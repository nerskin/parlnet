"Combet, Greg, MP",ALP,2012-09-19,"



Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:02):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Australian government accepts the advice of climate scientists that greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to climate change and that this poses great risks to our environment, our economy and our society.


Climate change is a diabolical international problem with an achievable international solution.


In this matter, Australia has a choice.


We can be part of growing international action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and use the market to reduce emissions at least cost to our economy.


Or we as a country can reject the advice of scientists, reject the advice of economists, ignore our international responsibility, and in so doing put our future prosperity at risk.


The Australian government has a responsibility to act in our national interest to be part of the international solution. Australia will not ignore that responsibility. This government will not ignore it.


Australia is in fact one of the top 20 greenhouse gas emitters internationally, and the highest per capita emitter amongst the advanced economies.


And anyone who suggests to the Australian community that we can have a free ride and that other nations with lower per capita emissions and less-developed economies must take all the responsibility while Australia does nothing is engaged in nothing less than an act of deceit.


That pathway will lead to retaliation in our trading relationships.


Australia has the 14th-highest GDP per capita in the world. Does anyone seriously think that our Asian trading partners, which are so vital to our economic future, which have much lower per capita income, which are dragging hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, will give us a free ride in tackling climate change? They will not.


Australia must do its fair share—and it is in our economic self-interest to do so, because the economies that will be competitive in the 21st century will be those that innovate, those that move to clean energy, those that reduce the emissions intensity of their economies.


If we are the innovators, if we reduce the emissions intensity of our economy, if we utilise our renewable energy resources, Australia will have that competitive edge.


Now, the Gillard government began this process through the enactment of the clean energy legislation last year, and the commencement of the carbon price mechanism.


And let's be clear about it—we have introduced an emissions trading scheme that commences with a three-year fixed price period where the carbon price is fixed just for those three years. After that transitional period, we will have a fully flexible emissions trading scheme where the carbon price will be set by the market—a market that will be international in its nature.


The carbon price began 80 days ago and the world has not ended, as those opposite had forecast. We have simply begun a sensible economic transformation and started the process of cutting our greenhouse gas emissions in an economically responsible way.


From 1 July 2015, when emissions trading commences, national greenhouse gas emissions will in fact be capped, enabling Australia to meet targeted cuts in emissions each year.


These targeted cuts in emissions reflect the commitments that have been made by this country to the international community—commitments that reflect our fair share of the task in tackling climate change, commitments that both sides of politics have signed up to.


But the baseless fear campaign by those opposite against action on climate change has demonstrated that they have no commitment to anything at all. The only thing that matters over there is the shallow political opportunism that they have engaged in. Any deceit will do. But it will not do for the good of this country.


As our Prime Minister made clear just over a year ago, this government is on the right side of history.


This bill that I am introducing today and the associated bills make amendments to the Clean Energy Act 2011 and related acts which will extend the international dimension of our contribution to the challenge of climate change.


They give legislative effect to an interim link between Australia's emissions trading scheme and the European Union Emissions Trading System, along with a number of changes to Australia's scheme to facilitate this linkage. 


This bill also makes minor changes designed to improve the flexibility of Australian auctions of carbon units and to recognise specific circumstances around the treatment of natural gas under the Australian scheme.




International linking



If I could turn to the issue of international linking, which is at the heart of the bill that I am presenting. The bill means that from 1 July 2015, we will be linking the Australian carbon price mechanism to the European Union's emissions trading scheme. It is an important international agreement that has been reached between the Australian government and the European Commission. This confirms that the fixed carbon price will end on 30 June 2015 and that we will move to a fully flexible emissions trading scheme where the Australian carbon price reflects the price in the largest carbon market in the world.


In other words, the Australian carbon price will reflect the price in our second largest trading bloc and be the same as in at least 30 other countries, including the United Kingdom, France and Germany. Our carbon price will be consistent with that which obtains in countries inhabited by no fewer than 530 million people—making a mockery of the fallacious argument that Australia is acting alone, or somehow has a carbon price ahead of the pack. Our carbon price will in fact be consistent with that which obtains in 30 other countries, including, in aggregate, our second largest trading bloc.


The European Union Emissions Trading System was the first international carbon market and now makes up more than three-quarters of the world’s carbon market. It has operated since 2005 and has delivered cost-effective emissions reductions across the European Union.


Overall, linking the Australian emissions trading scheme with the European ETS is good for Australian industry, good for our economy and good for our environment.


Linking means that an Australian business with a carbon price liability under our scheme will be able to purchase a carbon emissions unit—which is effectively a permit to emit a tonne of greenhouse gas—in either the Australian or the European carbon markets.


Those permits in fact can be bought now, for compliance in the period following 1 July 2015 in the Australian scheme.


Businesses know that the most cost-effective way to cut pollution is through an open market mechanism and that is exactly what this legislation ensures. Providing Australian businesses access to the world’s largest carbon market allows emissions to be reduced in the most cost-efficient way, by broadening the pool of carbon units that can be used by businesses.


As well as benefiting businesses, linking also has wider economic benefits. Linking will reduce the cost of the emissions reduction effort to the Australian economy.


As Treasury modelling clearly demonstrates, without the ability to access international carbon markets, without the ability for Australian businesses to purchase international permits, the cost of reducing emissions in our economy would double in order to meet Australia’s bipartisan unconditional emissions reduction target. This is something those opposite need to carefully consider. They say they have committed to the same emissions reduction target. They oppose international linkage, which means that their policy will cost at least double if they were to genuinely pursue the emissions reduction effort they say they are committed to, and that is the importance of this bill to the Australian economy. It will achieve our emissions reduction targets at the lowest possible cost.


We have always, as a government, recognised the benefits of linking in this way, and that is why it has been the Labor government’s policy to link with international carbon markets. In fact, linking with international carbon markets has been Australian government policy since 2007 under Prime Minister John Howard's government. The Australian government’s 2007 Shergold report, the report commissioned by Prime Minister John Howard, had this to say:


As a supporter of the development of a global system, Australia has a direct interest in promoting links between comparable schemes. Any Australian domestic trading scheme should be designed to enhance the scope for links, both formal and informal, with as many different systems as possible.


It is common sense to support international linking because it assists in providing emissions reduction at least cost and it contributes to knitting together different national and regional schemes.



Mr Hunt interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Flinders is warned!




Mr COMBET:
  It develops a common carbon price across economies, a common incentive to cut emissions, and fairly shares the burden of doing so.


We have a responsibility, as the leaders of this nation and as elected representatives of the federal parliament, to act in the interests of all Australians, both current and future generations. Ultimately, the scientists have warned us that the planet is warming and that warming is caused by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. They have warned us that continued warming will have severe consequences, which may include more frequent droughts, more days with high fire danger, changes in rainfall patterns, increased heat waves and more intense cyclones. This poses a risk to the environment, our economy and our way of life. No responsible government can ignore these risks.


Responsible governments must take action—action that is environmentally effective, economically efficient, and socially fair. Those have been the underpinning principles of government formulation of policy in responding to climate change—environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, and being socially fair and equitable. That is Labor's approach—action we can take to protect our economy and minimise the risk of the most extreme impacts occurring. That is the action we are taking.


This is a global problem and it requires global efforts to reduce pollution. There are many out to mislead the Australian public by saying that Australia is acting alone and our efforts are meaningless unless part of global action. But this argument falls down on two fronts, and it is important to address them. 


Firstly, Australia is far from acting alone. Every major economy is taking action. From 2013, 850 million people will live in a place where polluters pay for their pollution. The world is acting and we are part of that action.


The second reason the argument of these detractors falls down is that many of these same people who say a global solution is required also categorically oppose international linking. If you accept that climate change is a global problem that needs a global solution, it follows that you should support opening up trade with other countries to ensure pollution is reduced at the least cost. A globally coordinated approach must be fundamental to Australian climate change policy.


Because the Australian and European systems both cap the overall level of emissions, the use of a European allowance by an Australian emitter means that one less tonne of carbon pollution is released in Europe. Our challenge is to reduce global emissions. One tonne of pollution reduced in Europe delivers the same environmental benefit as a tonne of pollution reduced in Australia.


We are an open economy and a trading nation. This is one more commodity that needs to be included in our trading relationships with other countries. By opening up trade in carbon, we will ensure that pollution is reduced at the least cost, which will benefit households, businesses and the environment. The type of economic xenophobia and anti-market rhetoric that has been used when it comes to linking emissions trading schemes is backward and irresponsible.


We are very proud to stand on this side of the parliament and be able to say this will be the first intercontinental linkage of emissions trading schemes. It represents an important development towards the establishment of an interlinked global carbon market and global action on climate change. It is the first link between Europe and emerging carbon markets in the Asia-Pacific region.


Emissions trading schemes, it is worth noting, are currently being developed in China, which is our largest trading partner; Korea, our fourth largest trading partner; and California, which in its own right is the world’s eighth-largest economy. These are just some examples of the development of carbon markets in our own region which ultimately we have the objective to link with.


In fact, market based mechanisms to reduce pollution are in place or being developed in eight of our top 10 trading partners. 


Other key economies in the Asia-Pacific such as Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam are also entering the carbon market. 


This will lead to the development of a cooperative Asia-Pacific carbon market in the future. 


The link with the EU is also very important for the competitiveness of Australian industries. The linking arrangements—this is an extremely important feature of the bills I am presenting to the House today—have the potential to increase the effective assistance delivered to our emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries by the Jobs and Competitiveness Program. For example, if a highly emissions-intensive activity is able to source Kyoto units on the market for half of the price of European allowances, their effective assistance rate in 2015-16 could rise to 97 per cent. The assistance delivery also retains the incentive for emissions reductions.


This is an extremely important measure to support the members of our community, and their families, who are employed in these important emissions-intensive trade-exposed activities like aluminium smelting, steel making, cement manufacturing and a host of others. It will support the competitiveness of those businesses.


This bill and the amendments it contains are intended to provide the legislative foundation for this link and future links with other emissions trading schemes.


The link with the European Union ETS will first allow European allowance units to be used for compliance under the Australian scheme for liabilities incurred between 1 July 2015 and 30 June 2018. This will be followed by a full bilateral link from 1 July 2018 where units from both schemes may be used for compliance in either system.


To simplify the linking arrangements and facilitate the convergence of Australian and European carbon prices, the government has announced that it will no longer proceed with the carbon price floor from 1 July 2015, and that it will restrict the quantity of eligible Kyoto units that Australian entities can use to discharge their liability. 


This bill eliminates the price floor from existing legislation by removing the requirement for a minimum auction reserve price for the financial years 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18, and repealing the act that provided for a surrender charge on eligible international emissions units.


The bill also limits Australian entities' use of eligible Kyoto units to 12.5 per cent of their total liability and provides the government with the ability to introduce other limits on eligible international emissions units should this flexibility be required in the future.


In relation to the designated limit of 12.5 per cent, or one-eighth of a liability, for Kyoto units, the bill provides that this designated limit percentage may not be changed before 1 July 2020. This will provide certainty to Australian liable entities in relation to their allowable surrender of international units, and hence certainty in relation to their emissions reduction investment and compliance strategies and also certainty in relation to the level of assistance available to them under the Jobs and Competitiveness Program. That is eight years of certainty.


The bill also provides the government with flexibility to implement the most appropriate set of registry arrangements to establish the interim link with the European Union ETS, and flexibility in establishing future registry arrangements with other jurisdictions should links to other schemes be concluded in the future.



Equivalent carbon price



This bill also alters the current arrangements for applying an equivalent carbon price to synthetic greenhouse gases and some liquid fuel use, to ensure that it reflects the effective carbon price faced by liable entities under the Australian Emissions Trading Scheme when linked to the European Union ETS.




Auctions



The government proposes to make minor and technical changes to the design of the auction scheme for the Australian emissions trading scheme, to improve its operation and streamline the arrangements. These changes take account of further consultation on the detailed design of the auction scheme and the commencement of the detailed design process.


The amendments increase the carbon unit auction limit from 15 million to 40 million for 2015-16 carbon units that are auctioned in 2013-14, and 20 million for all other advance auctions before a pollution cap is set.


The amendments also establish that where there is not a pollution cap in place, units cannot be sold at auctions held more than three years in advance of their vintage year.


In addition, the bill provides for the approach to setting auction reserve prices to be determined in a ministerial determination. 


Finally, the bill simplifies the treatment of relinquished carbon units.




Natural gas



There are also some measures contained in the bill in relation to natural gas. In order for the carbon price to maintain effective and complete coverage of natural gas, the bill allows regulations to be made to provide for coverage of alternative natural gas arrangements, supporting competitive neutrality in the industry. 


The bill also amends the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007, so that from 1 July 2013 the methods to measure and adjust liabilities for liquid and gaseous fuels may be set out in a disallowable ministerial determination. This will give more certainty to the liquid and gaseous fuels sectors and more flexibility in emissions reporting, which is appropriate given the complex commercial arrangements in these sectors.




Conclusion 



In conclusion it is important reiterate some key elements. The fact of the matter is that countries around the world are taking action to tackle climate change.


Australia’s carbon price is now part of this global action.


It is submitted in pursuit of the commitments that we have made internationally, which are supported by the opposite side of parliament, to tackle this problem in our domestic economy. 


With emissions trading schemes in 33 countries and 18 subnational jurisdictions expected to be in operation from 2013, it is likely this linking arrangement is the first of many to come, which will lead to a deep and liquid global carbon market. 


It gives the lie to the claims that no other countries are acting.


Linking to the European Union Emission Trading System is a historic achievement not only for Australia but for global action on climate change. 


When future generations look back on the Clean Energy Act and associated acts, the emissions reductions it will have driven and the global carbon market it will have supported, I believe they will thank the members of this parliament who have rejected the argument for delay in acting on climate change and who have embraced a clean energy future. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham—Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (09:40):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The bill will introduce a number of measures to strengthen and streamline the Higher Education Support Act 2003, resulting in more effective and efficient administration of the Australian government's Higher Education Loan Program, or HELP, schemes, namely FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. The bill will enable the government to act on recommendations made in the post-implementation review of the VET FEE-HELP Assistance Scheme Final Report 2011 and its commitments made under the April 2012 COAG National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform. It will position the government to deliver timely improvements to the HELP schemes, creating a more accessible, transparent, responsive and robust tertiary sector.


The bill will enhance the quality and accountability framework through new provisions that allow the minister to consider investigation reports from the national and non-referring jurisdiction education regulators when making a decision to approve, revoke or suspend approval under the HELP schemes. The bill will further strengthen the government's ability to manage risk to the administration of public moneys and better protect students by strengthening the suspension and revocation provisions for approved providers. This will ensure that decisions under the provisions of the act to revoke or suspend a low-quality provider can take effect on the day the notice is registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments, offering increased protections to students.


The amendments will also improve the tertiary sector's ability to deliver education and training in a more responsive and flexible manner by moving the census date requirements into the legislative guidelines. This will allow the sector to offer rolling enrolments and be more responsive to student and industry needs without onerous administrative requirements. The bill will also allow for a managed trial of VET FEE-HELP for specified certificate IV level qualifications by amending the definition of a VET course of study.


Further, the bill will reduce complexity and duplication through consolidating and streamlining three sets of legislative guidelines into a single set. In doing so, provider obligations and responsibilities will be clarified and information further streamlined. Delegation powers will be enhanced to allow for the minister and secretary to delegate powers to an APS employee. This will ensure that programs and funding requirements under the act can continue uninterrupted regardless of which department holds responsibility for the schemes.


Finally, the bill will enable a streamlined approach to approvals and administrative compliance for low-risk applicants and providers already approved under the schemes. The amendments will allow the minister to determine a category of providers and financial reporting requirements for low-risk VET FEE-HELP applicants and approved providers. This approach will further reduce the administrative and regulatory burden placed on applicants and providers and encourage increased uptake of the scheme by quality providers, and ultimately students. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (10:54):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: 


Upgrade of on-base housing for Defence at Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin, Northern Territory.


Defence Housing Australia proposes upgrades of on-base housing for Defence at Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin, Northern Territory. The project will upgrade 48 older houses located in the residential housing precinct on Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin, to bring them up to the 2006 Defence minimum standard. These houses are from a portfolio of nearly 1,700 dwellings managed by Defence Housing Australia in Darwin to meet the housing needs of Defence members and their families posted to the Darwin area. The proposed upgrade project does not increase dwelling numbers on Larrakeyah Barracks. As the project involves upgrading existing housing, disruption to the local community will be minimised.


Defence and Defence Housing Australia have evaluated options and jointly agreed that the upgrade of 48 dwellings on Larrakeyah Barracks is economically viable and represents good value for money. The houses are suitable for upgrading and will provide a well-located housing precinct that will serve Defence families for the next 20 to 30 years. The estimated overall project cost is approximately $25 million, including GST, contingency and escalation costs but excluding the cost of the land. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in February 2013 and be completed by April 2015. 


I commend the motion to the House.

Upgrade of Housing for Defence at RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory.


Defence Housing Australia proposes to undertake an upgrade of housing for Defence at RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory. The project will upgrade a further 131 on-base houses to bring them up to the 2006 Defence minimum standard. The range of work on each house varies but may include new kitchens, new bathrooms, living room extensions, new bedrooms and double garages. Once upgraded, the total of 193 houses will greatly improve the amenity of Defence families living in this remote area. The upgraded on-base dwellings will offer a standard of amenity likely to attract and retain Defence members and their families in this remote area.


The work will be completed in two stages, the first upgrading 68 houses, the second upgrading 63 houses. The estimated overall project cost is approximately $57 million, including GST, contingency and escalation costs but excluding the land cost. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in April 2013 and be completed by December 2015.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament:


Base Infrastructure Works Project under the Base Security Improvement Program.


Security at Defence sites remains a high priority for the government and for the Department of Defence. Defence continues to review and improve its protective security arrangements to ensure that its most valuable assets—people—remain safe and able to conduct their important role. The $203.502 million base infrastructure works project is part of the wider Defence Base Security Improvement Program. It proposes to deliver a range of infrastructure enhancements to 16 sites. 


This project is part of Defence's response to the government's 2009 review of the Defence protective security arrangements. These enhancements have been designed specifically to reduce the risk to Defence personnel of the possibility of terrorist attack. The protective measures include the provision of alert and surveillance systems, electronic access control and detection systems, improved command, monitoring and management facilities, as well as enhanced entrance and reception facilities.


The infrastructure solutions delivered by this project have been developed in conjunction with a range of other protective security improvements which are being implemented across the entire Defence estate in Australia. These include changes to legislation and policy, procedural improvements and the introduction of armed response capabilities at some sites, plus other minor infrastructure works. Defence is working closely with local planning authorities as well as the relevant road and traffic authorities to ensure that any disruptions during construction are minimised.


In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to begin in early 2013 and is planned to be completed by mid-2015. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support, and I commend the motion to the House.

Moorebank Units Relocation, Holsworthy, New South Wales.


The Moorebank Units Relocation project proposes to relocate 13 Defence units and associated Defence facilities, the largest of which is the Army School of Military Engineering, from the Commonwealth owned but currently Defence occupied site for the future intermodal terminal at Moorebank to neighbouring Holsworthy Barracks in New South Wales. In addition to the provision of facilities for the relocated units, several facilities are also to be provided to enable the relocation and to achieve an efficient consolidated-facility solution at Holsworthy Barracks when considered over the whole of life. The enabling facilities include a new mess, a physical fitness complex, a chapel and facilities for elements of the 5th Brigade currently located at Holsworthy. In addition the project will improve the functionality and capability of Holsworthy Barracks by replacing a substantial amount of inadequate and non-compliant infrastructure and engineering services well past their design and economic life to meet the needs of the new facilities to be delivered.


The project will provide new working, instructional and living-in facilities for the School of Military Engineering, other relocated Defence units and aligned organisations. The project will also upgrade security and access arrangements at the northern entry to Holsworthy Barracks, including a new intersection on Heathcote Road approximately 500 metres east of the current intersection configuration. This will address traffic congestion in the existing location by separating Holsworthy Barracks from the Holsworthy railway station and residential access.


Redundant facilities beyond their economic life in the vicinity of the proposed new works will be demolished and realise operational savings. This capital investment in the project will have economic benefits for the Sydney region and local industry, with significant opportunities for subcontractors and the construction industry over the next three years. The estimated out-turned cost of the proposed work is $870 million plus GST.


In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence immediately, in October this year, and is planned to be completed by late 2015.

Development and construction of housing for Defence members and their families at Kellyville, Sydney, New South Wales.


Defence Housing Australia proposes to develop a four-hectare greenfield property at Withers Road, Kellyville in New South Wales. The site is approximately 21 kilometres from the Parramatta CBD, 47 kilometres from the Sydney CBD and 24 kilometres from RAAF Base Richmond. DHA purchased this land from the private market via a private treaty in late 2011. The site was selected due to its close proximity to established shopping and service facilities at Rouse Hill and its central location between RAAF Base Richmond and the Parramatta CBD.


The proposal will involve development of the site over two stages, with stage 1 consisting of general civil and road works for the development of 65 serviced allotments and stage 2 consisting of the construction of 34 dwellings for Defence personnel use in the form of 26 integrated town houses and eight detached dwellings. The estimated overall project cost is $21.85 million, including GST and excluding the cost of the land. The cost of the land will be met by DHA and recovered through the sale of surplus lots and the DHA sale and lease-back program.


In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2012-09-19,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (11:15):  On 29 August, Labor and the Greens announced the closure of the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. It was proposed for 30 November but had a closure date of 7 September, only a couple of weeks ago. It has been a devastating blow in this country to people with chronic disease who need dental services. This was the only dental scheme for adults that provided treatment under Medicare. A dental benefits schedule for children is due to commence in January 2014. That is the subject of this debate. A national partnership agreement for adult dental services that will provide payments to the states and territories, the government claims, will start in July 2014.


There are a number of points to make in relation to this. The coalition's position, firstly, is that we support further investment in dental care not just for children but also for people who are suffering from chronic diseases. Under the old scheme, they would have been referred immediately to a dentist, to relieve some of that pain and to put them on a more sustainable path. A significant part of our concern in what the government proposes is that there will be a gap of up to 19 months between the closure of this Chronic Disease Dental Scheme on 30 November and when the new scheme for adults starts in July 2014.


The existing scheme has provided up to $4,250 in Medicare dental benefits over a two-year period for eligible patients with a chronic health condition. Patients who presented to a general practitioner required a referral from that GP to a dentist and the work was then performed to the satisfaction of the patient. There has been a significant cost in this program, largely because of the huge underlying demand for dental services in our community. The government has made much of the expense under this program but it is important to remember that over 20 million services have been provided, to over a million patients, over the course of the last five years. That says to all Australians that there is a demand and that demand, in part, has been met. We know that the Labor Party sought to destroy the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, not because of a lack of demand, considering that 20 million services have been conducted, but simply because they want to discredit and trash a scheme that was set up by Tony Abbott.


The Australian public might ask themselves: 'Who is Tony Abbott and what is Tony Abbott about?' Tony Abbott was the architect of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. It provides about $1 billion a year to people in desperate need of dental services. He was the architect of this scheme. He was the person who decided that these 20 million services needed to be provided to over a million Australians, because he wanted to see an end to their suffering of dental conditions. That is why the scheme has been a success. It is for that single reason—that Tony Abbott was the architect of the scheme—not that there is no demand or that the scheme was not justified, that this government has sought to close it down.


Despite the overblown claims by this government, the average claim under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, according to the department, was not $4,250 but $1,716. Recent estimates suggest that this figure has fallen even more, down to $1,200 per patient. Eighty per cent of people using the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme have a concession card. The government has tried to paint this as some sort of playground for the rich, for people who can access services under the universal Medicare scheme that we have for conditions relating to the rest of the body. They claim that the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme has been a rip-off because it has applied the same universal scheme as we have operating under Medicare. That shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the targeting of the scheme, given that 80 per cent of the services were not provided to people of significant means; they were provided to people who held a concession card.


This government has an ideological and continuing attack on people they deem to be rich—that is, people with an earning capacity of over $70,000 or $80,000 a year. It determines these people are not worthy of support. Yes, those people have accessed this scheme, but only two in 10 of those who have received services in this scheme have been people other than those who hold a concession card. It would have cost more in the administration of this scheme to exclude that 20 per cent than it did to allow them to receive these services. That, to me, says a lot about what this government is embarking upon. Many of those people would have otherwise been forced to go without treatment or they would have been added to public dental waiting lists that already have 650,000 people on them. Consider that point for a moment. 


Eighty per cent of those who accessed support under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme had a concession card. Had Tony Abbott's scheme not been in place, those people—the 800,000 or so who accessed support under this scheme—would have joined the 650,000 who languish on waiting lists this very day. The government says that there is no need for the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme or that somehow it is the playground of the rich or that somehow it is justified to close this scheme. But it would keep a 19-month gap between now and when people can access a scheme—although it would not be as generous as the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. Look to the facts, not to the spin, of what this Labor government provides.


It is estimated, on available information, that 16 million services have been provided to patients with concession cards through the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. Some patients will not be able to complete treatment when the closure is due to occur on 30 November. It may be a cancer patient who is part-way through treatment for their condition—and I will come to a very, very important example in a moment. Consider that this government in its design of this legislation has not even taken into consideration cancer patients or people suffering from chronic disease who may be part-way through treatment. They will suffer under what Labor proposes in its new arrangement and in the closure of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. They are patients who cannot afford the full cost of private care and they will not receive treatment for 19 months under what the government is proposing before this House today.


I spoke before of an example, and I want to bring the House's attention to a very, very serious case of a constituent of mine by the name of Mr Wayne Whitehead, who recently contacted me. I think his circumstances deserve recognition in this parliament. This is a man who is suffering and is in significant pain. He will suffer more when the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme closes. This government may be full of good intent but it does not have the capacity to deliver on programs—as we have seen, day after day, over the course of the last five years—and this is just the latest example. Mr Whitehead could well represent thousands of patients around the country in these circumstances. His own circumstances are that he has battled with throat cancer. Due to damage from radiation treatment he is unable to produce saliva or open his jaw normally. He needs frequent dental care and intensive and regular fluoride treatment. Mr Whitehead has been advised that an extraction will require major surgery in a hospital followed by specialised and expensive medical care. The cost of the procedure would be substantial, at about $55,000 for such an extraction and subsequent treatment. Mr Whitehead is on a disability support pension and he says:


… due to my ill health and the cost of daily treatment 3 monthly dental visits for regular check-ups would be prohibitive.


The minister and the Greens in concert need to explain why Mr Whitehead and countless others have to go through the stress and suffering caused by the gap between the closure of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme and the 2014 delivery of their proposals.


This legislation does not commence until 1 January 2014—bearing in mind that this relates to children. The bill makes very minor amendments to the Dental Benefits Act 2008, only changing the eligibility age of the current Medicare Teen Dental Plan from 12 to 17 years to two to 17 years. It does make other minor terminology changes to provide for a change from the Medicare Teen Dental Plan to the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. The schedule of service fees and details of how the scheme will be funded are still not available. The government is rushing this bill through the parliament without having this detail, even though it does not commence for well over a year—in fact, after the next election.


The minister has acknowledged that services for most children will cost less than the proposed $1,000 cap—at least that is what the government modelling is telling them. Some children will require more services, and there is no provision to ensure they continue to receive adequate treatment, especially in the period before this bill commences. Available data suggests that well over 60,000 services have been provided to children under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, and it comes to an end on 30 November. Many children who are sick and suffering from chronic disease will suffer in pain during the 13-month gap before 1 January 2014 when services will be available to them, but at a much lower cap than the $4,250 available to them under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. These are children who are in the midst of treatment, who will not be able to have their treatment completed by 30 November. What does the minister or this Prime Minister say to those people, to those families, who have children suffering with severe pain? These are kids who had access under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme but cannot get access under this scheme. Why are they put in that position?


I bring you back to my earlier point, Mr Deputy Speaker, and that is that the government's intent to close the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was not about making it easier or making dental services more accessible for children and for adults; it was about making a political point because they want to be able to say at the next election, 'We closed down Tony Abbott's Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, and here we are champions of the new scheme that we have designed in concert with the Greens.' I say that Australians should see through what is completely and utterly a contemptuous act by a government desperate to return themselves to some sort of respectability in the polls.


This decision has not taken into consideration those sick children who have received treatments under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme—60,000 of them. We are not talking about one or two cases where assistance may be able to be provided. What do people do, what do families do, over the course of the next 13 months? For many of them, if they are in desperate situations, as obviously many of them are, they can only access treatment through what is an already overburdened public system where 650,000 people wait and languish to receive those services.


This Prime Minister and this minister need to explain to the Australian people what happens in those individual cases over the course of the next 13 months where kids are suffering, some of in silence but many of them not. I would say to those families: contact your local Labor member of parliament and contact your local Labor senator and say to those people, 'Why is it that your government is removing much needed assistance for my child? Why is it that this government has decided to close down the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme and not to start anything in its place?'


That is why yesterday, on behalf of Tony Abbott and the coalition, I announced that we would move to disallow the government's procedure in this parliament to close down the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, so that people can at least get support under that scheme or something similar in the intervening period—which is 13 months if they are children and 19 months if they are adults—until the government's new scheme can commence. That is the very least that this government could provide to people and children who are suffering from dental pain. That is what we need to ask of this government and it is the very least that it can provide to those people.


There are a couple of other points that need to be made as part of this debate. Australia has 5.1 million concession card holders and an additional 2.3 million people without concession cards, on low incomes, who could benefit from coverage, according to the government's own National Advisory Council on Dental Health, under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. The government's proposed number of services, even if delivered, as promised, by 2018, will be totally insufficient in meeting the demand that is going to be created under this proposal.


In 2008, Labor proposed the Commonwealth dental program, which it never delivered. The program promised one million services by providing funding to the states and territories, and it was revealed in Senate estimates that the Commonwealth did not assess the capacity of the public dental workforce to provide the projected services, and the number delivered might have been significantly less than that promised.


The number of services to be provided over the full six years under Labor's recent proposal is only 20 per cent of what the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme provided last year alone. The government say that in the design of their scheme, even though in net terms they are training no new dentists, clinicians or technicians, they are going to open the gates to several million more Australians come 1 January 2014, or 1 July 2014, depending on which part of the scheme you are talking about. And they will have people lining up on the doorsteps of dentists around the country, where apparently millions of places are sitting vacant right now! Somehow the government argue that this is a well-designed scheme and somehow, even though they are not going to increase supply between now and 2014, it is okay to have millions of additional services being required from people. 


Does anybody hear an alarm bell ringing about the design of this scheme? Has anybody thought back to the pink batts, to computers in schools or to school halls? Do people think that the government possess the capacity to deliver the most basic of design when it comes to programs? I would have thought that the government could have given away free pink batts with some success, but they did not. They burnt houses down and people died as a result of that program. They wasted billions of dollars and there is a huge tail liability in that scheme because they now have to remove the defective pink batts from people's ceilings around the country at a significant cost to taxpayers. 


Yet the government say they are going to design a scheme. Again, they are full of good intent, but look at the detail of what they provide. They say that with no new dentists we can bring millions of people into dental surgeries across the country from 1 January. There will be no phased implementation and no increase in the workforce between now and 1 January 2014, and somehow we can provide services to all of those people! There will be no increase in the price that dentists charge, even though they have people lined up out the doors! 


Do people seriously believe that this government will get the design right? Think about the school halls program, where they had the same good intent—the same superficially attractive proposal—where they said, 'We will put money into schools.' Nobody would knock that back, but this government spent billions of dollars of taxpayers' money on overpriced school halls that, in the end, did not deliver what this government promised. This government squandered the opportunity to deliver significant infrastructure, because in the process it spent money lining the pockets of people who were greedy and saw a purchaser in distress. Those greedy people saw this government coming, and school halls were built well over price and the benefit was not delivered to the school, the students or to the taxpayer. That is the track record of this government when it comes to those two programs.


Look at what else this government has done. In relation to the provision of solar panels this government completely mucked up the delivery of that program. This is a government that started with billions of dollars in the bank, and it wasted every single dollar. It was not the government's money but taxpayers' money. Not only did it waste that money, it thrust us into unprecedented debt. This government talks about a surplus, and it has talked about a surplus for five years, but this government has delivered the four most significant deficits in our country's history. And it continues to ramp up debt on a daily basis in this country. Yet it asks the Australian public to believe that it can deliver a dental scheme from 1 January 2014. 


Let's ask why the government is introducing legislation today, without the detail attached to it, for a scheme that will not start until after the next election. There are only two possible scenarios. The first is that this government has no intention of delivering this scheme, and it wants a policy that is superficially appealing to the Australian public, because, like the coalition, the Australian people want to see more money put into dental services. But the coalition do not want to see money wasted without people getting the services that they rightly deserve.


That is the first scenario: this government has said one thing and they intend to do the opposite after the election. That may well ring a familiar tune with the Australian public, because this Prime Minister said before the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads but she did the complete opposite when she got into power. So this government should not be taken on their spin but on their track record. 


If people want to look at what the government will be like if they are re-elected at the next election, look at what they have been like over the last five years. They have squandered money. They started with good intent in policies but they have not been able to get the design right and not been able to deliver what they promised to the Australian people. That is the first scenario. The second is that they have rushed this in for political purposes but also because they believe they can implement the scheme, perhaps with some significant design feature changes which they will sort out if they get elected at the next election. Either way, people need to be deeply suspicious about what the government is offering up.


What is the position of the coalition? The starting point, as I said in my opening remarks, is that we want to see further investment into dental care. We want to make sure that it is done efficiently and productively. Why? Because we want to make sure that we get the maximum number of services delivered to those most in need. In the end, we are the guardians of taxpayers' money and it is incumbent upon us to make sure that people who deserve the services get the services at the lowest possible cost. That is what we are charged with, and that is what this government has lost sight of.


This government has closed down the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme not to replace it with a scheme that starts from 1 December but to say to the Australian public that, even if you are suffering from a chronic disease, even if you are a concession card holder and you are in the most desperate of circumstances, you will have to wait up to 19 months to receive any assistance at all. The minister will say, 'We've put more money into the public dental waiting list, and somehow we'll work through that list.' Some people at the moment wait five years or more on the public dental waiting list. If they are waiting five years or more, and there are 650,000 people on that list as of today, how can people seriously take this minister at her word? Are people who are receiving treatment today under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme somehow going to jump the queue of 650,000 people over the next 19 months? This minister has no credibility.


In the end, in wasting money, this government has decreased the capacity of our nation to deliver a more effective health system. When this minister talks about the extra spend in health, what she is saying is that she has employed more health bureaucrats. I think health bureaucrats are well intentioned and I think many of them do a wonderful job. This government, having spent all the money and plunged into debt, has now arrived at a crossroad, where the choice is to continue to spend money on recurrent bureaucratic positions or to reapply and redirect some of that money to front-line services. This government has a decision to make, and future governments will have a decision to make, about whether to continue to bloat the health bureaucracy in this country or to apply that money to the doctors, nurses, dentists and allied health professionals across the country who are trying to make a difference in people's lives.


The idea of an infrastructure or a bureaucracy is to deliver services efficiently to the people they serve, and in our case that is the Australian public. Over the last five years, where have the government spent money in health? They have spent it on the creation of 12 new bureaucracies. They have not spent it in front-line areas. They have not spent it on providing advances and opportunities to our researchers and to people who are delivering amazing interventions on a daily basis. This government have taken a deliberate decision to divert money away from the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme and to put it into their ever-growing bureaucracy.


The Australian people understand that. They understand that because it is what Labor did at a state level. It is what Labor did in New South Wales and Queensland in particular. They bloated their bureaucracies to a point where the recurrent spend became unmanageable. And what happened? People could not get into emergency departments. People waited hours and hours with sick children in emergency departments. Older Australians, concession card holders, pensioners, and self-funded retirees on small, fixed incomes saw services drop off in public hospitals because Labor decided to increase the number of bureaucrats in the system and take money away from doctors, nurses and core services.


After the next election, if the coalition is elected, we will make a deliberate strategy to return support to front-line services, to doctors, to nurses, to those people who are seeing patients and those people who are making a tangible difference in people's lives. That is what the health portfolio is about. It is not about making yourself feel good because you have new buildings, new motor vehicles and new infrastructure which requires billions of dollars more each year to feed.


The government should be about providing support to people who are sick. They have taken their eye off the ball, and there is no more egregious example than the area of dental health. People received millions of services under a system that was designed by Tony Abbott, a system which made an intervention into people's lives and changed their futures. That is what the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was about. If the government sought to close it down and implement their own scheme immediately after the closure then people might understand. But to leave a 19-month gap during which people cannot access adequate dental services, and particularly where people are already suffering from a chronic disease, is a cruel blow by this government. It underscores the point that we make—that the government, when it comes to health, have taken their eye off the ball. They have adopted the state Labor strategy of spending money not on doctors and nurses but on bureaucrats, and that is why this country has been plunged into billions of dollars of debt.


The government should say here and now, in this place, to the Australian people what will happen over the next 19 months, when this void will appear in people's lives, when treatments that are partly carried out will not be finished. What happens to those people? I ask the following speakers from the Labor Party, who would have been receiving the same correspondence that I have from around the country from people who are suffering from chronic disease and who are petrified at the closure of the scheme: what do you say to those people? How could you look those people in the eye and say that you provide no services to them, not because you have intent to implement a better scheme but because you want to close it down for your own raw political purposes? I think the Australian people will make their judgement at the time of the next election, and so they should. It will be a damning judgement on a government that has failed in so many areas, this just being the latest. (Time expired)

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,4,1
"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2012-09-19,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (11:45):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2012 that will service our community, especially the most vulnerable. I am always happy to take advice from anyone, including those opposite, but, let us not forget, in 1996 the very first act of the Howard Liberal coalition government was to cut the Commonwealth dental scheme. We all remember that; every single one of us remembers that. That was the first act of the Howard government—to cut the Commonwealth dental scheme, which saw the list of people waiting for dental procedures and dental care skyrocket to 750,000 people with over two years on the waiting list. So now we hear them come into this House, preach to us on dental care and tell us what it means to them.


In opposition, I asked many questions about dental care and I always got the same response back, whether it was from the Minister for Health of the coalition at the time or whether it was from the Prime Minister. The answer was like this: 'It has got nothing to do with the federal government; it has got nothing to do with us. Go to your mates in the state Labor government; it is a state responsibility.' That is all we heard from the other side. In 2007, as the doom and gloom was overshadowing them, they decided that they should try and do something about this particular issue. What did they do? They came up with this cobble-wash scheme that was meant to cost $80 million per year. It is now costing us $80 million per month and giving dental care to millionaires and not giving the care that is required to low-income earners, to the unemployed, to pensioners and to a whole range of other people. So I am very pleased and very proud to be in this House today promoting this bill and speaking in support of this bill.


We were elected in 2007 and again in 2010 on a platform of recreating a federal dental scheme. We have a mandate that is as clear as can be and we have the electoral authority to deliver reform on the provisions of dental services in this land. If you look at the Hansard from when we were in opposition and from when we were in government, and at the promises that were made, it was about delivering a dental scheme that was equitable for all in this nation, not just for millionaires. However, we have been obstructed every step of the way by those who know only one word and that is the word 'no'. We hear it continually from those opposite on so many issues. And with mind-boggling predictability we are going to hear it again on this particular bill.


The fear campaign from which Labor took office five years ago continues and we see it again today. The Abbott scare campaign is trying to convince people that Labor is going to deprive people of a dental service. Well, the only people that have deprived the Australian public of a dental service were the opposition coalition when they were in government in 1996. They came in and axed the Commonwealth dental scheme, requiring people to wait up to two or three years to have their teeth fixed.


Labor has proposed and has been pursuing something very different to those opposite to increase the availability of dental services. As I said, the poorly designed coalition scheme that we sought for years to replace subsidised treatment of the millionaires while depriving age pensioners, welfare recipients, Australian battlers around the nation and low-income earners. It subsidised elective cosmetic work while people with the most need could not get assistance. As I said earlier, Tony Abbott said it would cost $90 million per year but it is costing a billion dollars a year or $80 million per month and people still cannot get treatment they require. It was a scheme that was poorly designed and that led to waste and dissatisfaction, with over 1,000 complaints lodged from those who were able to access the scheme but were not satisfied.


There has been free money from the government to dental practices, and taxpayer funds were gouged by billions of dollars each and every year. Treatments have been of low value and poorly performed or have remained inaccessible to those who need them most. Something has to change. The system needs to improve but improvement is anathema to the opposition, who prefer a culture of fear, as we have seen continually in this House.


This opposition scare campaign has cried out with false alarm, as we heard from the previous speakers—false alarm that Labor plan to deprive people of available dental services. As I said, the only people who deprived the Australian public from dental care were the former Liberal government, which cut the Commonwealth dental scheme as a first act as a government. And that is the cynical mockery of their fear campaign. They say Australians should be scared that Labor will direct dental services away from millionaires to those who most need them, those who find it most difficult to afford them. It has been just one of a continual string of cynical Orwellian ironies where the coalition says positive change is negative change, where an increase in services means a decrease in availability and where the Abbott coalition strive to convince the people to fear the very changes that will most benefit them.


Today, as I said, I am very pleased and proud to speak in favour of this legislation, which will deliver Labor's expanded dental benefits scheme—this government's version of a Commonwealth dental scheme—which will allocate vastly increased services to children and funding for expanded state services for adults in need.


As a result of this package, which was announced by the Minister for Health in late August, 3.4 million Australian children will be eligible for funded dental care through the expansion of the government's current child focused dental scheme. Currently, children aged 12 to 18 can access dental care. With this bill, almost 3½  million children aged two and over will be able to access the care they need. That will be a good start in dental hygiene, and will set the path for fewer problems in the future, costing governments less money. Funding will be provided to the states to provide around 1.4 million additional dental services for adults on low incomes such as age pensioners, concession card holders and people with special needs.


Let us look at those numbers: 1.4 million. When we look back in the Howard years, there were 750,000 people on the waiting list who had to wait over two years. Providing 1.4 million services will ensure that that waiting list comes right down. And if those opposite were to form a government next election—shock, horror!—I bet you one of the first things they would do is cut the current scheme, leaving people high and dry, and we would see those figures escalate, maybe well over 750,000 and up to the million mark.


Further, outer metropolitan, rural and remote areas will receive additional capital and workforce to provide the services where they are needed. This package relies on federal funding complementing state funding. So, as with many things negotiated between tiers of government in this Federation, state governments will have the choice—and I suspect New South Wales and Queensland will take it—to sabotage the dental services of their own residents, as we have seen with the cuts in those states over the previous few weeks. I fear this will be the case with this particular scheme in Queensland and New South Wales, where services are being absolutely stripped on an almost-daily basis. And, as we heard, that is the entree of the real thing if the coalition ever forms government.


But I can assure you that, at least in South Australia, the federal government will cover, through this program, a much greater number of children of families of limited means. This will make already budgeted funds and an additional 1.4 million dental services or appointments solely available for adults who need the most assistance. This creates a package of services for those adults in need of dental care while providing preventative work for children to prevent dental problems becoming a major long-term issue.


I welcome this package of reforms, as all of us on this side do. We welcome these reforms because, for far too long, dental care has been separate from health care—yet one cannot exist without the other. Without good teeth or dentures, without oral health, we cannot have good dietary habits and good nutrition; and without good nutrition, other health problems are as good as certain. This is an area of policy very close to our hearts on this side. We campaigned on it when we were in opposition, we campaigned on it in 2007 when we were elected and it was a promise in the 2010 election. So we are delivering on what we told the Australian public. I personally campaigned on this issue as a candidate and an opposition MP, year after year, and received full support from my constituency toward the Commonwealth ensuring the provision of a decent level of dental services and dental care for those who need them most in our community. As I said earlier, this issue was raised by me and many others, many times in opposition, and the answer always came back the same—that it had nothing to do with the then Howard government. That was the response we got: it was a state issue.


When conducting surveys in my electorate, dental care was the one issue which received the greatest support from senior residents, specifically residents on the age pension, a pension that was worth much less then than it is today, thanks to Labor's reforms. But, even with a substantial increase in the age pension, the cost of dental care is more than many can afford, especially those with the greatest dental problems and those who require the greatest and most costly dental work. Labor have done what we have been able to get through the parliament since forming government in 2007. We have injected very substantial funds, through the budget process, in helping the states reduce the waiting lists for the state based services while trying to redirect federal funding being wasted, year after year, billions of dollars after billions of dollars, on the Leader of the Opposition's flawed chronic dental system.


With this bill we have the start of a new package of dental reforms which will deliver the services with willing state governments to meet the needs of both young and old and those in most need. It is a duty of this place to provide the assistance where it is most needed, to provide services that are most critical and to help Australians improve and maintain their health and their lives, with that objective—a healthy Australian population in clear sight.


This bill will start operation on 1 January 2014. For many decades the history of the dental health of children in this country was that it was improving. But since the mid-1990s we have seen a reversal of that. Since the late 1990s the prevalence of children with dental problems, and the mean number of teeth affected by dental diseases in children, has increased. A recent Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report showed that 45 per cent of 12-year-olds had decay in their permanent teeth and almost 25 per cent of 12-year-olds had untreated decay. If a decline in oral health of children becomes established, children will require increased services in the future. So it is very important that we see the investment in our children's teeth as an investment in the future, as an investment in good oral hygiene—and we know that poor childhood oral health leads to poor adult oral health and has wide- ranging impacts on general health and wellbeing, including increasing the demand on our health and hospital system.


This bill is a very important one and I am proud to support it. It is a bill I have campaigned on for many years and I hope those opposite will consider agreeing to it, because at the heart of it are pensioners, people on low incomes and children. It is extremely important that this bill is supported for the benefit of dental care.


Debate adjourned.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2012-09-19,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (11:15):  On 29 August, Labor and the Greens announced the closure of the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. It was proposed for 30 November but had a closure date of 7 September, only a couple of weeks ago. It has been a devastating blow in this country to people with chronic disease who need dental services. This was the only dental scheme for adults that provided treatment under Medicare. A dental benefits schedule for children is due to commence in January 2014. That is the subject of this debate. A national partnership agreement for adult dental services that will provide payments to the states and territories, the government claims, will start in July 2014.


There are a number of points to make in relation to this. The coalition's position, firstly, is that we support further investment in dental care not just for children but also for people who are suffering from chronic diseases. Under the old scheme, they would have been referred immediately to a dentist, to relieve some of that pain and to put them on a more sustainable path. A significant part of our concern in what the government proposes is that there will be a gap of up to 19 months between the closure of this Chronic Disease Dental Scheme on 30 November and when the new scheme for adults starts in July 2014.


The existing scheme has provided up to $4,250 in Medicare dental benefits over a two-year period for eligible patients with a chronic health condition. Patients who presented to a general practitioner required a referral from that GP to a dentist and the work was then performed to the satisfaction of the patient. There has been a significant cost in this program, largely because of the huge underlying demand for dental services in our community. The government has made much of the expense under this program but it is important to remember that over 20 million services have been provided, to over a million patients, over the course of the last five years. That says to all Australians that there is a demand and that demand, in part, has been met. We know that the Labor Party sought to destroy the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, not because of a lack of demand, considering that 20 million services have been conducted, but simply because they want to discredit and trash a scheme that was set up by Tony Abbott.


The Australian public might ask themselves: 'Who is Tony Abbott and what is Tony Abbott about?' Tony Abbott was the architect of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. It provides about $1 billion a year to people in desperate need of dental services. He was the architect of this scheme. He was the person who decided that these 20 million services needed to be provided to over a million Australians, because he wanted to see an end to their suffering of dental conditions. That is why the scheme has been a success. It is for that single reason—that Tony Abbott was the architect of the scheme—not that there is no demand or that the scheme was not justified, that this government has sought to close it down.


Despite the overblown claims by this government, the average claim under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, according to the department, was not $4,250 but $1,716. Recent estimates suggest that this figure has fallen even more, down to $1,200 per patient. Eighty per cent of people using the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme have a concession card. The government has tried to paint this as some sort of playground for the rich, for people who can access services under the universal Medicare scheme that we have for conditions relating to the rest of the body. They claim that the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme has been a rip-off because it has applied the same universal scheme as we have operating under Medicare. That shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the targeting of the scheme, given that 80 per cent of the services were not provided to people of significant means; they were provided to people who held a concession card.


This government has an ideological and continuing attack on people they deem to be rich—that is, people with an earning capacity of over $70,000 or $80,000 a year. It determines these people are not worthy of support. Yes, those people have accessed this scheme, but only two in 10 of those who have received services in this scheme have been people other than those who hold a concession card. It would have cost more in the administration of this scheme to exclude that 20 per cent than it did to allow them to receive these services. That, to me, says a lot about what this government is embarking upon. Many of those people would have otherwise been forced to go without treatment or they would have been added to public dental waiting lists that already have 650,000 people on them. Consider that point for a moment. 


Eighty per cent of those who accessed support under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme had a concession card. Had Tony Abbott's scheme not been in place, those people—the 800,000 or so who accessed support under this scheme—would have joined the 650,000 who languish on waiting lists this very day. The government says that there is no need for the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme or that somehow it is the playground of the rich or that somehow it is justified to close this scheme. But it would keep a 19-month gap between now and when people can access a scheme—although it would not be as generous as the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. Look to the facts, not to the spin, of what this Labor government provides.


It is estimated, on available information, that 16 million services have been provided to patients with concession cards through the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. Some patients will not be able to complete treatment when the closure is due to occur on 30 November. It may be a cancer patient who is part-way through treatment for their condition—and I will come to a very, very important example in a moment. Consider that this government in its design of this legislation has not even taken into consideration cancer patients or people suffering from chronic disease who may be part-way through treatment. They will suffer under what Labor proposes in its new arrangement and in the closure of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. They are patients who cannot afford the full cost of private care and they will not receive treatment for 19 months under what the government is proposing before this House today.


I spoke before of an example, and I want to bring the House's attention to a very, very serious case of a constituent of mine by the name of Mr Wayne Whitehead, who recently contacted me. I think his circumstances deserve recognition in this parliament. This is a man who is suffering and is in significant pain. He will suffer more when the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme closes. This government may be full of good intent but it does not have the capacity to deliver on programs—as we have seen, day after day, over the course of the last five years—and this is just the latest example. Mr Whitehead could well represent thousands of patients around the country in these circumstances. His own circumstances are that he has battled with throat cancer. Due to damage from radiation treatment he is unable to produce saliva or open his jaw normally. He needs frequent dental care and intensive and regular fluoride treatment. Mr Whitehead has been advised that an extraction will require major surgery in a hospital followed by specialised and expensive medical care. The cost of the procedure would be substantial, at about $55,000 for such an extraction and subsequent treatment. Mr Whitehead is on a disability support pension and he says:


… due to my ill health and the cost of daily treatment 3 monthly dental visits for regular check-ups would be prohibitive.


The minister and the Greens in concert need to explain why Mr Whitehead and countless others have to go through the stress and suffering caused by the gap between the closure of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme and the 2014 delivery of their proposals.


This legislation does not commence until 1 January 2014—bearing in mind that this relates to children. The bill makes very minor amendments to the Dental Benefits Act 2008, only changing the eligibility age of the current Medicare Teen Dental Plan from 12 to 17 years to two to 17 years. It does make other minor terminology changes to provide for a change from the Medicare Teen Dental Plan to the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. The schedule of service fees and details of how the scheme will be funded are still not available. The government is rushing this bill through the parliament without having this detail, even though it does not commence for well over a year—in fact, after the next election.


The minister has acknowledged that services for most children will cost less than the proposed $1,000 cap—at least that is what the government modelling is telling them. Some children will require more services, and there is no provision to ensure they continue to receive adequate treatment, especially in the period before this bill commences. Available data suggests that well over 60,000 services have been provided to children under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, and it comes to an end on 30 November. Many children who are sick and suffering from chronic disease will suffer in pain during the 13-month gap before 1 January 2014 when services will be available to them, but at a much lower cap than the $4,250 available to them under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. These are children who are in the midst of treatment, who will not be able to have their treatment completed by 30 November. What does the minister or this Prime Minister say to those people, to those families, who have children suffering with severe pain? These are kids who had access under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme but cannot get access under this scheme. Why are they put in that position?


I bring you back to my earlier point, Mr Deputy Speaker, and that is that the government's intent to close the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was not about making it easier or making dental services more accessible for children and for adults; it was about making a political point because they want to be able to say at the next election, 'We closed down Tony Abbott's Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, and here we are champions of the new scheme that we have designed in concert with the Greens.' I say that Australians should see through what is completely and utterly a contemptuous act by a government desperate to return themselves to some sort of respectability in the polls.


This decision has not taken into consideration those sick children who have received treatments under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme—60,000 of them. We are not talking about one or two cases where assistance may be able to be provided. What do people do, what do families do, over the course of the next 13 months? For many of them, if they are in desperate situations, as obviously many of them are, they can only access treatment through what is an already overburdened public system where 650,000 people wait and languish to receive those services.


This Prime Minister and this minister need to explain to the Australian people what happens in those individual cases over the course of the next 13 months where kids are suffering, some of in silence but many of them not. I would say to those families: contact your local Labor member of parliament and contact your local Labor senator and say to those people, 'Why is it that your government is removing much needed assistance for my child? Why is it that this government has decided to close down the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme and not to start anything in its place?'


That is why yesterday, on behalf of Tony Abbott and the coalition, I announced that we would move to disallow the government's procedure in this parliament to close down the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, so that people can at least get support under that scheme or something similar in the intervening period—which is 13 months if they are children and 19 months if they are adults—until the government's new scheme can commence. That is the very least that this government could provide to people and children who are suffering from dental pain. That is what we need to ask of this government and it is the very least that it can provide to those people.


There are a couple of other points that need to be made as part of this debate. Australia has 5.1 million concession card holders and an additional 2.3 million people without concession cards, on low incomes, who could benefit from coverage, according to the government's own National Advisory Council on Dental Health, under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. The government's proposed number of services, even if delivered, as promised, by 2018, will be totally insufficient in meeting the demand that is going to be created under this proposal.


In 2008, Labor proposed the Commonwealth dental program, which it never delivered. The program promised one million services by providing funding to the states and territories, and it was revealed in Senate estimates that the Commonwealth did not assess the capacity of the public dental workforce to provide the projected services, and the number delivered might have been significantly less than that promised.


The number of services to be provided over the full six years under Labor's recent proposal is only 20 per cent of what the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme provided last year alone. The government say that in the design of their scheme, even though in net terms they are training no new dentists, clinicians or technicians, they are going to open the gates to several million more Australians come 1 January 2014, or 1 July 2014, depending on which part of the scheme you are talking about. And they will have people lining up on the doorsteps of dentists around the country, where apparently millions of places are sitting vacant right now! Somehow the government argue that this is a well-designed scheme and somehow, even though they are not going to increase supply between now and 2014, it is okay to have millions of additional services being required from people. 


Does anybody hear an alarm bell ringing about the design of this scheme? Has anybody thought back to the pink batts, to computers in schools or to school halls? Do people think that the government possess the capacity to deliver the most basic of design when it comes to programs? I would have thought that the government could have given away free pink batts with some success, but they did not. They burnt houses down and people died as a result of that program. They wasted billions of dollars and there is a huge tail liability in that scheme because they now have to remove the defective pink batts from people's ceilings around the country at a significant cost to taxpayers. 


Yet the government say they are going to design a scheme. Again, they are full of good intent, but look at the detail of what they provide. They say that with no new dentists we can bring millions of people into dental surgeries across the country from 1 January. There will be no phased implementation and no increase in the workforce between now and 1 January 2014, and somehow we can provide services to all of those people! There will be no increase in the price that dentists charge, even though they have people lined up out the doors! 


Do people seriously believe that this government will get the design right? Think about the school halls program, where they had the same good intent—the same superficially attractive proposal—where they said, 'We will put money into schools.' Nobody would knock that back, but this government spent billions of dollars of taxpayers' money on overpriced school halls that, in the end, did not deliver what this government promised. This government squandered the opportunity to deliver significant infrastructure, because in the process it spent money lining the pockets of people who were greedy and saw a purchaser in distress. Those greedy people saw this government coming, and school halls were built well over price and the benefit was not delivered to the school, the students or to the taxpayer. That is the track record of this government when it comes to those two programs.


Look at what else this government has done. In relation to the provision of solar panels this government completely mucked up the delivery of that program. This is a government that started with billions of dollars in the bank, and it wasted every single dollar. It was not the government's money but taxpayers' money. Not only did it waste that money, it thrust us into unprecedented debt. This government talks about a surplus, and it has talked about a surplus for five years, but this government has delivered the four most significant deficits in our country's history. And it continues to ramp up debt on a daily basis in this country. Yet it asks the Australian public to believe that it can deliver a dental scheme from 1 January 2014. 


Let's ask why the government is introducing legislation today, without the detail attached to it, for a scheme that will not start until after the next election. There are only two possible scenarios. The first is that this government has no intention of delivering this scheme, and it wants a policy that is superficially appealing to the Australian public, because, like the coalition, the Australian people want to see more money put into dental services. But the coalition do not want to see money wasted without people getting the services that they rightly deserve.


That is the first scenario: this government has said one thing and they intend to do the opposite after the election. That may well ring a familiar tune with the Australian public, because this Prime Minister said before the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads but she did the complete opposite when she got into power. So this government should not be taken on their spin but on their track record. 


If people want to look at what the government will be like if they are re-elected at the next election, look at what they have been like over the last five years. They have squandered money. They started with good intent in policies but they have not been able to get the design right and not been able to deliver what they promised to the Australian people. That is the first scenario. The second is that they have rushed this in for political purposes but also because they believe they can implement the scheme, perhaps with some significant design feature changes which they will sort out if they get elected at the next election. Either way, people need to be deeply suspicious about what the government is offering up.


What is the position of the coalition? The starting point, as I said in my opening remarks, is that we want to see further investment into dental care. We want to make sure that it is done efficiently and productively. Why? Because we want to make sure that we get the maximum number of services delivered to those most in need. In the end, we are the guardians of taxpayers' money and it is incumbent upon us to make sure that people who deserve the services get the services at the lowest possible cost. That is what we are charged with, and that is what this government has lost sight of.


This government has closed down the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme not to replace it with a scheme that starts from 1 December but to say to the Australian public that, even if you are suffering from a chronic disease, even if you are a concession card holder and you are in the most desperate of circumstances, you will have to wait up to 19 months to receive any assistance at all. The minister will say, 'We've put more money into the public dental waiting list, and somehow we'll work through that list.' Some people at the moment wait five years or more on the public dental waiting list. If they are waiting five years or more, and there are 650,000 people on that list as of today, how can people seriously take this minister at her word? Are people who are receiving treatment today under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme somehow going to jump the queue of 650,000 people over the next 19 months? This minister has no credibility.


In the end, in wasting money, this government has decreased the capacity of our nation to deliver a more effective health system. When this minister talks about the extra spend in health, what she is saying is that she has employed more health bureaucrats. I think health bureaucrats are well intentioned and I think many of them do a wonderful job. This government, having spent all the money and plunged into debt, has now arrived at a crossroad, where the choice is to continue to spend money on recurrent bureaucratic positions or to reapply and redirect some of that money to front-line services. This government has a decision to make, and future governments will have a decision to make, about whether to continue to bloat the health bureaucracy in this country or to apply that money to the doctors, nurses, dentists and allied health professionals across the country who are trying to make a difference in people's lives.


The idea of an infrastructure or a bureaucracy is to deliver services efficiently to the people they serve, and in our case that is the Australian public. Over the last five years, where have the government spent money in health? They have spent it on the creation of 12 new bureaucracies. They have not spent it in front-line areas. They have not spent it on providing advances and opportunities to our researchers and to people who are delivering amazing interventions on a daily basis. This government have taken a deliberate decision to divert money away from the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme and to put it into their ever-growing bureaucracy.


The Australian people understand that. They understand that because it is what Labor did at a state level. It is what Labor did in New South Wales and Queensland in particular. They bloated their bureaucracies to a point where the recurrent spend became unmanageable. And what happened? People could not get into emergency departments. People waited hours and hours with sick children in emergency departments. Older Australians, concession card holders, pensioners, and self-funded retirees on small, fixed incomes saw services drop off in public hospitals because Labor decided to increase the number of bureaucrats in the system and take money away from doctors, nurses and core services.


After the next election, if the coalition is elected, we will make a deliberate strategy to return support to front-line services, to doctors, to nurses, to those people who are seeing patients and those people who are making a tangible difference in people's lives. That is what the health portfolio is about. It is not about making yourself feel good because you have new buildings, new motor vehicles and new infrastructure which requires billions of dollars more each year to feed.


The government should be about providing support to people who are sick. They have taken their eye off the ball, and there is no more egregious example than the area of dental health. People received millions of services under a system that was designed by Tony Abbott, a system which made an intervention into people's lives and changed their futures. That is what the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was about. If the government sought to close it down and implement their own scheme immediately after the closure then people might understand. But to leave a 19-month gap during which people cannot access adequate dental services, and particularly where people are already suffering from a chronic disease, is a cruel blow by this government. It underscores the point that we make—that the government, when it comes to health, have taken their eye off the ball. They have adopted the state Labor strategy of spending money not on doctors and nurses but on bureaucrats, and that is why this country has been plunged into billions of dollars of debt.


The government should say here and now, in this place, to the Australian people what will happen over the next 19 months, when this void will appear in people's lives, when treatments that are partly carried out will not be finished. What happens to those people? I ask the following speakers from the Labor Party, who would have been receiving the same correspondence that I have from around the country from people who are suffering from chronic disease and who are petrified at the closure of the scheme: what do you say to those people? How could you look those people in the eye and say that you provide no services to them, not because you have intent to implement a better scheme but because you want to close it down for your own raw political purposes? I think the Australian people will make their judgement at the time of the next election, and so they should. It will be a damning judgement on a government that has failed in so many areas, this just being the latest. (Time expired)

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2012-09-19,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (11:45):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2012 that will service our community, especially the most vulnerable. I am always happy to take advice from anyone, including those opposite, but, let us not forget, in 1996 the very first act of the Howard Liberal coalition government was to cut the Commonwealth dental scheme. We all remember that; every single one of us remembers that. That was the first act of the Howard government—to cut the Commonwealth dental scheme, which saw the list of people waiting for dental procedures and dental care skyrocket to 750,000 people with over two years on the waiting list. So now we hear them come into this House, preach to us on dental care and tell us what it means to them.


In opposition, I asked many questions about dental care and I always got the same response back, whether it was from the Minister for Health of the coalition at the time or whether it was from the Prime Minister. The answer was like this: 'It has got nothing to do with the federal government; it has got nothing to do with us. Go to your mates in the state Labor government; it is a state responsibility.' That is all we heard from the other side. In 2007, as the doom and gloom was overshadowing them, they decided that they should try and do something about this particular issue. What did they do? They came up with this cobble-wash scheme that was meant to cost $80 million per year. It is now costing us $80 million per month and giving dental care to millionaires and not giving the care that is required to low-income earners, to the unemployed, to pensioners and to a whole range of other people. So I am very pleased and very proud to be in this House today promoting this bill and speaking in support of this bill.


We were elected in 2007 and again in 2010 on a platform of recreating a federal dental scheme. We have a mandate that is as clear as can be and we have the electoral authority to deliver reform on the provisions of dental services in this land. If you look at the Hansard from when we were in opposition and from when we were in government, and at the promises that were made, it was about delivering a dental scheme that was equitable for all in this nation, not just for millionaires. However, we have been obstructed every step of the way by those who know only one word and that is the word 'no'. We hear it continually from those opposite on so many issues. And with mind-boggling predictability we are going to hear it again on this particular bill.


The fear campaign from which Labor took office five years ago continues and we see it again today. The Abbott scare campaign is trying to convince people that Labor is going to deprive people of a dental service. Well, the only people that have deprived the Australian public of a dental service were the opposition coalition when they were in government in 1996. They came in and axed the Commonwealth dental scheme, requiring people to wait up to two or three years to have their teeth fixed.


Labor has proposed and has been pursuing something very different to those opposite to increase the availability of dental services. As I said, the poorly designed coalition scheme that we sought for years to replace subsidised treatment of the millionaires while depriving age pensioners, welfare recipients, Australian battlers around the nation and low-income earners. It subsidised elective cosmetic work while people with the most need could not get assistance. As I said earlier, Tony Abbott said it would cost $90 million per year but it is costing a billion dollars a year or $80 million per month and people still cannot get treatment they require. It was a scheme that was poorly designed and that led to waste and dissatisfaction, with over 1,000 complaints lodged from those who were able to access the scheme but were not satisfied.


There has been free money from the government to dental practices, and taxpayer funds were gouged by billions of dollars each and every year. Treatments have been of low value and poorly performed or have remained inaccessible to those who need them most. Something has to change. The system needs to improve but improvement is anathema to the opposition, who prefer a culture of fear, as we have seen continually in this House.


This opposition scare campaign has cried out with false alarm, as we heard from the previous speakers—false alarm that Labor plan to deprive people of available dental services. As I said, the only people who deprived the Australian public from dental care were the former Liberal government, which cut the Commonwealth dental scheme as a first act as a government. And that is the cynical mockery of their fear campaign. They say Australians should be scared that Labor will direct dental services away from millionaires to those who most need them, those who find it most difficult to afford them. It has been just one of a continual string of cynical Orwellian ironies where the coalition says positive change is negative change, where an increase in services means a decrease in availability and where the Abbott coalition strive to convince the people to fear the very changes that will most benefit them.


Today, as I said, I am very pleased and proud to speak in favour of this legislation, which will deliver Labor's expanded dental benefits scheme—this government's version of a Commonwealth dental scheme—which will allocate vastly increased services to children and funding for expanded state services for adults in need.


As a result of this package, which was announced by the Minister for Health in late August, 3.4 million Australian children will be eligible for funded dental care through the expansion of the government's current child focused dental scheme. Currently, children aged 12 to 18 can access dental care. With this bill, almost 3½  million children aged two and over will be able to access the care they need. That will be a good start in dental hygiene, and will set the path for fewer problems in the future, costing governments less money. Funding will be provided to the states to provide around 1.4 million additional dental services for adults on low incomes such as age pensioners, concession card holders and people with special needs.


Let us look at those numbers: 1.4 million. When we look back in the Howard years, there were 750,000 people on the waiting list who had to wait over two years. Providing 1.4 million services will ensure that that waiting list comes right down. And if those opposite were to form a government next election—shock, horror!—I bet you one of the first things they would do is cut the current scheme, leaving people high and dry, and we would see those figures escalate, maybe well over 750,000 and up to the million mark.


Further, outer metropolitan, rural and remote areas will receive additional capital and workforce to provide the services where they are needed. This package relies on federal funding complementing state funding. So, as with many things negotiated between tiers of government in this Federation, state governments will have the choice—and I suspect New South Wales and Queensland will take it—to sabotage the dental services of their own residents, as we have seen with the cuts in those states over the previous few weeks. I fear this will be the case with this particular scheme in Queensland and New South Wales, where services are being absolutely stripped on an almost-daily basis. And, as we heard, that is the entree of the real thing if the coalition ever forms government.


But I can assure you that, at least in South Australia, the federal government will cover, through this program, a much greater number of children of families of limited means. This will make already budgeted funds and an additional 1.4 million dental services or appointments solely available for adults who need the most assistance. This creates a package of services for those adults in need of dental care while providing preventative work for children to prevent dental problems becoming a major long-term issue.


I welcome this package of reforms, as all of us on this side do. We welcome these reforms because, for far too long, dental care has been separate from health care—yet one cannot exist without the other. Without good teeth or dentures, without oral health, we cannot have good dietary habits and good nutrition; and without good nutrition, other health problems are as good as certain. This is an area of policy very close to our hearts on this side. We campaigned on it when we were in opposition, we campaigned on it in 2007 when we were elected and it was a promise in the 2010 election. So we are delivering on what we told the Australian public. I personally campaigned on this issue as a candidate and an opposition MP, year after year, and received full support from my constituency toward the Commonwealth ensuring the provision of a decent level of dental services and dental care for those who need them most in our community. As I said earlier, this issue was raised by me and many others, many times in opposition, and the answer always came back the same—that it had nothing to do with the then Howard government. That was the response we got: it was a state issue.


When conducting surveys in my electorate, dental care was the one issue which received the greatest support from senior residents, specifically residents on the age pension, a pension that was worth much less then than it is today, thanks to Labor's reforms. But, even with a substantial increase in the age pension, the cost of dental care is more than many can afford, especially those with the greatest dental problems and those who require the greatest and most costly dental work. Labor have done what we have been able to get through the parliament since forming government in 2007. We have injected very substantial funds, through the budget process, in helping the states reduce the waiting lists for the state based services while trying to redirect federal funding being wasted, year after year, billions of dollars after billions of dollars, on the Leader of the Opposition's flawed chronic dental system.


With this bill we have the start of a new package of dental reforms which will deliver the services with willing state governments to meet the needs of both young and old and those in most need. It is a duty of this place to provide the assistance where it is most needed, to provide services that are most critical and to help Australians improve and maintain their health and their lives, with that objective—a healthy Australian population in clear sight.


This bill will start operation on 1 January 2014. For many decades the history of the dental health of children in this country was that it was improving. But since the mid-1990s we have seen a reversal of that. Since the late 1990s the prevalence of children with dental problems, and the mean number of teeth affected by dental diseases in children, has increased. A recent Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report showed that 45 per cent of 12-year-olds had decay in their permanent teeth and almost 25 per cent of 12-year-olds had untreated decay. If a decline in oral health of children becomes established, children will require increased services in the future. So it is very important that we see the investment in our children's teeth as an investment in the future, as an investment in good oral hygiene—and we know that poor childhood oral health leads to poor adult oral health and has wide- ranging impacts on general health and wellbeing, including increasing the demand on our health and hospital system.


This bill is a very important one and I am proud to support it. It is a bill I have campaigned on for many years and I hope those opposite will consider agreeing to it, because at the heart of it are pensioners, people on low incomes and children. It is extremely important that this bill is supported for the benefit of dental care.

Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (13:45):  I rise today to voice my disgust at the rank hypocrisy of the current government. Day after day in question time we listen to the government criticise state governments such as the LNP government in Queensland for making tough decisions to get their economy back on track. All while this government has wasted billions through its popcorn policies but is itself making massive cuts to cover its mistakes. It is making cuts to programs such as the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme; from November this year the chronically ill in Flynn will no longer have access to dental treatment through Medicare. It has ripped $25 billion from Defence since 2009. We see the results affecting every area of our defence forces, right down to cadet units in my electorate. Cadet units in Wondai, Biloela, Rosedale, Blackwater, Monto and Gladstone will now suffer because of these cuts. This government criticises the LNP for salvaging the Queensland economy whilst itself compromising the health of the chronically ill and the defence of our nation. The very fundamentals of our nation are at risk at the hands of the Gillard government. The people of Flynn and the rest of the nation deserve better than this hypocrisy.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  Today marks the day that the Leader of the Opposition and I return from having attended three soldiers' funerals. We have been engaged in a sad and sombre duty attending the funerals of Private Nathanael Galagher, Lance Corporal Mervyn McDonald and Sapper James Martin. I am sure I can speak on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister for Defence and the shadow minister for defence and say that, whilst this was a sad duty, it also came with a real sense of privilege. We spent some time with some families who are grieving deeply—and we grieve with them. Two families of the five soldiers we lost that day elected to have private funerals. But their grief is very real too, and I know all members of the House would be thinking of the families of Private Robert Poate and Lance Corporal Stjepan Milosevic.


Today also marks a day of return for me from a short period of leave associated with the death of my father. I want to take this opportunity to thank everybody in this House and beyond who, in huge numbers, have offered their condolences to me and my family—to my mother, Moira; to my sister, Alison; and to my niece and nephew, Jenna and Tom, my father's granddaughter and grandson. We have been overwhelmed by people's kindness. We have been particularly overwhelmed when attending funerals in the past few days that people who have lost someone so young would take the opportunity to offer their condolences on the loss of my father. My father died at 83, so it is a different thing from a man dying in his 20s, 30s or 40s—a very different thing. 


My father led a very full life and a very happy life—a life that brought him from Cwmgwrach in the valleys of Wales to this great country, a life in which he got to pursue his dreams from the time of being a small boy. He grew up in a state of hardship. It was not unknown for him to literally not have enough food. He grew up in a coalmining village and he was one of seven children. They did not have much money. He also did not have the opportunity at that stage of his life to fulfil his dreams for a further education. He passed highly in the 11-plus exams of those times—indeed, so highly that he won a scholarship—but his family could not afford to not have him work, so he left school at 14 and he always felt very keenly the loss of opportunity that leaving school at that age brought. Despite that, though, he was very determined to make something of his life. So, as he went through his life's journey, he continued to study—firstly, A levels and O levels at night school and then to become a police officer in the town of Barry in Wales. It was there that he met my mother, a policewoman. He confessed to my partner, Tim, that the initial point of attraction was her black stockings. On the basis of such things was almost 55 years of marriage made. They would have celebrated their 55th wedding anniversary in December this year.


My father and mother took a life-changing decision, and that was to migrate to this great nation. I cannot imagine what the difference in our lives would have been had they not taken that decision and had we stayed in Wales. I cannot imagine what that would have brought for my sister and me. But migrate they did, to Adelaide, to a wonderful place—and I acknowledge other members in the parliament who represent the great state of South Australia. And in Adelaide they found a life of huge opportunity. My father got the opportunity to study again and to pursue for more than two decades what became the most important part of his working life, his work as a psychiatric nurse. He very much enjoyed—indeed, loved—that sense of care and compassion that he got to give people with mental illness in our society. 


But, in truth, his life's work was the nurture of his family—of me and my sister initially. It is certainly true that I would not be standing here if my father had not brought from the Welsh valleys a deep sense of attachment to Labor values, a profound belief in the benefits of unionism and also a profound belief in the life-changing nature of education. I would not be standing here if it were not for that.


My father, through me, got to live a life in politics, at one remove. He was deeply interested in politics and he marvelled at every part of it. He enjoyed coming and sitting and watching in this chamber. He enjoyed meeting people from both sides of politics. He got the opportunity to meet some of the Labor heroes who shaped his adult life—people like Bob Hawke. He was mesmerised by the functioning of this place. I took him to the press gallery once. He came back full of excited stories about meeting Kerry O'Brien and Michelle Grattan—people who for him had been storybook heroes. He got to meet them face to face and very much enjoyed it.


He was also very conscious of the rigours of the life that we lead and the hard work. He would chide me sometimes for working too hard. I would remind him that he was the man who not only worked shift work and took all the overtime that was available in that shift work but also worked a second job when we were very young, and so he too knew about hard work and the benefits of it. He understood that this life comes with moments of stress and strain. He felt more deeply than I, in many ways, some of the personal attacks that we face in the business of politics, but I was always able to reassure him that he had nurtured a daughter with sufficient strength to not let that get me down.


If I gave him many of the highs and the lows of his life, my sister, Alison, really built the contours of his everyday life for him. Her staying in Adelaide, her bringing into the world his very beloved granddaughter, Jenna, and grandson, Tom, was the stuff of his everyday life. He made them—Jenna and Tom—the centre of his world for a very long time. He was tremendously proud of them, tremendously proud of Tom getting an electrical apprenticeship and then completing it, tremendously proud of Jenna's PhD in biotechnology. Indeed, even in relatively recent times he was heard to say to virtually anybody who would listen that his daughter Julia had done very well becoming Prime Minister but that Jenna was really the smart one in the family! He believed that very deeply, with the PhD. He also embraced our extended family—my partner, Tim; Jenna's husband, Damien; and Tom's girlfriend, Laura—and they became a very important part of his existence.


My father was a very proud Australian, but he tried to instil in my sister and I a sense of our Welsh origins. This would take many forms, but one of the least favoured forms, I would have to say, was to make us listen to Richard Burton, a Welshman, reading the poems of Dylan Thomas, a Welshman. He had as a very prized possession a floppy 45 record—and hopefully there are others in the parliament old enough to remember those floppy 45 records!—of Richard Burton reading Dylan Thomas. One of our least favoured activities as small girls was being required to sit in reverent silence and listen to this for what seemed to us like hour after hour. But, as a result, I grew up listening to Dylan Thomas saying to his father to 'rage, rage against the dying of the light' and to 'not go gentle into that good night'. The last thing my father taught me was that in the life of a man there is a moment to go gentle into that good night. And so it was. Thank you.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:09):  On behalf of the coalition—and I suspect on behalf of all members of the parliament—I welcome the Prime Minister back after her bereavement leave. This is a tragic time for her, and we all feel for her at this very difficult and sad time. I also acknowledge the sad duty that the Prime Minister and I have been engaged in over the last few days attending military funerals. They are very sad occasions. But they are proud occasions, because the departed have done their duty, by their mates and by our country.


I again acknowledge John Gillard, who has done his country proud in producing such a daughter. It is a remarkable parent who produces a Prime Minister of this country. I acknowledge his journey from the valleys of Wales to this wide brown land. It is a journey I am a little familiar with, as my own maternal grandmother grew up in the village of Gelligaer, a former mining town on the south coast of Wales. For John Gillard, as for Phyllis Lacey, my grandmother, Australia has been a land of opportunity—although the same journey provided different political destinations, I hasten to add, in those cases.


We all know the place good parents have in the hearts of their children, and the coalition continues to extend its deepest sympathies to the Prime Minister.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2012-09-19,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (15:05):  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving immediately:


That this House:


(1) notes the Prime Minister’s comment on 11 February 2011 that: 'Every time we announce something we properly account for it and properly fund it.';


(2) calls on the Government to explain where the money is coming from for its $120 billion of recently announced spending, including spending on disability services, additional funding for aged care, new funding for low-paid workers, increased costs of its border protection failures, funding of new defence projects, establishment of a new dental care scheme, and the provision of additional education funding;


(3) notes that Australia’s debt continues to approach $300 billion despite the Prime Minister claiming that the Budget is in surplus; and


(4) calls on the Treasurer to immediately rule out new increases in taxes for families and small business in order to plug their $120 billion Budget black hole.


Standing orders need to be suspended so that this House can have the economic debate that the Prime Minister herself called for at the start of question time—and she has now fled. Standing orders must be suspended because the nation's finances are descending into chaos and even the government's own backbenchers know it.


We have a Prime Minister who is spending like a drunken sailor, with one eye on the polls and the other eye on the member for Griffith—and doesn't she know it: doesn't she know that she has to keep an eye on the member for Griffith! This is why standing orders must be suspended, because yesterday, in the caucus, the Rudd forces made an organised hit on the Prime Minister and on the government's economic strategy. I am quoting from today's Financial Review:


Mr Swan faced questioning in the weekly caucus … from five MPs concerned about the government's plans.


In the Labor caucus room yesterday, outspoken Labor Left senator Doug Cameron, Tasmanian MP Geoff Lyons, NSW MP Janelle Saffin, NSW MP Ed Husic and Victorian MP Kelvin Thomson expressed concern about the government's spending priorities.


That is why standing orders must be suspended. What do all those members of parliament have in common? Every single one of them is a backer of the former Prime Minister. And we know it was an organised hit. We had the front page of the Financial Review; we had an almost identical leak from caucus in the Australian:


At least five Labor backbenchers yesterday tackled the Treasurer about the government's spending priorities and its ability to pay for big-ticket promises while protecting a budget surplus—


of just $1.5 billion this financial year. That is why standing orders must be suspended. But the organised nature of this hit by the former Prime Minister on the current Prime Minister is exposed by what else was said in both the Financial Review and the Australian. Again, I am quoting from the Financial Review of this morning: 


Some senior Labor figures yesterday privately accused Ms Gillard of making a deal to help shore up union support for her leadership—


'union support for her leadership'. And there, in the Australian:


Labor MPs told The Australian last night they believed Ms Gillard's undertakings to union leaders running campaigns for government wage top-ups was all about ""shoring up union support for her leadership"".


So standing orders must be suspended because this is a government in fiscal chaos and this is what the parliament should be debating as a priority right now.


I have to say, in fairness to the Prime Minister, that her opponent's supporters are just as incoherent and just as economically illiterate as her own. We had Senator Cameron saying in the caucus yesterday that we needed more taxes. And then we had the member for Chifley saying in the party room yesterday that we needed to boost spending. And then we had the member for Bass saying that we had to have a special Medicare levy—more taxes. And then we had the member for Page saying that we needed more foreign aid—more taxes! And then we had the member for Wills saying in the caucus yesterday that we needed more spending. So, whether they are supporters of the Prime Minister or whether they are supporters of the former Prime Minister, it is the same Labor economic illiteracy.


We had the Prime Minister say today that her economic policy was based on Labor values. Well, we know what Labor values are when it comes to the economy: debt and deficit, tax and waste. And, at all times—and this is why standing orders must be suspended—they are making our economy less and less and less competitive.


What did the Treasurer do yesterday? Well, the Treasurer is simply making it up as he goes. We all know that this Treasurer wants to be known as 'surplus Swan', but we know what he is: he is always 'wasteful Wayne'. That is what he always is. And we had a classic example of this Treasurer's real spending priorities exposed in the parliament last week when we had wasteful Wayne's weaving workshop—like something out of the Life of Brian: wasteful Wayne's weaving workshop!—because this is a government that will spend whatever it takes to buy its way back into office.


Let us go through the list: the National Disability Insurance Scheme—a very good cause, but it will only be delivered by a political party which is fiscally prudent and fiscally responsible—is $10.5 billion a year; the Gonski changes, $6.5 billion a year; the assistance to childcare workers, $1.3 billion a year; the new submarines, $35 billion; the Nauru and Manus Island centres, $2.1 billion; the additional humanitarian intake, $1.3 billion a year; and then there is the dental scheme—and this is why standing orders must be suspended—some $4 billion; all absolutely, utterly and totally unfunded.


We had the Prime Minister tell us, oh so solemnly—the Prime Minister who will not even stay in this parliament to debate the economy, having demanded an economic debate earlier in question time today—'Every time we announce something we properly account for it and properly fund it.' Well, do you know what this is going to rank with? It is going to rank with: 'There will be no carbon tax—



Opposition members:  under the government I lead.'




Mr ABBOTT:
  Another deception from a Prime Minister who will say and do anything to enter office and to stay in office. That is the tragedy of this country: having fibbed into office, this is a Prime Minister that will now squander this nation's fiscal inheritance to stay in office. We had the Prime Minister talking today about savings that this government has made.


We know what this government means when it talks about savings, don't we?



Opposition members:  A tax!




Mr ABBOTT:
  It means a tax. That is what it means. The government talked about $100 billion of savings. At least $50 billion of that was new taxes. It talked about $33 billion of savings in this budget; half of it—$17 billion—was new taxes. The time for big-spending, big-taxing, big-fibbing government has gone. We will give the Australian people the decent government they deserve. (Time expired)




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Is the motion seconded?

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2012-09-19,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:15):  I second the motion. Standing orders must be suspended in order to get answers out of this government. I found it absolutely extraordinary: very simple questions were asked in question time; the government refused to answer them. When the Treasurer was asked whether he was going to raid the Future Fund to pay for the $120 billion of unfunded promises, he typically obfuscated. He did not obfuscate yesterday when the member for Bass asked him in the caucus whether he was going to double the Medicare levy—he said 'no'. He did not obfuscate when we asked him in this place whether he was going to support the reintroduction of death duties, which was identified by the Henry report. He said—eventually—'no'. 


When we asked him today whether he was going to break open the Future Fund—the last remaining resort of funding for Australia's future—the Treasurer turned around and did not answer the question. He did not answer the question because the government is now desperate. Standard & Poor's has identified in a media report that the deficit this year is estimated to be over $20 billion. The government claims it is going to have a surplus. The Treasurer said he would have a surplus, because that helps to take some of the upward pressure off interest rates. That is why he said it was important to have a surplus.


It is not just falling revenues that make it urgent that this matter to be dealt with; it is the government's unfunded spending. To shore up the Prime Minister's leadership the government has committed to over $120 billion of new spending initiatives. We know about the deal that it is trying to reach with the missos union. We know equally that it is probably the case that the Prime Minister has been scared off giving a $1½ billion a year subsidy to private sector workers because the matter leaked from the Labor caucus yesterday. We also know that the government is going to avoid making that commitment until after MYEFO, which is expected to come out in the next few weeks. We know all of that. Why? Because we know that the carbon tax was not in the budget in 2011 and then came out only a few weeks later with a multibillion dollar deficit in the carbon tax package. We know the trickery that this government is up to. It needs to be held to account. We are trying to hold it to account.


This is an incompetent government. It is typically Labor: it is big spending, big promises, no delivery and taxpayers paying. When in Queensland and New South Wales you get a coalition government following the reckless indifference of terrible Labor governments that left a legacy of debt and deficit, this mob then shoots the ambulance driver trying to rescue the patient. That is what those opposite do. They are hypocrites. They shed crocodile tears about public servant job losses, yet the Treasurer is sacking 3,000 people this year. What a hypocrite.


We need to suspend standing orders because we and the Australian people want answers. We want answers to the questions on where the money is coming from. We want the truth about the government's plan on taxes. We know the promise that there would be 'no carbon tax under the government I lead'. How can you believe them after an election? You cannot trust Labor before an election and you sure as hell cannot trust them after an election. This is typical Labor: debt and deficit. They are recklessly indifferent to the truth. They are not being honest with the Australian people. It is reliant upon us to hold this mob to account on behalf of Australian families, on behalf of Australian small-business people, on behalf of the people who have to pay the bills for Labor's reckless spending. We want answers. We want them now. The Australian people want the truth about the $120 billion black hole.



Mr Pyne interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  If the member for Sturt does not allow me to put the question he might not get a suspension. The question is that the motion be agreed to.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:20):  This is a leader who has hit a brick wall. The pugilist is out there swinging away; but they are air swings. He has not landed anything. He is like the pugilist who goes out there all macho man: swinging away but not landing a punch. Is that all you have got? After 1 July we know that that is all he has got. He comes in here and is like a robocall: press button 1, scare campaign on the carbon price and the economy; press button 2, scare campaign on asylum seekers. That is all they have got. They have no alternative agenda whatsoever. They have just the low road of fear; they do not worry about any of the facts when they go down that road.


This is a Leader of the Opposition who ran from the parliament but also runs from himself. This is a Leader of the Opposition who goes day after day without giving a press conference. He talks about accountability. This morning he gave a press conference at 6.15 am in Fyshwick.




Dr Emerson:
  He hoped no-one would turn up!




Mr ALBANESE:
  It was at 6.15 am. People turned up, so I suspect that tomorrow it will be at 5:30 am in Queanbeyan. And then of course when he gets a question that has a simple answer like we saw last Friday from Karen Middleton, a yes or no question, he runs from it—he runs from his own press conferences. Not as fast as a gazelle, but run nonetheless he does. But when he has to take some responsibility and show leadership as the Leader of the Opposition, we see that the leadership comes from the other side but not from this Leader of the Opposition. 


We saw Malcolm Turnbull show leadership earlier today, after Cory Bernardi engaged in such a disgraceful, reprehensible attack last night. Cory Bernardi resigned; he did not apologise. The Leader of the Opposition could not bring himself to condemn the latest comments made by Senator Bernardi, who is shadow parliamentary secretary to the Leader of the Opposition. He just does not get it about respect for other people. The problems with the comments were not that they were ill-disciplined; the problem is that they were bigoted and they were disrespectful. The Leader of the Opposition should have shown leadership today.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I hesitate to interrupt the Leader of the House, but the remark he made about the Leader of the Opposition was entirely personally offensive. It was a bridge too far and he should withdraw it.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The Leader of the House will withdraw.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Withdraw what?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Just for the convenience of the House.




Mr ALBANESE:
  The Leader of the Opposition had 10 minutes. We stood there and listened to him and—



Opposition members:  Withdraw!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Leader of the House has the call, if he could withdraw.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I do not know what it is that should be withdrawn, Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I will be brutally honest: I have no idea either because I could not hear over the members—




Mr ALBANESE:
  I said nothing offensive. I cannot withdraw something when I do not know what it is.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House has the call and will be heard in silence. I will review the matter later.




Mr ALBANESE:
  The fact of the matter is this. They want a debate on the economy. This economy is 11 per cent larger than when we came to office—impressive growth, a low unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent—




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Perhaps we should give the Leader of the House the benefit of the doubt, but he said that the Leader of the Opposition did not respect people, and his actions today indicate that he has deep respect for people. It was disrespectful and we are asked to withdraw things that—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. I had asked the Leader of the House to withdraw but, as neither of us had heard it, I said he would be heard now in silence and I will review the matter later.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Deputy Speaker, if it helps, I withdraw, but I do find it absolutely extraordinary that this bloke had 10 minutes to attack—




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Madam Deputy Speaker—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Mackellar will resume her seat.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  Deputy Speaker, they say he did not attack the Prime Minister!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House has the call. He will refer to members by their title. 



Opposition members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will be heard in silence, as the two previous speakers were.




Mr ALBANESE:
  The Leader of the Opposition is not man enough to discipline his own side. It is as simple as that. In the meantime, we have engaged in an economic performance that is the envy of the world. You do not have to believe me; believe him because the Leader of the Opposition had this to say:


… Australia has serious bragging rights. Compared to most developed countries, our economic circumstances are enviable.



Mr Pyne interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Very shortly the member for Sturt might not be here to vote.




Mr ALBANESE:
  That is what he had to say in London. Yet here he comes and talks down the economy, when all the economic fundamentals show that this government has a record we can be proud of. Compared to the former government, taxes, interest rates, unemployment and inflation are today all lower—and they raise the issue of the assessments overseas—along with a AAA credit rating from all three of the world's leading ratings agencies for the first time ever. It is no wonder I have lost a bet in our tactics room because this morning what I said around the room in the Prime Minister's office was that today the Leader of the Opposition will not come back and move a suspension because they are onto him and his destructive negativity. Today they will try to put forward a policy argument, which is why we should not suspend standing orders. They are going to suspend standing orders, when their MPI has been put in by the shadow Treasurer about the same issue. So they are knocking off the MPI debate, moving it forward, in order to have the same debate twice. This morning the Treasurer was right. The Treasurer said to me, 'No, he can't help himself; he'll go down the destructive, negative road.' What we have seen today is just that.




Mr Tehan:
  Big brave Wayne sitting there in the chair.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Wannon is warned!




Mr ALBANESE:
  In spite of the advice they have got:


Abbott told, 'We want policy, not negativity'—


That is what they have said in the party room:


We need to be balancing the negative stuff more and looking at greater fleshing out of policy,' a member of the opposition said.




Mr Pyne:
  Who said? 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Sturt will leave the chamber under 94(a). I gave him plenty of warning.




The member for Sturt then left the chamber.





Mr ALBANESE:
  I suspect it might have been one of the backbenchers up there who said:


There's a lot of passengers in quite a lot of senior positions, said one MP backing a reshuffle.


And indeed there are. Not only does this Leader of the Opposition not have a plan for Australia's future; he has not even had a plan for a three-year term in opposition. Every day he has engaged in a strategy which is based upon the election being called tomorrow. That is why he has not put forward constructive suggestions. That is why 407 pieces of legislation have been carried in this parliament. Not only have the opposition failed to knock one off but they have failed even to get an amendment up without the government's support. Here in this parliament, one in which the crossbenchers have a particularly critical role to play, the opposition have not even been able to achieve that.


The words of Robert Menzies were right. He said:


… on far too many questions we have found our role to be simply that of the man who says ‘No’ … There is no room in Australia for a party of reaction. There is no useful place for a policy of negation.


That is what we are seeing and that is why this Leader of the Opposition is the most unpopular Leader of the Opposition in Australia's history. (Time expired)

The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
) (15:45):  I have received a letter from the honourable member for North Sydney proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: 


The urgent need for the Government to bring its spending under control.


I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:45):  How interesting it was that, of the five amigos, the fabulous five who were named yesterday in an AFR article about challenging the Treasurer on spending priorities, only one today decided to stand up and say the claims were untrue.




Mr Tehan:
  Only one!




Mr HOCKEY:
  Only one. What about the other four? I am sure that, over in the Senate, Senator Cameron as the chief flamethrower for the member for Griffith is right now saying, 'It's outrageous—I didn't challenge on spending priorities; I actually challenged on the basis that I want more taxes'! That is what Labor is about: more taxes. The member for Bass gave it his best shot. He said, 'Let's double the Medicare levy.' The Treasurer said, 'No, we're not going to do that.' That is a more effusive, more direct and more comprehensive answer to the member for Bass in the Labor Party caucus than anything this Treasurer has ever given to the Australian people in this place. But it gets better. According to the article yesterday: 


One Labor MP, who asked not to be named, told The Australian Financial Review that some MPs were concerned about Labor's recent raft of funding commitments.


''They want to talk about these all encompassing programs, but they don't want to talk about how they are going to fund it,'' the MP said.


""It’s probably a sign of maturity in caucus—


it has only been around for 113 years, caucus, but finally there is a sign of maturity in caucus, according to this Labor MP!—


that people are not just prepared to go along with this wishful thinking.''


I repeat: 'this wishful thinking'. It is like The Wishing Well, one of the books I read to my kids, a story about making wishes, or The Magic Pudding, The Magic Faraway Tree, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and all those stories. They are all great stories but they are all fantasy—all fantasy, like the economic credibility of the Labor Party. It is all fantasy. They know how to spend money and, boy, are they good at it.


We have had pink batts that have burnt down houses. We have had $900 cheques go to dead people to stimulate the economy, which is a big ask of a dead person! We have also had the government spend outrageous sums of money on massively overpriced school halls. But, if you thought for a single moment that Labor might have learnt its lesson on waste, you are wrong; we have found a couple more examples. The Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities—actually, I think it is a bit of a waste to have a title with five different roles in it—




Mr Tony Smith:
  What's the acronym?




Mr HOCKEY:
  DSEWPaC! The Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has a $462,000 contract to deck out just two offices with indoor plants. That is just fantastic! It's a cracker. Just listen to this one: Labor has handed out $72,000 to the Auburn Community Development Network—in the member for Reid's marginal electorate—to host an 'enviro tea salon'. Thanks to the funding—this is the worst!—participants can now take part in a weaving workshop using native lomandra grass. I wonder what they are doing with that lomandra grass! Listen to this: participants 'will be encouraged to share their energy efficiency tips in exchange for a free seedling, re-potted into a recycled coffee cup sourced from local businesses'. That is taxpayers' money, $72,000 worth. Every taxpayer out there has been wondering where their taxes go under Labor.


And, just in case the wrong impression is given, Labor currently spends $150 million a year on an army of spin doctors. There are 1,600 people employed in the Public Service in media, communications, marketing and public affairs. The Australian Taxation Office has 271 spin doctors—I would say that is 271 who have failed at their jobs—while Defence has 175 and Human Services 124. This is Labor.



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  You might say, 'Come on, Joe, you're being a little tough here. You're being a little tough when you're down to talking about $72,000 or even $467,000.' But do you know what the cracker is? The federal government paid $1 billion, no strings attached, to electricity generators before 31 June this year for nothing—for nothing. They were going to close down some of those power stations, or they were going to keep them open; they cannot quite tell. But it was $1 billion. Remember the flood levy? The flood levy upset so many Australians who had given so generously privately to try and help Queenslanders in particular but also Victorians affected by floods. The government said, 'No, we've got to be responsible with our budget. We've got to have a limit on the deficit. The deficit will be $22 billion, therefore we're going to have a $1.7 billion flood levy.' That had a real impact on consumer confidence. It had a real impact on the discretionary spend of consumers. You know what happened? The government did not care about the budget, because what they promised was a $22 billion deficit and it has now turned out to be a $44 billion deficit.




Mr Bradbury:
  So how would you have funded it?




Mr HOCKEY:
  Now that I am being interjected on by the member for Lindsay, it takes me to the waste on boats. You are familiar with boats, aren't you, coming from Western Sydney? Before the last election the member for Lindsay went all the way up into Northern Australia, jumped on one of our naval vessels and, to the best of my memory, said, 'We are going to stop the boats.' Commander Bradbury said that—a long way from Penrith and Western Sydney. The only boat the Labor Party has stopped is a legal boat that tried to go fishing in Australian waters after three approvals from the Labor Party. That is the only boat you have stopped, sunshine.




Mr Tony Smith:
  His electorate's landlocked.




Mr HOCKEY:
  No, he has got the Nepean River. He will have his own little navy out of this, I am sure!


But it does get very serious. Why? Because, in order to shore up the Prime Minister's leadership, the Labor Party have gone on a spending spree of unprecedented scale. They have promised to deliver a National Disability Insurance Scheme, for which they have promised a huge amount of money, involving $10½ billion a year once it is fully operational, but they have not found the money for it. There could be no crueller hoax on some of the most vulnerable people in the community than to raise expectations and not deliver. Yet that is what the Labor Party have done. They have allocated $1 billion over the next four years for a program that, into the future, is going to cost $10½ billion to run. There is no money for it. They are trying to create the impression there is money for it.


They said they are going to increase aged-care funding by $3.7 billion over the next five years, but there is no money for it. They said: 'Don't worry. Low-paid workers are going to get an extra $1 billion.' In fact, we have now found out it is an extra $3 billion for low-paid workers, which the Labor Party said was a pay rise for social and community sector workers. So it was originally $1 billion and now it is $3 billion. They are going to subsidise private sector wages, and of course that is money that is not in the budget.


Offshore processing—gee, that's going well! It will be $2.1 billion at least for reopening Nauru and Manus Island. On the increase in the refugee intake, the government said they are increasing it to 20,000. They cannot stop the boats. We have had more than 25,000 people come here on boats under the government in recent times, yet they are increasing the refugee intake to 20,000, which is going to cost $1.4 billion.


You keep reminding me of defence and border protection. On defence, the government has committed to 12 new submarines—not six. They have one that urgently needs work sitting on a dry dock in South Australia. They are not prepared to spend the money on that, but do not worry, South Australia.



Opposition members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Grierson
):  Order! I do not think the member for North Sydney needs that assistance.




Mr HOCKEY:
  This government claims it is going to build 12 new submarines at $36 billion, and there is $16 billion for the Joint Strike Fighter, which it delays; it says the money is somewhere in the forward estimates. Well, it is not there. Then we have the dental care program—the one going through the parliament now—with $4 billion.


But the mother of them all, if you like, is the Gonski review, with $6½ billion, but probably really more—$8 billion a year. The Prime Minister said: 'Don't worry. Every school in the country will be better off.' We would love to promise that. We would love to say that every school in Australia is going to get way more money than the six per cent annual increase already budgeted for. We would love to say that. You know what? They will not say where it is coming from. But we know where it is coming from, because there is someone running around out there saying: 'Hang on. We should break into the government Future Fund, the money that was set up and put away by the coalition for the future challenges—the superannuation needs into the future—so that our children and grandchildren will not have a debt burden.' We put that money away. We did not spend it. We put it away, and what do Labor want to do? They want to break into that. You know what that is the equivalent of? That is the equivalent of saying to a parent: 'It's okay. Don't worry about your retirement. Don't worry about funding yourself and your family into retirement. You can break into your superannuation now in order to fund your children's education.' You cannot apply one rule to the government and not apply the same rule to everyday Australians. You cannot break into people's savings for one purpose and not another.


We asked the Treasurer explicitly in question time today: 'What is the answer? Yes or no? Are you going to break into this Future Fund, which Australians have put aside to deal with the challenges into the future and to protect our children?' You know what? He would not answer the question. He was prepared to answer the member for Bass in the caucus yesterday. He was prepared to answer a question on death duties in this place, but he was not prepared to answer the question about breaking into the Future Fund.


You know what comes out of all of this? The government's total indifference to the welfare of Australian families. How can you say to a family on a household income of $68,000 a year, 'Guys, you're going to have taxes that increase your cost of living by at least $1,000 or $2,000 a year'? How do you say that to them in this environment, when so many people are uncertain and nervous about the future? How do you say to those people, 'We're going to make it much harder for people into the future under Labor, but don't worry; it's all accounted for'? It is not accounted for. That is the Labor way. They said before the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' The Prime Minister looked the Australian people in the eye and pledged there would be no carbon tax, and the Treasurer looked the Australian people in the eye and said it was a hysterical allegation that there would be a carbon tax. So too do they look the Australian people in the eye today and say, 'Don't worry; it will be all right.'


It will not be all right under Labor, because they are A-grade hypocrites. They are indifferent to the welfare of Australian families. They are indifferent to the welfare of Australian businesses. They just do not understand that taxpayers' money belongs to taxpayers. It is not theirs to splash around for the re-election of the leader of the Labor Party, Julia Gillard. It is not their opportunity to try and hold government based on taxpayers' money. It is their solemn responsibility to protect taxpayers, to give Australians hope, to allow Australians to gain the reward from their effort and their hard work and to ensure that as a nation we have the opportunity to do better. The handbrake of Labor must come off. It is time for them for once to be honest with the Australian people. (Time expired)

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2012-09-19,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (16:00):  I am pleased to be able to contribute to this matter of public importance brought forward by the member for North Sydney. It is ironic that it is the member for North Sydney that brings forward this MPI, given the fact that he is the one that has confirmed that there is a $70 billion black hole in the opposition's costings. He has done it twice now on breakfast television. We all know about that occasion when he did it, when the minister for the environment was also side by side with him on breakfast television, and he confirmed that the $70 billion figure was correct. But after all of the hot air that we have heard from him since, we see today he went back on breakfast television. It took him a little while, but eventually he conceded once more that he does have a $70 billion black hole.


To give this some context, this $70 billion black hole comes on the back of that $11 billion black hole that they had in their election costings.



Mr Hartsuyker interjecting—




Mr BRADBURY:
 The member opposite—always one to walk into it—has come forward making an interjection about some mysterious $120 billion—no fact, absolutely no basis, no substance, another one of these Liberal scare campaigns. In fact, he is not even a Liberal. He is part of the tail that has been wagging the dog of economic policy for the Liberals—he is a National member. He is out there making these claims about $120 billion. Well, it is rubbish. There is no $120 billion black hole, and if they believe there is, provide some evidence. Tell us where this $120 billion black hole is. But when it comes to the $70 billion black hole, don't believe me. Go and talk to the shadow Treasurer. He is on the record, not once, but twice, going on breakfast television and confirming a $70 billion black hole.


But what was interesting about the comments that he made today on ABC 24 was that not only did he confirmed the $70 billion black hole, but he went on to say, 'Up to,' and when he did that, he goes on, 'what we are saying was, we will find the savings, and we have found the savings.' So he is not just saying that they have a $70 billion black hole, and not just acknowledging that they are going to need to find $70 billion worth of savings to plug the loophole. Mind you, they have not revealed to the Australian people any of these savings, except, of course, for the 12,000 public servants that they want to sack. We heard the member for North Sydney once more, on his feet just a few minutes ago, when he started talking about all these people in the public service. What he did not tell us was how many of them he intends to sack. But he has done that on a previous occasion—12,000 is the current figure. Twelve thousand. It is starting to sound familiar, isn't it? It is starting to sound just a little bit like Queensland. In fact, when we have a look at what is emerging, it is a pattern—a pattern of deceit, a pattern of Liberal and National deceit. I think it can best be described as the five-point plan coming straight out of the Liberal playbook. It always starts with step 1: talk down the economy. It does not matter how good the economic figures that are released are, the member for North Sydney has always got some spin that turns it into doom and gloom. You would think that we were a Third World country, if you listen to Premier Newman or some of those in New South Wales. They are out there saying, 'The Australian economy is up there in the same league as the Greek or Spanish economies.' Does anyone seriously believe that?


Let us have a look at the facts. We have an economy where our budget is returning to surplus. We have growth that has been achieved since the GFC of 11 per cent—our economy today is 11 per cent larger than it was before the GFC. Show me a major advanced economy, anywhere in the world, that comes within a hair of that 11 per cent growth—head and shoulders above all of our competitors, but they talk the economy down.


Unemployment is just over five per cent. We have interest rates at record lows. Remember they told us all, at a previous election, 'Interest rates will always be lower under the Liberals.' Then we had 10 consecutive increases in interest rates. To put some facts into the debate, interest rates are lower today under the Labor government than they were when the Liberals left office. In fact, a family on an average mortgage of about $300,000 is paying $4,000 a year less in their repayments. Four thousand dollars a year less—these are the facts.


We talk about strong growth, low unemployment, contained inflation, not to mention the record pipeline of investment coming into this country—half a trillion dollars worth of investment scheduled to come into this country in the resources sector alone. In addition to that, we know that our net debt—and they talk about debt and deficit—is peaking at less than 10 per cent of gross domestic product—less than 10 per cent of the size of our economy. When you compare that with our competitor economies, it is about a 10th of the average of other advanced economies. Anyone travelling to Australia says, 'What is the secret?' This is one of the miracle economies in terms of the GFC and coming out of the back of the GFC. The way in which the Australian economy is performing, it is outperforming all of its peers.


Those opposite come in here every day and talk down the economy. If they were in power, all of the indicators that they used to claim were the indicators of success. They used to say, 'We're a wonderful government, because interest rates are low.' Well, interest rates are low today. They used to say, 'We're a wonderful government, because unemployment is low.' Unemployment is low today. They used to say, 'We're a wonderful government because we've been growing.' The economy is growing today. On all of the measures that they previously stood up in this place and claimed were the benchmarks of economic success when they were on this side of the chamber, this government has achieved success. Our national economy gets a tick on all of these counts, yet day after day they come into this place and go out there into the community and talk down the economy.


They talk down the economy because that is step 1 of the five-point plan of the Liberal play book. Step 2, after they have spent all their time talking down the economy, is they make sure that they keep their policies in the top drawer. We heard from the member for North Sydney earlier today that they have costed all of these savings—$70 billion worth of savings. Have a look at New South Wales. The New South Wales Liberals have ripped $1.7 billion out of education. Look how much damage that has done. The federal party would have to make $70 billion worth of cuts. If you believe the shadow Treasurer or the member for Goldstein, who has previously said, 'We've done all the hard policy work, we've got the costings and we've got the savings,' they are in the top drawer.


They keep it in the top drawer. I am not sure if it is in the top drawer of the shadow Treasurer or the shadow minister for finance, but there is this folder. This folder has all of these nasty cuts that they want to make to health and education, like the cuts we have seen in Queensland and the cuts we have seen in New South Wales. I do not remember the people of New South Wales being let in on the secret before the New South Wales election. The Queensland people were not let in on the secret about all these cuts before the Queensland election. In the top drawer is a folder, and there is a label on this folder. The label says 'Commission of audit: recommendations', because step 3 of the five-point plan is that they hold a commission of audit.


So they would come in after talking the economy down, telling everyone that this is the worst economy in the world, and say, 'We have to take drastic action, and those policies that we costed that were sitting in the top drawer are mysteriously going to be the recommendations of the secret audit.' In Queensland they got Peter Costello to conduct the audit. I suspect that will not be happening. He is not the flavour of the month. In fact, given the way the coalition have turned their backs on rational economic policy, he has to pick up the pen and write opinion pieces day after day to point out what a tragedy it is that the once great Liberal Party, as he says, has now been taken over by that wagging dog of National Party agrarian populism. That is the shame about the modern Liberal Party.


The member for Higgins smiles. She smiles because she knows what a debacle it is that their economic policy is now being controlled by people who are xenophobic when it comes to foreign investment. They want to smash and break up Coles and Woolies.




Mr Robert:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: standing order 90 does not allow any improper imputation upon members of the opposition. Calling our view on foreign investment xenophobic crosses that line.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Grierson
):  The member for Fadden will resume his seat. If I were to apply his rules, we would not actually have any debates in this place. Go ahead, Assistant Treasurer.




Mr BRADBURY:
  They are not my words but Peter Costello's words. Go and have a look at his opinion piece. Step 1: talk the economy down. Step 2: cost those nasty savings measures but keep them in the top drawer. Step 3: create a commission of audit. If you thought Peter Costello did a good job, I tell you that with a $70 billion black hole the only man for this job is Freddy Krueger. He is about the only one who could slash and slice and dice the sorts of savings that we would experience if the Liberals were to come to power.


So that is the third thing to do. They create a mickey mouse commission of audit, like they did when they were last in government. What they do not tell you is that when they were last in government they came in and said: 'What a disaster. The economy is in terrible shape. We need to make some savings.' So what did they do? They took an axe to health and education. The interesting thing was they had something like a commission of audit, but most of the things that they actually took up were not even the recommendations that the commission of audit outlined. They have already decided what they are going to cut. It is sitting in the top drawer.


The model, the template, is there for people to see in New South Wales and Queensland. It will take an axe to the Public Service. They have at least been a little bit honest about that in mentioning it will be 11,000 or 12,000 people. But they will take an axe to health. They will take an axe to education. That is their way. That is the Liberal way. We invest. We build a stronger economy for the future so that each individual has the capacity to make an active contribution to our economy. They believe that education is only for the privileged. They believe that if you cannot afford to pay for an education you do not deserve one. That is what they think. That is what they have always thought. Unfortunately, that is the future for this country if they get elected.


I have gone through the first few steps, but step 4, which I have already covered, is what they do when they get in, and that is to cut health and cut education. We saw what they did when they came to power in 1996. We have seen what Newman has done in Queensland. We have seen what O'Farrell has done in New South Wales. We have seen what Baillieu has done in Victoria. It is more of that that the Australian people can look forward to. But step 5 is the one. All of the first four steps were pretty predictable, but step 5 is the doozy. This is the one that you have all been waiting for.


There is a bit of an alignment of the stars happening here. They have their $70 billion black hole. How are they going to fill it? They are going to slash services—we know that. But, to give them credit, there have been one or two creative suggestions on their side. It is no more than a thought bubble, but if you pierce the thought bubble you can see there might actually be a kernel of coalition policy. It is a shame the member for Goldstein is not in the chamber at the moment. He came up with this cunning plan that the way he would save money is he would outsource health and education to the states. That is a good idea—they have been doing such a good job! I feel much safer knowing that Barry O'Farrell and Campbell Newman are going to look after health and education policy!


So we are going to outsource health and education completely to the state Liberal governments. Talk about opening the barn door and letting the fox into the henhouse. That is the future under a Liberal government. That is what we will experience under a Liberal government. But the thing about what the member for Goldstein has had to say is that there is a little bit more method to his madness. He is not just talking about outsourcing services to the states—because he knows that, if you outsource services to the states, they are going to want something out of it. Barry O'Farrell told us on the weekend what they want. They want to jack up the GST. The stars are beginning to come into alignment as more and more Liberal governments start to sprout up around the place all calling for an increase in the GST. We can see where it is going. They always wanted to put the GST on everything. They even took it to an election. Deep down in their heart of hearts they want to put the GST on everything—food, education and health. And now they want to get together with their Liberal mates and come back and try and finish the job. Well, we are going to stand up against that. (Time expired)

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2012-09-19,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (16:15):  I am pleased to be able to speak on the very important issue of the failure of the government to bring its spending under control. The member for North Sydney chronicled the waste of this government. He mentioned pink batts, Building the Education Revolution and sending cheques to dead people and pets. But the biggest waste of all is not a budget item. The biggest waste of all has to be the National Broadband Network—and it is not even on the budget, so Australian taxpayers will be unaware of the financial carnage that this government is wreaking in Australia. The National Broadband Network has a cone of silence around it. You cannot inquire into the actual position of the NBN; it is shrouded in secrecy. It started as a $4.7 billion fibre-to-the-node network across the country. But it has morphed. It has had the mother of all cost overruns. And now many industry commentators say they do not think it will be finished for $50 billion—a tenfold increase in cost.


We have had no cost-benefit analysis. The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, worked out the details on the back of a beer coaster on a VIP jet with then Prime Minister Rudd flying from Sydney to Perth. The $4.7 billion project morphed into something much more expensive. The member for North Sydney chronicled a number of fairytales earlier. We had the Wizard of Oz and the Magic Faraway Tree. But there is a bigger fairytale, and that is the NBN Co. corporate plan. The NBN Co. corporate plan is one of Australia's great fairytales. But it does tell us a few things. It claims that the actual cost, the capex, to build the network will be $37.5 billion but it will cost around $44.1 billion to complete the total project.


When you look at their figures, NBN Co.'s capital expense will be $1.4 billion more than originally planned, operating expenses will be $3.2 billion more than originally planned and, at the same time, revenue will be $600 million less than originally planned. That is a $5.2 billion adverse budget outcome in only two years. If you can achieve that in around two years, what hope does the Australian taxpayer have for any protection from the waste of this organisation over the life of the project, which is going to go well beyond a decade? The reality is that the government have no idea how much this project is going to cost. At every turn, they conceal the true position of the National Broadband Network.


The corporate plan for the NBN Co. has changed so much over the last couple of years that any forecasts made within it should be seen as nothing more than politically motivated guesses. We can have very little faith in NBN Co., because they miss every target. They are the gold medallists in missing targets. They missed every target in the 2010-12 corporate plan. The original corporate plan said the indirect costs were supposed to be $800 million by 2013. That has been revised up to $1.5 billion. This spending was on advertising, staff, vehicles, fit-outs, beer fridges—all the essential things. But building activity, spending on the actual network, was $1.7 billion less than actually planned. So NBN Co. was busily fitting out its offices, buying a fleet of vehicles and all that sort of stuff but the rollout of the network was actually proceeding at a snail's pace.


By 2013 the NBN fibre rollout was supposed to have passed 1.26 million premises; the new corporate plan says only 341,000. By 2013 the NBN fibre was supposed to be connected to over half a million premises; the new corporate plan revised that figure down by a princely 89 per cent to just 54,000. Total customer numbers, including wireless and satellite, have been revised down by 84 per cent from 562,000 to just 92,000.


But there is some good news. In the recent past, we finally got to the point where NBN Co. have more customers than staff. That is certainly a substantial improvement. Finally they have got to the point where they have got more customers than staff. NBN Co. is purely a financial disaster. If you believe the corporate plan, NBN Co. will have spent around $6 billion by 2013 for a grand total of 92,000 customers hooked up to its network—by any measure a colossal failure.


Despite the government rhetoric, the taxpayer is really paying for this. It is an absolute furphy to try and claim that this is somehow a project that can be kept off budget; it is a cost that is going to be met by the taxpayer. This project has little chance of being commercially viable. They did not even include in their figurings the cost of interest. My colleague the member for Wentworth quite rightly pointed out that a cost of around $10 billion in interest has not been included in the project cost. No developer would exclude interest charges on the cost of a development. But NBN Co. do, and they do it because they are trying to create an illusion that this project is somehow viable. I think Australian taxpayers deserve to know the true cost of the NBN. They deserve to know what it is costing them. They deserve to have the shroud of secrecy raised so that there can be actual transparency. Just as the government cannot get its spending under control, NBN cannot get its spending under control. In the current financial year NBN Co. will spend $1.1 billion on operating expenses, $3.2 billion on capital expenses and will only connect 54,000 customers.


The issue of how NBN Co. will run the satellites is of great concern. They will spend in the order of $2 billion on the satellite program. The program to have high-speed services delivered via satellite will be welcomed by regional Australia. But the reality is that there is no need for the government to own satellites, operate satellites and own the ground stations. When you talk to people in the satellite industry they are aghast at the fact that the government would go into the satellite business when they could have set a performance specification and had the private sector deliver the product, with utmost reliability, at a fraction of the cost. The government obviously have not learned from the Aussat debacle, where they lost $700 million in the early nineties. Nowhere in the world is a government getting into providing communication services via satellite.


We have the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network. It is supposed to be the eyes and ears of the parliament, supposed to be a watchdog that looks over the project. When we have Mike Quigley, the head of NBN Co., appear before the NBN joint committee, all we get are elusive answers. We never get answers to the questions that we want, we never get frank and concise answers; we always get an attempt to shroud what is actually happening in NBN Co. I asked a question about some remediation works needed for Bonnyrigg subdivision. I asked what the cost was and, as is always the case, the CEO of NBN Co. said that he did not know. 




Mr Christensen:
  Didn't care!




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  Probably didn't care—that is right. So I put the question on notice and after months and months of waiting—he probably thought I would forget about it—the answer came back. I asked a very simple question: 'What was the cost of remediation works for Bonnyrigg subdivision?' He came back and said, 'The project was completed using standard NBN techniques.' That was the cost: 'The project has been completed using standard NBN techniques.'


So I then reminded him that to mislead a parliamentary committee was a most grievous matter and that he should be mindful of giving us the correct answer. After months we finally got the answer: they had wasted $20,000 on remediation works for Bonnyrigg. That item is relatively minor in terms of the total project, but the principle is far more important, that a parliamentary committee asked a concise question and got an answer that was meant to mislead. So if we are getting answers to a whole range of other questions that are equally misleading, when you are looking at the largest infrastructure project in this nation's history, the Australian taxpayer can have no faith in the answers that NBN Co. are giving and the Australian taxpayer can have no faith in their corporate plan, which is the greatest fairy story since The Wizard of Oz. The Australian taxpayer should have great cause for concern. Not only do we have a Treasurer who cannot keep spending under control; we have the CEO of NBN Co., Mike Quigley, who cannot keep spending under control. We have a project that is behind time, over budget and a waste of taxpayers' money. Taxpayers will be paying dearly for their incompetence.

Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (16:25):  People listening to this MPI debate might think they had just experienced a bit of deja vu, maybe a bit of a re-run of an old tape. But the old tape was not that old; it was from earlier today.


The coalition disrupt the proceedings of the House for urgencies and for all sorts of things they want to do just to have a debate, then they have an MPI just half an hour later on the exact same topic. They have no idea about their own agenda or how to run a program and certainly no idea about what the urgency is in a matter of public importance. So rather than talk about the issues I thought that I would have a look at what this MPI actually says and that maybe we could address the urgency. What is the urgency that is contained in this MPI? I had a bit of a think about what this urgency perhaps represents.



Opposition members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Grierson
):  Order! I will ask for the cooperation of the House. The last speaker, the member for Cowper, was heard in silence and the same courtesy should apply to every member of this House.




Mr RIPOLL:
  Thank you for the protection, Madam Deputy Speaker, from this rowdy mob, although I have to say they are not as rowdy as the contributions we had just after question time. There was a fair bit of hide, a fair bit of bluster—and a fair bit of spittle that went around the room at the same time. But it always indicates to me just how shallow, hollow and how empty the rhetoric is—the louder it is. We saw plenty of that before from the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney. Again, I thought I should have a close look at what this urgency matter is. What could be so urgent? Is something imminent about to happen? A collapse or an ending of something? This urgency starts to wear a little bit thin after more than two years of hearing it—'The government's going to collapse,' 'Something's going to happen,' all these things. It just is not the case. So I figured out what the urgency is. It is the urgency of these guys to warm their backsides on the seats of government. That is the urgency. The urgency is actually about them. It is about their personal urgency. They want to get on this side. That is the only urgency. These guys are in a hurry. 


One thing that we do know is that they do not respect democracy. From day one the only mantra they have had is: 'We need an election tomorrow.' That is their whole mantra, that is their policy basis: 'We need an election tomorrow so that we can get to government quicker. Forget the three-year terms, forget the process, forget the Constitution.' The urgency of this motion is about how quick these guys can get themselves into the seats of power. Believe me, they have form. That is the only urgency. 


Then I thought, if it is not just about the urgency issue, perhaps it is the control of government spending. What is urgent about the control of government spending? I thought there must be something disastrous happening either in Australia or in the world. I looked at the world and I thought, 'There is something disastrous happening.' Most of the world is feeling those ill winds of the global financial crisis. I know those opposite have forgotten already; they forgot the same day it happened. The global financial crisis, according to Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, just did not happen. They like to skip over that bit, because the Labor government actually did a good job of getting through it. So they do not want to talk about that; they do not want to remind people about that. So what is the urgency here? What is the getting back into control of the spending? I thought I had better go and check the books. What is the best way to find out if spending is out of control? Go and check the books. So I did. I went and had a look at the books and I found—guess what—that the Australian economy has grown larger, by 11 per cent, since we came to government. How is that even possible? We were facing a global financial crisis but we still managed to grow the economy. And guess what? We did not grow it by sacking people. That is what the Queensland LNP and Campbell Newman do and that is what Barry O'Farrell does in New South Wales. We grew it by adding jobs. We grew it by investing in infrastructure. We grew the economy by investing in education, investing in skills dealing with productivity and looking at what the economic drivers of the economy are. 


I know they are hollow words for the opposition. They do not even know what those words mean. They are not concerned. In fact, in this one matter of public importance you can see what this opposition are all about. It is about their urgency to warm the seats of government, their urgency to run to the Lodge, their urgency to be in the halls of power—not to deliver anything, not to achieve some good, not to deliver some outcome and not to deliver better education outcomes or better health services.


Let us take a leaf out of the book of those LNP and Liberal and National party governments that are in government right now. We know they are on the same page and are singing from the same song sheet. They are in the same broad church. What are they doing? What are they doing to their economies? What are they doing in their states? Let us take a look at Queensland. You would think that in difficult economic times you would try to boost upwards the economy. You would perhaps try to support mining. You would not want to increase royalties. A direct hit—regardless of profit, just on the sheer amount you pull out of the ground. At the same time that we have got price pressures downwards on resources, they actually put a tax the other way. They put a tax on the quantity that comes out of the ground rather than when you make a profit. Where have the great market economists of the Liberal Party gone? They are not sitting on the opposition benches. They are not even on the crossbenches.




Ms O'Dwyer:
  They're not sitting on your side!




Mr RIPOLL:
  If they are not sitting on our side and they are not sitting on your side, just which side are they sitting on? There are only two sides. Let me go through, again, some facts. Where have we spent the money?—hang on! We lifted the age pension, the largest single increase in the age pension, for those most in need in our economy—our older people who really need a boost.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr RIPOLL:
  They are still arguing against it! They still do not want older people to get an age pension increase. They really hate that. It is disturbing. Was that a waste of money? I do not think it was. I think it is something good we did and is something that will outlive us as a government and hopefully outlive you, whenever you might be in government.


We saved over $3 billion by means-testing the private health insurance rebate to ensure it was fairer and more sustainable into the future. We understand the need to get the balance right between spending and saving. We have saved over $900 million by targeting family payments in a better way, making sure the baby bonus works in the way it is intended. We have saved over $1.9 billion by better targeting the tax concession for living-away-from-home allowances. We have saved over $900 million by reducing tax concessions for very-high-income earners. People have called for a long time for the lifting of the tax-free threshold. Why should it only be $6,000 before you pay tax? This government listened. We have lifted it not twice but three times, to $18,000. That is where we have spent the money.


Go and tell everyone out there that you want to take it back off them, because that is what you are saying by everything that you do—I was going to say in policies, but there are not any. 




Mr Tony Smith:
  I thought we had nasty policies!




Mr RIPOLL:
  They are all nasty. They only have one policy and one mantra, which is the urgency to get to the Lodge and the urgency to be in the halls of power. They cannot wait. They are rubbing their hands with glee. You can see them at night, going: 'I can't wait. I can't wait to do what Campbell Newman does in Queensland. I can't wait to do what Barrel O'Farrell'—maybe he is a barrel—'Barry O'Farrell in New South Wales—



Mr Ewen Jones interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I remind the member for Herbert that he is not in his chair.




Mr RIPOLL:
  They cannot wait to get to the halls of power to do the first thing they always do, and all Australians know it, and that is to just start sacking people. How do you support an economy by just getting rid of people? It is a tragedy in this place. But when we recently heard some of the contributions to this debate I thought I had better listen to what the other side says, to make sure I get a grasp or a grip on what their argument is.


Their argument amounted to this, and I will summarise it. You start with a tax. You attack government department names: 'What a silly name for a government department.' I think the shadow Treasurer spent two minutes talking about silly names. That was his contribution to an economic debate. Then they attacked small business by saying: 'What a waste of money, to give it to small businesses that do things for other people. As long as it’s a small business related to climate change or anything that might be good for sustainability or the future, attack them. They're not worthy of being called a small business.' 


Then they talked about flowers. The member for North Sydney spent a minute talking about flowers and the great waste. Then they went to their pet subject, their favourite topic at all times—that is, sacking people. They think this government spends too much money employing people. 



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr RIPOLL:
  They go, 'Where's the money coming from?' This is all that is left. I will tell you where it is coming from and I will tell you where we have saved it, because I have already done some of that. And I will tell you where it will not go. It will not go to Liberal Party mates and to National Party mates, as under the previous Howard government. We saw enormous trunks of wasted money going to—if you want to talk about far-Left airy-fairy stuff—Liberal and National party mates. So it is clear in this place that after five years and more than two years since the last election we have done a good job to support jobs and the economy, and it is proven by the— (Time expired)

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2012-09-19,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (16:35):  It is extraordinary. On a matter of public importance about Labor needing to bring its spending under control, from each of the Labor speakers we have heard, there has not been one mention of the word 'debt' or the word 'deficit'. The answer to why that is so is: they confirm they care about neither. We have seen something else with previous speakers—and I will exempt the last speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. As well as avoiding the topic of this MPI and launching attacks on our side of politics, the Assistant Treasurer, once again, demonstrated the incredible capacity Labor has to mix its metaphors when trying to tell a story. The member for North Sydney rightly said that we all grow up learning stories and fairytales. And sayings are handed down, are they not, from family to family? I was horrified to hear the Assistant Treasurer say in response to the member for Cowper that they were going to open the barn door and let the fox into the henhouse.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  I'm confused and I'm National Party!




Mr TONY SMITH:
  At first I thought that it is just a reflection on the Assistant Treasurer. I should not single out our old friend the admiral; this is just him. I should not generalise and say that this is a Labor Party trend, but then I was reminded, I regret to say, that this is in fact a trend with those opposite. We had the Treasurer last year say: 'They have their heads stuck so far in the sand they cannot see the wood for the trees.' This is just a small illustration of the competence of those opposite. Of course, if they mix their metaphors on something so simple, it is no wonder they cannot get any of their budget numbers right.



Mr Ripoll interjecting—




Mr TONY SMITH:
  I am invited to attack you on debt and I will. Thank you for the invitation. I was not going to forget in the last seven minutes, but since you have asked me to recite the debt story, I think I will, because you failed to mention it. As my friend the member for Higgins has been pointing out—you said you listened to those opposite—$96 billion was the level of net government debt left behind by the Hawke-Keating government.


We had the Assistant Treasurer saying, 'What did those opposite do when they got into power in 1996? They reduced spending.' Why would we have done that? All through the election campaign in those days before the Charter of Budget Honesty you had Labor ministers saying that the budget was in surplus. When the election was over and there was a new government the Treasury said, 'Actually the budget's in deficit by $10 billion.' Net government debt was $96 billion. It took more than a decade of responsible budgets to pay off $96 billion of net government debt. In fact debt-free day, I think, was on 20 or 21 April 2006. It took 10 years to pay it down.


What happened after that with surpluses? Money began to be banked into the Future Fund—something Wayne Swan is looking at very closely today.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  He can't keep his hands off it.




Mr TONY SMITH:
  That was the debt story. It was Labor's debt story of $96 billion; our story of paying off that debt. Remember when debt was paid off and money was being banked there was a guy called the member for Griffith—who is still here in this House—as the Leader of the Opposition saying that he was a fiscal conservative and he believed in surplus budgets. Then the Labor government was elected. What has happened since? Have they produced a surplus budget? No.



Ms Rishworth interjecting—




Mr TONY SMITH:
  Don't you worry, we will go all through the years. Let us have a look at what has happened since. It started with $45 billion in the bank. Net debt is now projected to be $144 billion or $145 billion. Let us look at how accurate they are. Let us judge them on their precision. For the member for Kingston up the back, let us just take the last two years. Do you agree the GFC is over?



Ms Rishworth interjecting—




Mr TONY SMITH:
  No, sorry; not on the talking points. That was a question without notice. Let us take the last two years. It is helpful that you do that. Let us just start from the end of the last election. The mid-year update was brought out in December 2011. It is worth having a look at what the Treasurer said debt would be for the 2012-13 year, what it would peak at. Back then, this is under two years ago, the Treasurer said, 'Net government debt would peak at $93 billion.' About six months later, in the budget of last year, he said it would peak at about $104 billion in the 2012-13 year. Then at the mid-year update at the end of last year he said $133 billion. This year's budget it is $143 billion. So from $93 billion to $143 billion—what is a $50 billion blow-out in two years? If you compare it with the debt blow-out in the last five or six years of the Keating government, where net government debt went from something like $17 billion to $96 billion, that is just a blow-out of about $79 billion or $80 billion.


You start to get the picture. Net government debt just escalates under Labor every single year. It is escalating today. You do not have to just look at their inaccuracy on net government debt projections; look at the last financial year. Over a similar period the initial projection for the budget deficit was $12 billion, then $22 billion, then $37 billion, then $44 billion on budget night. I do not have the final number yet; we will be getting it any day. I have to say that, if these guys were playing basketball, they would miss the backboard. If they were kicking for goal in an AFL match, they would hit the interchange bench. They would be out of camera shot.


It reminds me of an infamous aviator who filed a flight plan in the 1930s to fly, I think, from New York to California. He filed the flight plan, took off and landed in Ireland. His name was Wrong Way Corrigan. I am being a bit cruel to Wrong Way Corrigan because it transpired later that he actually meant to go in a different direction. It was all a bit of a trick.


But in relation to debt—$144 billion—we have had a $50 billion blow-out in two years. And now we have a $120 billion black hole blow-out. Those opposite will announce spending plans but they will not announce how they are paid for. It is always the same way under Labor: escalating debt and more taxes. It is the same way. When was Labor's last budget surplus?




Mr Hartsuyker:
  1988?




Mr TONY SMITH:
  It was in 1989. You have heard the story about what Labor does. If you look at the last couple of years, you will know the future under Labor. In their hearts, those on the government side know it. That is why the famous five stood up in caucus. Four members of this House—the fab four—started to ping the Treasurer for his irresponsibility. (Time expired)

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (16:45):  It is no surprise that today the opposition have come in and started their new fear campaign. It is interesting that today, for the first time in question time, they did not ask about carbon pricing. And that is because their fear campaign on that issue has run out of steam. It has run out of steam and now they are casting their minds to the next fear campaign: 'What can we now scare the Australian people senseless about?' That is exactly what they are doing now: talking down our economy and putting concern out there, when really our economic fundamentals are very good in this country. Believe it or not, the opposition refuses to acknowledge that. They think, 'We did not succeed in scaring people out the carbon price, so we will move on now and scare people about the economy.'


I think it is important to get the facts on the table. I have to say that there seems to be an ability by the opposition to completely ignore the existence of a global financial crisis that this government faces. I know that those on the opposite side of the chamber are becoming protectionists. I imagine that the member for Casey and the member for Higgins would be concerned about the protectionist elements, but the member for Cowper is probably cheering for them on the sidelines. The opposition are becoming protectionists, but that should not stop them from looking—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  I ask the member for Casey to resume his seat. We know what is happening. I can see what is happening, so he should resume his seat. 




Ms RISHWORTH:
  As I was saying, those on the opposite side of the chamber are becoming a protectionist party. However, they should look outside at the rest of the world to see what significant achievements this country has made and should stop this fear campaign about our economy.


Let's start with our growth. In the Euro zone, the economy after December 2007 shrank by 1.7 per cent. The Japanese economy shrank by 1.7 per cent and the US economy grew by just 1.2 per cent. What happened here in Australia? What happened here in Australia was 10.3 per cent growth. That is an astonishing achievement when you look around the rest of the world and at what we have done. 


That did not happen by accident. That happened because this government acted when it was necessary. This government acted to protect jobs. I know that for those on the other side of the chamber it is a foreign concept to act to protect jobs; in fact, one could say that, for them, it is the opposite: they act to protect unemployment in some ways. But we acted to protect jobs. We made it very clear that we would act to protect jobs and, when growth returned to trend, we would do the economically responsible thing, make savings and return the budget to surplus.


That is exactly what we are doing. Over the last five budgets we have seen savings of $130-plus billion. That is because we know that it is responsible, when we are facing an issue where there is economic downturn, for the government to intervene, and when it is not facing economic downturn the government has to withdraw. That is exactly what we have done. We have made savings in a whole range of areas.


And, might I say, they are savings that the opposition continually vote against. There was the Chronic Dental Health Scheme, about which there has been some conjecture. That was a scheme that was rorted by many people. It was a scheme that was not means-tested. It did not matter whether you were a pensioner or a millionaire, you could get access to the scheme. It was a poorly targeted scheme but when we moved to close that down the Liberal Party voted against it.


Then there was the private health insurance rebate. That was a rebate that we believed should be properly and appropriately targeted, but those on the other side of the House voted against it. So, while we have been doing our bit to make savings, we have seen the opposition irresponsibly vote against that. That is why I can only see this MPI as representing crocodile tears. When the government have been working to produce savings, unfortunately the opposition have just voted against those measures.


It is not surprising that there is a $70 billion black hole in the opposition's figures. They say there are answers about where the money will come from but they will not actually tell us where. Which hospitals, which jobs, what education spending will they cut? But we do know where the money will go if they keep to their promises—and that is to their direct action plan. 


We have not heard much about their direct action plan, but it is an incredibly expensive plan. We have been talking about wasting money. A direct action plan that costs billions and billions of dollars, with no change to climate change, one could call a direct waste of money. But the opposition, if they continue to uphold that they believe climate change is occurring and that they need to act, will implement, if they are ever elected, this direct action plan. That would mean a tax bill, if they do not find the savings, of $1,300 for every single household. 


They will not tell us where the money is coming from. Often the Labor Party get in these debates, 'You're just making this up; there's no $70 billion black hole.' Of course, the $70 billion figure does not come from the Labor Party; it comes directly from the mouths of those opposite. It is time for the Liberal Party, who profess to be good economic managers, to be very clear about how they are going to fund this. Of course, this is on the back of an $11 billion black hole at the last election. It shows that when it comes to being transparent, those on the other side are a little sloppy.


Our economy is going very well. Since coming to office we have created 800,000 jobs.




Mr Tony Smith:
  You have? 




Ms RISHWORTH:
  This is despite 27 million jobs lost worldwide. Since coming to government there have been 800,000 jobs created. Are you disputing that for some reason? 




Mr Tony Smith:
  You said you created them.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! All remarks are to be through the chair.




Ms RISHWORTH:
  Since this government has come to office, there have been 800,000 new jobs. I know you do not want to talk about jobs. I can understand that those on the back bench may be embarrassed about Campbell Newman and about Barry O'Farrell. I can tell you: those on the front bench are cheerleading and saying, 'Bring on those job losses!' But this side of the House does care.


Let's go through some of the other important economic figures. Inflation is at 13-year lows. Interest rates are now at record lows of 3.5 per cent—compared to 6.75 per cent when the Liberal Party left office. There is a huge investment pipeline and very low debt. Those on the other side failed to compare debt around the developed world. As a percentage of GDP, Australia has a very low debt. We are bringing the budget back to surplus and we are making responsible cuts.


We heard those opposite talk about how great it was, how responsible they were, in the Howard years. A lot of people would remember the $121 million they spent on their Work Choices advertising campaign, and I do not think a lot of people would think that was very responsible spending. Do not forget the $10 million spent on the cloud-seeding rainmaker by the then Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, the member for Wentworth. There was also the cheese factory that never made cheese. And the list goes on. This was at a time when it was raining gold—and what did they do? They squandered it. We were given a difficult task when we came into office: to deal with the GFC and ensure that people were still employed. We are managing that in the economically responsible way.


At the end of the day I think the Australian people will see through those opposite. They will not be able to forget. There is also the Woolies and Coles tax that they are going to impose on the Australian people. I think the Australian people will see through the irresponsible economic ideas of those opposite.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (16:56):  After the ducking and weaving that we saw today in question time from the Treasurer and from the Prime Minister on their $120 billion black hole, it is no wonder at all that the people who were sent in here to defend this matter of public importance were the Assistant Treasurer, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and the member for Kingston. I feel very sorry for them because Wayne Swan was not prepared to come into this chamber and provide the facts himself as to where the money is coming from.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  He was incapable.




Ms O'DWYER:
  He was absolutely incapable, as my learned colleague highlights.


Apart from the member for Kingston blithely dismissing the discussion of this very important matter as merely a scare campaign, the thing that really struck me, when I listened more attentively to the Assistant Treasurer, the member for Lindsay, was that he said there was a terrible pattern of deceit occurring here. He actually had the temerity to point the finger at this side of the chamber. He suggested that somehow this is an issue for us. I have three words for him: pot, kettle, black. If we want to talk about a pattern let us focus on the deceit that has been practised on the Australian people.


Let's first focus on the promise that has been made by the Treasurer to deliver next year a $1.5 billion surplus next year. In question time today, when the Treasurer was asked to guarantee this $1.5 billion surplus, he talked about it being simply an aspiration. If we want to talk about deceit, why is the Treasurer not prepared to guarantee this tiny hurdle that he set himself, of a $1.5 billion surplus? Why isn't he prepared to put his job on the line? Why isn't he prepared to resign if he does not meet this tiny target? Because he simply does not believe what he says. He is practising a cruel hoax on the people of Australia. The reason he cannot guarantee it, the reason he will not put his job on the line, is that he has a huge problem—a $120 billion black hole. If there is a pattern on the other side, it is a pattern of spending and taxing.


Today we heard from Standard & Poor's that in fact we can expect a $20 billion deficit next year. This comes off the back of a previous report released by Macroeconomics that said it would be $15 billion. It seems to be going up—it seems to be trending in the wrong direction. The reason the $120 billion is so important is that it is $20,000 for the average four-person Australian family. We know that this $120 billion is not simply a one-off. What the government are doing with all of their new spending announcements is locking in recurrent spending. Why do we care about that? We care because at some point someone is going to have to pay for it. Someone is going to have to pay for the big-spending announcements of the government that have not been funded, that are not accounted for in the budget.


Despite the fact that the Prime Minister made the claim that every time she made an announcement she would properly provide for that announcement, she has not done so on this occasion; nor has the Treasurer. We are simply told we have to wait for MYEFO when it is announced and simply trust the government that they will somehow account for this spending. Well, it is not just us who are concerned on this side of the chamber about the government's big spending announcements. In fact, there are many on the other side of the chamber who are concerned.


I read with great interest an article by Stephen Scott and Jessica Irvine in today's Courier Mail in Brisbane which said Labor backbenchers are urging the Gillard government to raise taxes and cut perks for high earners to ensure it can pay for big-spending promises. Labor is doing that because it knows that is the only way to fund its promises. It comes off the back of the concerns raised by five Labor backbenchers who yesterday tackled the Treasurer about government spending priorities and the ability to pay for those priorities. Who are these brave souls on the opposite side of the chamber? Who are these people who were sick of the culture of deceit in this government? They were Senator Doug Cameron, Ed Husic, Janelle Saffin, Kelvin Thomson and Jeff Lyons. They are the only people who are concerned about the future generations of Australians who will be forced to foot the bill for the spending announcements.


But why has it got such urgency today? It is because we also read that the government, on top of their billions of dollars of announcements to do with their dental scheme, their Gonski plan and the NDIS, is going to spend an extra $1.4 billion in paying off childcare workers. Why is it doing that? It is because it is a union demand. It is a demand by United Voice, which is a union, and, as was reported in the paper today, it is going to be paid by this government. They have not denied it. They are going to announce it because Julia Gillard is being forced to. In an article today it says she is being forced to shore up union support for her leadership. So when they talk about jobs on that side of the chamber, the only job they are really concerned about is Julia Gillard's job. The only job they are concerned about saving is Julia Gillard's. Julia Gillard says we have to wait for MYEFO, as does the Treasurer. We have to wait to understand how it is that they are going to fund this $120-billion black hole. They say we should trust them. If we were to trust the other side of the chamber, we would have believed them when they said this year they were going to deliver a deficit of only $12 billion. But that grew over an 18-month period from $12 billion to $23 billion to $37 billion and hit $44 billion. So how can we trust anything that the government has to say on this issue? How can we trust a Prime Minister who said in this term of parliament that she would throw open the curtains and let the sunshine in and yet, in response to this matter of public importance, we have not heard one word of detail from those opposite as to how their $120-billion black hole will be paid for? How can we trust a Prime Minister that only days before the last election promised that there would be no carbon tax are under the government she led? And she back flipped weeks later in order to do a dirty deal with the Greens so that she could form government.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  And keep her job.




Ms O'DWYER:
  And so she could keep her job, as pointed out by my colleague. We cannot trust this government. This $120-billion black hole comes at the worst possible time. It comes at a time in our domestic environment where we know the retail and manufacturing sectors are hurting. We know that families are under increased stress, that cost of living is one of the biggest issues that families are facing and that small businesses are finding it really tough.


We know that overseas the financial crisis has not passed. In fact, the financial crisis we see in Greece and in France has morphed into a social crisis. I note that we hear constant refrains from the other side that Australia is doing well when you compare us to France and when you compare us to Greece. But they only want to compare us to the worst-performing economies. They only ever want to make that comparison.


This $120-billion black hole comes at a time where commodity prices are down 30 per cent over a 12-month period. We are seeing a huge revenue shortfall because of that. We are seeing company tax receipts being reduced and yet the government continues to spend and refuses to say how it will be paid for. There is a better way. We know from experience that a coalition government can right the wrongs of an irresponsible Labor government. We did it before when we repaid $96 billion of debt. We left a surplus $20 billion and we provided for the future with $70 billion in the Future Fund. The government want to raid that future fund to pay for their spending. There is a better way and that is with the election of a coalition government. (Time expired)

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (19:00):  I have spoken numerous times in this House regarding the serious concerns that many in my electorate of Paterson have regarding the delivery of digital television access. Never has so little been done by so many at such expense to the taxpayer with so little outcome. This Labor government has spent millions upon millions of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars on countless glossy brochures and radio, newspaper and television adverts telling everyone to get digital ready. So we have had the spectre of many of my constituents buying digital televisions which they were not able to use, because most transmitters in my electorate of Paterson did not offer a digital signal or had very poor digital reception to say the least.


This Labor government promised through the Household Assistance Scheme that those on a pension, older Australians, veterans and people with disabilities or their carers would receive, according to the digital ready website, a high-definition set-top box, a demonstration of the new equipment and instructions on how to use it and a 12-month warranty, service and technical support. This was all at a cost to the taxpayer nearly double what Gerry Harvey said he could do the same job for. It has been more mismanagement and wasteful spending by an inept government.


This is a very serious matter. We are facing total digital conversion in Paterson by the end of November this year and many of those who were promised support through the Household Assistance Scheme have not heard anything from anyone, despite constant requests. Mrs Baker from Stroud relies on the analog self-help tower in Stroud. The Stroud tower was due to change to a digital signal in August, but that change has been put back to October. I have many elderly constituents living in Stroud who are entitled to the Household Assistance Scheme, but if the contractors do not install the relevant equipment in the next two weeks they will not have access to any television at all.


Mrs Sternbeck lives in Booral. Because the government through Regional Broadcasting Australia has decided not to upgrade the Booral tower to digital, its residents should be entitled to the Satellite Subsidy Scheme, which would give them access to Viewer Access Satellite Television, or VAST. However, when Booral residents contacted the Digital Ready hotline and the Department of Human Services, no-one there seemed to know when the existing analog tower would be switched off and their service delivered by satellite. More ineptitude!


The Duffys in Corlette are a stone's throw away from an existing tower at Gan Gan. However, as they are in the shadow of a hill they cannot receive reception from that digital tower and have to rely on the analog signal form the main Hunter transmitter at Mt Sugarloaf. They have been told that the analog signal from the Mt Sugarloaf transmitter will be switched off on 27 November and that the digital signal will not have the same footprint. Like the residents of Stroud, if the contractors from the Household Assistance Scheme do not visit their homes and install the digital set-top box by then they will be denied access to television reception.


This is a major issue throughout my electorate of Paterson. We know this government is good at making promises on infrastructure and other services. Remember the NBN, anyone? However, at least while people wait for the NBN—and that wait keeps getting longer and longer—they can still rely on existing internet services where they are available. If the government fails to contact soon those of my constituents who have been promised government assistance with the digital switchover, many are going to be denied access to TV.


The coalition has always said that the government should rethink its proposals to deliver digital television. I personally warned that it would have been better to spend the millions wasted on marketing the digital switchover; on investing in upgrading more, if not all, of the analog towers to digital in order to deliver the decent terrestrial TV service that the community quite rightly expects and deserves.


Labor continually talks a good game about looking after the less fortunate in our society—the elderly, the disabled, the lowest income earners, the battlers. However, it is its financial mismanagement and policy failures that affect those in the community who are most in need of our support. In particular, it affects those on a part pension or on as little as $30 less than the full annual pension, many of whom have now been left struggling to pay the costs of upgrading and have been offered no financial assistance by the government. It is these Australians whose major source of entertainment and news the government is now threatening to deny.


This is simply unacceptable. My constituents and I will not stand for it. We want our television signal, we want it now and we want it delivered properly and affordably through measures that should have been in place from day one. We do not want spending on glossy brochures and TV and radio ads promoting a digital ready program that is not working.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (09:30):  Army Cadets is a very important activity, which provides leadership, discipline and many other forms of valuable training and experience for young Australians. Army Cadets has a very important presence in my electorate of Bradfield. There are three cadet units in Bradfield: 226 Army Cadet Unit Normanhurst, which includes students from Turramurra High School, St Leo's Wahroonga and other schools in my electorate; Barker College Cadet Unit; and the Knox Cadet Unit, which, as well as the boys from Knox, also includes an encouraging recent development, the girls from Ravenswood.


In total there are over 1,000 cadets in my electorate of Bradfield. That makes a very significant proportion of the total number of army cadets around Australia of some 14,000. The cadets play an important role in the life of the electorate of Bradfield. One of the highlights of the year is the annual Knox Grammar School Anzac Day service, followed by a cadet parade on Knox 1, the school's oval. Unfortunately, these very worthwhile activities are under a considerable threat, thanks to budget cuts imposed by the Gillard government. The Gillard Labor government has made a decision to reduce the cadet forces allowance for staff from 48 days per year to just 33.5 days—a 30 per cent cut.


An internal Department of Defence memo makes it clear that Australian Army Cadets staff will have a reduced time frame to submit pay claims and that all regional and local activities, conferences and camps for cadets will be cut, along with access to ration packs for camp. These issues were first raised with me in a letter from Jack Dalton, a student at Turramurra High who participates in the 226 Normanhurst Army Cadet Unit, who wrote to me saying:


The reason I am writing to you is because of the issue 226 ACU faces with the Defence budget cuts. If these budget cuts go ahead, cadets around Australia will face cuts to their activities, like live shooting and general training.


He goes on to say:


I am basically asking you if there is any way that cadets would be able to avoid the budget cuts.


It is extraordinary that the Gillard government should mount this attack on an activity which is so worthwhile to the development of young Australians. Fourteen thousand cadets around Australia, including over 1,000 in my electorate of Bradfield, are going to have their access to this very worthwhile activity constrained and cut back, because of budget cuts imposed by the Gillard Labor government. I join with my constituent, Jack Dalton of Turramurra High School and 226 ACU Normanhurst, to ask: is there any way the cadets will be able to avoid the budget cuts? (Time expired)

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2012-09-19,"



Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10:00):  This issue is undoubtedly a contentious issue for a variety of reasons and for many people. There is nothing more iconic or symbolic than the institution of marriage. It means many things to many people and it has much associated with it. Yet for many people a sacramentalisation by religion. Some people associate marriage with that sense of the spiritual, the religious or the sacramental, depending on their theology and beliefs. Some of those people associate marriage with a spiritual dimension. And it means a great deal to them. I do not deny that for a moment. I recognise that basis in my own background and in my own socialisation as a Catholic, until I stopped being a practising Catholic. Indeed, I trained as a priest for a number of years as well and I have an abiding interest in the study of religion. I have been a chief examiner and a teacher of studies in religion for many, many years in the college system. So I have a great appreciation of the significance of marriage for people of a religious persuasion or belief. Many of those people live in my electorate and have contacted me. In the main, those people have asked that the law not change in its definition and its extent in our community. I fully acknowledge and respect their viewpoints.


On the other hand , of course, for many other people marriage is a secular institution. It is viewed and valued in different ways, but it is for many of those people a formal recognition of their relationship, a formal state recognition in the eyes of the community about the nature of their relationship. For many people it is also associated with the creation of a family and, in the main, is viewed as a relationship between a man and a woman. That, indeed, is the current definition as we understand the Marriage Act at the moment.


However, the institution itself is fundamentally, for me, a statement about relationships. There are many marriages that exist today very happily and that, of course, is a great testament to marriage as an institution and that formal recognition. There are many marriages that do not, for a variety of reasons, involve having children. The nature of that marriage is no less significant because they do not have children. So the institution itself is not necessarily for the creation of what we deem to be a family of mum, dad and children. Marriage is a formal recognition of the relationship between those two people. To me, marriage in our community has had an extraordinary history over time, as do most major social institutions. It has had a variety of meanings and functions, and they have been more traditionally different from how we understand it today.


Within marriage today and as it has evolved we talk about equality, partnerships and so forth. In other words, the individual has rights and their human rights are valued inside the institution which we call marriage. In our community it is, irrespective of how people may view it in terms of their personal values and beliefs, a secular, government recognised status. At the moment, that recognition is based on a gender relationship, and to me—and this is not easily arrived at—it is based on discriminating on gender. I believe that we as a community are evolving and working through our values system. I believe that the individual human rights of a person should not be discriminated against on the basis of their religious belief, on the basis of their gender, on the basis of their ethnicity or on the basis of their sexual preference. I do not believe that, if we change the act itself to allow people in same-sex relationships to adopt this iconic institution, it will affect the rights or status of opposite-sex couples in any sense. What it will do is include others who have been discriminated against in terms of being able to choose that institution, to be able to have formally recognised their relationship. I do not believe it affects one single religious belief in terms of those who regard a particular relationship as being unacceptable for whatever theological reason they may have. Those people will continue to hold those beliefs. This has nothing to do with that. People who find the relationships of same-sex couples to be unacceptable for a variety of reasons will continue to do so. No-one is forcing them to attend or be part of a marriage ceremony if two people decide they want to formally recognise their relationship. Nor will it require people who are of religious orders or have religious recognition and status to perform ceremonies or to perform marriages for same-sex couples, as it exists now for opposite-sex couples. So I do not believe the rights of other people and the values of other people are going to be affected at all by this decision to allow people who may wish to recognise their same-sex relationship to have it formally recognised in what is a secular, government recognised status.


I do appreciate that, like any major debate in our community, there are a variety of views on this. We move through these things; that is why we discuss, debate and, ultimately, legislate. The important thing about our legislation is that it is not so much that we have to grant a human right in this sense; we need to recognise and protect the human rights of everyone, and I believe that, at the moment, the Marriage Act discriminates against individuals and couples based on gender and sexual preference. I believe the law should change, and that is why I support this, but I do of course recognise the difficulty this presents for people who are opposed to it—I will be exercising my conscience vote in this—and the difficulty that is presented currently with the legislation for those people who want to formally recognise their relationship with their same-sex partner and their families. At the same time, I know all sides of the parliament were supportive of removing a lot of the discrimination and unfairness that was associated with same-sex relationships in terms of legal proceedings and other matters. I think it was something like 80 pieces of legislation in 2008 that were supported by the parliament. It was very significant. Indeed, that led to what some would regard as a reinstatement of fairness in recognising these relationships, but it is not a reinstatement and is certainly not an acceptance of equality. I believe that is what we need to recognise now and uphold, and that is why I will be supporting the legislation. Thank you very much.

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-09-19,"



Mr STEPHEN SMITH
 (Perth—Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (10:12):  I support the bill. I made this view clear at the most recent Australian Labor Party National Conference in December 2011. I expressed my view at the time that legislation, or the state in the guise of the Commonwealth parliament, should not stand between same-sex couples having equal access to marriage to reflect their lifelong partnership—a secure, stable long-term relationship. This was not always my view. Indeed, at the previous Australian Labor Party National Conference in 2009 I expressed a contrary view, what might be described as a traditional view. But I did take note on that occasion of the speech made to the conference by the now Minister for Finance and Deregulation. I said to her at that time that I had listened to her speech and this was something that I would have to think about. And I did. At the last national conference I made the remarks which I have referred to.


Australian society has changed dramatically at very many levels since I grew up as a young boy in country Western Australia and subsequently in Perth. I was born in the mid-1950s, and the generation of my mother and father, who were young men and women in the 1950s, essentially did what the current Commonwealth Marriage Act reflects. Young men and women of their generation got married, had children and set up the modern, post-World War II Australia. In 1961, the Commonwealth Marriage Act essentially took over the institution of marriage from the states, where there had been previous state legislation reflecting the institution of marriage. So, for men and women of the fifties, sixties and, indeed, the early seventies, this was the norm. De facto relationships between men and women were not recognised. On the contrary, they were either kept private or shunned. Same-sex relationships were kept very private, were shunned and same-sex relationships between men were serious criminal offences in every jurisdiction.


The first change to legislation and societal attitudes in the area of marriage came in the mid-1970s when this parliament in 1975 enacted the Family Law Act and for the first time bona fide, genuine de facto relationships between men and women were recognised as they should have been. That was deeply significant legislation passed by this House and the parliament. So for the first time, a very short period of time ago in an historical sense, bona fide domestic relationships between men and women which were not the subject of a ceremony—religious or otherwise—under the Marriage Act were recognised by the parliament and by the state. That enabled important rights and entitlements to flow as they did for couples who had had their relationship recognised under the Marriage Act. They went to rights of custody for children if the relationship broke down and to entitlements pursuant to maintenance and to estates in the aftermath of death of a partner.


We saw that substantial change in the 1970s. In the 1970s, but more particularly in the early to mid-1980s, through the Commonwealth parliament and state and territory parliaments—almost across the board—we saw the enactment of anti-discrimination and equal opportunity legislation. This effectively made it unlawful to discriminate against people on the basis of sex, gender, sexual preference, religion, ethnicity and the like. So the next substantial body of work done by this and other parliaments was to enshrine in Commonwealth, territory and state legislation the notion that people were equal before the law irrespective of sex, gender or sexual preference. In the course of the last two parliaments, led by then Attorney-General McClelland, we have seen substantial work done to remove the remnants of discrimination to same-sex couples who were disadvantaged by the failure to recognise a same-sex relationship. 


When you look at the change in Australian society—the sweep of legislative history at state, federal and territory levels—you see we are now in a position where effectively the capacity of a man and a woman to marry under the Commonwealth Marriage Act is respected and reflected. The capacity of a man and woman to be in a long-term relationship, a bona fide domestic relationship not reflected by the Marriage Act, is respected under the law where the same entitlements and rights accrue. Finally in respect of every area other than marriage itself there is a recognition by Commonwealth legislation that same-sex couples are not discriminated against for entitlements, benefits or their status.


Indeed, in the course of that sweep of legislation, we have also seen the removal from all of the state and territory jurisdictions of Criminal Code or criminal law provisions which made it a serous criminal offence for male homosexual conduct. Much earlier in my working life, I was very pleased as principal private secretary to the Attorney-General of Western Australia to strongly support the passage of private members' legislation through the Western Australian parliament to decriminalise homosexual activity or conduct.


One last area remains and that is: do we now as a modern, tolerant society accept people of the same sex who want to have their relationship recognised under Commonwealth law, who want to say, 'We are in a long-term, enduring loving partnership, we want our relationship recognised as well'? That is the issue which this piece of legislation confronts the House and the parliament with. The attitude and view that I express as a result of exercising my conscience—because this is, in my view, a conscience vote issue—is a view that I would not have expressed five or so years ago. Australian society has changed. We are a mature, tolerant society. This is a conscience vote because people form a view about this issue as a result of a belief strongly held. There may be a religious basis for that belief. There may be a cultural basis for that belief. In this area, everyone's view is entitled to be treated with respect and with dignity. The view that I have come to is that this parliament should recognise same-sex couples and allow them equal access to the institution of marriage.


This is an important piece of legislation. It comes before us as a private member's bill. It is not the first occasion either before this parliament or before state and territory parliaments that issues of this nature have been determined by a private member's bill where people have exercised their conscience. Like most members of this place, I have been the recipient of a wide variety of views expressed to me on the streets of Perth or through my electorate office. My own judgement is that the majority view, or the prevailing attitude, is that the parliament should allow equal access to marriage for same-sex couples. But I do not think we should determine it on the basis of a majority view; we should determine it on the basis of what we think is the right thing to do.


I think it is also the case that the absolute overwhelming view of young Australian men and women—teenagers and young adults—is that, frankly, they do not see what the problem is. They do not see what the fuss is about. They are living in a generation where they treat all of their colleagues and friends as equals, irrespective of sex, irrespective of gender, irrespective of sexual preference and irrespective of private and personal relationships. That reflects the changing Australia. We are a much more prosperous society than we were when my mother and father were raising a family in country Western Australia and in Perth.


For those reasons of conscience, it is appropriate that this parliament enacts this legislation to enable equality before the law not just for men and women but for men and men and women and women—same-sex couples who wish to have their relationship reflected by the status afforded under the Marriage Act of the Commonwealth.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2012-09-19,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (10:23):  Today I rise in this chamber to support marriage equality. I do so because I believe it is the right thing to do. It is the fair thing to do. All individuals are entitled to the right to participate fully in our society and to receive the support and protection of the law, regardless of their sexuality.


Let's be clear. The inequality and the intolerance that many lesbians and gay men face will not immediately stop if this bill is passed. No law can deliver that. It will take time to pull down the prejudices that have built up over time. What laws can do is remove institutional injustice. That is what gays and lesbians face today.


This bill will also send an important message. It sends an important message about acceptance of individuals in our society, regardless of their sexuality. There are many young people right now struggling to come to terms with their sexuality. There has been too much tragedy in the past as a result of issues relating to discrimination. Indeed, a failure by society to offer full acceptance has led at times to people being less than frank—often with themselves, let alone with the people around them—about their sexual orientation, with consequences as a result of that.


We need to send a message that it is surely a basic right for each of us to be able to marry the person that we love. I fail to see how the institution of marriage is weakened if more people have the right to participate in it. My view on this comes down, essentially, to one fundamental disagreement with those who will not support this legislation, and that is that giving one group of people the rights that they have been denied in any way diminishes the rights that currently exist for the rest of us.


That is why I have been fighting for equality for same-sex couples ever since I was elected to federal parliament 16½ years ago. Indeed, fighting for equality is what led me to join the great Australian Labor Party more than 30 years ago. I am proud that Labor governments were the ones to decriminalise homosexuality. Labor governments were the ones that had the courage to confront the deadly HIV-AIDS epidemic and set an example for the rest of the world. Labor governments were the ones to advance same-sex adoption. On each of those occasions there were people of goodwill across the political spectrum who supported equality, and I know that there are many people in the coalition who would like to vote for this legislation but who will not be able to. I think that contrasts with the leadership that has been shown by Barry O'Farrell, the New South Wales Premier, in acknowledging the importance of a conscience vote on this issue in the New South Wales parliament.


When I first arrived in this place in my first term of parliament, I moved the same-sex superannuation legislation to remove discrimination when it came to superannuation. At that time, that was seen as a radical piece of legislation. I had to re-introduce it time after time. There was no debate allocated in the chamber, and a number of times it lapsed—just a short period of time when we look at the extent of the human condition. That legislation, coupled with another 84 pieces of legislation, passed this parliament without opposition during the last term of parliament. Eighty-four pieces of legislation to remove discrimination: it went from being an issue of controversy to an issue which was essentially had a consensus in this parliament. That, to me, is indicative of the way in which society does move forward on issues, not just in terms of equality for people regardless of their sexual preference but on race and gender issues as well. We as a society, particularly under liberal democracies such as we cherish here in Australia, are moving forward to embrace diversity and difference and to respect people on that basis. So I have no doubt that in the near future the removal of this final frontier of discrimination will occur. And then I think people will recognise immediately afterwards that the sky has not fallen, that people have not suddenly changed their sexual orientation as a result of that legislation and that the institution of marriage has in fact been strengthened by the fact that more people are prepared to engage in an institution which celebrates lifelong commitments between two people who love each other. That is what we are talking about with this legislation here.


I very much respect the views of colleagues who disagree with me on this issue. I respect their right to say it and to participate in this debate in a constructive way. I must say that I do not respect some of the views that have been expressed that promote intolerance and reinforce prejudice, and I know that people across the political spectrum in this parliament will agree with me on that. I think that, regardless of what position people will take on this final legislation, overwhelmingly this debate has been constructive, and I congratulate the member for Throsby on his initiative in putting forward this legislation. I say also to those people who support this legislation that we need to be inclusive in the way that we conduct ourselves in this debate. We should be tolerant in the way that we conduct ourselves in this debate. We cannot argue that we are about inclusiveness if we do not act that way ourselves, because I believe that this change is coming, just as we have removed other areas of discrimination in a range of areas. I come down to a fundamental view: that extending the right of marriage to same-sex couples in no way detracts from the rights of marriage that heterosexual couples currently enjoy. I have had the opportunity to be married. I see no reason why someone who happens to want to marry someone of the same sex rather than the opposite sex should not have the same right that I enjoyed.


I also think that in this debate we need to be very careful about the nature of all of our relationships. As someone who was raised by a single mother, I say that those people who speak about the family unit as if they know exactly what is right, to the exclusion of other family relationships, need to think very carefully about the messages that they send to families who are not nuclear in their composition. I was in a two-person family. It was a loving family, and my mother gave me everything that a parent could give their child. Some of the views that have been promoted in this debate question that when they question the diversity that exists in our society.


The fact is that Australia is moving forward on these issues. Most of us have siblings, children, neighbours, friends or work colleagues who happen to be gay or lesbian. It is a simple fact of life. The way that Australians deal with it is just to get on with it, treating each other with respect and as equals. We should not pretend that marriage is an unchanging institution that has been around forever, because it has not. It has evolved just as relationships evolved, just as society evolved. Today we recognise that couples in de facto relationships should have the same rights as married couples. That was not the case a few years ago. Our values and our relationships have evolved and they will continue to do so.


Many relationships, both heterosexual and homosexual, are committed, loving relationships. It is not up to me to judge whether a relationship between a man and a woman is more important, more significant or more loving than a relationship between a man and another man or between a woman and another woman. We do not know what goes on inside relationships. Surely people recognise that life is more complex than that.


We need to face up to the realities of modern Australia. We need to have faith in our fellow Australians wherever they might live. We should have faith that Australians can and have overcome prejudice, intolerance and injustice. Importantly, we should have faith that members of this parliament can make the decision to vote for or against this bill for themselves, which is why I supported this being a conscience vote issue at the ALP national conference—a position that put me in some disagreement with some of my colleagues. I argued that consistently. I argued for equality consistently. I am very pleased to be able to support this legislation, which will be voted on today in the House of Representatives. I look forward to the day when legislation similar to this is passed and discrimination is removed.

"Oakeshott, Robert, MP",Ind.,2012-09-19,"



Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (10:38):  I have listened closely to all speakers in this debate. I have been challenged by and thought deeply on the many issues involved in this topic. I have talked as widely as possible with the full spectrum of representatives of various views in this debate as well as the many within the community who remain relatively neutral on this topic. Of all topics before this House in my four years in this place, this one challenges my view of representation more than all others. I have previously very clearly stated that my view of representation is not to run with the populist mood of the moment, that that is to break the social contract with electors; instead it is very much the Burkean model in his letter to the electors of Bristol, and that is to uphold the social contract with electors by doing your homework, by listening to all the views and then, ultimately, by making a conclusion and representing that conclusion that you think is right for community and country. This one tests that model of representation more than any other because there are some very strongly held views in this debate from most of those who care either for the continuation of the Marriage Act as amended in the mid-2000s or for change to remove any gender-specific reference. At the heart of the conflict I face are a range of issues on both sides and then some conclusions. First, in conversations with representatives from various churches, I have disagreed that a literal reading of the Bible being against homosexuality should be the basis of our view today. I do not think that reflects Australia today, and neither does it reflect the many valuable contributions made by many who on that literal reading should not be participating in society at all. So I disagree with that very strict, literal reading of certain sections of the Bible.


I also sometimes see people trying to build a case that all of this, with change, is somehow going to be compulsory. None of this is compulsory. It is not compulsory who you fall in love with and it is not compulsory for any organisation to marry anyone they do not voluntarily want to. So all of what we are talking about in this debate today is of a voluntary nature. No-one is forced to do anything they do not want to do either as an individual or as an organisation.


I also reflect on some of the debate around health and prevention, particularly from the aspect of a regional member of parliament facing issues of suicide in his electorate. For many regional teenagers this is an incredibly difficult issue to deal with. The arguments that I have seen emerge over the last week or two—trying to build a case that there is lower life expectancy for those who are gay compared with those who are not—is,  in my view, actually an argument to expand the bond of love rather than contract it. So it is an argument which has assisted me in drawing some conclusions, particularly from the perspective of a regional MP and particularly, out of all the health profession measures, from the perspective of the issue of youth suicide in regional communities such as mine.


There is also an opportunity in this debate to dispel some other myths about regional Australia. This is not an issue owned by Sydney and Melbourne—and throw in a bit of Brisbane! This is an issue owned by all Australians. On the mid-North Coast of New South Wales we have a very large gay and lesbian community, many of whom play really valuable roles in our community and are engaged in many aspects of community life. Rather than dismissing them or putting them in some sort of corner as a sector that we accept but on other occasions deny, I say on behalf of the mid-North Coast—not on behalf of this Marriage Act debate but on behalf of the community—to anyone of any sexual orientation: you are welcome members of our community so long as you contribute. That is the condition of entry to the mid-North Coast of New South Wales: you participate in community life and you contribute to building a better place. I would hope the majority view is one like mine—that, frankly, I do not give a stuff what you do in your bedroom. That is your business, just as it is my business as an individual, as a father and as a member of parliament what I do in my bedroom.


That gets me onto the issue of the role of the state. This is not an issue I campaigned on in any of the last five elections I have been involved in. So, as a member of parliament, I do feel a bit blindsided by the debate before this chamber over the last couple of years, but I am big enough and ugly enough to deal with it. I will ultimately make a yes or no decision. In thinking this through over the last couple of years, it has become increasingly obvious to me that, from my perspective, this is less an issue of gender in the Marriage Act and more an issue of: what the hell is the state doing in this space anyway? 


Why is the state involved in the bedroom and in love and in relationships at all? I particularly note a recent article by Michael Sexton, the Solicitor-General in New South Wales, who made exactly that point. I know it is not going to happen today, but I even find myself—for the first time, I think—agreeing with the Institute of Public Affairs on this topic that the role of the state in love is a questionable one.


There is a second option of finding a way for state governments, with the powers that they have, to take a lead on this. I note what New South Wales is doing today. I note the debate that is happening in Tasmania. But I also hope that, wherever all these four bills before the House at the moment end up, we not only reflect on gender in the Marriage Act but also reflect on the role of the state. Can we do better in capturing the bond of love and the building of community in a better way than providing boundaries in a Commonwealth piece of legislation? I have frankly been surprised that the Commonwealth is in my bedroom. I did not know that. I had not really thought about it. The more I think about it, the more I am surprised by it.


Having said that, I also think there are some contradictions in the position that the Commonwealth is taking and the role of the state. I go back to the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011, one of the hotter debates of last year. I invite people to go and look at the definition of marriage in a completely different piece of legislation and see that it is really business as normal in this parliamentary process. The definition of marriage in legislation that was passed last year is: 'Marriage includes people who live together in a relationship as a couple on a genuinely domestic basis, even where they are not legally married.' So, even in the run of business in this place already, we are already defining marriage as a relationship between 'a couple who live in a genuinely domestic relationship', and decoupling this issue of legal marriage. It sounds oxymoronic, but that is what we have been doing for at least a year, and there is an example of a piece of legislation where we have done it.


The other point I would like to make is a personal one. I am in a loving marriage with someone of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent. For me: no big deal. And, I would hope, for most Australians: no big deal. But in reading and thinking about this issue over the last couple of years, there was a time in Australian history where I could not have expressed that love and got married to my wife. That is a shocker. I therefore am exposed if I do anything other than reflect that same principle for others in their relationships. If they fall in love with someone and their love is not reflected in law, they quite rightly should and could feel exactly as I would: that that is a shocker. So that is a personal reflection from me that helps drive my considerations. In the final couple of minutes I have to speak in this debate, I will put my worries on the table. I have spoken of the sentiments that lead me to take a position that this issue of equality is really a bit of a no-brainer. My worries are more about the process issues, that we are using this parliament to address traditions and norms that can and could be addressed in other ways, and the strategic questions. I worry that we have four bills before this chamber. I worry that there is a vote in the Senate today that may be close and that we have the Leader of the House saying that we are going to go for it today in the House of Reps and more than likely it is going to have a grand loss. I worry about what the strategies of the political parties are behind why we have got four bills. We have the bipartisanship you have when you don't have bipartisanship. If we do this, it has got to be as seamless and as bipartisan as possible, and it has got to stick, because I also worry that we still have not heard whether, if this change were made, it would be a weapon of campaigns in the future and we will then have the Marriage Act coming before this House to be changed with changes of government. It would help me a lot, and I know it would help many people, to have clarity, particularly from the Liberal-National Party, on whether this change, if it happens either in this parliament or in the future, is change that will stay or whether we are going to revisit debates from 2006 and see a reinsertion of gender. That concerns me greatly.


I worry that we are rushing this at a time when, only today, New South Wales has made some pretty significant moves. I would prefer to see the detail of that and to watch that process unfold, as with the situation in Tasmania as well. I also worry that, regardless of what we do, this is going down the road to the High Court. One way or the other, where this really should have been to start with, prior to 2006, is in a legal definition based on legal precedent of that word 'marriage' in the Australian Constitution. From my reading of several key cases, they were slowly defining and redefining what that word meant. In my view it would have been preferable for that process to continue to unfold. What we are seeing today is a natural response by politicians to an incursion by politicians in 2006. I think that is unfortunate. I therefore worry that we are just heading to the High Court regardless of what we do. So more than likely, based on that conflict, I will support this legislation. But that is conditional: I hope there is commitment to cleaning up processes and cleaning up strategy. I know this is looking more like a statement today than anything else. I am in the business of getting wins and results, and if we are serious about that we have got more work to do.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-09-19,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (10:53):  I will be summing up the debate on the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012. I will start by thanking the many members who have contributed to this debate, at times a passionate debate and a very personal debate, as it often is in this space. The contribution from the member for Lyne typifies the quality of contributions we have had in this chamber. I listened very carefully to the member for Lyne's contribution. Many of the points that he raised have been raised by other speakers in this debate, and through the course of my summing-up I will reflect upon some of those.


The Leader of the House, the member for Grayndler, in his contribution made the point that the change that we seek to occur will require a respectful debate within the parliament and within the community, a debate that brings people along with us and does not seek to isolate and alienate. I concur with those observations. In fact, when I first spoke on this matter in the House when a private member's motion came before the House last year, I said that if change were to occur it would not occur because of some mad dash to the finish line because some member of this place seeks to own the cause to the exclusion of all others for party or other reasons. That is the very nature of this parliament; if we are able to get any change then we need more votes than can be mustered by any one party that sits in the House. So a mad dash to the finish line will not achieve the results that we seek.


The case for the bill is simple. It is about equality, it is about recognition of relationships—the validation of those relationships—and it is about saying to people who are often excluded, alienated or discriminated against: 'You know what? You are okay. What's more, you are better than okay: your relationship is just as valid as mine is in my marriage to my wife. And if you seek to have that relationship described as a marriage and recognised by the state as a marriage then who are we to stand in your way?' As I said when I introduced this bill, I firmly believe that God made us all equal but different—not differently equal. If this bill is passed into the law, it will ensure that this House recognises that we are equal but different, not differently equal, when it comes to marriage and the recognition of our relationships.


Can I say a few words about the objections that have been raised within this debate? The first objection springs from what I can only describe as some religious or theological objection. I have listened very carefully to all of the constituents who have come through my door and said that, essentially, to bring this bill forward and to vote in favour of this bill is an affront to their religion. Can I say that the objection that they have is not to the bill? It is not to marriage equality; it is to the relationship itself. As many, many speakers have said in this debate, I respect your right to hold that view, but it is another thing entirely to ask the state to enforce it. We have moved on as a society; we no longer believe, as some may hold, that to be gay is somehow wrong, an aberration or a sin. I do not believe that, and I was brought up in a very strong Catholic family; if we demurred from any of the theology of the Catholic Church it was on this one issue, that we do not believe that to be gay is an affront to God and that it is not a sin. So, as much as I might respect people's right to hold that view, we cannot make our laws based on what I believe to be a wrong.


The second objection I summarise as this: to change the law in the way that I propose to change the law is somehow an affront to the tradition of marriage. As many, many speakers have said—and as the member for Lyne quite eloquently just said in his contribution—the institution of marriage has changed in many, many ways over the last 100 years and over the last several centuries. The member for Lyne would have been unable to marry his wife in many states in Australia if he had met her 80 years ago and sought to marry her, because the laws of Australia at that point in time did not allow or recognise the marriage between a white Australian and an Australian who is an Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander. The laws of marriage once recognised the institution of betrothal, where a father or brother could betroth their daughter or sister as if she were some kind of property, ensuring that she could be married against her will. In some countries this practice still goes on. We do not recognise that in this country.


I can only imagine, Deputy Speaker—and I know that you are about to get married at some stage in the next few months—the response that I would have received if, in the preparation for my marriage, I asked my wife in the recitation of our marriage vows that she would honour and obey me, let alone submit to me. I can inform the House that I would not be married today and that marriage of 13 of years or more would not have occurred if that had been insisted on in my marriage rites. Dowry, inter-race marriages—there are so many examples that we can all draw upon to prove the point that marriage is a sacred institution but it is not immutable. It has changed in many, many ways over the centuries.


The third objection that I want to address goes to the issue of the separation of church and state. In summary, this objection is that the state has no right to interfere with or legislate in the area of religious rites. I think the best statement on this was made by Jesus Christ himself in that very famous dictum on the relationship between church and state: 'Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's.' There is nothing that we are seeking to do in this private member's bill which would force a religious institution, a priest, a preacher or a church to solemnise a marriage where the solemnisation of that marriage is a breach of their religious beliefs. In fact, we are quite clear in this bill that there will be no requirement for a religious minister to solemnise such a marriage. What we are saying, however, is that we recognise the rights of churches to hold these beliefs and to practise their rites of marriage, as different as they may be in all the different churches and religious institutions in this country, but we as a government are not going to enforce those religious beliefs by the exclusion of one type of relationship from the definition of 'marriage'. In summary, we will render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's. The state reserves for itself the right to recognise the marriages that it believes are in keeping with the norms of Australian society, without in any way interfering with the rights of religious institutions to practise their freedom of religion.


The fourth and final objection that has come up within both the parliamentary and extraparliamentary debate is what can best be described as a 'slippery slope' argument. Upon this argument, the contributions quite frankly have at times been quite ridiculous: the idea that if we make this change, which might on its face seem reasonable to its proponents and those who are swinging, we open the floodgates to recognition of all sorts of relationships as marriages—not just between man and woman but between human beings and non-human beings, as I have heard in another debate. Frankly, that is just a ridiculous proposition that no normal, right-thinking person would proffer in the course of a serious debate. But, to the extent that there is a feeling within the community that they might accept this change but for the fact that it might lead to something else that they do not support, I make this point: the ultimate bulwark between that which is acceptable and that which is not acceptable is the Parliament of Australia, which is founded upon the principle that we seek to represent the common sense of the great Australian people. I have great faith in the common sense of the great Australian people—perhaps more faith than many of those who proffer some of these ridiculous arguments.


I believe that views on this particular issue, marriage equality, have changed over the course of this debate but also over the course of the last few years, and the polling reflects that. In 2004, Newspoll conducted an extensive survey in which they found that at that point in time only 38 per cent of Australians supported marriage equality and same-sex marriages. If we wind the clock forward some seven years we find that, in 2011 when the Nielsen polling organisation conducted an extensive poll in the lead-up to the Australian Labor Party's national conference, in excess of 62 per cent of people polled said they do support same-sex marriage. So we can see that over a relatively short period of time in the history of this Federation opinions have changed. As Australians have focused upon the issues, focused upon the debates and looked at the objections, they have come to the conclusion that there is no reasonable objection to parliament moving to recognise marriages between same-sex couples.


I have no doubt that the majority of Australians are either not that focused on the issue or, to the extent that they are focused on it, they support it. I have no doubt about that. Against that backdrop, it disappoints me that we may not have enough votes in this parliament to reflect that view of the Australian people. As the member for Lyne has just said, perhaps it will take a new parliament to see a change to the definition of marriage in the Marriage Act. While the campaign for marriage equality has been won in the community it may not have yet been won in this parliament.


The debate has been interesting, and it has been a quality debate in this chamber. Over 40 members of the House have spoken on it, and roughly half of those are in favour of the private member's bill. I have had the time to examine some of the speeches of cabinet ministers who have spoken on the bill. I believe it is true to say that all of them have spoken in favour of this bill, so the bill has support in high places. 


I believe that at some point in the next 10 years Australians are going to look back on this debate, perhaps as they attend a marriage between same-sex couples who are their friends, their sons, their daughters or their cousins—their relationships—and will wonder what all the fuss was about. I know that this change will occur within my lifetime. I hope that I am surprised when we vote upon this issue and the matter comes before the House. I hope that I am surprised, but at this point in time I do not think I will be. 


So, in that vein I note that in the chamber today there are representatives of PFLAG, the Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, who have run a tremendous campaign, and representatives from Australian Marriage Equality as well. If we do not get enough votes in the parliament to get this changed after today, can I say in the words of a great Australian, 'Maintain your rage,' because this change will indeed come.



There is much more that could be said in this debate but I hope that I have fairly and reasonably summed up the debate, both the objections and the counter-objections to the proposition before the House. I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2012-09-19,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (11:09):  Today I wish to highlight the achievements of athletes from my seat of Forrest who competed at the London Olympics. I congratulate each and every one of our athletes right across Australia. I recognise their hard work, their dedication, the countless hours on the road, the endless training sessions, the personal discipline, the sacrifice and passion to represent their country. Being selected to compete at the Olympics is a just reward for all of the athletes efforts.


Forrest is a regional and rural electorate of 12,500 square kilometres at least two or three plus hours from Perth itself, depending on where the athlete lives. For some of the athletes and their families it is hundreds of kilometres from top-level competition. What our athletes know is that the only way they can achieve in their athletic development, whether it is at a state, national or international level, is with the support of their equally dedicated families, their local communities, the veritable army of volunteers who run the sporting clubs and organisations, and their coaches. People need this level of support to help them fulfil their Olympic dreams. 


For instance, dual Olympic basketballer Mark Worthington grew up in Australind just north of Bunbury. The 203-centimetre forward debuted in the green and gold in 2005 and has been in teams which have won two world championships and a Commonwealth games. The Boomers enjoyed several wins in London, including a thriller against the more fancied Russian team. They were eventually knocked out, despite a valiant effort against the USA Dream Team. Anybody who watched that game would understand when I say it was a valiant effort. It was the second time in a row that Australia had finished amongst the top eight teams in the Olympics. Throughout his career Mark has been strongly supported by his parents, Greg and Treena, his brother Trent, his sister Kate and of course his wife. South West Slammers coach Steve Hawkins has also played a pivotal role in Mark's career.


The south-west provided two Hockeyroos in the London Olympics, Kobie McGurk and Jayde Taylor. Kobie McGurk is from Collie and was competing in her second Olympics. Like most talented young athletes, Kobie shone in several sports before she focused on hockey. She has earned her reputation as one of the toughest defenders in the world. Kobie played in the final of the World Cup in Argentina in 2006. She won gold at the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne in 2006, and has over 100 international caps. But none of this has come easily for Kobie. Like a lot of athletes Kobie has had to overcome injury and disappointment during her career. I acknowledge the determination and toughness that Kobie has shown to achieve at the highest level. 


After five years on the national development squad, Jayde Taylor was making her last bid for Hockeyroo selection when she broke into the team two years ago. This was her Olympic debut. She had won a gold medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games and, with her 25 international caps, Jayde is recognised for her intellect and composure in defence—critical if you are in a defensive position, certainly in hockey. 


Lauren Reynolds originally came from the Bunbury BMX Club and was an inaugural South West Academy of Sport scholarship holder. Lauren actually found out she was going to the Olympics on the day she celebrated her 21st birthday. What a great present for a 21st birthday. It followed her continued success as an elite BMX rider which saw her finish in 2011 as Australia's top ranked female and in the top 10 in the world. The BMX events at the Olympics drew plenty of spectator interest and packed crowds saw Reynolds qualify ninth fastest in the trials. She unfortunately crashed out of contention but she was giving it her all in her third semi-final. What a great effort.


Bunbury's Alex Hagan was also an inaugural scholarship holder of the South West Academy of Sport. At the age of 21 Alex was one of the youngest members of the women's eight rowing team which came from nowhere in the qualifying regatta to book their spot at the Olympics. We all remember that. Alex had set her sights on rowing at the Rio de Janeiro games in 2016. The team and crew was put together only just months before the qualifying events for London. They basically thought they were not going to get to these Olympics in London and she was focusing on 2016. Next thing, the team was off to London. The team won the qualifying event and reached the final. What a great effort for such a recently formed team.


Chair of the South West Academy of Sport, Don Punch, CEO Bernice Butlion and the board were all really proud of both of these athletes for their selection in the Olympic team and they are equally proud of the support and the part the academy has played in providing real practical support for both of these young south-west Olympians. It is a real feather in the cap for everyone. Also competing at his first Olympics was Scott Sunderland from Busselton and the South West Cycle Club. He was a member of the men's three-man indoor cycling team sprint. His Olympics followed a world championship win with the team in Melbourne earlier this year in April. In a sport which is decided by thousandths of a second, his team came fourth to Germany in a bronze-medal ride-off.


We had Margaret River based archer Taylor Worth. He was Australia's only male archer competing in London. He had to overcome injury—like I said, so many of our athletes have so much to overcome—in 2010 to win the national championship. He was crowned the Australian Archer of the Year and has won a Commonwealth Games gold medal and a US Open individual gold medal. In London, Taylor was able to dispatch the world No. 1 when he stormed through to the final 16. The 21-year-old, who was ranked 44 in the world, had his dream ended by a Chinese competitor in a one-arrow tiebreaker. What a way to end your campaign!


In concluding, I want to mention our most prolific medal winner across both of the games: our middle-distance track Paralympian Brad Scott from Eaton. Brad was competing at his second Paralympics and won a silver medal in the 1,500 metres and a bronze medal in the 800 metres. I can see the members around the room smiling at this achievement. You would understand exactly what this means. Brad was also a silver medallist at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics and a silver medallist at the IPC Athletics World Championships. I know Brad is looking forward to competing in the 2016 games in Rio, and he told me even prior to going to London that his goal was to get to the gold medal position. He is going to continue his very strong competition with one of the athletes who continues to get the better of him. Brad will not give up and has promised to bring his medals in to show me. I cannot wait to hear what Brad has to say about his experiences in London. I am really looking forward to that.


The outstanding commitment to excellence shown by all of our athletes and their continuing goals, whether they are personal or team performances, are things all of us in this place admire and congratulate. We recognise and respect that. Their feats and endeavours have inspired people in their home towns—the little towns around my electorate. They watch the Olympics and the young children—and even those of us of a more mature age—are wishing that it was us out there. Whether it is athletics, cycling or any other form of athletic competition at the games, we are with our athletes the whole time and we celebrate with them. We understand and share their frustrations but we never question their commitment. We certainly know what can be achieved by their discipline and sacrifice, and they always give over and above.


The athletes are also the biggest endorsement for sporting participation, particularly in regional areas. As athletes have often said themselves, they have been lifted up on their journey with help from the parents and the people involved in grassroots sporting clubs, the hard yards when they are just young athletes, the people who come out in the rain and in the sun, and of course their parents, who initially are the encouragement. They encourage their children into sport. They are involved with their children's sports. They are mum and dad taxis. Day in and day out they do not complain. They want to give their children the best opportunity they can. 


In my part of the world, as the children develop they become owned by the community as well as the parents, and everybody shares in what they do and achieve and shares in the disappointments. We see that constantly. We see parents who become drivers and personal coaches, who wave flags behind the goalposts and who help with injury recovery. The clubs that provide our children with sporting opportunities are only made possible by the dedicated countless hours of volunteering to the clubs from coaching and training to just washing the jumpers. Even if it is cutting oranges, no job is too big or too small.


I really want to thank and acknowledge all of those who support every athlete across this nation, not just our Olympians but even the little kids who are just having a lot of fun and who are inspired by those of our athletes like our Olympians who compete at the highest level. Above all, I hope the joy of sport and the opportunity for a happy, healthy pursuit encourages all of us to continue to enjoy sport in this nation. I salute all of our Olympic athletes.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (11:20):  The Illawarra region is a nursery for great sporting champions, including Olympic champions. I would like to take the opportunity today to extend my congratulations to one local champion: local kayaking champion and gold medallist Dave Smith, a member of the Australian men's K4 team that claimed gold in the 1,000-metre final by more than half a boat length. Dave is a resident of Warilla, which is a suburb of my electorate of Throsby in New South Wales, and is now fondly referred to by locals as the Warilla Wonder after the fantastic effort he displayed at the London games. It was a victory that was all the more sweet, I am sure, after narrowly missing out on a medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. As Dave says, 'A few years and memories have been erased.'


There was little doubt in the minds of the Illawarra locals that Dave and the team would achieve gold in London. He is a natural athlete. He started competing at little nippers at Warilla surf club at the age of six and was achieving success in surf-lifesaving, iron man and kayaking competitions at a national level by the age of 14. In 2001 he was named Shellharbour Junior Sports Star of the Year and went on to represent New South Wales in the Australian titles, placing first in the under-19s double ski in 2003.


By this stage it was clear that Dave was destined for bigger and better things and he got this chance in 2004 when he was selected to represent Australia at the junior world cup regatta, finishing just outside the medals in both the K1 and K4 1,000-metre events. He bounced back in 2006 at the Australian championships, winning the K2 1,000 metres and winning again in 2007 and 2008 in the K4 events. In fact, Dave is part of the current national championship team after winning his fourth overall title and third K4 in the event earlier this year. He has already achieved more than most of us back home could ever dream and we could not be more proud of him. I am sure I am not alone in my anticipation of the 2016 games, where we will have the great opportunity to cheer our local hero, the Warilla Wonder, to another golden victory.


Dave's contributions to the Olympics are well celebrated, but there are many other people from the Illawarra that I would like to make mention of. They are the people who form the teams and also the people who give up their own time go to referee in some of these Olympic events, and I pay tribute at this moment to their contributions as well.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (11:23):  I rise to acknowledge the great triumph of one of the golden girls of the Gold Coast, a local resident of Helensvale and a resident of the fighting electorate of Fadden: Sally Pearson. Sally, of course, won gold with a new Olympic record time of 12.35 seconds in the hurdles, beating American Dawn Harper, with 12.37—two-hundredths of a second—and Kelly Wells, with 12.48 seconds, both personal bests. It is an outstanding result from a young girl who has worked so hard through her life. Many may not realise it, but Sally was raised by single mum Anne, who worked her guts out—worked two jobs—just to make enough money to support her daughter's athletic career. She attended Helensvale State High School, where my wife was a teacher, and was part of their excellence in sport program. It is a great program that the school runs to identify, encourage and support high-quality, high-calibre athletes.


While still in primary school and just eight years of age Sally's talents were noticed by Sharon Hannan, who remains her coach today. Sally rose to prominence in 2001, 14 years old, when she won the Australian under-20 100-metre title. She made her debut at the 2003 World Youth Championships in Canada, and won gold in the 100-metre hurdles.


At the beginning of the following athletics season after the 2010 Commonwealth Games, she became the first Australian woman ever to win three national titles at the same event since Pam Kilborn did so back in 1968 when she won the 100 metres, the 200 metres and 100-metre hurdles. In November 2011 the International Association of Athletics Federations awarded Sally Pearson the 2011 Athlete of the Year. She is the first Australian to receive this award, and she also received prize money of $98,800. I think this is fabulous from the girl who battled with her single mum so that she could run.


Coming into the 2012 London Olympics for the 100-metre hurdles she had won 32 races from a staggering 34 starts. She led the competition after round 1 heats, and led coming into the final with a semi-final time of 12.39. And, of course, she has the new Olympic record of 12.35.


Sally embodies all that is great about the human spirit and all that is great about sport, not only as an equaliser but as an opportunity to rise above your odds. It does not matter how you were born or where you were born; the circumstances you come from are not limiting—we only limit ourselves. What matters is how we finish: that is, how we run, and that is how we race—the manner and spirit in which we race. And it is the dignity and the humility in which we accept victory. I think Sally embodies all of that and more. She is truly a great Australian and worthy of special recognition and notice in the House of Representatives this morning.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (11:26):  The London Olympic Games of 2012 will live for a long time in our collective memories. At a time of conflict, and with economies in peril, Great Britain set aside these trials and was heroically triumphant in the face of doubters. It showed the world that there is much to celebrate.


For the first time in Olympic history women were included in every team, with three nations including female athletes for the very first time. Women competed more widely than ever before. Countries that have endured conflict in recent times found teams and joined the rest of the world to play games and to engage with each other. At the height of its conflict and all of the misery that battle delivers so cruelly and indiscriminately, Syria found 10 athletes from seven disciplines and transported them from war to participate in the enduring goal of the Olympic movement of building friendship and understanding through sporting engagement.


London, which has so often been the beacon of light in world leadership in dark times, shed its burdens and lifted the British spirit. The British people, reinvigorated, can now face adversity with new energy and optimism to triumph. And there we were, Australia, a small country whose national character is so defined by our love of sports. This is born from playing and competing, and the recognition of those who excel from our midst—those greats who we uphold as an ideal reflection of us. It is our sporting heroes who we hold up the highest: the Don, Evonne, Phar Lap, Rosewall, Elliott, Murray Rose and so many more maintain that special place in Australia's heart. How is it possible for leaders like Menzies, Chifley, Hollows or Howard to compare?


How do other countries define their greatness or national character? Where do Winston Churchill or Francis Drake sit with their great footballer, Stanley Matthews, or their three-time Wimbledon winner, Fred Perry, or Roger Bannister, the first man to break four minutes? The US is defined more by Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, John Kennedy and Martin Luther King than Mickey Mantle, Jesse Owens or Babe Ruth. Yes, more than anything else we hold our sporting greats in the highest esteem.


However, just as the official creed extols participation, the most important thing in the Olympic Games has been the underlying benefits to our society that most justify our fascination with sport. We have learned that nothing comes without hard work. The messages of sportsmanship: playing the rules, health, mateship, teamwork, responsibility for your actions and the flow-on of benefits from social interaction have been the values that serve as the bedrock from where our greats have come. Through endless competitions we have learnt that victory is a fleeting thing, and that when you lose there will always be another day.


This is the school that produces our best sports people, our nation's most esteemed representatives. During the two weeks of the Olympic Games we saw a man with no legs run, women compete in their hijabs and small island nations triumph over superpowers. The world took time out to marvel at athletes who could transform into an art form a sport that is so difficult just to play. In these two weeks that happen every four years the world becomes a better place. Our athletes who have participated with us and excelled at local levels, then state level, and now as national representatives have been worthy and a true reflection of us. They have trained hard, completed with their all, and displayed the full range of emotions that is normal when so much effort has been invested and the final result must be accepted. Win or lose, modest in victory or not, graceful in defeat or not, they have been our chosen representatives—a reflection of us and of our society. We should be proud of our representatives and the role they have played in making our world a better place through this sporting engagement.


Anyone who judges our participation in these Olympics by the medal count does not understand the true value of sport or the great Olympic movement. In these statements we celebrate 410 Australian athletes who went to London, from 16-year-old Brittany Broben to the slightly less young Mary Hanna, and from those who faltered at the first heat to those who sang our anthem on the dais. We applaud and thank every parent, carer and friend who has been an orange cutter, weekend taxi driver, amateur referee or coach, or just provided a clean pair of socks—you are all part of the Olympic team that we celebrate today. 


The energy gained from those athletes and those great two weeks in London reinvigorated all of us for the Paralympic Games that started two weeks later. It is with some amusement that I note Channel 4's billboard advertisement placed next to London Olympic Stadium after the closing ceremony, which simply read, 'Thanks for the warm-up.' The world's Paralympic athletes certainly delivered, displaying superhuman abilities as they inspired all with the manner in which they have successfully overcome life's toughest challenges. There is no more powerful symbol of the importance of participation than the sight of Paralympic athletes achieving such incredible feats of strength, fitness, skill and endurance. For these athletes, their journey to London is surely the greatest achievement, and the rest is, more or less, just a game.


Over 300 Australians represented us and made us proud, just as those 410 Olympians did in the prior games. As policymakers, we can only hope that the achievements of all of our Olympic and Paralympic heroes can drive us all, across all generations, towards the enduring benefits of participation and to those core values that have made our sportspeople most esteemed of all Australians. More than any gold, silver or bronze, this is the goal of our nation's representatives and is, in fact, our greatest sporting achievement.

Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (11:32):  I join with others to honour the contribution of all those who represented our country at the London Olympic Games. Every four years, as we know, the world stops to look in awe and to watch in wonder at the athletic achievements of those who meet in the modern Olympics. But, as others have said, it is not just about the question of those who win medals. One of the great things about the Olympics is the fact that it brings the world together in peace to celebrate the very best aspects of the human spirit. When we look at that and we look at the question of the athletes and their achievements, we ought to focus on the fact that that is what it is about: it is about competing, it is about doing your best and it is about being part of a great international event.


The dedication of athletes in terms of the sacrifice that they make at a personal level in order to be able to get to the Olympics is absolutely phenomenal, and we know that many have given up so much in order that they can be there once every four years. But we also know that it is not just about the athletes; it is also about their families, the volunteers who are involved in local sporting clubs, those who take the invidious role of being an official, which often puts them into a difficult situation for those who are competing, and those who are administrators. All of them are part of that broader Olympic family. All of them are part of that great tradition that comes together every four years. In the sacrifice that is made by families—whether it be playing the taxi service, getting up at ungodly hours to assist those getting ready to train, or dealing with the bruises that come from getting out there and doing it as hard as you can—there is much to remember and it is not just about what happens on the day. But what happens on the day is the focus when you get to the Olympics. Frankly, we can be very proud of the efforts of those who represented our country on this occasion. Many won medals. Many made finals. Many did their very best, and that is what it is all about.


The nature of those competitions is that it is small countries; it is big countries; it is everybody out there having a go; and in all circumstances our people did the best that they could, and that best was very good. They were great representatives of Australia and also great representatives of local communities throughout this country—local communities who are justifiably proud. They are in themselves as Olympians very much seen to be representatives of the very best that people should aspire to; in that way they are role models for their broader community, and most have most definitely been role models of great significance.


As others have mentioned, following on from the Olympics was the Paralympics. The Paralympians are in so many ways absolutely inspiring—often dealing with disabilities of a significant nature, but who are prepared to do everything they can to prove that they can be everything that they can be. Their achievements were phenomenal. Their example is exemplary. We all salute them for their efforts and for their struggle. So to all those involved in the Olympics and the Paralympics I say: well done. Your achievements are significant. You ought to be very proud. We are very proud of you.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2012-09-19,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (11:36):  Earlier this week I had the opportunity to congratulate our Australian Paralympic team for their success in this chamber. Now we have the opportunity to congratulate our Australian Olympic team. One of our greatest Australian athletes, Herb Elliott, once said:


It is the inspiration of the Olympic Games that drives people not only to compete but to improve, and to bring lasting spiritual and moral benefits to the athlete and inspiration to those lucky enough to witness the athletic dedication.


We have certainly witnessed our athletes' dedication during the London Olympic Games and, regardless of whether or not they won, it is their passion and courage that inspires us all to work hard to achieve our dreams.


I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate two of my constituents: Samantha Reid from Tanah Merah and Lyndsie Fogarty from Shailer Park for their outstanding contribution to the London Olympic Games. Samantha Reid was part of the Australian Olympic team that secured sixth place at the Spanish open synchronised swimming competition in Madrid in July. They had hoped for a similar result, a top-six position at the London Olympics; however, they were not as successful as they hoped and unfortunately finished last in the technical routine and in the free routine. But it is not so much where they finished as the fact that they got out there, competed and did their best on the day. It was a great achievement to have been selected to represent our nation in synchronised swimming, and I am very proud of her efforts.


Lyndsie Fogarty, a local kayaker, won bronze in the K4 500-metre sprint event at the Beijing Olympics; however, she just missed out at this year's London Games. It was a fantastic achievement to have made the semifinals in the K4 500-metre sprint and to have placed fourth in the B final of the K2 500-metre events.


Kimberley Park State School—one of the schools in my electorate—would be very proud of their former student Mitchell Watt, who is considered one of Logan's greatest success stories at the games. Mitchell Watt jumped 8.16 metres in the long jump to secure silver at the games, which was a welcome addition to the overall performance of our track and field athletes.


A few weeks ago I attended a welcome home ceremony for the Gold Coast Olympians. My electorate covers parts of both the Logan City Council and the Gold Coast City Council, and I felt very honoured to have been invited to attend the ceremony. From just going around the room and meeting those Olympians, I know we are certainly blessed as a community but more so as a nation, by the wonderful and talented athletes in Logan and the Gold Coast. As a nation we tend to pose huge expectations on our Olympians and, despite not winning the official medal tally for the London Olympic Games, there is always a way to celebrate the success of our Olympic team. 


In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald, statistician Brian Dawes formulated the only true and just statistical representation of Olympic medal performance. Dawes calls it the MAP methodology:


Based on a crafty combination of medals won, athletes in your team and your country's population, I am pleased to advise that the real winner of the London Olympics is Australia!


Using the formula of medals won multiplied by athletes in your team divided by home count population, here are the top four: Australia 632, Great Britain 565, Hungary 268 and Russia 250. Team USA only scored 175 and China only 23. However, as the founder of the International Olympic Committee Pierre de Coubertin once said:


The important thing in life is not victory but combat; it is not to have vanquished but to have fought well.


There are a number of ways to look at our success in the London Olympic Games, but I believe that the real winners are those who dedicate so much of their time to their sport, to being good role models for our younger generations and to being great ambassadors for our country. The satisfaction of inspiring others to live their dreams and represent this country at an international level is, in itself, worth its weight in gold, medal or no medal.


Later in the year I will be holding a ceremony for our local sporting champions. I will be congratulating young sporting champions such as Rachael Harcombe, Gemma Brinkman, Jack Goodsell, Blake Cearns, Skye Nicolson, Nevyn Livingstone, Angela Beard, Lizaya Iti, Samuel Jones, Joshua Tierney, Jake Greusmuhl, Tamara Tisdall, Jake Otago, Nicolas Preston-Smith, Frederyk Woodhouse and the Sarah Atkins Netball team. Each time I meet one of these aspiring young sportsmen or sportswomen, I believe in their ability to be the best they can be. These are young men and women who are already competing at a state or national level in their chosen sport and may very well be our future Olympians. I say well done to the Australian Olympic team and I wish all the best for those who aspire to take part in the next Olympic Games in Rio in Brazil in four years' time.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2012-09-19,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (11:42):  I would like to join in congratulating those Australian athletes who brought great honour to our country by their success at the Olympics and the Paralympics. To win an Olympic gold medal or for that matter any medal is a crowning achievement of a sporting life. All of the athletes who succeed at international level have worked for decades to develop their talent and have reached the pinnacle of their sport. The Paralympics results were an extraordinary success for our country. Our fifth place in the Paralympics erased some of the disappointment that was around about Australia achieving only tenth place on the medal tally at the Olympics. However, it needs to be acknowledged that in most sports Australia achieved around expectations.


Our tenth was certainly a credible result, but it was not up to Australia's previous achievements and there has been some criticism and soul-searching about why Australia's performances were below our expectation. Of course, there should be. It is appropriate that after a major event of this nature we look at how we can do better. There has been criticism of coaches and funding—that there was not enough funding, that there were too many officials there, there was too much hype and perhaps even unjustified expectations. One constituent wrote to me, drawing attention to the fact that we do not provide substantial financial rewards to our successful athletes. This person drew attention to Singapore, where apparently there is a $1 million reward offered to anyone who can win a gold medal. To be fair, Singapore has never won a gold medal in Olympic history and so I guess for them it would be a special prize, but it also demonstrates that money is not what delivers sporting success—it is dedication and commitment.


It is appropriate that there be a thorough examination of how our team was prepared, what our reasonable expectations for the future are, if the level of funding is appropriate and what we need to do to make sure we do as well as we can at the next Olympics. We have a tradition of excellence in sport and our achievements on the sporting field very much inspire our country. Those results are just as important to us as succeeding in business or economics—if we do well on the sports field we feel proud of ourselves as a nation.


Perhaps we need to look more fundamentally at why there was some disappointment with our Olympic results. I would like to read an extract from a letter to the editor in my local newspaper from a Mr Phil Enright from River Heads. He said:


The sad fact is that for decades, our nation has been losing its work ethic and intensity, instead placing the weight of expectation on our athletes to produce gold at the Olympics so we may continue to delude ourselves we are a nation of hard-working, high achievers—the opposite of whom we have become. 


I suggest our athletes' achievements reflect our own more than we might like to admit. 


If we want our athletes to commit intensely to a work ethic of excellence and high achievement, we must commit to those values as a nation. We must stop championing mediocrity, rewarding any 'achievement', and the view of entitlement that we can be guaranteed the things we want, just because we are fortunate to be born in the lucky country. 


The Olympic Games is a great leveller, and a reminder that spin is no substitute for serious commitment. 


The answer is not more money but the right values and the leadership to commit to them as a nation …


Mr Enright has made a very powerful point. If we want to be critical of our athletes, perhaps we also ought to look at ourselves. Our lifestyle has changed in quite dramatic ways over the years. Perhaps the major Olympic disappointment was our results in the swimming pool. Swimming is a sport which requires an enormous commitment, and not just from the athletes who participate; many of them begin their swimming careers at a very young age and they depend on their parents to take them to the pool to train before dawn every day. It is a huge commitment, not just from teenagers and children but also from their parents. In this day and age, many families are two-income families, and there are fly-in fly-out parents. Children spend a lot of time in childcare centres and after-school care and do not have parents available to drive them to the pool or who have time to take them to competitions. Then there are the costs to be met in the early years before they might qualify for sponsorship. It is a fact that our lifestyle is changing our commitment to sport, and if we want to criticise our athletes I think we need also to look at ourselves and our lifestyle.


There are real issues confronting our sporting community. We can be very proud of our athletes, who have represented us with great distinction. In reviewing our athletes' performance we need to remember the enormous personal commitment that they have made in a changing world, when it is a lot harder to make that commitment than it might have been in previous times. I congratulate those whose success brought honour to our country at the Olympics and the Paralympics, and we wish them well for the future.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-09-19,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (11:49):  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on this, our parliament's recognition of our athletes' tremendous performance at the Olympics. I, like many Australians, was astounded by how good these Olympics were. I give full credit to the UK and London for hosting a tremendous games from the very start. The opening ceremony was one of the best opening ceremonies you could ever have witnessed, demonstrating the full breadth of creativity and ingenuity within the London organising committee and within the UK. It was just tremendous to see them put on that opening ceremony.


I had an opportunity to see Lord Coe when he was here in Australia. He visited Parliament House and gave an update to parliamentarians on the progress of the games, and he has been here a number of times. He is a truly impressive individual and deserves full credit for how well those games went. He is a fantastic individual. I do not think there has been an Olympic Games in living memory where there has not been something that has potentially been a dark cloud on the horizon. It really is a test of how you recover from that, and certainly I thought Lord Coe managed it magnificently and was able to demonstrate that these are not insurmountable hurdles; they are things that you just have to deal with and move on from.


So it certainly was a pleasure to be able to see over the course of those great days back in July and August how well the games were run. In particular, they gave a platform and venue for our athletes to shine. I want to pick up on the comments from the member for Wide Bay, because it was a subject of discussion about our performance relative to years gone past. This is a discussion that could have changed in a nanosecond. In some cases the difference between gold and silver—and that is what we are talking about here—was only a matter of milliseconds. But those milliseconds need to be taken in the context of the huge amount of time that our athletes dedicate—not just themselves and the people around them but their families too—to ensuring that they are at their peak performance. It is a huge contribution that is made.


Like other members who have spoken through this debate, I also want to celebrate some achievements of locals who have been able to participate in these games. In particular, I want to talk about Olympian Beki Lee from Mount Druitt, in the electorate of Chifley. She is 25 and grew up in Mount Druitt. She smashed her personal best at the London Games. Then, on top of that—you could not get any better—she accepted a marriage proposal to boot from her boyfriend, Dan Smith, at the finish line. So it was a fantastic string of events for her. As an Indigenous woman representing Australia at the games, she occupies a special place in the hearts of many, particularly in my electorate, where so many people are proud of their Aboriginal ancestry and history. It was just fantastic to see how well she did at these games and particularly all the things that she can look forward to in married life. Beki had identified with former Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman as someone who had inspired her, and now she will in her own way inspire others to do great things. So congratulations from all the residents of the Chifley electorate to Beki and Dan on their future life together.


I would not be able to speak in this special moment within parliament without recognising the efforts in a sport that I have a particular passion for, basketball. Both the Boomers and the Opals in these games were up against exceptionally tough competitors but excelled themselves magnificently. I want to quickly run through, in particular, some of the efforts of both teams, the Boomers and the Opals. The Boomers in the end went down to Team USA, the Dream Team, the team that Kobe Bryant said would have bested the 1992 team, the original Dream Team. I think there is a degree of merit in Kobe Bryant's sentiments there, though I have to say that at the time I was a bit sceptical. But the Boomers held their own against the team that had devastated so many other national teams. The undefeated Americans led through the course of the game, but the Boomers kept going. In particular, in the second half there was some inspiring play from 'Patty' Mills, an Indigenous player who has been a representative of our country in the NBA in America, playing for Portland, and who shows the world how good the depth of talent is in the Australian basketball community. Patty Mills, I might add, had the opportunity to meet President Obama last year and, on walking towards him, President Obama exclaimed, 'Now this is a man with speed!' So even President Obama has recognised the explosive talent Patty Mills has. And it is not just talent that is directed on the court but talent that is mindful of what needs to be done in the community. Patty Mills is an absolute role model for others in the community, and he is trying to be a role model not just for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids across the country but also for those who want to follow in his footsteps in the game of basketball.


While they went down to the US, we saw some fantastic games from the Boomers. In the game with Great Britain, Patty Mills scored 39 points. There were some tough games against Spain. The Boomers won in an upset against Russia, a team that, particularly in Andrei Kirilenko, had some pretty seasoned athletes. Then they went on to face some pretty tough talent in the US team.


The Boomers have a stack of great players but I want to point out in particular the efforts of an up-and-comer in Matthew Dellavedova, who is the next great thing on the horizon for Australian basketball. He plays in college basketball in the States. I saw him play in the qualifiers against New Zealand. He has incredible defensive skills, being able to shut down opponents, and he stepped up in the Olympics. The great thing about the Olympics is that they give players the opportunity to shine at unexpected moments, and he certainly took up that opportunity. Coach Brett Brown is an assistant coach in the NBA in America, with the San Antonio Spurs, so again we have Australians excelling over there in one of the prime basketball competitions in the world. We need to thank Brett Brown for all his efforts with the team.


I have a soft spot for the Opals, as many people do. We saw Lauren Jackson rightfully being the flag bearer for our Olympic team in the opening ceremony. She is humble off court but a fierce competitor on court. Lauren Jackson has been recognised as one of the world's best players. She hit the record books by breaking the Olympic scoring record for women's basketball. She hit a jumper, with three minutes 46 remaining, in the team's win over China that gave her an impressive 536 points scored in Olympics, one more than former Brazilian star Janeth Arcain in her Olympic total. Lauren Jackson finished London on a 575-career-point high. That is a tremendous recognition of effort. We saw another up-and-comer in Liz Cambage, who has played for Tulsa in the WNBA in America and has come back to Australia to play with Bulleen. She became the first woman in an Olympic event to slam dunk, causing a sensation by doing so. She has just celebrated her 21st birthday and has a huge future ahead of her.


In that talented Opals team I want to pay particular attention to coach Carrie Graf. In Australia, she coaches the Canberra Capitals and has been tremendous in guiding the women's team. I have huge admiration and respect for her. She is not afraid to make some tough calls, particularly when she feels that players could be doing better. That is a sign of a true leader. I want to congratulate her and the Opals on the way they have performed.


While the Boomers and the Opals did not get to where they wanted to, they held their heads up high on the world stage. It is worth noting that in a sport that is No. 2 globally, played in 213 countries, we are in the top three. Within Australia a million men and women play the game, and they would all be proud to see the way our national team performed. While talking about the Olympics here I cannot overlook the performance of two special Paralympians that I am exceptionally proud of, and I think a lot of others would share the sentiment. I know we did have an opportunity to talk about the Paralympics earlier but I want to make special reference to these two people as I did not have an opportunity to speak in that earlier debate. In particular, I want to recognise Kylie Gauci from Rooty Hill. Kylie was on the Aussie Gliders women's basketball team in the Paralympics. They went down in the gold medal match. They claimed the silver against Germany, and Kylie was an inspiration for the Gliders. She led the scoring charge with 15 points and five assists, and through Twitter she was getting a lot of feedback from excited fans about her efforts over there. She was an absolute credit to us and I am looking forward to catching up with Kylie on her return and personally congratulating her for her efforts with that team.


The Rollers, the men's basketball team, also went down but charged all the way through the competition. Again, they can also hold their heads up high. It is worth noting that here in Australia we have both the National Wheelchair Basketball League and the women's WMBL. The National Wheelchair Basketball League has been going for quarter of a century, and the women's competition for 13 years. They have become an incubator for the Rollers and Glider players, and they have strong state and national programs providing young athletes with access to expert coaching and training facilities. I just want to give a shout out to both the Rollers and the Gliders for making us all proud of their incredible efforts.


The final person I want to recognise is someone that I have had a lot to do with, and whom I think is an absolute credit to not only the local community but also to our nation, and that is Jayme Richardson-Paris, a cyclist from Quakers Hill. I got to see a truly moving video of Jayme. Her first moments of life were some of her most challenging. She really had to put on a brave battle to be able to get through. Her family rallied around her and have been a constant source of support. She won bronze in these Paralympics after getting into the sport, from my recollection, only in 2004. She was able to show with determination matched with her own innate skill how far she could go. She is a graduate of the Doonside Technology High School. She went back to her high school and I was able to be there with her back in late July before she set off for London. She attended Doonside Technology High from 2002 until 2008. Jayme was born with Cerebellar Ataxia which is a disorder that basically impacts on the coordination, balance and eye movements. She is able to overcome that and participate in cycling in a way that stands her in fantastic stead. She suffered a bout of ataxia during her first two laps at the velodrome, which sent her arms into uncontrollable spasms and shook the bike, but again, demonstrating that fighting ability, she overcame that and went on to take bronze in the C1. This is someone who broke her second C1 world record in as many races with a time of 40.476 seconds. She was recently married to her husband Ashley, and her family and all her supporters have been just overwhelmed by her successes. I would like to give the chamber a sense of the humility of this athlete.


 She thanked her fans, in the local Blacktown Advocate, for all the support she received. I would like to read her moving comments into the Hansard:


'I can't wait to get home so I can share it with all of you and don't forget it's not my medal or my result, it's our medal and our results,' she said.


'It's Blacktown's, it Woodcroft Plaza's, it's everyone I run into in Blacktown Westpoint, it's all my nan's friends at the Blacktown Workers, it's Doonside High School's, it's Jasper Road's, it's postcode 2763.'


She is just a truly humble athlete. Again, a lot of our athletes are so humble and so willing to give of themselves, but they are also fierce competitors, showing the rest of the world that the Australian teams and athletes who play on the world stage cannot be taken for granted, because they have such a huge fighting spirit.


I commend all the athletes for their efforts. I want to pay particular attention to their families and friends, who also give of themselves, and while they might not be on the podium they have a right to share in that success.

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2012-09-19,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (12:05):  Briefly, I would like to add my comments on the 2012 Olympic Games to the record. First of all, I would like to congratulate the City of London on the fantastic job that they did of hosting the event. Second, I want to speak about the efforts of our Olympians generally. A lot was said about their results, and I found myself wondering how a result that is a fraction of a second slower than the gold medal performance can be seen as a failure. When you get that close to being the best in the world, everyone should be very proud. In general terms, I think the Olympics are great for not only Australian pride but also highlighting the importance of sport and an active lifestyle. So I compliment the team on that.


But what I really want to speak about today is someone from the Parkes electorate, a young man that I know personally—a young Aboriginal man from Moree by the name of Cameron Hammond. Cameron Hammond is one of the most respectful, polite and inspiring young men that I have had the opportunity to meet. He is a boxer in the welterweight division and competed in that division in London. Cameron started his boxing career in Moree. I would also like to pay tribute to his coach, Danny Cheetham, who has mentored and trained Cameron—and Cameron actually lived in Danny's home for a lot of that time. He has been a real inspiration to Cameron, I know. Cameron has spent quite a bit of time at the Australian Institute of Sport as well.


As a son of Moree Cameron has made the entire community incredibly proud. Indeed, yesterday, students from Moree East Public School were in Parliament House, and they were telling me how proud they were that one of their number was an Olympian. Through Cameron's efforts, these young people can see that it does not matter where you grow up or in what circumstances; if you apply yourself, if you set goals for yourself and if you work hard, you can mix it with the best in the world.


Cameron won his first fight, defeating Nigerian boxer Moustapha Abdoulaye Hima 13-6 in his preliminary round on day 2 of the London Olympics. In the next round, he faced up to Canadian Custio Clayton but was unfortunately defeated 14-11 in that bout. But I think what really sums up Cameron are some of the messages he posted on his Facebook page—he is one of my Facebook friends—after that loss, and I will read out a couple. He wrote: 


Well I lost my fight :( Sorry everyone! He was a good fighter, very strong. No excuses about the loss. But I made the top 16 in the world and now I'm an Olympian for life. It definitely has been the best experience of my life. So proud to represent my country and my culture at the Olympics. Thank you so much to everyone that has been supporting me yous have been great. Can't wait to see you all when I get back to Australia. Now just go and enjoy London and do some sight seeing.


And a couple of days later:


Well, that's it. The Olympics are finished! It's a little emotional :(


I enjoyed myself here, had so much fun. Proud to be here representing my country and culture. Gotta say the opening and closing ceremony were amazing! I didn't get a medal like I wanted to but I tried my best. London Olympics 2012 was the best experience of my life so thank you to everyone that helped and supported me. Leaving tonight and will be back in Australia Wednesday!


Olympian for life :)


I think that sums up the Olympic spirit. Cameron Hammond, who grew up on the streets of Moree and is a fine young man, has had the experience of his life. I think, with Cameron's case, that the Olympics is the start of Cameron's career and not the finish.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (12:10):  I rise today to speak on behalf of the Ryan electorate in congratulating the Australian Olympic team on their success at the recent London Olympic Games.


London was an ideal host city for the 2012 Olympic Games, with well-equipped venues for the world's best athletes and fantastic weather for the competition. I join with the member for Chifley, who commented on the outstanding organisation led by Lord Sebastian Coe, who was not only a great organiser but also a great ambassador for the Olympics.


We should all be very proud of each and every one of Australia's athletes and their efforts in London. As a combined team they delivered seven gold medals, 16 silver medals and 12 bronze medals, ensuring that Australia finished 10th out of 204 nations. This is a wonderful achievement for our nation—particularly given some of the other top 10 countries, including the host nation and the traditional powerhouses of the United States of America, Russia and China.


I would like to take this opportunity to recognise some of the outstanding athletes from the Ryan electorate who contributed to our successful Olympic campaign. In fact, the Ryan electorate added seven medals to Australia's haul. Cate Campbell was part of the golden 4 x 100-metre freestyle relay team. Fellow swimmer Christian Sprenger brought home silver in the men's 100-metre breast stroke and was also a member of the winning men's 4 x 100 medley relay team. I recently saw Christian's mother, Sharon, at the Brookfield Uniting Church community market's day. Understandably, she was very proud and delighted with her son's success.


Another teammate of Christian's is Bronte Barratt, who took out bronze in the 200-metre women's freestyle and who was a member of the women's 4 x 200-metre freestyle relay, which was awarded silver. Sophie Smith and Bronwen Knox were members of the women's water polo team, which took out bronze, and meanwhile, Mitchell Watt took out silver in the long jump.


I would also like to congratulate Mitch Larkin, who was a finalist in the men's 200-metre backstroke, and our young canoeists Alex Haase and Jake Donaghey, who made the men's canoe double C2 100-metre final. Alex is trained by Mr Kevin Crisp, who has been coaching canoeists at Nudgee Junior College in Ryan and other young people around Brisbane for many years.


I am also pleased to recognise a number of athletes from the Ryan electorate who took on the world's best in their chosen fields at the Olympics. Track cyclist Michael Hepburn, diver James Connor, swimmer Kenrick Monk, synchronised swimmer Francesca Owen, volleyball player Andrew Grant, and water polo player Rhys Howden. We are all extremely proud of these athletes, and on behalf of the entire Ryan electorate I congratulate them on their outstanding efforts at this year's Olympic Games and wish them well in the lead-up to Rio 2016.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (12:13):  Naturally, I would like to congratulate all the winners of the Australian medals and say how well our Australian team did. However, at the end of the day, the true Olympic spirit is not about winning, nor is it about medal tallies. The Olympic Games Charter states that the Olympics are:


… a philosophy of life, exalting and combining in a balanced whole the qualities of body, will and mind. Blending sport with culture and education, Olympism seeks to create a way of life based on the joy of effort, the educational value of good example and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles.


The charter continues:


The goal of Olympism is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man, with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity.


Therefore, for me the true inspiration that embodies the ideal and the meaning behind the Olympic charter is not that of Usain Bolt, nor Michael Phelps, nor Sally Pearson, nor any of the other Australian medal winners. For me the true inspiration that embodies the ideal behind the meaning of the Olympic charter at the summer 2012 Olympic Games is Oscar Pistorius, the blade runner, the man who became the first amputee runner to compete at the Olympic Games alongside able-bodied athletes.


Oscar Pistorius was born on 22 November 1986 in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a congenital absence of the fibula in both legs. When he was just 11 months old both his legs were amputated halfway between his knees and his ankles. Pistorius credits his late mother, who died at the age of 42 when he was just 15 years old, as a major influence on his life. Before his mother died she gave him a letter she had written just before the amputation of his lower legs when he was only 11 months old, for him to read later in life as an adult. The letter stated, and these are words that we should all learn from: 'The real loser is never the person who crosses the finishing line last. The real loser is the person who sits on the side, the person who does not even try to compete.'


For Pistorius, his Olympic appearance was the culmination of years of fighting just to compete. Pistorius not only had to overcome the disability of having both legs amputated; he also had to fight the bureaucracy of the International Association of Athletics Federations to have the simple right to compete against able-bodied athletes. In 2007 the International Association of Athletics Federations banned Pistorius from competing in able-bodied competitions. But Pistorius did not take no for an answer and he pursued them all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, simply seeking the opportunity to compete.


For any able-bodied person who has played any sport, the notion that a man without legs could have some type of advantage over his able-bodied rivals to compete is an affront to our common sense. A man without legs does not have the muscles to explode out of the starting block at the same rate as other runners, and a man without legs cannot lean forward and run aerodynamically, as other runners can, due to the fact that his artificial legs force him to stand more upright. But thankfully common sense prevailed and Pistorius was successful in his appeal. He won his legal battle against the sport's ruling body in 2008, after the court of arbitration ruled his carbon fibre blades did not give him any unfair advantage.


Pistorius is quoted as saying of his legal battle for the simple right to compete:


My focus throughout this appeal has been to ensure that disabled athletes be given the chance to compete and compete fairly with able-bodied athletes.


Having won that battle, Pistorius's next battle was to train, to try and achieve the qualification standard for the games and be selected for the South African team. History shows he was successful in that.


For the record, Pistorius competed in the 2012 London Olympics and in the first heat of the 400 metres he finished second with a time of 45.44 seconds, his personal best for the season, and advanced to the semifinals. In the semifinals he finished eighth and last. He was also a member of the South African four by 400 metres relay team, an event in which he eventually finished eighth out of a field of nine in the final on 10 August, with Pistorius running the final leg in 45.9 seconds.


Although Pistorius did not even look like winning a medal, he achieved something far, far more important. He lifted the aspirations of tens of thousands of disabled sportsmen, and that is enough to assure him his place in Olympic history. His continued advocacy for disabled people by setting the example and showing that anything is possible will no doubt help inspire children that through sheer grit and determination they can turn any disadvantage into an opportunity. But his message is also for us all. When we are faced with any adversity, through hard work, sheer grit and determination we can overcome significant odds. To the extent that the Olympics are about showing the world what a human being is capable of and that as humans we will not accept limits, that extraordinary athlete Oscar Pistorius was the true giant of the London Olympics.

Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (12:19):  I rise also to pay tribute to the 410 talented and committed members of the Australian 2012 London Olympics team. I would also like to thank the families, the coaches, the volunteers and the team staff for their commitment and support of our outstanding Olympians. The calibre of our Australian Olympic athletes, coupled with their attitude and excellent sportsmanship, makes me proud to be Australian. The Northern Territory—which I talk about quite often in here; in fact, every time I speak I talk about the Northern Territory—has an excellent track record when it comes to sporting ability and we have a solid history of producing Olympic athletes. I would like to share some of the previous Olympic talent that we have had from the Northern Territory.


Our very first Olympian was the late Michael Ah Matt, who was selected to play basketball for Australia at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964 and, again, in Mexico in 1968. Michael was the first Indigenous person to represent Australia and was deservedly inducted into the Australian Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010—

Mrs GRIGGS:
  As I was saying, Darwin born softball catcher Kerry Dienelt trained at the Northern Territory Institute of Sport before she went on to captain the Australian women's softball team, which claimed bronze at both the Atlanta and Sydney Olympics. Then there was Darwin born Frank Farina, who was selected to play soccer for Australia at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. Then we have Darwin born and Northern Territory Institute of Sport trained swimmer Ian Vander-Wal, who was selected as part of the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games team.


Silver and bronze medallist swimmer Geoff Huegill was born in Nhulunbuy and has represented Australia at two Olympics Games. Darwin born and dual gold medallist cyclist Graeme Brown also represented Australia and the Northern Territory at the 2000, 2004 and 2008 Olympics. Shot-putter Justin Anlezark, who was born in Katherine, was selected for the Australian Olympic team in 2000, 2004 and 2008.


At Sydney's 2000 Olympics, the Northern Territory was extremely proud to have three representatives selected for the Australian Olympic team in the men's boxing: Darwin born Paul Miller, Alice Springs born James Swan and Northern Territory Institute of Sport trained Henry Collins. Pistol shooter Christine Trefry trained at the Northern Territory Institute of Sport before she also went on to represent Australia at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.


Further to the previous athletes I mentioned that have represented not only the Northern Territory but Australia at Olympic level, there is no doubt that in the Northern Territory the most successful sport of all at the Olympic level is hockey. Australia has been represented in hockey by numerous Northern Territory athletes, including: Stephen Holt, who won bronze in the Sydney 2000 Olympics; Mark Hickman, who won gold at the Athens Olympics in 2004; Des Abbott, who won bronze in the Beijing 2008 Olympics; and of course no-one can forget Nova Peris, who was the first Aboriginal Australian and Northern Territory athlete to win an Olympic gold medal. Nova did this at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and then, amazingly, in 1997 she changed to athletics and went on to be one of only a handful of Australian athletes to compete in two different sports at the Olympic level, making it into the 400-metre semi-final at the Sydney 2000 Olympics.


As you can see, the Northern Territory has a strong history of elite sporting talent, a solid legacy for our future athletes to follow. Our involvement in the 2012 London Olympics was quite modest. All Northern Territory residents were delighted that we were to have cousins Des Abbott and Joel Carroll selected to represent Australia in the men's hockey team. Unfortunately, Des was ruled out of the squad before the Games due to a knee injury. Joel, however, went on to win bronze when the Kookaburras downed Great Britain 3-1 in the bronze medal play-off. The pair now have matching bronze medals.


The Northern Territory would also like to claim success in the pool with Katherine-born swimmer Leisel Jones, who has become a well-known Olympic icon. London was Leisel's fourth Olympic Games, having previously competed in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 Games. Leisel has made the Northern Territory, Australia and me personally proud, being rewarded for her dedication and winning three gold medals during her career as well as a silver medal in the recent London Olympics.


2011 Tour de France winner Cadel Evans, like Leisel Jones, was born in Katherine. The London Olympics was the fourth time he had been selected to represent Australia. First selected in 1996 and 2000 to represent Australia in the men's mountain bike cross-country, Cadel moved to the men's road racing and was chosen to represent Australia in 2008 and 2012. Unfortunately, Cadel had to withdraw from the men's time trial only days before the competition due to illness, but there is no doubt of the athlete's elite level of performance and achievements so far.


It is not only our Northern Territory athletes that I wish to congratulate today. I am in awe of our entire Australian Olympic team and would like to thank each and every one of them and their families for their dedication and determination, and for the sacrifices they have made during their sporting careers. No-one can deny it is an amazing achievement and an absolute honour to represent your country. Everyone acknowledges that it is not all about the medals; and while it may be disappointing for the members themselves that many of our talented team did not win a medal, they must know that all Australians are extremely proud of each and every one of our Olympic athletes and that we are grateful for the way that they proudly represented their country.


I would like to acknowledge our medal winning Olympians. Gold medals were won by Sally Pearson, women's 100-metre hurdles; Jacob Clear, Tate Smith, David Smith and Murray Stewart; Anne Meares; Mathew Belcher and Malcolm Page; Iain Jensen and Nathan Outteridge; Thomas Slingsby; and Cate Campbell, Alicia Coutts, Brittany Elmsie and Melanie Schlanger.


Silver medals went to Jared Tallent; Mitchell Watt; Jessica Fox; Samuel Willoughby; Jack Bobridge; Rohan Dennis; Michael Hepburn and Glenn O'Shea; Brittany Broben; rowing four, James Chapman, Joshua Dunkley-Smith, Drew Ginn and William Lockwood; Kimberly Crow and Brooke Pratley; Kate Hornsey and Sarah Tait; Nina Curtis, Olivia Price and Lucinda Whitty; James Magnussen, Christian Sprenger, Emily Seebohm; Alicia Coutts; the women's 200m individual medley team of Leisel Jones, Alicia Coutts, Melanie Schlanger and Emily Seebohm; and the women's four by 200-metre freestyle relay team, Bronte Barratt, Alicia Coutts, Kylie Palmer and Melanie Schlanger.


Bronze medals were won by the Opals, the Australian women's basketball team, consisting of Suzy Batkovic, Abby Bishop, Elizabeth Cambage, Laura Hodges, Lauren Jackson, Rachel Jarry, Kathleen Macleod, Jenna O'Hea, Sam Richards, Jennifer Screen, Belinda Snell and Kristi Willoughby; by Shane Perkins, Annette Edmondson, Kaarle McCulloch and Anna Meares; the Kookaburras, the men's hockey team, made up of Nathan Burgers, Matthew Butturini, Joel Carroll, Christopher Cirello, Liam De Young, Timothy Deavin, Jamie Dwyer, Russell Ford, Matt Gohdes, Kieran Govers, Fergus Kavanagh, Mark Knowles, Edward Ockenden, Simon Orchard, Matthew Swan and Glenn Turner; the men's rowing quad sculls, Karsten Fosterling, James McRae, Christopher Morgan and Daniel Noonan; the men's four by 100-metre medley relay, Christian Sprenger, Hayden Stoeckel, Matthew Targett and James Magnussen; Alicia Coutts, Bronte Barratt and Erin Densham; and the women's water polo team, Gemma Beadsworth, Victoria Brown, Kate Gynther, Bronwen Knox, Holly Lincoln-Smith, Alicia McCormack, Jane Moran, Glencora Ralph, Melissa Rippon, Sophie Smith, Ashleigh Southern, Rowena Webster and Nicola Zagame.


Well done to all of these people, and congratulations to you all on your outstanding achievement. I think it is important that you all know that we as Australians are very proud of you as members of the Australian Olympic team. On behalf of my electorate of Solomon, thank you for your hard work and dedication. We respect you all and, whether you won a medal or not, you will be known as Olympians for life. Well done. We are proud of you.


Debate adjourned.
