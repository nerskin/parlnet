"Watson, Sen John",LP,2007-08-09,"—Following the receipt of a satisfactory response, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1, standing in my name for two sitting days after today, for the disallowance of the Australian Federal Police Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 326.

Senator Milne to move on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—
notes that:
the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is an intergovernmental body concerned with reducing nuclear proliferation by controlling the export and re-transfer of materials, including uranium, that may be applicable to the development of nuclear weapons,
the NSG was founded in 1975 in response to the Indian nuclear test of the previous year, a test which demonstrated that certain non‑weapons specific nuclear technology could be readily used for weapons development, and
the NSG makes decisions by consensus, which means that each of the 45 NSG members, including Australia, must agree to the change of any rule, including those rules which prevent the export of uranium to non-Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty states such as India; and
calls on the Government to use its position in the NSG to block the submission to exempt India from the NSG rules preventing the supply of uranium to states which have not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

SELECTION OF BILLS COMMITTEE


Proposal to refer a bill to a committee


Name of bill(s):


Water Bill 2007


Water (Consequential Amendment) Bill 2007


Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration


Purpose of the Bills


The Water Bill establishes an overriding Commonwealth water resource management function across the Murray-Darling Basin and a national water data collection, analysis and information service within the Bureau of Meteorology.


The Water (Consequential Amendments) Bill makes amendments to the 
Meteorology Act 1955,
 the 
National. Water Commission Act 2004,
 and 
the Trade Practices Act 1974
 in order to give effect to the Water Bill.


Reasons for Urgency


The Water Bill and the Water (Consequential Amendments) Bill are necessary to implement the measures contained within the National Plan for Water Security.


These bills are necessary to implement the measures contained within the National Plan for Water Security.


The current arrangements for the management of the Murray-Darling Basin by consensus of the relevant states, the Australian Capital Territory, and the Commonwealth have failed to deliver timely and adequate responses to the accelerating over use and degradation of the water resources of the Basin. The National Plan for Water Security provides for these measures to be addressed subject to placing the Basin under overriding Commonwealth authority.


These bills, together as a package, provide for Commonwealth management of the Murray-Darling Basin and are a prerequisite for the implementation of the assistance and reform measures set out in the National Plan for Water Security. Failure to implement the measures quickly will delay the reforms and allow the degradation and over use of the waters of the Murray-Darling Basin to compound.


Possible submissions or evidence from:


Committee to which bill is to be referred:

—I move:
That the report be adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-09,"—The Democrats have serious concerns about the date of 14 August that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate has put forward, which the observant amongst you would realise is next Tuesday. That is, frankly, an absurdly short time frame. The Democrats’ view is that we should be seeking to have the committee report back on the first sitting date in September, which, off the top of my head, I think is 10 or 11 September, when we come back after the APEC meeting.
The water bills, as we all know, are very significant, hugely historic in lots of ways and not necessarily something that the Democrats oppose—certainly not in principle. We have made that very clear publicly a number of times. I do not know how many times I can say this in this place: we have a responsibility to do the job right. I know the Prime Minister has his political agenda and I know that state governments have their political agendas; the farming lobby and the environment lobby have their political agendas. The Senate’s job is to make sure that we look at what is actually going to become law.
Let us look at the reality of what the government’s proposal will mean. These incredibly significant pieces of legislation deal with the Murray-Darling Basin. As we all know, we have these bills because the Murray-Darling Basin is in crisis; it is at an absolute, total crisis point. If serious and effective action is not taken very promptly, that damage will be permanent. That does not mean that if we do not get these bills passed by next week that damage will be permanent. The prospects of saving the situation are dramatically enhanced if we do it right and do not pass them until September, in one month’s time.
It is ludicrous to suggest that that would be the case, given that this has dragged on all year. As we know, it came out of absolutely nowhere when the Prime Minister made his grand announcement. I will not speculate on his motivation because, whatever that was, there is no doubt that action needed to happen. So he made his grand announcement out of nowhere, as we all know, without consultation even with cabinet, Treasury, or a whole lot of people in the government, let alone anywhere else, saying that this was crucial and that we needed to surge ahead. Here we are in August and we are just now getting some legislation. Even today, we do not know if the New South Wales government is now supportive or not.
I am not commenting on any of those disputes and differences of views; what I am commenting on is the Senate’s responsibility to get it right. It is totally ludicrous to suggest that we can examine this legislation and hear from the stakeholders, from the people who will be directly affected, from the state governments, from the farmers, from the environmental experts, from the scientists and from affected Indigenous people in this space of time.
The reality of this proposal from the government, if it goes ahead, will be that we hold a Senate committee hearing tomorrow. In less than 24 hours time, people will be expected to come and give evidence on these bills—people who do not even know that they are invited yet, people who do not even know what time they are going to be appearing, people who have had less than 24 hours to provide a written submission. They are all meant to suddenly get to Canberra and provide informed opinion to the Senate so we can assess whether we are getting this right. Can anyone here credibly tell me that that is a responsible process? Of course it is not. It is grossly irresponsible. It is a dereliction of our most fundamental duty.
Just yesterday, or the day before, the Prime Minister—quite rightly, in my view—slammed Queensland Premier Peter Beattie for railroading through all the changes to local government and not consulting with the people who will be directly affected, and not giving them a chance to have their say. I am paraphrasing him here, but that is basically what he said. Yet, here we are doing it. We are doing it to the people of the Northern Territory and we are doing it to the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. There is no opportunity for them to have their say on the massive changes being imposed on them. We will not get to hear the views of the people directly affected, let alone take advantage of their expertise.
And we are doing it again with the water bills and the Murray-Darling Basin. It is a huge, incredibly important area. This is major, groundbreaking legislation that is a huge shift in how things are dealt with. It has serious constitutional questions to consider and address, and there are obvious differences of views about how it is going to operate in terms of the key stakeholders. And we are meant to just have a hearing tomorrow. We have just come from a meeting of the committee and we are still sorting out the witnesses for the hearing. It is just ludicrous. This is what this government has reduced the Senate to by grossly misusing its Senate power. It is a fundamental breach of the Prime Minister’s promise after the last election when he promised he would not abuse the Senate power. He has done it time and time again and he is doing it now. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-09,"—The Greens wanted the water bills referred to a different committee, although we are happy they are going to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. But we do believe that the committee should be reporting on 10 September. This legislation contains fundamental, major changes to the way land and water are managed in Australia. There are a number of organisations that will want to review the legislation. At our first look at the bills, the Greens found some good areas in the legislation, but we do have some concerns, particularly about some of the environmental clauses, how the environment is going to be managed and whether it is going to be environmentally sustainable.
We need much more time to be able to consider this legislation. The community groups do too. I am particularly concerned that Indigenous organisations are not going to have time to look at this legislation properly. I have already had an Indigenous organisation contact my office to raise concerns with me about the bills and the lack of inclusion of traditional rights and Indigenous involvement in the management of the river. It is highly unlikely that organisations will be able to get a submission in by tomorrow, much less appear tomorrow before the committee, because the committee is meeting tomorrow. Organisations are being contacted now to come to Canberra tomorrow. If you are not based in Canberra or very close to Canberra, you will not be able to appear before the committee. You may be able to be on a phone link-up, but that is not as good as being able to appear before the committee and being able to listen to the evidence from the other people appearing.
This is significant, long-term change to Australia’s biggest river system and to our largest agricultural producing system. It has some of our most important wetlands and our most important rivers. It is absolutely vital that everybody has an opportunity to adequately review this legislation. Again, as happened yesterday on the Northern Territory legislation, I do not think any senator will be able to stand with their hand on their heart and say that they absolutely understand all the ramifications of the bills—there are two bills in this package of legislation. In the past, I have raised concerns about how this particular bill and water management interrelate with the natural resource management in the catchment. To date, I have not been given satisfactory answers. Unfortunately, in the limited time frame that is available for consideration of these bills, I do not think that those answers will be available.
There is a vast variety of stakeholders and issues involved here, covering an area from Queensland right through to South Australia. How, for example, are South Australian urban water users going to be able to get hold of this legislation, adequately review it and put in a submission by tomorrow? I see no reason why, other than the government’s desire to rush this through this place, we could not hold an inquiry during the September break. I think that would allow a much more thorough process. It would be much fairer for the community and it would certainly be much fairer for the senators considering this legislation. It would enable us to consider all the information that is available.
As I said, it seems like there are some very good bits in this legislation, but there are also very significant problems that need to be adequately considered. The Greens do not support the motion moved by the government to have this committee report by Tuesday. We believe it should be reporting on 10 September to allow adequate time to fully consider the ramifications of this legislation and the very significant changes it makes to the way we manage our water and natural resources. This is probably the last time that we will be able to put in place adequate management regimes for the Murray before it dies. If we do not get it right this time, it will basically be gone. And bear this in mind: if the environment of the Murray is gone, agriculture in the whole of the Murray-Darling Basin will be permanently changed. So we have to get it right. You would think the government would allow adequate time for us to get it right this one last time, because this is our last chance to get it right.
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Abetz be agreed to.
Question agreed to.
—The question now is that the motion, that the report of the Selection of Bills Committee be adopted, as amended, be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-09,"—I move:

At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Lobbying and Ministerial Accountability Bill 2007, the bill be referred to the Finance and Public Administration Committee for inquiry and report by 31 October 2007”.

The report reads at point (4):
(4)           The committee considered a proposal to refer the Lobbying and Ministerial Accountability Bill 2007 to the Finance and Public Administration Committee, but was unable to reach agreement on whether the bill should be referred.

So the committee was unable to come to agreement on that. The fact is that the committee is in default there by saying that it should not be referred. I stand to be corrected, but I would think that means that the government does not agree with this important bill being referred.
The Lobbying and Ministerial Accountability Bill 2007, which I brought into the Senate some weeks ago, requires ministers to divest themselves of all shares or move them to a blind trust within 28 days of becoming a minister. It also requires the public registration and regulation of lobbyists and it places limits on the post-separation employment of ministers for up to two years after leaving the parliament. It is a bill to increase public confidence in the body politic and in particular in the decisions made by parliamentarians. It aims to remove the spectre of undue influence being placed on ministers or, through lobbyists, on all members of parliament.
It is an important bill. It will bring Australia into line with the practice in overseas countries like Britain and Canada, through greater transparency of the activities of lobbyists in parliament and the behaviour of parliamentarians. In particular, it will remove the possibility of instant jobs for members of parliament after they leave this place, where, on behalf of sectoral interests, they are able to influence the decisions made in parliament.
This bill should be referred to a committee. It should be available for public comment and it should be on a trajectory to be dealt with and debated in this parliament during this period of government. It is not satisfactory for the committee to have determined, by failure to agree, that the bill will not be referred to a committee. I object to that. There is no reason given by the majority or the government. I do not know what is to be gained by refusing to have an analysis of this bill. That speaks volumes in itself. The inference can be drawn that the government simply does not want the accountability which this bill would bring to Australian politics. It is running away from it. Be that as it may, I am now moving this amendment so that the bill does get referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for report by October and does get the public input that it deserves.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-08-09,"—The government opposes the amendment. I will outline for those who may be interested that John Howard is in fact the first Prime Minister to have established a public ministerial code. Most of these issues have been previously considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, through Senator Murray’s Charter of Political Honesty Bill. A report on that bill was tabled, I understand, some five years ago.
This is a stunt by Senator Bob Brown. Neither the parliament nor successive governments have imposed constraints on former ministers as to what employment they may take up after leaving office. It has been left to an individual’s judgement.
—What poor judgement has been shown!
—As Senator Brown interjects, I simply say to those who may be listening that to come to this debate you have to come with clean hands. Senator Brown does not, because of his personal conduct with his own private RJ Brown Forest Account, which he has not properly disclosed to this place. We had to bring him back for the register of senators’ interests.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. That was referred to a committee, which made no such finding. The imputation is not warranted, is unjustified and should be withdrawn.
—I ask the minister to address his comments to the amendment.
—The amendment is in relation to standards. If somebody wants to come into this chamber and try to impose standards on others, I think it is more than appropriate for us to consider the standards they apply to themselves—such as raising money on the basis of saying: ‘This is a rock I found in the Franklin River. Who will buy it at auction?’ You get $1,000 for it and never disclose who was the purchaser of that rock, and then the person gives the rock back to Senator Brown at the end of the auction. Just imagine if a minister of the Crown were engaged in such funny money deals. Senator Brown would be the most outraged of any individual, with all the puffed up, faux outrage that we have now come to expect from him. Senator Brown is the one who gets personal loans from lawyers in Hobart and discloses them a long time after they should have been disclosed. It is about time the Australian people knew the facts about Senator Brown, whenever he puts his hand on his heart and asserts integrity in public life, money and public disclosure. If we were to behave in the way that Senator Brown does, there would be outrage, especially from our friends in the media.
We believe that the standards that have been applied are the highest that have ever been applied. One thing the Australian people can be assured of is that we will never descend to the sorts of rock auctions that Senator Brown has engaged in and his failure to disclose. When he disclosed to the Senate about his donations, he only put names—sometimes only with initials—so you had no idea where the people lived. We now know that some of those people were overseas donors. I think it is about time that Senator Brown got his own house in order, before he tries to assert these standards and before he tries to clean the few specks of dust that may exist in other people’s houses.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-08-09,"—I would like to get back to the debate at hand. I am not quite sure how this has degenerated into personal attacks, but nothing surprises me in this place at the moment. I want to place on record that the Australian Democrats are happy to support the amendment that has been proposed by Senator Brown on behalf of the Greens. One of the reasons for us supporting that is the policy matter that is before us for debate. As the then Leader of the Australian Democrats back in 2002, I introduced a comparable piece of legislation. I note that Senator Abetz also acknowledged Senator Murray’s charter of honesty legislation—the Minister of State Post Retirement Employment Restriction Bill 2002—which was reintroduced in 2004.
This is worthy legislation that deserves examination and report. For that reason we will be supporting it. It is because of the policy matter only—on that basis—that we are happy to support this amendment. Mr President, as you would well be aware, my colleague and the Democrats deputy leader, Senator Bartlett, has repeatedly placed on record our views in relation to the selection of bills process.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-08-09,"—We have before us a motion to refer the Lobbying and Ministerial Accountability Bill 2007 to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. In the Selection of Bills Committee, individual senators seek to have matters or private members’ bills referred to a particular Senate committee for an inquiry and its report. Under the previous system—before we combined the two Senate committees—it may have been a more general reference that would have been referred, and it would have come here. The usual answer that the opposition gives to these things is that references by individual senators should generally be referred to committees. Those committees then are able to inquire into them within reasonable time frames to look at the particular issues. That is the general principle that Labor has supported.
Since the government’s changes to the committee system, we now have one committee that deals with both legislation and references. With the matters that go to the Selection of Bills Committee for determination, if the committee cannot come to a reasoned conclusion or agreement on these matters—as clearly it did not do, because the government was not able to agree, it seems from Senator Abetz’s statements today—then we have to have the argument here. That does not always reflect all the matters that should be taken into account in dealing with the issue.
To Senator Brown, through you, Mr President: one of the matters that concern me is that the time frame is a little bit short. Firstly, there is the workload of the particular committee. Also, the committee usually advertises these matters once they have been referred and, depending on the committee’s workload, there may be a return date of four to six weeks for people to make reasonable submissions. That is what happens in the usual course of events where someone wants a proper inquiry; we are not so much talking about the situation where the government wants a short inquiry.
The committee’s time frame before reporting back is particularly short. In this instance, I am not sure whether an October return date will actually end up happening. We may end up in a position where we have been prorogued at that point. It is, of course, in the government’s hands when that is likely to occur, but we have heard that there is going to be an election some time at the end of this year—most likely in November. The government are obviously not going to confirm that—although it would be helpful if they did—but that seems to be the broad suggestion. It concerns me that, if you have an October date, we may not be back here to be able to deal with the matter in any sense. Then the committee itself will have to make a general consideration as to what resources it will put into these things and how the submissions will then be dealt with. After the election, it is a question of whether the committee will pull that report back up again and continue on. Having said all that and hopefully explained the matter to Senator Brown, I emphasise that this underlines the difficulty that the committee might have in dealing with this particular reference.
We will not take a position of opposing it, but we do note all of those problems that might arise. I think that Senator Brown should consider these matters if he really wants these things to be proceeded with in a sensible way and to be dealt with. We are not going to take the government’s view about these things. The government provides for short committee inquiries. In our view, it does not allow the time to have these inquiries dealt with in a proper way and we are not going to buy into its argument. We make the point with regard to Senator Brown’s particular inquiry that he might be falling into the same trap that the government falls into when it makes these types of committee arrangements.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-09,"—I want to place a couple of things clearly on the record in relation to the specific matter that we are dealing with here. It is a proposal, through Senator Brown, for a private senator’s bill of his to be considered by a Senate committee. I am not going to go to the merits or otherwise of what is in the bill; others have done that. That is what Senate committees are actually for.
Once upon a time there used to be a convention in this place whereby, if anybody wanted a bill referred to a committee for examination, unless there were extraordinarily pressing reasons, the Senate would agree to it and the Selection of Bills Committee would agree to it. There might have been a difference of opinion over reporting dates, but if somebody wanted to refer a bill—if even one senator wanted to refer a bill—because they thought it merited examination then the Senate would agree to it. I do not know how many times you have to destroy a convention before it no longer applies at all. I suspect we are already at that point. That is one of the problems with the government’s approach as they have got control of the Senate: they have degraded and debauched and besmirched the Senate process and the whole nature of the Senate’s activities so thoroughly that you have to wonder—even if they do lose control of the Senate at the coming election, and whoever ends up in government—whether the Senate will go back to having some of the more thorough and more independent accountability and examination processes that it had in the past. That to me is a real concern, and that is why I am pleased that Labor have taken a position of being prepared to support this. It does not mean they think it is a great idea. They are not convinced that the timing is right. But, with respect to appropriate recognition of the role of the Senate, if somebody wants to put a bill forward, unless there is a really strong reason not to do so, you do it.
That goes to the second point I wanted to make. The Senate is not a house of government. The Senate should be an independent chamber examining legislation and private senators’ bills. This even goes to the point that Senator Ludwig was making about time frames. Particularly with private senators’ bills, we bring them back at a certain time; that does not mean we bring them back at a certain time so we can bring them on for debate straightaway.
As we all know, in many cases we put forward private senators’ bills not because we are expecting them to come on for debate, much as we might like them to, but to try to get issues considered, to try and inform the Senate more fully about the sorts of matters that are contained in the legislation and to try and get all of us to think about the possibilities of inserting those sorts of legislative principles in laws, perhaps in other contexts, including in government legislation that comes through. That is why it is totally valid for a Senate committee to examine something—even, I might say, in the lead-up to an election.
We know there will be an election sometime before the end of the year, and I would assume that has significantly influenced Senator Brown’s choice of date. But, given that this legislation that is proposed to be referred to the committee is not going to be brought on for a vote before the election, even that becomes somewhat academic. The level of interest from those on the committee who are focused on the election may be less than 100 per cent. But there is more to Senate committees than the senators who sit on the committees. There are the people in the wider community who have the expertise and the views, and there is the opportunity for those things to go on the public record through submissions.
I would point to my experience in referring one of my own private senators’ bills, relating to animal welfare. That had massive public interest. I think we had over 200 submissions. The rest of the committee were so uninterested they did not even bother to hold a public hearing and brought down what I thought was a derisory, perfunctory report. That is fine, in one sense: that is their view and that is the process they decided to take. But the opportunity to have all of that material, all those views, collated in one place on the public record for everybody to make use of in formulating public policy in a particular area down the track is important. So it is not all about the government. It is not even all about us. It is not all about just pushing legislation through. It is about getting a more informed public policy debate and a wider range of ideas about potential legislative reform in a much broader and ongoing context. That is why, unless there are very good reasons, we should not be opposing references of private senators’ bills to committees. It does not get in the way of the government’s program in the chamber at all. It does not even necessarily distract senators on committees. They do not have to hold public hearings if they do not want to. What it does do, by blocking it, is prevent the issue from being examined more thoroughly by the people in the wider community. The government might be happy to silence the rest of us in this chamber regularly, but they should not be so readily silencing people in the wider community.

SELECTION OF BILLS COMMITTEE


Proposal to refer a bill to a committee


Name of bill(s):


Water Bill 2007


Water (Consequential Amendment) Bill 2007


Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration


Purpose of the Bills


The Water Bill establishes an overriding Commonwealth water resource management function across the Murray-Darling Basin and a national water data collection, analysis and information service within the Bureau of Meteorology.


The Water (Consequential Amendments) Bill makes amendments to the 
Meteorology Act 1955,
 the 
National. Water Commission Act 2004,
 and 
the Trade Practices Act 1974
 in order to give effect to the Water Bill.


Reasons for Urgency


The Water Bill and the Water (Consequential Amendments) Bill are necessary to implement the measures contained within the National Plan for Water Security.


These bills are necessary to implement the measures contained within the National Plan for Water Security.


The current arrangements for the management of the Murray-Darling Basin by consensus of the relevant states, the Australian Capital Territory, and the Commonwealth have failed to deliver timely and adequate responses to the accelerating over use and degradation of the water resources of the Basin. The National Plan for Water Security provides for these measures to be addressed subject to placing the Basin under overriding Commonwealth authority.


These bills, together as a package, provide for Commonwealth management of the Murray-Darling Basin and are a prerequisite for the implementation of the assistance and reform measures set out in the National Plan for Water Security. Failure to implement the measures quickly will delay the reforms and allow the degradation and over use of the waters of the Murray-Darling Basin to compound.


Possible submissions or evidence from:


Committee to which bill is to be referred:

—I move:
That the report be adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-09,"—The Democrats have serious concerns about the date of 14 August that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate has put forward, which the observant amongst you would realise is next Tuesday. That is, frankly, an absurdly short time frame. The Democrats’ view is that we should be seeking to have the committee report back on the first sitting date in September, which, off the top of my head, I think is 10 or 11 September, when we come back after the APEC meeting.
The water bills, as we all know, are very significant, hugely historic in lots of ways and not necessarily something that the Democrats oppose—certainly not in principle. We have made that very clear publicly a number of times. I do not know how many times I can say this in this place: we have a responsibility to do the job right. I know the Prime Minister has his political agenda and I know that state governments have their political agendas; the farming lobby and the environment lobby have their political agendas. The Senate’s job is to make sure that we look at what is actually going to become law.
Let us look at the reality of what the government’s proposal will mean. These incredibly significant pieces of legislation deal with the Murray-Darling Basin. As we all know, we have these bills because the Murray-Darling Basin is in crisis; it is at an absolute, total crisis point. If serious and effective action is not taken very promptly, that damage will be permanent. That does not mean that if we do not get these bills passed by next week that damage will be permanent. The prospects of saving the situation are dramatically enhanced if we do it right and do not pass them until September, in one month’s time.
It is ludicrous to suggest that that would be the case, given that this has dragged on all year. As we know, it came out of absolutely nowhere when the Prime Minister made his grand announcement. I will not speculate on his motivation because, whatever that was, there is no doubt that action needed to happen. So he made his grand announcement out of nowhere, as we all know, without consultation even with cabinet, Treasury, or a whole lot of people in the government, let alone anywhere else, saying that this was crucial and that we needed to surge ahead. Here we are in August and we are just now getting some legislation. Even today, we do not know if the New South Wales government is now supportive or not.
I am not commenting on any of those disputes and differences of views; what I am commenting on is the Senate’s responsibility to get it right. It is totally ludicrous to suggest that we can examine this legislation and hear from the stakeholders, from the people who will be directly affected, from the state governments, from the farmers, from the environmental experts, from the scientists and from affected Indigenous people in this space of time.
The reality of this proposal from the government, if it goes ahead, will be that we hold a Senate committee hearing tomorrow. In less than 24 hours time, people will be expected to come and give evidence on these bills—people who do not even know that they are invited yet, people who do not even know what time they are going to be appearing, people who have had less than 24 hours to provide a written submission. They are all meant to suddenly get to Canberra and provide informed opinion to the Senate so we can assess whether we are getting this right. Can anyone here credibly tell me that that is a responsible process? Of course it is not. It is grossly irresponsible. It is a dereliction of our most fundamental duty.
Just yesterday, or the day before, the Prime Minister—quite rightly, in my view—slammed Queensland Premier Peter Beattie for railroading through all the changes to local government and not consulting with the people who will be directly affected, and not giving them a chance to have their say. I am paraphrasing him here, but that is basically what he said. Yet, here we are doing it. We are doing it to the people of the Northern Territory and we are doing it to the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. There is no opportunity for them to have their say on the massive changes being imposed on them. We will not get to hear the views of the people directly affected, let alone take advantage of their expertise.
And we are doing it again with the water bills and the Murray-Darling Basin. It is a huge, incredibly important area. This is major, groundbreaking legislation that is a huge shift in how things are dealt with. It has serious constitutional questions to consider and address, and there are obvious differences of views about how it is going to operate in terms of the key stakeholders. And we are meant to just have a hearing tomorrow. We have just come from a meeting of the committee and we are still sorting out the witnesses for the hearing. It is just ludicrous. This is what this government has reduced the Senate to by grossly misusing its Senate power. It is a fundamental breach of the Prime Minister’s promise after the last election when he promised he would not abuse the Senate power. He has done it time and time again and he is doing it now. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-08-09,"—The Greens wanted the water bills referred to a different committee, although we are happy they are going to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. But we do believe that the committee should be reporting on 10 September. This legislation contains fundamental, major changes to the way land and water are managed in Australia. There are a number of organisations that will want to review the legislation. At our first look at the bills, the Greens found some good areas in the legislation, but we do have some concerns, particularly about some of the environmental clauses, how the environment is going to be managed and whether it is going to be environmentally sustainable.
We need much more time to be able to consider this legislation. The community groups do too. I am particularly concerned that Indigenous organisations are not going to have time to look at this legislation properly. I have already had an Indigenous organisation contact my office to raise concerns with me about the bills and the lack of inclusion of traditional rights and Indigenous involvement in the management of the river. It is highly unlikely that organisations will be able to get a submission in by tomorrow, much less appear tomorrow before the committee, because the committee is meeting tomorrow. Organisations are being contacted now to come to Canberra tomorrow. If you are not based in Canberra or very close to Canberra, you will not be able to appear before the committee. You may be able to be on a phone link-up, but that is not as good as being able to appear before the committee and being able to listen to the evidence from the other people appearing.
This is significant, long-term change to Australia’s biggest river system and to our largest agricultural producing system. It has some of our most important wetlands and our most important rivers. It is absolutely vital that everybody has an opportunity to adequately review this legislation. Again, as happened yesterday on the Northern Territory legislation, I do not think any senator will be able to stand with their hand on their heart and say that they absolutely understand all the ramifications of the bills—there are two bills in this package of legislation. In the past, I have raised concerns about how this particular bill and water management interrelate with the natural resource management in the catchment. To date, I have not been given satisfactory answers. Unfortunately, in the limited time frame that is available for consideration of these bills, I do not think that those answers will be available.
There is a vast variety of stakeholders and issues involved here, covering an area from Queensland right through to South Australia. How, for example, are South Australian urban water users going to be able to get hold of this legislation, adequately review it and put in a submission by tomorrow? I see no reason why, other than the government’s desire to rush this through this place, we could not hold an inquiry during the September break. I think that would allow a much more thorough process. It would be much fairer for the community and it would certainly be much fairer for the senators considering this legislation. It would enable us to consider all the information that is available.
As I said, it seems like there are some very good bits in this legislation, but there are also very significant problems that need to be adequately considered. The Greens do not support the motion moved by the government to have this committee report by Tuesday. We believe it should be reporting on 10 September to allow adequate time to fully consider the ramifications of this legislation and the very significant changes it makes to the way we manage our water and natural resources. This is probably the last time that we will be able to put in place adequate management regimes for the Murray before it dies. If we do not get it right this time, it will basically be gone. And bear this in mind: if the environment of the Murray is gone, agriculture in the whole of the Murray-Darling Basin will be permanently changed. So we have to get it right. You would think the government would allow adequate time for us to get it right this one last time, because this is our last chance to get it right.
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Abetz be agreed to.
Question agreed to.
—The question now is that the motion, that the report of the Selection of Bills Committee be adopted, as amended, be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-09,"—I move:

At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Lobbying and Ministerial Accountability Bill 2007, the bill be referred to the Finance and Public Administration Committee for inquiry and report by 31 October 2007”.

The report reads at point (4):
(4)           The committee considered a proposal to refer the Lobbying and Ministerial Accountability Bill 2007 to the Finance and Public Administration Committee, but was unable to reach agreement on whether the bill should be referred.

So the committee was unable to come to agreement on that. The fact is that the committee is in default there by saying that it should not be referred. I stand to be corrected, but I would think that means that the government does not agree with this important bill being referred.
The Lobbying and Ministerial Accountability Bill 2007, which I brought into the Senate some weeks ago, requires ministers to divest themselves of all shares or move them to a blind trust within 28 days of becoming a minister. It also requires the public registration and regulation of lobbyists and it places limits on the post-separation employment of ministers for up to two years after leaving the parliament. It is a bill to increase public confidence in the body politic and in particular in the decisions made by parliamentarians. It aims to remove the spectre of undue influence being placed on ministers or, through lobbyists, on all members of parliament.
It is an important bill. It will bring Australia into line with the practice in overseas countries like Britain and Canada, through greater transparency of the activities of lobbyists in parliament and the behaviour of parliamentarians. In particular, it will remove the possibility of instant jobs for members of parliament after they leave this place, where, on behalf of sectoral interests, they are able to influence the decisions made in parliament.
This bill should be referred to a committee. It should be available for public comment and it should be on a trajectory to be dealt with and debated in this parliament during this period of government. It is not satisfactory for the committee to have determined, by failure to agree, that the bill will not be referred to a committee. I object to that. There is no reason given by the majority or the government. I do not know what is to be gained by refusing to have an analysis of this bill. That speaks volumes in itself. The inference can be drawn that the government simply does not want the accountability which this bill would bring to Australian politics. It is running away from it. Be that as it may, I am now moving this amendment so that the bill does get referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for report by October and does get the public input that it deserves.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-08-09,"—The government opposes the amendment. I will outline for those who may be interested that John Howard is in fact the first Prime Minister to have established a public ministerial code. Most of these issues have been previously considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, through Senator Murray’s Charter of Political Honesty Bill. A report on that bill was tabled, I understand, some five years ago.
This is a stunt by Senator Bob Brown. Neither the parliament nor successive governments have imposed constraints on former ministers as to what employment they may take up after leaving office. It has been left to an individual’s judgement.
—What poor judgement has been shown!
—As Senator Brown interjects, I simply say to those who may be listening that to come to this debate you have to come with clean hands. Senator Brown does not, because of his personal conduct with his own private RJ Brown Forest Account, which he has not properly disclosed to this place. We had to bring him back for the register of senators’ interests.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. That was referred to a committee, which made no such finding. The imputation is not warranted, is unjustified and should be withdrawn.
—I ask the minister to address his comments to the amendment.
—The amendment is in relation to standards. If somebody wants to come into this chamber and try to impose standards on others, I think it is more than appropriate for us to consider the standards they apply to themselves—such as raising money on the basis of saying: ‘This is a rock I found in the Franklin River. Who will buy it at auction?’ You get $1,000 for it and never disclose who was the purchaser of that rock, and then the person gives the rock back to Senator Brown at the end of the auction. Just imagine if a minister of the Crown were engaged in such funny money deals. Senator Brown would be the most outraged of any individual, with all the puffed up, faux outrage that we have now come to expect from him. Senator Brown is the one who gets personal loans from lawyers in Hobart and discloses them a long time after they should have been disclosed. It is about time the Australian people knew the facts about Senator Brown, whenever he puts his hand on his heart and asserts integrity in public life, money and public disclosure. If we were to behave in the way that Senator Brown does, there would be outrage, especially from our friends in the media.
We believe that the standards that have been applied are the highest that have ever been applied. One thing the Australian people can be assured of is that we will never descend to the sorts of rock auctions that Senator Brown has engaged in and his failure to disclose. When he disclosed to the Senate about his donations, he only put names—sometimes only with initials—so you had no idea where the people lived. We now know that some of those people were overseas donors. I think it is about time that Senator Brown got his own house in order, before he tries to assert these standards and before he tries to clean the few specks of dust that may exist in other people’s houses.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-08-09,"—I would like to get back to the debate at hand. I am not quite sure how this has degenerated into personal attacks, but nothing surprises me in this place at the moment. I want to place on record that the Australian Democrats are happy to support the amendment that has been proposed by Senator Brown on behalf of the Greens. One of the reasons for us supporting that is the policy matter that is before us for debate. As the then Leader of the Australian Democrats back in 2002, I introduced a comparable piece of legislation. I note that Senator Abetz also acknowledged Senator Murray’s charter of honesty legislation—the Minister of State Post Retirement Employment Restriction Bill 2002—which was reintroduced in 2004.
This is worthy legislation that deserves examination and report. For that reason we will be supporting it. It is because of the policy matter only—on that basis—that we are happy to support this amendment. Mr President, as you would well be aware, my colleague and the Democrats deputy leader, Senator Bartlett, has repeatedly placed on record our views in relation to the selection of bills process.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-08-09,"—We have before us a motion to refer the Lobbying and Ministerial Accountability Bill 2007 to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. In the Selection of Bills Committee, individual senators seek to have matters or private members’ bills referred to a particular Senate committee for an inquiry and its report. Under the previous system—before we combined the two Senate committees—it may have been a more general reference that would have been referred, and it would have come here. The usual answer that the opposition gives to these things is that references by individual senators should generally be referred to committees. Those committees then are able to inquire into them within reasonable time frames to look at the particular issues. That is the general principle that Labor has supported.
Since the government’s changes to the committee system, we now have one committee that deals with both legislation and references. With the matters that go to the Selection of Bills Committee for determination, if the committee cannot come to a reasoned conclusion or agreement on these matters—as clearly it did not do, because the government was not able to agree, it seems from Senator Abetz’s statements today—then we have to have the argument here. That does not always reflect all the matters that should be taken into account in dealing with the issue.
To Senator Brown, through you, Mr President: one of the matters that concern me is that the time frame is a little bit short. Firstly, there is the workload of the particular committee. Also, the committee usually advertises these matters once they have been referred and, depending on the committee’s workload, there may be a return date of four to six weeks for people to make reasonable submissions. That is what happens in the usual course of events where someone wants a proper inquiry; we are not so much talking about the situation where the government wants a short inquiry.
The committee’s time frame before reporting back is particularly short. In this instance, I am not sure whether an October return date will actually end up happening. We may end up in a position where we have been prorogued at that point. It is, of course, in the government’s hands when that is likely to occur, but we have heard that there is going to be an election some time at the end of this year—most likely in November. The government are obviously not going to confirm that—although it would be helpful if they did—but that seems to be the broad suggestion. It concerns me that, if you have an October date, we may not be back here to be able to deal with the matter in any sense. Then the committee itself will have to make a general consideration as to what resources it will put into these things and how the submissions will then be dealt with. After the election, it is a question of whether the committee will pull that report back up again and continue on. Having said all that and hopefully explained the matter to Senator Brown, I emphasise that this underlines the difficulty that the committee might have in dealing with this particular reference.
We will not take a position of opposing it, but we do note all of those problems that might arise. I think that Senator Brown should consider these matters if he really wants these things to be proceeded with in a sensible way and to be dealt with. We are not going to take the government’s view about these things. The government provides for short committee inquiries. In our view, it does not allow the time to have these inquiries dealt with in a proper way and we are not going to buy into its argument. We make the point with regard to Senator Brown’s particular inquiry that he might be falling into the same trap that the government falls into when it makes these types of committee arrangements.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-09,"—I want to place a couple of things clearly on the record in relation to the specific matter that we are dealing with here. It is a proposal, through Senator Brown, for a private senator’s bill of his to be considered by a Senate committee. I am not going to go to the merits or otherwise of what is in the bill; others have done that. That is what Senate committees are actually for.
Once upon a time there used to be a convention in this place whereby, if anybody wanted a bill referred to a committee for examination, unless there were extraordinarily pressing reasons, the Senate would agree to it and the Selection of Bills Committee would agree to it. There might have been a difference of opinion over reporting dates, but if somebody wanted to refer a bill—if even one senator wanted to refer a bill—because they thought it merited examination then the Senate would agree to it. I do not know how many times you have to destroy a convention before it no longer applies at all. I suspect we are already at that point. That is one of the problems with the government’s approach as they have got control of the Senate: they have degraded and debauched and besmirched the Senate process and the whole nature of the Senate’s activities so thoroughly that you have to wonder—even if they do lose control of the Senate at the coming election, and whoever ends up in government—whether the Senate will go back to having some of the more thorough and more independent accountability and examination processes that it had in the past. That to me is a real concern, and that is why I am pleased that Labor have taken a position of being prepared to support this. It does not mean they think it is a great idea. They are not convinced that the timing is right. But, with respect to appropriate recognition of the role of the Senate, if somebody wants to put a bill forward, unless there is a really strong reason not to do so, you do it.
That goes to the second point I wanted to make. The Senate is not a house of government. The Senate should be an independent chamber examining legislation and private senators’ bills. This even goes to the point that Senator Ludwig was making about time frames. Particularly with private senators’ bills, we bring them back at a certain time; that does not mean we bring them back at a certain time so we can bring them on for debate straightaway.
As we all know, in many cases we put forward private senators’ bills not because we are expecting them to come on for debate, much as we might like them to, but to try to get issues considered, to try and inform the Senate more fully about the sorts of matters that are contained in the legislation and to try and get all of us to think about the possibilities of inserting those sorts of legislative principles in laws, perhaps in other contexts, including in government legislation that comes through. That is why it is totally valid for a Senate committee to examine something—even, I might say, in the lead-up to an election.
We know there will be an election sometime before the end of the year, and I would assume that has significantly influenced Senator Brown’s choice of date. But, given that this legislation that is proposed to be referred to the committee is not going to be brought on for a vote before the election, even that becomes somewhat academic. The level of interest from those on the committee who are focused on the election may be less than 100 per cent. But there is more to Senate committees than the senators who sit on the committees. There are the people in the wider community who have the expertise and the views, and there is the opportunity for those things to go on the public record through submissions.
I would point to my experience in referring one of my own private senators’ bills, relating to animal welfare. That had massive public interest. I think we had over 200 submissions. The rest of the committee were so uninterested they did not even bother to hold a public hearing and brought down what I thought was a derisory, perfunctory report. That is fine, in one sense: that is their view and that is the process they decided to take. But the opportunity to have all of that material, all those views, collated in one place on the public record for everybody to make use of in formulating public policy in a particular area down the track is important. So it is not all about the government. It is not even all about us. It is not all about just pushing legislation through. It is about getting a more informed public policy debate and a wider range of ideas about potential legislative reform in a much broader and ongoing context. That is why, unless there are very good reasons, we should not be opposing references of private senators’ bills to committees. It does not get in the way of the government’s program in the chamber at all. It does not even necessarily distract senators on committees. They do not have to hold public hearings if they do not want to. What it does do, by blocking it, is prevent the issue from being examined more thoroughly by the people in the wider community. The government might be happy to silence the rest of us in this chamber regularly, but they should not be so readily silencing people in the wider community.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2007-08-09,"—I wish to make some comments in relation to the tabling of the report Workforce challenges in the transport industry. This inquiry commenced on the basis of looking at employment opportunities in the industry and the issue of shortages of skilled labour required by the industry. In terms of the period that this inquiry covered we only had a very superficial look at what is a very complex industry, with a number of different forms and modes of transport across our country. One of the startling factors that came out of the inquiry, which seems to be agreed upon by all sectors of the industry, including the department, is that our requirements for transport will double by the year 2020. That poses a very significant challenge to this parliament and to this country to commence to put in place policies in this industry to ensure that both the modes of transport are right and that there is a labour force in place to be able to manage those modes and operate those modes of transport by the year 2020.
The government has given the Australian Logistics Council the task of examining a draft report prepared by the department of transport that looks at transport requirements for the next five years and marshalling the responses from the industry to that draft report. It is essential, in our view, that they not just look at the next five years but start to examine the requirements for the next 20 years. There is a major challenge in this industry to do with training, particularly for truck drivers, and there are a whole range of issues, some of which are complex, that need to be addressed in that area. I am sure my colleagues Senator Sterle and Senator Hutchins will address that.
But there is also the challenge of looking at what direction we go in to face the 2020 challenge that faces this industry. Do we focus on building more rail infrastructure and seek to shift a greater proportion of our goods by rail than by road? Do we increase road transport? Do we look at using the natural infrastructure that exists all around the Australian coast and shift more of our goods by sea? We do not need to build roads 100 miles away from the coast because there are natural sea lanes that may help to satisfy our transport needs. When I was in Brisbane for another committee inquiry, I took the opportunity to talk to the Port of Brisbane Authority. They are doubling the size of the Port of Brisbane right at this moment. A huge amount of work is being undertaken to develop the port.
One piece of information I was able to glean from that visit is that something like 80 per cent of all containers that go through the port are delivered within 100 miles of the Port of Brisbane. That raises real issues about whether you move goods by rail or by truck. They said there is a major issue in Brisbane because of the interface between goods trains and passenger trains on metropolitan lines. The passenger trains obviously take precedence, and that is an inhibiting factor for the movement of goods by train. They also say that the size of container ships is going to double within the next five years—in fact, they are being built now. So, instead of ships carrying 3,000 or 4,000 containers, they are going to be carrying 8,000 or 9,000 containers. They said that, even if you were able to piggyback containers by rail, the most you would be able to add is another 230 containers.
So the intermodal interface is getting out of alignment because of the technology that is now being applied on ships and in other parts of the industry. That needs to be looked at. It is a major challenge that has to be faced up to. If we do not get it right, it is going to have a substantial impact upon the Australian economy and our capacity to increase our efficiency and productivity and to be able to match it with the rest of the world. I make the point because I think we need to see this report not as the conclusion of the transport issue but as a starting point to focus on the policy options that may be available to match the challenge into the year 2020. Those issues need to be addressed now. There are only eight or nine recommendations in the report, but they are key recommendations that need to be treated seriously. Interestingly enough, this is a unanimous report of the committee. It has the support of senators on the government side and senators on this side. It should be treated seriously by this government and looked at seriously by the department. Initiatives should be taken to ensure that the issues raised in the report start to be addressed in terms of building the physical and human infrastructure that is going to be essential to meet our transport needs in 2020.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee</title>",Committees,17,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2007-08-09,"—It is a pleasure to follow Senator Campbell and his comments in relation to the report Workforce challenges in the transport industry. As he outlined, the report is unanimous. It did take a few visits and inspections to highlight to a number of people on the committee the skills shortage in the transport industry—and not in just road transport. I compliment the committee chair, Senator Troeth, for her excellent conduct of the inquiry and for putting herself out to go to a variety of places to see how transport operates in this country. Of course, I also compliment the officers of the committee, John Carter and Monika Kruesmann.
As Senator Campbell said, the report is unanimous—and I think that is unique for the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education. Most of the reports, as I recall, have not been unanimous—in fact, there have been significant minority reports in relation to a number of the inquiries conducted by this committee. As Senator Campbell outlined, this is just the beginning and should not be seen as a panacea for the difficulties that employers are facing with skills shortages in the transport industry. I am sure that Senator Sterle will comment on this as well. To a large degree, particularly in the road transport industry, they have no-one to blame but themselves.
The organisations that represent workers in that industry—whether it is the TWU, the RBTU or others—have highlighted for some time the difficulties that are being faced as a result of these skills shortages. What is the answer of these companies to those shortages? They think there are two answers. Firstly, they think it is good to rort the system at the moment for traineeships and just train existing employees. Most of the money that goes to these traineeships goes to existing employees; 90 per cent of the money that these companies have access to goes to people already on their payroll. They do not go down any avenue to make sure that they have at least the 4,500 entrants that are required to come into the industry each year. So who is to blame? They are, themselves. What is their other solution? Their other solution is to try to import truck drivers through the use of the 457 visa, which is also commented on in the report. We must say that we do not recommend that this option be considered.
Whilst conducting the inquiry, we saw some scary things occurring, including the inability of the road transport industry in particular to invest in the future. Senator George Campbell talked about the intermodal changes in road, rail et cetera. We went to Australian National in Melbourne, and they told us that they cannot get men to drive trucks for car carrying, because they are not available—they are just not there—so they have to fit out trains to cart cars across from the west to the east. It is not any cheaper to put it on rail and it is not cheaper to go by road—it is almost neutral—but there are no men or women out there to do this work. I hope that the government and the department look at the recommendations in the report. They were considered seriously by the members of the committee. We see this as one way to point the government and the industry in the direction in which to deal with the pending skills shortage in the road transport industry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee</title>",Committees,17,1
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2007-08-09,"—I would like to add my comments on the committee’s inquiry into workforce challenges in the transport industry. I support the comments of my colleagues Senator Hutchins and Senator George Campbell. Like Senator Hutchins, I have an undying interest in the transport industry. Senator Hutchins and I are the only truck drivers represented in the Senate, and we are quite proud of that. We travelled the country with the support of Senator Troeth, the chair, who, I must add, did a wonderful job in chairing the committee. We had numerous submissions. Sadly, the submissions were all the same: ‘What have we got ourselves into?’ ‘It’s everybody else’s fault.’ ‘How can you, the government, or maybe a new government, help us out?’
A lot of positives came out of this inquiry, but, very sadly, I have to continue my comments along the lines of those of Senator Hutchins. For years and years, Senator Hutchins and I banged our heads against brick walls, arguing about the coming skills crisis that would hit the transport industry. Where will we find tomorrow’s truck drivers? Where will we find tomorrow’s forklift drivers, receival staff, even clerical and managerial staff, let alone mechanics, tyre fitters and auto-electricians? And there are the problems faced by the maritime industry and, obviously, the aviation and rail industries. As Senator George Campbell said, a raft of about eight recommendations came out of this committee, and we fully support them. Wonderfully, they were agreed to by both sides of this chamber, but we just cannot stop there.
I think that one of the saddest indictments in the transport industry is when we talk about traditional trades and trade skills. I have to say that it is very important to have the mechanics, tyre fitters, licensed aircraft maintenance engineers and the like, but who the heck is going to drive the trucks, trains and forklifts tomorrow? If you look in the West Australian newspaper, in my fine state of WA, every Saturday you will find column after column of: ‘Wanted: truck drivers.’ They are just not out there. It is not good enough to sit back on both sides of this chamber and admit that, by the year 2020, our transport task will double. Crikey—I would hate to think what it will be like by the time we get to 2020, unless we start acting now, from today.
I would also like to add that there are wonderful arguments out there about road versus rail, aviation and maritime. This comes from a transport operator and someone who has a vested interest in Australia’s future transport needs: there is a role for all modes of transport. Let us not make any mistake: what rail does, it does very well; what the road industry does, it does very well as well. But we must acknowledge this point: apart from a newborn baby, I cannot think of anything in Australia that is not delivered on the back of a truck. Whether we like it or not, we have to have infrastructure: roads, ports and railway lines. We could have the most efficient railway lines in the world running between our great states and cities, but the goods have to get to the rail yard on the back of a truck. I know that our industry—I still say ‘our industry’, proudly—is not the most popular industry. As is highlighted in the report, the work is done mostly in the wee small hours. When we sit down as Australians and open up our newspaper and our packet of Weeties or pop the bread into the toaster, we do not give any thought to how those goods got to our tables. We know they came from Woolies or Coles, but how did they get there from the farms, the factories and all sides of manufacturing?
I would like to add a few more comments before I conclude. As Senator Hutchins said, sadly, the transport industry wants to make up every excuse for why it has got itself into this pickle. Senator Hutchins is correct. I was part of the implementation of the existing employee traineeships in Western Australia back in 2000, alongside the employers’ representatives from the Transport Forum, the peak body representing transport employers in Western Australia. About $8 million was injected into training, which we supported fully. We supported it fully for a number of reasons. Firstly, we saw the impending crisis coming. Secondly, we wanted to have transport workers’ skills recognised. Up until the last couple of years, transport workers, whether they be truck drivers, receivals staff, forkies, freezer workers or whatever, were never classified as skilled workers; they were never classified as tradespeople.
The committee had a number of submissions from people representing large transport who had the audacity to sit there and say that because of the crisis that the industry has got itself into—using all this money to train existing employees, as Senator Hutchins said—they have not invested one single cent in training new trainees or in apprenticeships. I will tell you why they have not: because of the fear that, if they had to recognise transport workers as skilled workers or tradespeople, lo and behold, the truckies, the forkies and the receivals staff might ask to be paid appropriately. But I will save that debate for another day.
I would like to thank Dr John Carter and Monika Kruesmann, from the committee. They were absolutely valuable to the committee and they assisted us all the way. I would also like to add that the situation we are faced with in transport is not going to be resolved by the two main practices that are happening in the transport industry today. One is poaching. The transport industry cannot help itself. One transport company will let the other companies do a little in-house training that is not recognised through any skills process and then will poach those drivers with the promise of an extra rupiah per hour, or whatever it may be. That is not going to solve the problem. We must have quality training. As a government, through the department and all facets of the transport industry—employers and employees alike—we must offer a skilled framework. We must offer recognition of those skills. If we have to call them tradespeople, that will be a fantastic day for transport workers in this country.
We cannot go to sleep now. To use a trucking colloquialism, the last thing we want to do is to fall asleep at the wheel. The ball has started rolling. It is not just about bricklayers, carpenters, gasfitters and plumbers. Transport employs hundreds of thousands of Australians, directly and indirectly. We cannot take our eyes off the ball. This must be only the first footprint in what we do to meet Australia’s transport needs going into the future.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2007-08-09,"—I rise to speak on the same topic: the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education entitled Workforce challenges in the transport industry. Firstly, I want to thank all members of the committee and, in particular, the chairman, Senator Judith Troeth, for her leadership. I note the camaraderie and the support that we had from all sides on that inquiry. It was illuminating for me. I learnt a great deal. I acknowledge other members of the Senate, including Senator Sterle, who have a special interest in this matter. It is part of his history and experience. The committee went to various parts of Australia. As I said, I learnt a great deal from the evidence of the witnesses and the various submissions that were presented to the committee.
I note the chairman’s comments in the preface about the support of all members of the Senate committee for this report and the summary of findings and recommendations. Before noting the important findings and recommendations, I want to acknowledge John Carter, the secretary of the committee, and Monika, for their work and their team. I thank them for their support over the many months.
I want to highlight that, in the report, the committee found that there are workforce challenges facing every sector of the transport industry—roads and railways, shipping and aviation. The report notes:
To varying degrees, industry finds difficulty attracting and retaining employees, and particularly young employees, whose entry into the industry is necessary to replace a workforce which is ageing and looking to retirement. Younger workers are deterred by poor industry image, more attractive career prospects in other industries (particularly mining), and lack of coordination and appropriateness of training regimes.
These problems add further operational pressure to employers who are already facing tight profit margins, and who may sometimes struggle under complex regulatory and compliance regimes. A particular difficulty here relates to the variations in transport related legislation and regulation between different jurisdictions.
That was patently clear at the various committee meetings that we had. The report goes on:
The need to address these workforce challenges is becoming urgent in the face of estimates that the national freight task will double by 2020.
That is an amazing statistic and a concerning one. The report continues:
There is a critical relationship between Australia’s reliance on commodities for economic growth, a successful commodities industry and effective transport and logistics. It is vital that these workforce challenges, which may compromise the transport industry’s effectiveness, be addressed.
Some action has been taken, by both industry and government stakeholders, and the committee commends this progress. However, much work remains to be done, and the recommendation of this report may serve as a guide in where effort, investment and policy focus should be directed at the highest priorities.
I support the report and commend it to the Senate.

I note the camaraderie and the support that we had from all sides on that inquiry. It was illuminating for me. I learnt a great deal. I acknowledge other members of the Senate, including Senator Sterle, who have a special interest in this matter. It is part of his history and experience. The committee went to various parts of Australia. As I said, I learnt a great deal from the evidence of the witnesses and the various submissions that were presented to the committee.
I note the chairman’s comments in the preface about the support of all members of the Senate committee for this report and the summary of findings and recommendations. Before noting the important findings and recommendations, I want to acknowledge John Carter, the secretary of the committee, and Monika, for their work and their team. I thank them for their support over the many months.
I want to highlight that, in the report, the committee found that there are workforce challenges facing every sector of the transport industry—roads and railways, shipping and aviation. The report notes:
To varying degrees, industry finds difficulty attracting and retaining employees, and particularly young employees, whose entry into the industry is necessary to replace a workforce which is ageing and looking to retirement. Younger workers are deterred by poor industry image, more attractive career prospects in other industries (particularly mining), and lack of coordination and appropriateness of training regimes.
These problems add further operational pressure to employers who are already facing tight profit margins, and who may sometimes struggle under complex regulatory and compliance regimes. A particular difficulty here relates to the variations in transport related legislation and regulation between different jurisdictions.
That was patently clear at the various committee meetings that we had. The report goes on:
The need to address these workforce challenges is becoming urgent in the face of estimates that the national freight task will double by 2020.
That is an amazing statistic and a concerning one. The report continues:
There is a critical relationship between Australia’s reliance on commodities for economic growth, a successful commodities industry and effective transport and logistics. It is vital that these workforce challenges, which may compromise the transport industry’s effectiveness, be addressed.
Some action has been taken, by both industry and government stakeholders, and the committee commends this progress. However, much work remains to be done, and the recommendation of this report may serve as a guide in where effort, investment and policy focus should be directed at the highest priorities.
I support the report and commend it to the Senate.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2007-08-09,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Postal Corporation Amendment (Quarantine Inspection and Other Measures) Bill 2007. Labor regards this bill as a sensible approach to address legislative anomalies and introduce amendments to the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 for the benefit of the wider community. This bill has been developed in consultation with state and territory governments and Australia Post.
One of the key aims of this legislation is to prevent the spread of pest species between states and territories. The bill will implement recommendations from the 2004 Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee report Turning back the tide: the invasive species challenge and the 2005 House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry report Taking control: a national approach to pest animals.
The bill will prevent the spread of pest species between states and territories by providing for the inspection and examination for interstate quarantine purposes of postal articles carried by Australia Post. The bill aims to remove the legislative anomalies that see the prohibition of inspection and examination for quarantine purposes of interstate articles carried by Australia Post, except in certain circumstances, and see Australia Post subject to different inspection regimes from those of other interstate carriers. This is a sensible approach and one which Labor supports.
The bill also allows for the disclosure of scam mail articles to consumer protection agencies to ensure households are protected from scam mail. Labor supports the scam mail provisions of the bill as they address the issue of scam mail and implement the recommendations of the consumer protection agencies, which have been concerned by the increasing amount of scam mail received by households throughout Australia.
Further, the bill introduces amendments to reflect the operation of the GST and the wine equalisation tax or WET. The bill provides that, where an authorised examiner has reasonable grounds to believe that an international mail article may contain an item on which GST or wine tax is payable, they may open that article. This amendment is sensible and ensures an equitable system of taxation and import duties is imposed on all.
The bill also introduces an amendment to ensure that Australia Post may request information from a compliance agency so that it can comply with its obligations under the Universal Postal Convention.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-08-09,"—Given the hour, I seek leave to have my speech on the second reading of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 2007 incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—

I rise to speak on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 2007.


The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to effectively extend the transition period enabling “therapeutic” devices currently “listed” or “registered” in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG), to be entered in the ARTG as “medical” devices under the regulatory scheme introduced by the Government in 2002.
  


The Bill also makes consequential amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Act (No. 1) 2006 and the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Medical Devices) Act 2002.


Labor will be supporting the passage of the Bill through the parliament.


By way of background—the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) is a computer database of therapeutic goods, established under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and administered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).


Therapeutic goods listed on the Register are divided broadly into two classes—medicines and medical devices.


The new regulatory framework for “medical” devices is contained in Chapter 4 of the Act, which commenced operation on 4 October 2002.


The new regulatory framework provided for two transition periods to enable “therapeutic” devices currently “listed” or “registered” in the ARTG under the old regulatory scheme, set out in Chapter 3 of the Act, to be entered in the ARTG as “medical” devices under the new scheme (Chapter 4 of the Act) by either 4 October 2004 or 4 October 2007.


The first transition period, established through the operation of subsections 9B(1), 15A(5) and 15A(6) of the Act, ended on 4 October 2004 and required sponsors of previously exempt medical devices and some medical devices that were no longer excluded from the operation of the Act to have their devices included in the ARTG.


The second transition period, established in subsection 9B(2) of the Act, ends on 4 October 2007. The effect of current subsection 9B(2) is that therapeutic devices “registered’ or ‘listed’ in the ARTG under Chapter 3 of the Act will be taken to have been cancelled on 4 October 2007 or, if entered in the ARTG as an “included” medical device under Chapter 4 of the Act before that date, the date on which the inclusion takes effect.


The effect of cancelling the registration or listing of a therapeutic device under Chapter 3 of the Act is to prevent the sponsor of those therapeutic devices from continuing to market them to the general public.


The need for the amendments before us today arises because of delays in implementing the new regulatory scheme for medical devices, introduced by the Government in 2002.


The introduction of the new regulatory scheme necessitated that more than 30,000 “medical” devices be re-assessed by the TGA in order to transition from the old to the new scheme.


We understand from both the Government and industry groups that this requirement for re-assessment has posed significant challenges to both the TGA and the medical device industry, with the result that it now appears that all of the necessary re-assessments will be completed by the 4 October 2007 transition deadline.


The amendments in this Bill seek to effectively extend the transition period. The Bill substitutes the existing requirement for medical device sponsors to have their products entered in the ARTG as “included” medical devices by 4 October 2007 with a requirement to lodge an application with the intention of transitioning their products to the new scheme by 4 October 2007.


These amendments effectively allow for the continued supply of devices until such time as the TGA has completed its assessment of the compliance of the device, rather than mandatory cancellation on 4 October 2007.


In the absence of these amendments some medical devices would be prevented from being marketed for public use, not only adversely affecting the commercial supply of medical devices to the general public—interrupting access by patients and health practitioners—but also potentially undermining the domestic medical devices industry—with particular commercial disadvantage for sponsors of such devices.


Labor has sought views from industry representatives and understands that they support this legislation.


The Bill commences, or is taken to have commenced, on 3 October 2007.


According to the Explanatory Memorandum there are no significant financial implications.


Labor supports this legislation because we understand, firstly, that the potential disruption to the supply of medical devices could undermine consumer access to vital medical devices, and this sort of disruption should obviously be avoided.


Secondly, Labor supports the Bill because it will also ensure certainty of continued supply of such devices in health care facilities and help maintain consumer confidence in the health system.


Finally, Labor supports the amendments because they will remove uncertainty within the industry and ensure that the economic viability of Australian medical device companies is not undermined by the delays in the new regulatory scheme.


In conclusion, as I said at the outset, Labor will be supporting the Bill.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-08-09,"—I seek leave to have my contribution to the debate on the National Health Amendment (National HPV Vaccination Program Register) Bill 2007 incorporated in Hansard, but, in doing so, I want to recall the actions of the late Senator Jeannie Ferris and the work that she did in order to get 22 women senators in this place to sign the letter that went to the minister, making very strong representations on behalf of those 22 senators to register Gardasil on the schedule.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—

I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (National HPV Vaccination Program Register) Bill 2007.


The purpose of the Bill is to amend the National Health Act 1953 by inserting a new s.9BA, providing for the establishment of the National Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Program Register.


Labor played an important role in pushing the Government towards including Gardasil, the first vaccine available to treat some strains of HPV, on the National Immunisation Program (NIP). Naturally we will support these measures to establish the Register as they will enhance the efficiency of the National HPV Vaccination Program.


By way of background, HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, mostly affecting women 20 to 24 years of age. Almost all abnormal Pap smear results are caused by HPV. In 98 per cent of cases, HPV clears by itself. In rare cases, if the virus persists and if left undetected, it can lead to cervical cancer.


Cervical cancer kills around 200 women in Australia each year.


Gardasil, developed by former Australian of the Year Professor Ian Frazer, was the first vaccine available that protects against some of the cancer causing strains of HPV, notably HPV strains 16 and 18 which cause around 70 per cent of all cervical cancers.


Senators would recall that late last year CSL Limited, the Australian manufacturer and distributor of Gardasil, sought to alleviate the market cost of the vaccine—$460 for a course of three shots—to Australian families and applied to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Council (PBAC) for Gardasil to be listed on the National Immunisation Program.


The PBAC in November 2006 knocked back CSL’s original application. Unsurprisingly, there was an outcry from health stakeholders, patients groups and pharmaceutical companies.


I’m proud to say that Labor—including my colleague the former Shadow Minister for Health Julia Gillard—was vocal in demanding that PBAC’s decision be urgently reviewed.


Senators would recall that 22 women Senators—from all parties—signed a letter to the Health Minister Tony Abbott saying that while they recognised the careful analysis that the PBAC undertakes in making these decisions, they believed this particular decision required urgent review.


Eventually, after Prime Ministerial intervention, the Minister saw sense and requested PBAC to consider a new application from CSL, in which some of the main initial concerns raised by PBAC were addressed.


Gardasil was subsequently approved for inclusion on the NIP at an extraordinary PBAC meeting in late November and on 29 November 2006 the Government announced that it would fund free HPV vaccine for females in the 12 to 26 year old age group under NIP. The establishment of a HPV Register was also announced at that time.


Turning now to the legislation before us: this Bill inserts a new s.9BA into the National Health Act 1953 providing for the establishment of the National Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Program Register.


According to new subs 9BA(3), the purposes of the Register are to ensure the successful implementation of the National HPV Vaccination Program, and in doing so facilitate the establishment and maintenance of an electronic database of records for monitoring vaccination of participants in the HPV Program.


Broadly speaking, the establishment of the Register will assist in the administration of the vaccination program itself, provide a means to monitor participants in the Program and assist in monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of HPV vaccine in preventing certain cervical cancers.


It is intended that the HPV Register will collect information about the vaccination program, including personal identifying details, details about the doses given and the immunisation provider.


Labor acknowledges that there will be some in the community who will have privacy concerns around the collection of such data.


On this issue I note that the Bill provides for women or the parents of girls to have information removed from the Register following a request in writing—an “Opt Off” register which reflects the arrangements that have already been in place in Australian State/Territory-based Pap test registers. No information about sexual history will be sought or recorded, and the Bill precludes the release of personal information except to a vaccination provider or to prescribed bodies, either through regulation or as prescribed in the Health Insurance Act 1973.


Labor is satisfied on this basis that the Bill adequately addresses privacy concerns.


The Register will help to monitor the effectiveness of HPV vaccine in preventing certain cervical cancers by allowing for future cross referencing of data against Pap Smear and other cervical cytology or cervical cancer registers maintained by States and Territories.


The Register will also allow for the maintenance of records tracking the HPV vaccination status of eligible persons for the purposes of certifying the completion of the course of vaccination and establish mechanisms to advise eligible persons—or the parents or guardians of children—if doses of HPV vaccine have been missed or if booster doses are required in the future.


The Register will allow for the provision of information on new developments associated with the Program to vaccination providers, eligible persons and parents or guardians of children—promoting general health and well being.


And finally the legislation provides for the payment of general practitioners who enter information in the Register.


According to the Explanatory Memorandum there is no financial impact for the Bill. Funding for the Register was approved by the Prime Minister on 20 February 2007 as part of an additional $103.5 million over five years allocated for the implementation of the HPV Program. A total cost of $8-$11 million has been allocated to build and operate the Register over 3 years.


Labor supports this Bill. As I said earlier Labor was a strong proponent of Gardasil, to treat HPV, being put on the NIP so we are keen for its implementation to be as efficient as possible and its evaluation as thorough as possible. We support all measures that are aimed at the promotion of the health and well being of Australians, and which provide assurance to young women that the Australian Government is doing everything possible to help protect them against HPV.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-08-09,"—I thank Senator McLucas for her gracious contribution. The National Health Amendment (National HPV Vaccination Program Register) Bill 2007 amends the National Health Act 1953 to insert provisions for the establishment and maintenance of a Human Papillomavirus Register to complement the implementation of the National HPV Vaccination Program. The register will collect personal and vaccination information about people who receive the HPV vaccine under the HPV program, with a view to evaluating, in the long term, the effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing the incidence of cervical cancer. The HPV register will also facilitate a number of other functions relating to the HPV program, and the payment of an administrative fee to general practitioners who provide information to the register.
In summary, this amendment will ensure the collection of information which, in addition to evaluating the success of the HPV program in reducing cervical cancer, will also inform the policy direction of the HPV program and government expenditure in the future. It will also benefit individuals participating in the HPV program by providing them with information about their vaccination status, sending notifications when doses of vaccine have been missed, and facilitating a recall system for participants in the event that booster doses are required at a future time. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-08-09,"—I seek leave to have my speech on the second reading of this very important bill, the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment (Cosmetics) Bill 2007, incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—

I rise today to speak on the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment (Cosmetics) Bill 2007.


This Bill amends the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 and provides legislative underpinning for the reform of cosmetic regulation in Australia, which has for the past several years been implemented on a on a limited, interim, administrative basis.


The proposed amendments to the Act are intended to:

provide legislative underpinning for reforms to the regulation of cosmetics as part of the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS) Low Regulatory Concern Chemicals Reform Program, and
make minor changes to the legislation to improve clarity, increase consistency in the legislation and address minor technical anomalies or unintended effects of the legislation.

Labor anticipates that this Bill will have favourable outcomes for consumers, industry and Government alike. We are particularly supportive of this Bill because legislative underpinning of the regulatory scheme for cosmetics will provide clarity for all involved in the cosmetics industry in Australia.


By way of background, the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS) is the Australian Government’s regulatory authority for industrial chemicals including domestic chemicals, personal care products and cosmetics. The Scheme was established in 1990 under the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 and is located within the Office of Chemical Safety in the Department of Health and Ageing.


NICNAS operates within a whole-of-government chemicals regulatory framework that consists of four assessment / registration schemes. In addition to the chemicals scheme operated by NICNAS, there are regulatory frameworks operated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for medicines and medical devices; by the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) for food and food additives; and by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for pesticides and veterinary medicines.


The overall aim of these regulatory structures is to provide for the health and safety of the Australian people whilst also protecting the environment.


NICNAS in particular works to encourage the safe and sustainable use of industrial chemicals, providing a national notification and assessment scheme that assesses both chemicals already in use, and chemicals new to Australia.


NICNAS assessment information is made widely available and assists state and territory OHS, public health and environmental agencies in the environmentally sound management of industrial chemicals. NICNAS assessments also provide risk and safety information to industry, workers and the public to promote greater awareness of the dangers of chemicals and advice on how to use them safely.


This Bill will amend the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 to extend the current regulatory scheme for industrial chemicals to the regulation of cosmetics, as administered by the Director of NICNAS.


Historically, cosmetics in Australia have been regulated within the Health and Ageing portfolio by both NICNAS and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). Under the Act as it currently stands, and reflecting the historical timing of the establishment of the respective regulatory agencies, a product is deemed a cosmetic if it is not a therapeutic good (medicine). This is determined with reference to claims about the product and its composition.


This approach for defining cosmetics by their exclusion as medicines has created a disconnect between Australian industries and some of Australia’s trading partners in this sector. This approach has also led to differential regulation of broadly similar products. Under the Act as it currently stands, products classified as cosmetics are regulated by NICNAS, and include an environmental assessment of chemicals in cosmetic products, while therapeutic goods came under the TGA’s regulatory umbrella and no environmental assessment is undertaken.


The move to reform the regulatory interface between cosmetics and therapeutic goods can be traced to the Australian Government’s November 2002 response to the Chemicals and Plastics Action Agenda, which included a commitment to consider and develop options for assessing and/or testing chemicals presenting low regulatory concern.


The NICNAS Low Regulatory Concern Chemicals Task Force was subsequently established to investigate the reform of the regulation of industrial chemicals of low regulatory concern. In acknowledgment of the particular regulatory challenges that cosmetics present, cosmetics were considered separately under this process, through the Low Regulatory Concern Chemicals (LRCC) Cosmetics Technical Working Group.


NICNAS and the TGA subsequently undertook an independent review of regulation of products at the cosmetic/therapeutic interface in 2004-05. A draft discussion paper, Review of the regulation of products at the interface between cosmetics and therapeutic goods, was published in March 2005 for public comment. Eighty-five written responses to this review were received from a wide range of stakeholders including representatives of industry, consumers, regulators, medical practitioners and healthcare interest groups. There was overwhelming support for the proposed reforms from a majority of respondents.


The Government’s response to the independent review was published on 1 November 2005 (the Regulation of Cosmetic Chemicals: Final Report and Recommendations) and the Cosmetic Reforms Implementation Working Group (IWG)—comprising community, industry and Government representatives—was established to finalise the NICNAS Cosmetic Guidelines.


The Cosmetic Guidelines consist of a set of “cascading” instruments which comprise:

Criteria for Defining Cosmetics,
a Table of Product Categories including mandated conditions to ensure compliance with performance or other standards as required, and
a new mechanism for publicly identifying those chemicals that are prohibited or restricted for use in cosmetics in Australia.

The NICNAS Cosmetic Guidelines have provided the administrative basis for the interim regulation of some cosmetic products. According to the Explanatory Memorandum, permits have been issued by NICNAS which allow for the specified product to be regulated as a cosmetic under the interim arrangements, provided that the product complies with the NICNAS Cosmetic Guidelines. This arrangement has now been in place for 12 months and over 200 products are subject to the arrangements.


The Government has cited a number of reasons for now seeking legislative underpinning of these guidelines.


Firstly, these interim administrative arrangements have only applied to a limited set of cosmetics – for example, skin-whitening products and anti-ageing products have not been subject to compliance. According to the Explanatory Memorandum, the system has been difficult to properly enforce and there is currently no capacity to penalise companies for non-compliance. There is also no capacity to charge fees from the regulated companies for cosmetic permits issued under the interim administrative arrangements, which the Government has argued is not consistent with best practice.


This Bill therefore seeks to implement the reforms on a legislative rather than an administrative basis and to extend the reforms to additional types of cosmetics.


The Bill establishes a system of notification and assessment of industrial chemicals to protect health, safety and the environment, and to provide for registration of certain persons proposing to introduce industrial chemicals. It provides for the Minister to determine standards, by legislative instrument, for cosmetics imported into, or manufactured in, Australia – having regard to Australia’s international obligations.


As I said earlier, Labor supports this Bill.


The legislative rather than administrative underpinning of the NICNAS Cosmetics Guidelines will help to clarify the regulatory roles and responsibilities of NICNAS and the TGA with respect to cosmetic chemicals. The changes will increase the Government’s capacity to monitor and enforce compliance with the Guidelines and to take action in the event of non-compliance.


A legislative rather than administrative framework will also provide greater clarity and certainty for industry, helping to reduce inconsistencies in the level of regulation for cosmetic products and removing subsequent barriers to trade arising from regulation.


Most importantly, regulation of cosmetics by NICNAS ensures consumer confidence in cosmetic products. All products regulated as cosmetics by NICNAS will require full ingredients disclosure on the labels (not currently the case for products regulated as therapeutics by the TGA) and will include an environmental assessment of chemicals in the cosmetic products (again not involved in a TGA assessment).


Consumers can be assured that cosmetics are subject to NICNAS oversight in areas such as the protection of public health, occupational health and safety and the environment.


In summary, Labor is confident that this Bill will help all parties involved in the cosmetic industry to maintain confidence in NICNAS’ regulatory processes.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-09,"—The Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) Bill 2007 has been a long time coming. In fact, it has been nearly a decade since these measures were first discussed, and during that decade, which is most of my time in this place, I have been campaigning for amendments along these lines.
The Australian Democrats have worked hard to achieve a well-regulated corporate sector in Australia. It has always made sense to me that to have an effective corporate sector you must have a well-regulated, modernised corporate insolvency program. I proposed the inquiry, and the result was the June 2004 Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services report titled Corporate insolvency laws: a stocktake. It was a good report, if I may say so.
After two years, the coalition government responded favourably to that report, but it has still taken until late 2007 for the legislation to come forward. I do recognise that there was ongoing and quite considerable consultation between Treasury, ASIC and external stakeholders during that time, as well as the distribution of the exposure draft to the bill, and the committee report on that exposure draft earlier this year. However, it has been a slow process, and many Australians have been negatively impacted because of the delay in these reforms coming through.
In contrast to a determined and sprightly reform agenda for Corporations Law, the coalition has dragged its heels on insolvency reform. We have watched the misery on the faces of employees done over because their entitlements have been lost. We have seen the blight of phoenix companies in the building industry and property development. We have seen creditors and investors taken for a ride.
According to the Bills Digest, the purpose of the Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) Bill 2007 is to implement a package of reforms to improve Australia’s insolvency laws. There are six schedules to the bill, and the amendments to the Corporations Act by each schedule deal with the following reform themes.
Schedule 1 seeks to improve outcomes for creditors by: enhancing protection for employee entitlements; better informing creditor decisions; streamlining external administration; and facilitating pooling in external administration. Schedule 2 will implement measures to deter corporate misconduct. Schedule 3 has measures to improve regulation of insolvency practitioners. Schedule 4 includes measures to finetune voluntary administration in respect of rights to property during administration and liquidation following administration. Schedule 5 deals with miscellaneous amendments, including priority of administrative expenses in voluntary liquidation. Schedule 6 deals with transitional measures. According to the explanatory memorandum there is no direct revenue or financial impact from this legislation for the government.
Schedule 1 is welcome. Although it does not exactly reflect the recommendation of the Stocktake report, it does improve the position of employee entitlements. It does make it mandatory that the deed of company arrangement provides priority to employee creditors in a winding-up, unless the employees agree to waive the priority or the court makes an order differing from that.
I note that if a dispute arises, there is provision for creditors as a whole and eligible employee creditors to have the matter resolved by a court and the action can be initiated by the administrator so that an eligible employee creditor or an interested party is catered for. Although this is not ideal, and often employees may not feel in a position to initiate action to recover their entitlements, at least the avenue is now there and hopefully if an employee has been duped out of a significant sum of money then they would be motivated or able to bring an action.
The bill clarifies the way in which the superannuation guarantee charge should be treated in insolvency. The provisions ensure that the superannuation guarantee charge is given the highest priority, along with wages and entitlements that employees enjoy under the law. As has been pointed out, this significantly improves the recovery prospect of outstanding superannuation entitlements, if an employer becomes insolvent.
The bill also provides that insolvency practitioners will be under greater scrutiny and they must declare any prior advisory or other relevant relationships with the company to the creditors, and provide timely information on the fees they will charge. ASIC is working together with the IPAA on administrator independence. Although this is now enshrined in legislation, it has been part of the IPAA’s best practice guide since 2003. Such legislative change means that high-quality practitioners, who set the bar for quality work, will not have to change their practice at all, while those who have been doing less than is required are now legally obliged to meet that standard.
The report from the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services also looked at the practice of phoenix companies, where a company is established, it goes bust and assets are transferred to another company, those involved with the company continue trading in the second company, while the creditors of the first company are left high and dry. And then unscrupulous business people repeat the process again and again. These companies avoid their liabilities to their creditors and to their employees. This was a practice endemic in the building industry for many years and it appears now to have gravitated to the property development area.
In response to the Stocktake report, the government and ASIC established the Assetless Administration Fund. This fund was established to finance investigations by liquidators into cases where it appeared to ASIC that further investigation and reporting may lead to enforcement actions. This combined effort, using the skills of insolvency practitioners in the private sector, paid for through the Assetless Administration Fund, provides ASIC with information to identify and pursue misconduct by company officers in the lead-up to company failure.
According to ASIC’s website, in 2006 they banned 40 directors for a total of 144 years for engaging in misconduct following company failures and repeat phoenix activity. Of those 40 bannings, 15 were based on information provided by liquidators who received funding from the Assetless Administration Fund, and ASIC further banned 25 people as part of its efforts against phoenix activity. I point out that it was the corporations committee that first focused ASIC’s mind on phoenix behaviour. I commend the government for the level of funding that it is willing to provide to ASIC to continue with this important work.
When the Stocktake report came out in 2004, the committee was looking back at a couple of the most spectacular corporate failures in Australian history: HIH and One.Tel. Now, as I make these remarks, we know that those two were not the end of it. In the last couple of years we have watched with some horror as Westpoint, Fincorp, Bridgecorp and others have collapsed, taking with them much of the life savings of those Australians who had invested in them.
Although this bill addresses one aspect of insolvency in Australia, there is still the ability of corporations to limit their liability by restructuring their companies using related companies to deprive creditors, including employees, of access to assets when a subsidiary collapses. In fact, this government at the end of the last sitting passed the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Restructures) Bill 2007, which created a legal mechanism whereby companies could achieve this through non-operating holding companies. As I have said previously, when companies were originally conceived, it was intended that they would provide a benefit of limited liability to their owners—namely, the shareholders. It was not intended that they should be able to be manipulated to allow for the separation of assets in one company and liabilities in another, resulting in those to whom money is owed having access to no significant assets to satisfy their entitlements or not being able to recover liabilities from the parent or holding company.
On behalf of the Democrats, I have several times over the last decade brought an amendment to the Senate in an attempt to implement the recommendations of the Harmer Law Reform Commission report in 1988. Harmer proposed making related companies liable for the debts of insolvent companies in limited circumstances. With those limited circumstances it would still be up to a court to consider matters like the extent to which the related company took part in the management of the insolvent company, the conduct of the related company towards the creditors of the insolvent company and the extent to which the circumstances that gave rise to the winding-up are attributable to the actions of the related company.
Labor has supported these Democrat initiatives a number of times in the Senate, but for the same number of times the coalition has refused what I regard as an obvious reform. Its refusal continues to benefit those who wish to abuse the system. In the light of the new legislation before us and of the government’s refusal to adopt that particular aspect of the Harmer Law Reform Commission Report, this legislation is welcome, but I fear that it will not be as effective as it could be in the circumstances without the Harmer Law Reform Commission’s recommendation being put into law.
Since the Stocktake report of 2004, the government has been in ongoing consultation with a number of industry bodies and stakeholders, as was evidenced by the corporations committee March 2007 report on the Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) Bill 2007 exposure draft and the Corporations and Australian Securities and Investments Commission Amendment Regulations 2007 exposure draft. The committee commented that evidence received during that inquiry justified the committee’s decision to revisit a number of recommendations from its 2004 Stocktake report. I hope that the government will take them into account and respond favourably to them. In 2007 the committee reported that it found either in-principle or strong support for most of the recommendations rejected by the government from the accounting bodies, the IPAA and the Law Council. It is unfortunate these were not included in this legislation; it is unfortunate the committee’s recommendations have not been brought forward.
The main insolvency and accounting bodies endorsed the exposure draft bill and stated that it reflects much needed reforms. As I said previously, the IPAA have implemented some of the aspects of this legislation in their best practice guide already and should be commended for doing so. Although the committee recommended that the bill pass before the end of the financial year 2006-07, and although that was not achieved, I am grateful that at least this bill will pass prior to the calling of the election. I have deliberately, on behalf of the Democrats, ensured that this should happen in the non-controversial period of the Senate’s deliberations.
I note in passing that Treasury has confirmed that there is probably a need for additional amending legislation relating to insolvency to address new developments, in particular those arising from the collapse of the Sons of Gwalia. I am hopeful, as I am sure are many investors and employees in Australia, that these amendments will tighten the insolvency laws considerably and that future corporate collapses will not throw up too many more shortcomings in the legislation that need to be fixed.

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2007-08-09,"—I seek leave to incorporate a speech by Senator Wong.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (INSOLVENCY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-08-09,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

The Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) Bill is a belated response to a number of recommendations made in the 1997 Review of the Regulation of Corporate Insolvency Practitioners; the 1998 Corporations and Market Advisory Committee (CAMAC) Report Corporate Voluntary Administration; the 2000 CAMAC Report Corporate Groups; the 2004 CAMAC Report Rehabilitation of Large and Complex Enterprises and the 2004 Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services Report Corporate Insolvency Laws: A Stocktake.
Updated insolvency laws that adequately respond to business practices, provide more clarity for creditors and in turn reduce the cost of obtaining finance, are vital for a strong Australian economy.
There is also the social impact of insolvency that should be considered. In 2003, the ACTU estimated that around 19,000 employees may lose up to $500 million in unpaid entitlements each year. Although other creditors may have other sources of income, employees are likely to be dependent on the wages they receive from the company and as such the impact on them is likely to be substantial.
Labor welcomes the Bill, however, a number of the changes proposed are well overdue. In particular, those relating to fine-tuning of administration processes implement CAMAC recommendations that date back to 1998. It seems extraordinary that the Howard Government has taken so long to deal with these issues.
The changes that arise from this Bill fall into four categories. These are: improving outcomes for creditors, including employees; deterring misconduct by company officers; improving regulation of insolvency practitioners and fine tuning voluntary administration procedures.
Outcomes for creditors are improved by the Bill in a number of ways. In the current system, employees are afforded a priority amongst unsecured creditors. However this priority can be displaced by a Deed of Company Arrangement. Employees have only a limited opportunity to challenge any change to this prioritisation in a deed in the event that their priority is displaced by a meeting of creditors. Changes in this Bill mean that it will now be mandatory for Deed of Company Arrangement to preserve the priority of employee entitlements when a company is in voluntary administration unless employee creditors agree to waive their priority.
The court may approve the employee creditors’ waiver and alter their priority in the Deed of Company Arrangement where it is satisfied that it would be more beneficial for employee creditors than immediate winding-up of the company.
Issues relating to the Superannuation Guarantee will also be clarified. Although the Corporations Act gives priority to superannuation contributions of employees, it has been held by the courts that the SGC, which is a statutory tax liability owed by the Commonwealth, cannot be characterised in the same way and therefore does not have the same priority.
As the SGC is related to superannuation payments and exists to ensure that the benefits for employees are received, there is a need to clarify and address the priority of the SGC in a receivership, voluntary administration or Deed of Company Arrangement, not just company liquidation.
Changes to the Superannuation Guarantee Act and the Corporations Act mean that SGC will receive the same priority as wages and superannuation contributions.
Rights of subrogated creditors, being those creditors who are entitled to be substituted for another creditor in a liquidation because they have advanced funds to meet a particular creditor’s debt, are clarified so that they have the same rights as original creditors even if an advance has not been made before the relevant date.
New disclosure requirements for administrators are introduced to address concerns about the independence of directors and make sure that creditors can make well-informed decisions when engaging administrators.
Administrators will be required to provide a declaration of any ‘relevant relationships’ and indemnities that apply to them, in a document which is a maximum of two pages in length.
Greater guidance will be given to courts to set and review remuneration of administrators and deed administrators.
A number of amendments are also made to streamline administration processes.
The requirement that a company in a creditors’ voluntary liquidation hold an annual members’ meeting will be removed as the economic interests of those members is not substantial enough when balanced against the cost of these meetings. However, if the liquidator choses not to call an annual meeting of creditors, then they must lodge a report with ASIC on the progress of the administration and notify creditors that the report will be available to creditors free of charge.
In the case of a members’ voluntary liquidation, where the economic interest is generally greater, the requirement for an annual meeting is retained.
Various requirements to publish notices and documents will also be made redundant unless there is a strong policy rationale for the publication of relevant documents.
The Bill will also allow various notices to be published together to reduce costs.
Electronic communication will now be made available to administrators for the distribution of notices to creditors provided that certain conditions are met. Currently electronic distribution is only available to notify members of meetings.
In order to increase the opportunity to recoup funds for creditors, two types of pooling orders in liquidation, voluntary and court ordered, will be made available.
Voluntary pooling will be able to occur where the liquidator of a group of companies that are all in the process of winding up makes a determination that the group of companies can be pooled for the purposes of liquidation.
Courts will be empowered to order that a group of companies is pooled for the purposes of winding-up. An application for court-ordered pooling may only be made by the liquidator or liquidators of the companies in the group as each company in the group will be taken to be jointly and severally liable for each debt payable by and each claim against each other company in that group.
The Bill also puts forward a number of proposal to deter corporate misconduct.
ASIC will now be able to use its compulsory powers to investigate liquidator’s conduct if it has reason to suspect for example, that they have failed to carry out or perform their duties.
Penalty privilege in relation to proceedings for disqualification, banning, suspension or cancellation orders or declarations to that effect, will be removed. This was one of the amendments sought after privilege was claimed in the High Court’s Rich v ASIC case where ASIC was unable to obtain certain documents in relation to the relevant orders.
Banning and disqualification orders, and orders to cancel or suspend licenses will help deter misconduct of company officers including in relation to phoenix company activity.
Insolvency practitioners will be better regulated under new provisions.
Prohibitions on inducements to members or creditors of a company to secure an appointment will now be extended to include persons such as directors, providers of professional services such as accounting and legal firms.
Registered liquidators will have to obtain and maintain professional indemnity and fidelity insurance to cover their work as insolvency practitioners.
The requirement that registered liquidators provide triennial statements to ASIC will be replaced with a requirement that a detailed statement be provided annually. This means that a liquidator’s suitability for registration will be reviewed more regularly.
ASIC will be able to cancel the registration of a liquidator automatically where the liquidator becomes disqualified from managing a corporation or by reason of bankruptcy and where the liquidator does not maintain their insurance. An application will no longer need to be made to the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board (CALDB) first.
The CALDB will be given more flexibility to deal with disciplinary matters. For example, it will be able to hold a pre-hearing conference to determine procedural matters.
Small changes will be made to increase the efficiency of voluntary administration procedures.
New provisions will allow administrators to sell property subject to a lien, pledge or retention of title clause if they have the written consent of the property owner or security holder, or with the leave of court. Administrators will also be able to consent to transfer of shares if they are satisfied that it is in the best interests of the company as a whole.
The Bill will allow slightly longer periods to pass before the first and second meetings of creditors are required to be held. There will also be some slight amendments to change ‘days’ to ‘business days’ which will consequently affect the timing for things such as when notices for meetings must be given.
Labor notes the consultation with stakeholders in the insolvency area such as the Insolvency Law Advisory Group and the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia. And, as required by the Corporations Act, the amendments under this Bill have also been approved by the states and territories through the Ministerial Council for Corporations.
Labor supports this Bill in the interests of modernising Australia’s corporate insolvency regime. We reiterate our concern that the Howard Government has moved so slowly in relation to reforms in this area, particularly given the number of reports recommending changes dating back to 1997.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (INSOLVENCY) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-08-09,"—I would like to acknowledge Senator Murray’s longstanding interest in the area of insolvency. I note his admonishment of the government’s performance and also his mild congratulations. I thank him for his contribution this afternoon.
As Senator Murray said, the Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) Bill 2007 contains a comprehensive set of reforms that will modernise our insolvency laws and assist Australian businesses. The bill will improve protections for employee entitlements. The bill also contains groundbreaking reforms in respect of corporate groups to reduce costs and improve returns without exposing creditors to new risks. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-08-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by  Opposition senators today.
What we face today is a simple question: do Australians have a government that is run on sound economic principles and rigorous policy development processes, working for the benefit of all Australian working families, or do we have a government with only one guiding principle that is defined by the marketing spin of research agency Crosby Textor? We have a government that will do anything and say anything to win office at the forthcoming election. That is what we have; we do not have the former at all. Let us look at the evidence that underpins that. It is clear that, in the face of continuing challenging polls, the Prime Minister, over recent weeks, flicked the switch to portray himself as a strong man aggressively attacking the states, as a proxy for the federal Labor Party, rather than taking on the federal Labor Party itself. Suddenly, we have a Prime Minister announcing major national policy initiatives via the internet—one of them on emissions trading. We have a government that is reaching out to cherry-pick opportunities for government largesse. That is what the government is now forcing itself to do. In another era—and the National Party would obviously recognise this—it would quite rightly have been seen as blatant pork-barrelling, all wrapped up in an attempt to redefine federalism.
But the commentators see through this. Indeed, some have called the Howard government’s approach ‘porkofederalism’. Here is what one senior commentator, Paul Kelly, had to say in the Australian yesterday:
… Howard will play a brand of federalism politics that is neither likely to work nor to endure as a template for governance.
The government is well and truly caught out by its agenda being set by its marketing strategy. But let us go back to Crosby Textor. Rather than having a long-running agenda for the nation that takes account of the needs and interests of Australian working families, we have total short-termism. It is a pity, it is a shame, but that is the corner this government has painted itself into. It is designed for only one reason: purely to get the PM across the line at the forthcoming poll. That is the only reason. Otherwise we would not have Crosby Textor out there, and we would not have the Prime Minister following those lines, one by one, to see how he can ensure his success at the next election.
But isn’t it ironic that, in the very week when Australian working families suffered their fifth successive interest rate increase since the PM promised to keep interest rates at record lows, they will also read on the front page of their newspapers the details of the Crosby Textor marketing strategy that underpins the Howard government approach? This is how it stands: working Australians are now juggling their family and work commitments, increased consumer prices, increased uncertainty over their working conditions and an increased realisation that their children and future generations will face major challenges from lack of adequate educational and other critical infrastructure—whether it be access to broadband, skills shortages, being able to access affordable skills and training, healthcare services or a market-driven insecure job market under Work Choices. Working families now face all those challenges under the Howard government.
What does the Prime Minister have to say about this? Let us listen to his words: ‘They’ve never been better off.’ It rings very hollow if you are in the western suburbs, the outer suburbs, of Brisbane, Cairns or Townsville—all of those places. ‘Never been better off’, when the press this week reported that people are forgoing payments on health insurance to have the money to pay their mortgage. ‘Never been better off’, when families have to give up some of the little luxuries they may enjoy when they want to go out, when they might want to go to the pictures or take their kids down to the local eatery—all of those things. This is a government that has grown out of touch over its 11 years. It has become arrogant. (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2007-08-09,"—It is interesting to listen to Senator Ludwig talk about economic management and the benefits for families. Like many people in this place, I can recall when the only outing a family could really have under a Labor government was a trip down to the social security office to collect their unemployment cheque. There were not too many restaurants thriving under that circumstance. It was when unemployment in this country was virtually the highest it has been, certainly in recent history. We had interest rates averaging 12½ per cent under the former Labor government. And what do we have now? We have a circumstance where they are playing ‘me too’ politics: ‘We’re just the same on economic and fiscal policy as the Liberal Party, but we’re a little bit better.’ It is simply not going to wash with the Australian people. The Australian people understand that going to Labor in pursuit of economic policy is like having a decaf cappuccino in an attempt to stay awake: it is froth and chocolate, but there is no stimulus at all. Nothing in any of the policies that have been put forward by the Labor Party is going to create a better country or a more prosperous nation.
There are the working families of this country—and I note ‘working families’ because they are working, unlike they were under the Labor administration, when unemployment was so high. They were not working; people were going broke; they could not afford to pay for their homes. In fact, homeownership was terrible under the Labor administration. But today’s working families are awake to the master illusionists on the other side of the chamber. They are the David Copperfields of economic management. They have no policies; they only have smoke and mirrors to say, ‘We’re just like the others, but, trust us, we’re going to be a little bit better.’ How can we trust them when they have objected to every economic reform in this country that has delivered prosperity to so many Australian families? Unemployment is at record lows: 4.3 per cent. Owning a home, going on outings and enjoying the good things that this country offers start with having a job. Jobs mean a lot to families. People have flexibility in their workplace, so they can divide their time between their work and their family commitments. It allows flexibility so that people can enjoy everything that this country has to offer.
Of course, we have heard a lot today about interest rates. As I said, interest rates are lower under this government, and, since we took office, the official cash rate is still a full 100 basis points—that is, a full percentage point—lower than when we took office. This is after 11 years of sustained economic growth, where net household wealth has increased, the percentage of debt on housing assets has decreased, more people than ever before in this country have work, and people recognise that this legacy of prosperity can set us up for another decade of wealth accumulation in Australia. But only a coalition government can actually deliver on those sorts of reforms. Only the coalition has an agenda that is going to set up this country for another decade of sustained economic growth.
So, rather than the ‘me too’ politics, the Kevin-come-lately politics of Kevin07, there is now a clear choice for the Australian people. They can go with the unreliable Labor people who have objected to every significant economic reform. I think it was Senator Ludwig’s father who described it as the worst caucus he had ever seen—or was that last year’s caucus? I cannot remember; there have been so many. Nonetheless, the same faces are there. They keep trotting them out because of their union mandated quotas. It is very sad that the Labor Party have not managed to evolve over the time, but the Liberal Party and the coalition government have. We are still setting a sustainable agenda. Our approach is not simply about housing affordability; it is about ensuring that people have well-paying jobs, lifting real wages and keeping interest rates lower than they would ever be under a Labor government.
What about the Labor Party’s response to housing affordability: ‘Let’s spend some more money and create another central housing commission.’ Nineteen-fifties central planning went out of the window in the 1950s. I know it is alive and well on the front bench of the Labor Party, but, really, the economic debate has moved on. Today is about giving people choice and opportunity, and only a coalition government is equipped to do that and deliver. (Time expired)

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2007-08-09,"—I rise to take note of answers given to questions asked by the Labor opposition today in relation to the economy. This week we have had the ninth interest rate rise since Prime Minister Howard has been at the helm of this nation, and it is the fifth since he promised to keep rates at ‘record lows’ at the last election. This interest rate rise is going to hit working families hard. With the cost of living pressures already straining many household budgets, yesterday’s decision by the Reserve Bank to lift interest rates will only add to already high levels of mortgage stress.
It is the case that yesterday’s rate rise has seriously damaged the Prime Minister’s economic credentials. It is going to make it very difficult for Australian families to believe anything that the Prime Minister says in the lead-up to this year’s election. Rather than making excuses and pointing fingers—which is what we saw today during question time, particularly from Senator Scullion, who, in answers to questions that I asked him, simply said that it is the fault of the states—this government needs to actually accept responsibility for its broken interest rate promises, get down to work and put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates.
All we see from the ministers of the Howard government, whether it be the Prime Minister himself, the Treasurer or the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin, as we saw today, is their simply pinning the blame on the state governments. But it is pretty clear, and a number of commentators have pointed out, that there is very little direct linkage between borrowing by the government and interest rates. The Chief Economist of the ANZ Bank, Saul Eslake, in the Australian on 7 August said that very thing. A number of other commentators have pointed out the fallacy in the government’s argument. For example, in the Financial Review it was reported:
The Prime Minister’s claim that his government is in the clear because it is running a budget surplus and that it is all the fault of the states and their budget deficits is nonsense.
Federal Labor, when we are elected to government, have committed ourselves to economically conservative policies that will be directed towards keeping interest rates as low as possible. We have committed ourselves to keeping a tight rein on the economy and disciplined spending, and we have said that we will run budget surpluses, on average, over the economic cycle. Labor is committed to the independence of the Reserve Bank and its inflation targeting regime. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, in his press conference earlier this week emphasised that we very much believe in the independence of the Reserve Bank and we do not intend to depart from that in any way when we are in government. What we have emphasised is that we will implement policies to fight inflation by tackling skills and labour shortages and infrastructure bottlenecks that push up business costs.
As I said at the beginning, this interest rate rise that we have seen this week is a very concerning development for Australia’s working families. And it seems from the comments that we heard here today in the Senate that the government is out of touch with the reality of working families and the pressures that are upon them. In the 11 years that the government has been in office, what we see is that whenever interest rates go down, Mr Howard and Mr Costello take credit for them, but whenever they go up, they refuse to take responsibility. It is certainly the case that Australian families expect a better response than the response that we receive from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer when it comes to changes that could be made to economic policy settings.
When it comes to fiscal policy, Labor has made it clear that it will maintain a doctrine of budget surplus. This does not mean increasing taxation as a proportion of GDP. (Time expired)

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2007-08-09,"—I rise to take note of answers. I think the first thing I should be doing is acknowledging that the government does recognise that yesterday’s interest rate rise will cause disadvantage for some homeowners, but I think this is something that we definitely need to get into perspective. If you look at the most recent Reserve Bank Financial Stability Review you find that, in fact, the household debt is concentrated among higher income households. The top 30 per cent of high-income households have more than 60 per cent of the household debt. Those at the bottom 40 per cent of the income distribution scheme have just 10 per cent of that household debt. In fact, the median debt-servicing ratio for low-income households actually fell between 2002 and 2006. It is right now that those with the best ability to service their debt have the household debt.
As Senator Scullion, the Minister for Community Services, pointed out earlier, well over half of households that have mortgages are well ahead with their payments. In fact, around 25 per cent of people with mortgages are over a year ahead with their payments. And household debt to housing assets ratios fell between 2002 and 2005. This has been particularly pronounced in the low-income households, where gearing ratios fell around 10 percentage points in that period. Seventy-five per cent of indebted homeowners have a gearing ratio of less than 60 per cent. When these people have the ability to have jobs, as they do under our government, they can service that debt.
One of the most noticeable increases was in the owner-occupier mortgage group, and that has been in the 55 to 64 age group, an age group that was, effectively, cut out of the employment situation, out of income earning, under the previous Labor government. It has been particularly noticed that amongst the 55 to 64 age group they have a very low debt-servicing ratio—very low gearing ratios—compared to other homeowners. Therefore, the biggest increase in the number of households with property debt is coming from people who have strong balance sheets and a strong ability to service that debt.
I would also like to speak briefly about the situation with arrears. The ratio of non-performing loans to total housing loans in this market is, at the moment, 0.38 per cent with Australian banks, less than half of one per cent. These standards have remained low right through the nineties and are very low by international standards. There has been a slight increase in mortgage sales, but that too has remained low. The basic fact here is that, under our government, interest rates remain an average four per cent lower than they were under the Labor government. People actually have the jobs and therefore the income to satisfy the loans that they have.
I would also like to briefly mention the flip side of this coin, the self-funded retirees—people who have paid off their mortgages over many years—who actually benefit from this small increase in the interest rate and therefore are in a better position to help fund their own retirement and to move into the future.
The question was asked earlier about the government attacking the federal Labor Party. If there were a real and substantial entity to attack, certainly the government would. At the moment we are looking at a miasma of me-toos and agreements about the federal budget, about housing and about the future of the economy. We talk about developing the future of Australia on sound economic principles. From everything we are seeing, the federal opposition is agreeing with the federal government that what we are doing is developing the country on sound economic principles. In general, people in Australia have never been better off than they currently are, with low tax rates and close to full employment. The housing interest rates are harming a few, but let us also look— (Time expired)

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2007-08-09,"—Listening to the contributions this afternoon from the coalition senators confirms in my mind and, of course, with my colleagues that there must be two Australias, because the Australia I know from living in the outer suburbs of Sydney is not the same as the one that Senator Bernardi and Senator Boyce are referring to. The overriding view coming from the coalition that people have never had it so good is pretty much a disgrace. The front page of today’s Daily Telegraph in Sydney says:
The Lindley family of Kellyville have tightened their grocery bill, the Jacksons of Glenmore Park now walk to the shop to save on petrol.
That is the result of these latest interest rate rises. Remember that during the election campaign in 2004 the Prime Minister said that he would keep interest rates at record lows. Since 2004, we have had five interest rate hikes. Since 2002, we have had nine. The latest interest rate hike means that if you have a debt of $300,000 you are going to pay an extra $12.50 per week. If it is $400,000 it will be $16.66 per week, and if it is $500,000 it will be $20.83 per week.
Senator Boyce said that this debt is all in the high end, but, as I said, my Australia is struggling. In Penrith, in the seat of Lindsay, mortgage defaults have increased by 25 per cent over the year. I understand that mortgage default insurance claims have increased by four times. We have a situation in those outer suburbs of Sydney, electorates all held by the coalition, where people are just walking away from their homes. And they are getting hit twice. The mortgage stress is currently there—the Australian Bureau of Statistics says that mortgage stress is measured by people having to contribute 30 per cent of their income to service their debt—but people are walking away from their homes in places like Penrith and south-west Sydney because to service that debt they are having to use not just 30 per cent of their income; it is now up to 37 per cent. With this latest rise I would not mind betting that it will go up to 40 per cent, 41 per cent or 42 per cent. People cannot live with that amount of income going to service that debt.
The other frightening thing that is occurring in western and south-western Sydney is that house prices are declining. People have borrowed $300,000, $350,000 or $400,000 to get a house in the west or south-west of Sydney, but that house is no longer worth what they borrowed for it. People who are in mortgage stress now are walking away from a house that they may have bought for $350,000, which is now worth probably $290,000, and for which they are still servicing a $350,000 debt. As I said, the people in western and south-western Sydney, in particular, are being doubly hit because of the current interest rate rises and what appears to be the callous and heartless approach of the government in failing to alleviate the difficulties people have as a result of this interest rate hike. As I said, there seem to be two Australias. The one I represent, where I live, is struggling. People like the family in Glenmore Park are walking to the shops. (Time expired)

It is the first time I have had an occasion to have my own private senator’s bill debated in the Senate, so it is a very exciting opportunity for me. I am really pleased about the opportunity to talk on this issue in particular—the issue of climate refugees. Right now we as a planet face a great threat: climate change. Climate refugees are a very important component of the challenge that climate change presents us as a global community. In March 2004, the Pacific Conference of Churches met on the atoll island nation of Kiribati. They discussed climate change and its likely effects for Pacific nations. Out of this came the Otin Tai declaration. That declaration begins this way:
Here on the small atoll islands of Kiribati, the impacts of human induced climate change are already visible. The sea level is rising. People’s homes are vulnerable to the increasingly high tides and storm surges. Shores are eroding and coral reefs are becoming blanched. The water supplies and soil fertility are being threatened by the intrusion of salt water. Weather patterns are less predictable, posing risks to fisherfolk and farmers.
Kiribati is not alone in its plight. Many other island nations in the Pacific are experiencing similar impacts of human induced climate change. Our peoples, who number about 7 million, are already suffering and are vulnerable to more impacts in the future.
This declaration from Pacific island nations went on, requesting that highly industrialised countries such as Australia do seven things. The seven things they request of us are:
Acknowledge [our] special responsibilities for the effects of climate change—take action immediately because the Pacific people are suffering, crying and dying right now
Reduce fossil fuel production/consumption and increase use of renewable energy.
Provide scholarship funds to students of the Pacific for higher educational level studies on the issue of climate change.
Ratify and implement the Kyoto Protocol
Increase budgets for adaptation programs in the Pacific
To implement the reduction targets specified in the Kyoto Protocol within the first commitment period
To relocate and compensate the victims of climate change as requested by Pacific countries.
This piece of legislation that we are debating today, the Migration (Climate Refugees) Amendment Bill 2007, addresses this last point on the issue of climate refugees. Climate change induced environmental refugees are likely to be a big issue this century as the impacts of climate change occur and make many more places now inhabited uninhabitable for various reasons. We are perhaps now in the calm before the storm. The World Bank say that sea levels rising could displace hundreds of millions of people within this century. In a report released in February of this year, they concluded:
… the overall magnitudes for the developing world are sobering: Within this century, hundreds of millions of people are likely to be displaced by [sea level rise]; accompanying economic and ecological damage will be severe for many. The world has not previously faced a crisis on this scale, and planning for adaptation should begin immediately.
…            …            …
To date, however, there is little evidence that the international community has seriously considered the implications for population location and infrastructure planning in many developing countries. We hope that the information provided in this paper will encourage more rapid action on this front.
The Nicolas Stern report concluded that there could be between 150 million and 200 million climate refugees by 2050, and a recent Christian Aid report suggested 200 million to 250 million people will be displaced by climate change. Oxford academic and expert in this area Norman Myers predicts that by 2050 up to 150 million people may be displaced by the impact of global warming. This is a looming issue for Australia and the international community. Not many people have been directly displaced by climate change yet, but how we prepare for the challenge is an indication of how seriously we take the issue of global warming.
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has already identified climate change as one of the factors in the tragic Darfur conflict. He wrote recently in the Washington Post:
Amid the diverse social and political causes, the Darfur conflict began as an ecological crisis, arising at least in part from climate change.
Many climate refugees will be internally displaced. Some will be able to relocate and settle within their own country. This will place stress on infrastructure and may create social tensions and divisions. However, many will not be able to remain in their countries, and this Greens bill that we are debating provides a mechanism to assist them.
Alan Dupont and Graeme Pearman, in their report called Heating up the planet, for the Lowy Institute, state:
New migrants, regardless of whether or not they cross borders, can impinge on the living space of others, widen existing ethnic and religious divides and add to environmental stress in a self-sustaining cycle of migration and instability.
They continue in their report on how they see climate induced migration playing out:
First, people will move in response to a deteriorating environment, creating new or repetitive patterns of migration, especially in developing states. Secondly, there will be increasing short-term population dislocations due to particular climate stimuli such as severe cyclones or major flooding. Thirdly, larger scale population movements are possible that build more slowly but gain momentum as adverse shifts in climate interact with other migration drivers such as political disturbances, military conflict, ecological stress and socio-economic change.
In the Pacific, the small islands are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels associated with melting ice caps, the thermal expansion of the ocean and stronger storm surges—all part of climate change. Already the Carteret Islands of Papua New Guinea are being evacuated. The Pacific island nations of Tuvalu and Kiribati are already starting to drown. Kiribati’s chief climate negotiator spoke to New Scientist in 2000 about the plight of his country. He said:
Apart from causing coastal erosion, higher tides are pushing salt water into the fields and into underground fresh-water reservoirs. In some places, it just bubbles up from the ground. This is making soils too salty for root crops and is polluting drinking water. We often have to bathe in salt water. You’ll know all about coral bleaching in waters which are getting warmer. But for us, this is not just an issue of biodiversity tourism. The reefs are where we get many of our fish. If the reefs die, so will our food.
Eight or nine house plots in the village that my family belongs to have been eroded away. I remember there was a coconut tree outside the government quarters where I lived. The beach all around it was eroded, and eventually it disappeared. But erosion is not the only problem for trees. The droughts are much worse than they used to be. We can go more than six months without rain these days. Now the new row of coconut trees is withering, too. Our elders say we have never had droughts that last so long. The droughts may be because of El Nino. But if the El Ninos are stronger, that must be part of climate change.
It is not just Tuvalu and other atoll islands in the Pacific that would be affected by climate change. Even mountainous Fiji will face a crisis when the sea level rise becomes severe. Much of Fiji’s productive land and urban areas will be flooded, which could lead to increasing ethnic conflict. The President of the Marshall Islands said in a speech in May of this year, ‘It won’t be long before our country is completely inundated.’ Again, the Kiribati chief climate change negotiator said in 2000: ‘Imagine standing on one side of these islands, with waves pounding on one side and the lagoon on the other. It is frightening.’
It is not just rising sea level that has the capacity to create climate change refugees in the near future. As the earth warms, precipitation patterns will change causing catastrophic floods in some areas and in other areas turning currently cultivatable land into desert. Monsoons may change direction and strength and could fail to water the world’s breadbaskets. Mountain glaciers around the world are already shrinking at an alarming rate. The glaciers of the Himalayas are the source of major rivers such as the Indus, the Yangtze, the Mekong and the Ganges that currently sustain half the world’s population.
Alan Dupont and Graeme Pearman say that Australia should take the issue of climate refugees more seriously. In their report they say:
Australia and regional states need to give this issue more serious attention since three of the areas most vulnerable to sea  level rise globally are in Asia and the Pacific (South Asia, Southeast Asia and low lying coral atolls in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific) and six of Asia’s ten mega cities are located on the coast.
This piece of legislation proposed by the Greens, which we are debating here today, equips Australia with the formal mechanisms to accept and process climate refugees. Many in this place may say that the effects of climate change are too far off to worry about now or that the scale of future climate refugees is too big for Australia to deal with alone. But Australia must and can set an example for the world. By supporting this legislation, we would indicate that we take the issue of climate change refugees seriously and that we are implementing mechanisms to deal with the issue. It enables us to do our part and we must do our part. Many in this place might think that sea level rise this century may only be measured in centimetres. Dr James Hansen, who is NASA’s chief climatologist, wrote in last month’s New Scientist:
I find it almost inconceivable that ‘business as usual’ climate change will not result in a rise in sea level measured in metres within a century
There is not a sufficiently widespread appreciation of the implications of putting back into the air a large fraction of the carbon stored in the ground over epochs of geologic time. The climate forcing caused by these greenhouse gases would dwarf the climate forcing for any time in the past several hundred thousand years.
I have asked questions at the last three Senate estimates inquiries about whether the Department of Immigration and Citizenship is doing any work on the issue of climate change refugees and the answer is consistently no. The Greens are concerned that the government is not taking this issue seriously. The governments of Tuvalu and Kiribati have approached the Australian and New Zealand governments on several occasions to request that we work with them to put in place a plan for the migration of their populations to Australia as their homelands become uninhabitable.
In 2001, the then minister for immigration, Mr Philip Ruddock, refused to meet with Tuvalu to discuss this matter. At around the same time the New Zealand government implemented its specific access category under which 75 people from Tuvalu and 75 people from Kiribati can migrate to New Zealand each year. That enables them to play a constructive role in actually taking on board the entire population of Tuvalu and Kiribati over a protracted period of time as a part of a way in which they can contribute to these Pacific island nations dealing with the issue of climate change and climate change refugees—climate change for which we have been so responsible and refugees created in our region in the Pacific. A senior Tuvaluan official said that, while New Zealand had helped out their neighbours, ‘Australia on the other hand has slammed the door in our face.’ This is the situation that we face.
The Greens’ climate refugee bill would help us to address these problems. It creates a new class of visa under the Migration Act called the climate change refugee visa. It grants the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship the power to assess an environmental disaster that has displaced people and to make a climate change induced environmental disaster declaration. Such a declaration may only be made by the minister personally. When considering whether or not to make such a declaration, the minister can give consideration to the geographical scope of the disaster; the possibilities for adaptation and the long-term sustainability of the area; the capacity of the country and neighbouring countries to absorb displaced persons; and other international efforts of assistance.
Such a declaration may include setting the number of visas that will be issued to people displaced by a declared disaster and the criteria as to how such displaced people would be accepted as climate refugees. This is the standard procedure by which we create new visa categories under the Migration Act in Australia. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship told the Senate estimates committee hearing that Australia would be able to accept people who were displaced by environmental disasters through the existing migration law.
This piece of legislation formally recognises and implements specific mechanisms by which Australia would assess and accept climate change refugees. Australia should be able to take several hundred climate change refugees per year from the Pacific island nations of Tuvalu and Kiribati if we look to the example that New Zealand has set us and consider our larger size. This would ease the pressure on these nations and prepare the way for their eventual evacuation as the ocean claims their countries.
Under this bill the minister for immigration would have the power to make a declaration that Tuvalu is suffering a climate change induced environmental disaster due to rising sea levels and more intense storms. The minister could, for example, set a limit and say that 300 Tuvaluans could be accepted into Australia as climate change refugees per year and could set out the process by which they apply and the criteria against which applicants would be assessed.
Climate change refugees are currently a minor problem, but they could become a major global crisis. Australia should raise the issue of climate change refugees within the United Nations. We should work with other nations to form a new international framework to deal with climate change refugees in a just, efficient and fair manner. The United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees has provided a framework for the treatment, assessment and resettlement of refugees. Millions of people around the world have been provided protection, safety and the chance of a new life under this convention. Climate change refugees are not refugees under the definition that currently exists in the UN refugee convention. They seek refuge not from persecution—although that may be a consequence of climate change—but from an environmental disaster or are otherwise displaced by climate change. The Australian Greens have long held the position that the refugee convention should be expanded to include a category for environmental refugees. This would, of course, include the climate change refugees we are talking about today.
The Greens hope that this bill assists in providing some guidance and leadership towards a multilateral framework to deal with the issue of climate change refugees. Our priority must be to stop climate change by moving quickly towards a low-carbon economy. We know that our Pacific island neighbours do not want to lose their cultural connection to their land and do not want to be displaced as a result of rising sea levels due to climate change and be transferred en masse or in part to Australia or neighbouring countries in this area. We know that they would like to continue their connection with their land. Many people may stay until the last moment. We need to play a constructive role as the wealthiest country in our region and as a country that is responsible for producing so many greenhouse gases. We are one of the highest emitters of greenhouse gases on a per capita level in the world. We are the world’s largest exporter of coal. We need to take on the responsibilities that come with that of working in our region to ensure that there is a future for our Pacific island neighbours. That is what this legislation is about: it is about putting in place a process so that we can deal with the people who will lose their homes because of the contribution that we as a country have made to the global warming that is occurring. This is an issue of morality. This is an issue of responsibility. This is an issue that we, as a leading country in our region, need to grasp with both hands.
We need to play a constructive role in ensuring that there is a long-term future for our Pacific island neighbours. We need to assist them in the activities that exist in their countries now. But we also need to provide them with an avenue, a mechanism and an opportunity—in which we can support them—by which they can leave their country when the time comes that they have to. We are already seeing Pacific island nations like the Carteret Islands being evacuated as rising sea levels drown people’s homes. We need to be putting in place now a process by which we can help our Pacific island neighbours as this occurs over this period of time. This piece of legislation provides us with the opportunity to do that. I am proud to be introducing this legislation and debating it on behalf of the Australian Greens. I ask the Senate to support it. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION (CLIMATE REFUGEES) AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-08-09,"—I am pleased to be able to speak on the Migration (Climate Refugees) Amendment Bill 2007 to raise concerns about the impact of climate change on the South Pacific islands. The purpose of this legislation is to create a new class of visa: a climate change refugee visa. The reasons motivating this bill are clear to us all—climate change is impacting now on the people of island nations in the Pacific. Labor recognise that our Pacific island neighbours face increasing environmental challenges arising from climate change. However, Labor note that there needs to be an international effort to deal with people displaced by the effects of climate change. Labor will establish an international coalition to resettle people displaced by the effects of climate change when a country becomes uninhabitable because of rising sea levels, damage to coastal infrastructure or reduced food security and water supplies as part of our Pacific climate change strategy. The bill before the Senate today prescribes a unilateral response to people displaced by climate change and undermines the principle of shared responsibility that Labor support. On this basis, Labor cannot support the bill in its current form.
Labor will show the leadership required in our region to assist our Pacific neighbours to prepare for and adapt to climate change. As I said, Labor have long recognised that climate change is real for the people of the island nations in the Pacific. In January 2006 Labor released a policy discussion paper on climate change in the Pacific entitled Our drowning neighbours. Its purpose was to promote discussion in the community about climate change science and the impact occurring now in the Pacific and to work with our own and the international community to find solutions. I take this opportunity to commend Mr Bob Sercombe, the member for Maribyrnong, and Mr Anthony Albanese for the work they did in putting this excellent document together. There are four key threats to our Pacific neighbours: rising sea levels, extreme weather events, collapse of ecosystems and the contamination of freshwater with salt water. The Pacific has some of the smallest and lowest-lying countries in the world. It has been predicted that climate change will lead to a rise in sea levels of between 14 centimetres and 32 centimetres by 2050. However, a small rise would have a devastating effect on many Pacific countries. Tuvalu faces the prospect of total inundation by rising sea levels—as do islands in Vanuatu, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and parts of Papua New Guinea.
King tides are already flooding islands across the region. The SEAFRAME project attempts to secure data on sea level change that is absolute. This means it ignores the role of land movement as a part of sea level shifts. The early data sourced from this study shows a rise in sea levels of 5.9 millimetres per year at the Tuvalu measuring station, 8.1 millimetres per year at the Manus Island station in Papua New Guinea and 15.5 millimetres per year at the Tonga station. This compares with the global average of a rise of between one and two millimetres per year. This is an imminent catastrophe for atoll states such as Tuvalu. Some Pacific leaders are declaring that it is already too late for their countries to be saved.
As I said, extreme weather events are also a threat. The increasingly volatile weather patterns associated with climate change are an immediate and rising threat to our Pacific neighbours. Deaths from weather related disasters have already increased in Oceania by 21 per cent since the mid-1970s. Cyclone wind speeds are predicted to increase by 10 to 20 per cent over the next few years because of their complex relationship with sea temperature. The projected increase in the power of tropical storms is compounded by the increased volume of tropical storms over the last 30 years. As the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated, these extreme weather events pose a greater threat to atoll states as storm surges will cause greater structural damage and have ongoing adverse effects. Aside from the deaths, injuries and financial costs associated with storm surges, they cause widespread coastal erosion. Land space is already at a premium on the smaller Pacific islands, so they cannot sustain an ongoing loss of land.
Collapsing ecosystems are also of concern. Pacific societies are highly dependent on their ecosystems as their economies are often a mixture of formal exchange and subsistence practices. Unfortunately, Pacific island countries’ ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change. One effect of climate change is the bleaching of reefs. Reefs are the foundation of atoll states as they break the impact of violent weather on the land, protect against coastal erosion from severe weather and also generate the material that replenishes coastal areas. Reefs are a secure location for fish stocks to breed and feed. Tuvalu provides an example of this interdependence. Its inner reefs, along with the lagoon, provide most of Tuvalu’s food. Reefs are vital to many Pacific island ecosystems, so their bleaching is a threat to the sustainability of their entire social ecosystems.
Contamination of freshwater with saltwater is an extraordinary and real threat to the future of these countries. Citizens on the Carteret Islands in Papua New Guinea are currently being moved because their health has been steadily deteriorating because they are losing access to freshwater and their gardens are being destroyed by advancing saltwater. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change believes saltwater contamination is one of the most potentially devastating symptoms of climate change. The contamination of groundwater is a significant threat to our Pacific neighbours, reducing agricultural production and the basic availability of drinking water. It has been estimated that the freshwater supplies of some Pacific island countries could drop by up to 50 per cent.
The four key threats—rising sea levels, extreme weather events, collapsing ecosystems and the contamination of freshwater—are added to with a number of other threats. There is also the public health threat. Pacific island countries need to adapt to increasing vector borne and waterborne diseases—for example, malaria—caused by warmer temperatures. In Australia, for instance, the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Conservation Foundation have estimated that temperature related deaths could double in Australia to 2,500 deaths per year by 2020. These threats present a considerable challenge to individual countries, but they also present a challenge to regional stability and security. Climate change has the potential to destroy development gains in these countries and, according to a recent Pentagon report, climate change has the potential to destroy food systems and living conditions, leading to considerable instability, disruption and conflict. That is why climate change in the Pacific is an issue for Australia—for security reasons, not just for environmental or altruistic reasons. If Australia is committed to the stability and security of the Pacific, we have to deal with the impact of climate change in these countries.
Following the launch of our discussion paper, in July 2007 Labor launched a policy document entitled Assisting our South Pacific neighbours prepare for climate change. I commend the work of Mr Peter Garrett and Mr Bob McMullan, the shadow ministers respectively for climate change and environment and heritage, and international development assistance. The policy is comprehensive and has been well received. A Rudd Labor government will commit $150 million from Australia’s international aid budget to assist our neighbours to prepare for and adapt to the effects of climate change. Federal Labor is committed to working with our neighbours to develop and implement climate change adaptation plans to minimise the impacts on our region. The poorest countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change are also those that have the least financial capacity to respond. Labor believes that, as a developed country in our region, we have an obligation to help our poorer neighbours prepare for and adapt to avoid the worse impacts of climate change. Unless we help our neighbours to adapt and act to avoid the worse impacts of climate change, the world will see millions of climate change refugees. As part of its international development assistance and climate change commitment, a Rudd Labor government will increase aid expenditure on climate change by $150 million over three years to fund initiatives on adaptation to climate change, with a priority on the Pacific islands and East Timor. We will assist countries to develop climate change adaptation plans, particularly low-lying countries and those susceptible to extreme weather events.
Labor will ensure that climate change is a key consideration in the design of Australia’s aid program. Labor will develop a Pacific climate change strategy and build capacity for avoiding deforestation and for better forest management in the Asia-Pacific region. Labor will share Australia’s scientific and technological expertise in climate change and ensure that the aid program also promotes the use of low carbon emitting technologies. Labor will increase support for non-government organisations that assist with the implementation of this new approach and we will participate in multilateral and bilateral programs of assistance. However, Australia’s continued refusal to ratify the Kyoto protocol means that Australia cannot play a direct role in ensuring the allocation of funding under the protocol’s adaptation fund to countries in our region. Labor will redress that by ratifying the Kyoto protocol.
Today I also want to take the opportunity in this debate to focus on another group of people who are concerned and fearful for their future because of the impact of climate change. These people are not our Pacific neighbours; they are Australians. They are the people of the Torres Strait. I have spoken before in this chamber about the impact of climate change on the Torres Strait, expressing the growing concern of Torres Strait Islanders about their future. I have been very fortunate in being able to go to the Torres Strait for nearly 20 years. Over that time, I have been able to meet with community leaders and members of the community. That has been extremely educational and a great opportunity for me. But, increasingly, when I have those meetings with community leaders, erosion and inundation from climate change is the No. 1 issue on their agenda.
The outer islands of the Torres Strait are a very beautiful part of the world. The scenery is almost like a picture postcard. The connection of Torres Strait Islanders with their land and sea country is strong and part of their everyday life. I remind the Senate that native title was found on Mer Island in the Torres Strait, underlying that absolute connection between land and sea. Climate change is affecting Australians living in the Torres Strait, like Papua New Guinean residents on Carteret and the people of Tuvalu and Kiribati. It is an indictment on our national government that very little is being done to assist them.
In April this year, I undertook further consultations with people living in the Torres Strait. I met with the Torres Strait Climate Action Network. I congratulate this group of extremely energetic and mainly young people who are committed to educating and working with their community to militate against climate change in the Torres Strait. I thank Mayor Pedro Stephen of the Torres Shire Council for the use of the council chambers for that meeting. The Torres Strait Climate Action Network raised a number of issues with me at the meetings that I held. They expressed concern that there was limited information on which to make assessments and judgements about what the impact had already been in the Torres Strait in terms of sea level rise and urged us to undertake a proper analysis of sea level movement in the Torres Strait. They are interested in funding possibilities for research, planning and implementation and for public education and information programs in the region.
In their minds there is also a need for bodies such as councils, the Torres Strait Regional Authority, non-government organisations and others to have funding to be able to provide local input into research. They said that there was a desperate need for specific research and data on the region. They said that it should include potential population and economic, social and political impacts. TSCAN suggests that it would be useful for the Torres Strait to become an integrated climate change research centre, especially given the amount of science that is already done in the region and the number of eminent scientists who have on-the-ground knowledge. They talked about their actions in their own community to encourage fewer emissions. They are exploring the opportunity to establish a community garden to mitigate the greenhouse gases emitted when food is transported all the way up from the south. They suggested that sustainable tropical housing should be trialled in the Torres Strait so that the use of air conditioners in particular might be lessened. They also suggested that climate change content needs to be specifically inserted into state and national school curricula. I commend the network for the work that they are undertaking with and for their community. They expressed the frustration that they are doing what they can up there in the Torres Strait but that it will all be for nothing without support from the federal government. They urged the government to start by, firstly, signing the Kyoto protocol.
I was fortunate to be able to visit four of the outer islands: Badu Island, Saibai Island, Yorke Island and Yam Island. The stories that I heard in those four meetings were very similar. The message from Badu Island was that all of the island councils are very aware and very concerned but that they need more information on the causes and impact of and the possible solutions to climate change. There is a widespread view that the weather and the seasons are becoming less predictable, and that message was given to me on each of those four islands. It was said that traditional methods of predicting the weather and the seasons do not work now. The council on Badu Island was worried about the impact of climate change on future marine resources, specifically crayfish and fish stocks, and their migration patterns. There was also a concern about an increase that they have observed in silt and mud in the water; although, there is a view in the central islands that increased trawling may be part of the reason for that.
At Saibai Island, which is a mud island very close to the Papua New Guinea border, the immediate concern was the repair and extension of the seawall. I have spoken in this place before about the inundation that has occurred, particularly in February 2005, when we had king tides. They are using CDEP for some of the work, but they recognise that the funding is inadequate and described it as a ‘bandaid on a seawall’. The highest point on Saibai Island is only 2.7 metres above sea level, so they are very concerned.
I had a breakfast meeting with the Yorke Island Council, and I thank the council for their hospitality. They have done some significant work with James Cook University and the Queensland government through the Environmental Protection Authority to look at erosion issues there, as had the people of Yam Island. But all agree that more needs to be done to assist these communities.
I want to place on record again my thanks to the people of the Torres Strait for their hospitality during this recent visit. I will continue to work with the people of the Torres Strait to ameliorate the effects of climate change, particularly to actively investigate every option to avoid the need for relocation of the people of the Torres Strait onto the mainland.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION (CLIMATE REFUGEES) AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2007-08-09,"—I rise to speak on the Migration (Climate Refugees) Amendment Bill 2007. Addressing the issue of climate change is a genuine priority for Labor. We believe there are many measures that urgently need to be put in place if we are to limit the impact of climate change globally, including on our nation and on our neighbours, many of whom are vulnerable on a number of fronts. As we know, the Howard government has been asleep on climate change, yet it is an issue we cannot afford to take our eyes off for a moment, let alone be caught dozing on.
The Prime Minister, who has been a famous sceptic on this issue, and the government have failed to provide solutions to environmental concerns for 11 years. For its entire term in office, this government has failed to listen to the recommendations of experts. When it is awake, even if only for a moment, this government does not really know what it believes about climate change and emissions trading.
In contrast, Labor believes climate change is a real and immediate threat. While those in power have been idle and indifferent, on this side we have been asking the questions, putting forward ways to address environmental issues, moving amendments and introducing bills. Not surprisingly, the will and wishes of the Australian people are behind us on this issue. In fact, they are trying to do more than the government about global warming on a household by household, workplace by workplace basis. Right across Australia in homes and businesses, people are recycling, switching on to solar power, being water wise and conserving energy in greater numbers than ever before. While the government treats climate change as though it is a minor irritant, Australian families are not in any doubt about its importance. This should not shock anyone—we know the government is out of touch with the population it is meant to represent.
As we consistently see in surveys, our constituents across the country rank climate change policy as crucial to the future wellbeing, security and prosperity of our nation and our planet—and they are spot on. The Australian people are worried about the government’s interminable inaction on this issue. They are worried about the irreparable damage this environmental blight already has wreaked on our world and, even more so, about the devastation it will bring in the future.
That serious concern is understandable, given that 600 scientists from 113 nations, including 42 from Australia, on the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have found:
Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level.
We also have been warned in Australia responds: helping our neighbours fight climate change, a report by Australian environmental and aid non-government organisations, that unless our government acts now any efforts to help lift our poorest neighbours out of poverty will fail.
Despite having lower populations than their developing counterparts, industrialised countries are responsible for 76 per cent of the world’s historical emissions, according to World Resources Institute estimates. In the first year of this century, emissions by industrialised countries were listed at 14.1 tonnes per person, not including land use change. This figure is more than four times the per capita output of developing nations, which emit an average of 3.3 tonnes per person.
As if developing countries do not have enough to struggle with, it is predicted that climate change will increase drought in Africa; hit the populous delta regions of the Mekong and Bangladesh with sea level rises; cause the further retreat of Himalayan glaciers, meaning worsening water shortages in China and India; and degrade the forests, farming land and fish stocks that many impoverished families rely on for their survival. Of course, then there is the increase in death and disease predicted as mosquitoes thrive and heatwaves, hurricanes and floods occur with ever-increasing frequency and ferocity.
As water suitable for drinking dries up and the scourge of malnutrition takes an even-greater and more tragic hold of the children of Africa, climate change effects will reach cataclysmic proportions. It is predictable that there will be ever-increasing numbers of climate change refugees as environmental disasters become less isolated and more frequent.
Labor recognises that our Pacific island neighbours face increasing environmental challenges arising from climate change. However, Labor notes that there needs to be an international effort to deal with people displaced by the effects of climate change. Labor will establish an international coalition to resettle people displaced by the effects of climate change when a country becomes uninhabitable because of rising sea levels, damage to coastal infrastructure or reduced food security and water supplies. This will be done as part of our Pacific climate change strategy.
It is the very survival of our planet as a viable and healthy life host that is at stake. We can and must act now. Last year’s Stern review is true to its name when it comes to making the point about the necessity for, and responsibility of, prosperous countries to work with less wealthy nations. It says:
The poorest developing countries will be hit earliest and hardest by climate change, even though they have contributed little to causing the problem.
Their low incomes make it difficult to finance adaptation. The international community has an obligation to support them in adapting to climate change. Without such support there is a serious risk that development progress will be undermined.
And Stern is no orphan among leading international reports. The world needs hope and we are in the position of being able to do something about it. If we do set out on a path towards meaningful action, the resulting benefits will not just be environmental—there will be significant rewards on the economic, diplomatic and security fronts, too. But this government, it appears, is simply not up to meeting the immense and burning challenge climate change presents. One suspects the too-hard basket is looking decidedly full and the heat in the kitchen has become unbearable. In stark contrast, Labor is ready to hit the parched ground running.
On this side, we understand the urgency and the desperate need for action. A Rudd Labor government would immediately ratify the Kyoto protocol, sending the world an unpolluted view of our serious, unwavering pledge to be part of the global climate change solution rather than continue to undermine international efforts. Signing on to the protocol will also give Australia a position of influence when it comes to moving forward in partnership with other nations. Labor will adopt a 60 per cent emission reduction target by the middle of the century and set up a carbon trading scheme, among other measures.
Under Kevin Rudd we will increase aid expenditure on climate change by $150 million over three years. This will be targeted at helping our poorer neighbours prepare to cope with the effects of climate change. In particular, Labor will assist countries most susceptible to extreme events, including those in low-lying regions. Labor will work with Pacific nations to analyse, plan and implement the necessary measures. To deliver these ends, Australia will team up with the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other developed nations in the region. Labor will make sure our national aid program reflects our commitment to climate change considerations, promoting through it the use of low carbon emitting technologies.
We recognise, too, that better forest management in the Asia-Pacific is a key element in a cleaner, greener future. Within the structure of the World Bank’s Forest Carbon Partnership Facility initiative, Labor will head a new global deforestation initiative. We believe investing in the life-giving rainforests of the world is crucial, but we will not wane in our focus on slashing our own emissions. Under Labor, Australia will share its technological and scientific knowledge for the betterment of all nations. We believe establishing a Pacific climate change centre would benefit the region by monitoring, measuring and forecasting climate change developments. Labor will also give backing to non-government organisations to help deliver the different, deliberate and determined plans and programs needed.
A Rudd Labor government will give substantial and significant support to the international foundations, including the Least Developed Countries Fund, the Special Climate Change Fund and the Adaptation Fund, already in existence to help developing countries adapt to a world darkened by the climate change spectre. Australia’s contributions to these funds in the past have been an embarrassment. The time for action is well and truly upon us. We must work on recovering lost ground by taking the lead when it comes to reducing the world’s emissions. Only in this way and by committing to a comprehensive, considered and collaborative plan into the future will we avoid the worst impacts of global warming and climate change on our planet.
The bill before the Senate today prescribes a unilateral response to people displaced by climate change and undermines the principle of shared responsibility that Labor supports. On this basis, Labor cannot support the bill.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION (CLIMATE REFUGEES) AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-08-09,"—I am very interested in the Migration (Climate Refugees) Amendment Bill 2007, although it has only recently been drawn to my attention. I will ask some questions in the committee stages of the bill on just how it would operate, because a cursory look at the terms of the bill suggest to me that it would be wide open to abuse and that it really has little to do with climate change, immigration and visas but a lot to do with the Greens normal stunt-like approach to parliament and their policies. In the committee stage I will be very keen to ask some questions and try to get some answers.
I want to generally indicate that the Australian government over a succession of environment ministers, and particularly under the current environment minister, has been not just very concerned about climate change but actually doing things about it. I reiterate a point I always make: the Labor Party and others have come to this debate recently because focus groups I think have indicated to Mr Rudd that this is an important issue. Labor has a focus group approach and answer to climate change.
In contrast to that, the Howard government has been looking at this issue since the former Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Robert Hill, initiated the Australian Greenhouse Office back in, I think, 1997. As I recall, the Australian Greenhouse Office was the first government agency of that type to be set up anywhere in the world to address the issue of climate change. So, unlike Mr Rudd, who has come to this issue because focus groups have told him to do that in the last 12 months, the Howard government has been addressing this issue for 10 years or more. The Greenhouse Office has been very well funded to do its work. The Australian government has financed any number of initiatives—it would take the whole of my 20 minutes to go through them—at very great cost to the taxpayer. But I think the taxpayers, along with the government, are happy to have spent the money because what we have achieved has been important.
It is also very important to highlight that this is a global problem. Australia produces less than two per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. If you turned off every electric light bulb, shut down every power station and closed every mine in Australia tomorrow, the greatest impact that would have on greenhouse gas emissions would be about 1½ per cent. It would still leave a real problem for the globe, in that 98.5 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions would continue to pollute the world. So Australia’s principal contribution to mankind is to try to get the big emitters—China, India and the United States—to the table so that some sensible program can be agreed upon and implemented to stop global greenhouse gas emissions.
Some of our respected and supposedly responsible politicians are determined that Australia should damage itself economically for a result that would not make one iota of difference to greenhouse gas emissions and, therefore, climate change. They are determined that Australia should destroy itself economically without making any real contribution to climate change. What we have to do is try to convince those big emitters—and, in that way, we can make a real contribution to the climate change debate. Notwithstanding that Australia is such a small emitter, we have done more, proportionally, than most other countries to address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. The programs the government has been involved in have contributed very substantially to that.
Mr Rudd’s current policy—I think it is still his current policy—is to sign up to the Kyoto protocol. But I suspect that will not be his policy after he speaks to the Bowen Basin miners, members of the CFMEU, who, along with me, recognise that Labor’s policy of signing the Kyoto protocol is a ridiculous response to climate change. Signing a bit of paper will not make one iota of difference to climate change. In fact, a lot of the countries that have signed the Kyoto protocol have done nothing. I think 167 countries signed onto the Kyoto protocol—and only 34 of them have attempted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Even those who had the best intentions have not reduced their greenhouse emissions as they agreed to do at Kyoto. Indeed, Australia is on track to meet its target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to 108 per cent of 1990 levels. We are one of the few countries that are doing that. Signing the Kyoto protocol will not make one iota of difference, yet that seems to be Labor’s main policy approach: sign a bit of paper and the world will be all smiles again. That is just ridiculous, but it is typical of the focus-driven policy approach from the Labor Party at the present time. They are focus driven on everything, it seems, except tax policy. Their only tax policy is to have no policy at all.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I hear the members opposite laughing. Perhaps they can tell me I am wrong. Perhaps they can tell me when their tax policy is going to be released. We would be very keen to see it. My understanding is that the opposition’s only pronouncement on tax policy is that it will not have a tax policy—and I suspect that is also something Mr Rudd has picked up from focus groups. We in Queensland know how Mr Rudd operates. He was the adviser to Premier Goss when he shut down any proposal for getting decent water supplies to south-east Queensland. There is a crisis now, 10 years later, because, when Mr Rudd, as head of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet, was advising Mr Goss, they decided to stop any proposals that the National and Liberal governments had put forward for a proper water supply in south-east Queensland.
The interjections from the other side have diverted me from the bill before us. Before getting into the bill, I want to raise a couple of issues. This bill is predicated on the fact that climate change is going to cause disasters in many communities around the world and that there will be a need for a higher level of migration of people as a result of that. Could I just point out that sea level rise is a long-term challenge for our region which scientific evidence tells us does not present an immediate danger of displacing entire Pacific island populations. Sea level rise is a complex issue, and all of the factors need to be understood and reported accurately. Inundation of Pacific islands could be caused by factors such as land subsidence, tectonic subduction, natural climate variability, El Nino, tropical cyclones and the like, long-term tidal cycles and land use patterns. Climate change is only one variable in this mix.
We as a government, as a nation, are providing more than $42.25 million in practical assistance to Pacific island countries to deal with climate variation and sea level rise by monitoring sea levels, improving climate prediction, assessing vulnerability and planning adaption action. In the 2007-08 budget, the government announced $7.5 million for the UNFCCC’s Least Developed Countries Fund to help some of the poorest countries, including some of these Pacific island countries, to assess and adapt to the impacts of climate change. I should mention that at the, I think, 2005 Pacific Island Forum, the Prime Minister and the other Pacific leaders agreed to consider measures to address population dislocation should a genuine need arise.
The Australian government, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, have a long record of responding generously when needs arise in the Pacific, and we will continue to do so. Further, it is important to point out in the context of this bill that our current migration program is designed to serve economic, social and demographic objectives. We also have a substantial humanitarian program which resettles people who have been subjected to persecution or gross violation of human rights in their home countries. The global climate change phenomenon is a focus for all governments. We are strongly engaged in global dialogue on this particular issue. It is not appropriate to speculate on how our government might respond to possible future environmental challenges in the region—that is a matter for negotiation with other regional governments—but any responses will be consistent with our role as a responsible global citizen. The government manages a range of aid programs designed to assist developing countries in our region.
At times, questions have been asked about why Australia is not doing more through its immigration arrangements to alleviate the plight of Pacific islanders affected by climate change. Australia has long maintained a global non-discriminatory immigration policy. Australia is already strongly engaged in supporting development in the Pacific. In the event of environmental conditions in certain Pacific states reaching disaster proportions, Australia would play a major part in any international response. As I have mentioned, the Prime Minister recently committed to the development of an Australian-funded technical college for the Pacific, and work has began across a range of Commonwealth agencies to explore how that commitment will be met. It is likely that many of the graduates of such an institution would have skills in demand in Australia and would meet standards required to have their skills recognised in Australia. So we are clearly doing a considerable amount already to help our Pacific island neighbours.
On a closer look, it seems that this bill is, as I mentioned earlier, simply another stunt promoted by the Greens. I understand that they are doing this at the behest of the Friends of the Earth. The Friends of the Earth is a very interesting organisation. It is connected with an Indonesian organisation called WALHI, which is the Indonesian chapter of the Friends of the Earth. There are some interesting connections between WALHI and the Australian Greens. I note a press release, dated 12 January 2004, in which Senator Bob Brown and a WALHI director tried to blame Alexander Downer for violence at the Newcrest mine in Indonesia. That is an interesting proposition. I also note that the so-called Mineral Policy Institute—an NGO specialising in campaigning to prevent ‘environmentally and socially destructive mining’ and other minerals and energy projects in Australasia and the Pacific—has listed Senator Bob Brown as its patron. The Mineral Policy Institute was also affiliated with Friends of the Earth International.
Interestingly, WALHI appears to have now been joined by radical Islamic groups in its campaign against the US mining giant, Newmont. A photograph—which I could perhaps table if the Senate were interested—recently featured in the Indonesian press shows Abu Bakar Bashir, the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah, flanked by Muhammad Al Khaththah, the leader of the Indonesian chapter of Hizb ut-Tahrir, attacking Newmont’s environmental record. I also note an article from the Straits Times of 22 April 2006 which states:
The head of Walhi, the main environmental group, is also a member of Hizbut Tahrir, a hardline Muslim group which emerged over the past year, and which has been famously described as being a ‘conveyor belt for terrorists’. Although the group claims to be non-violent, the Walhi chairman took part in recent violent demonstrations outside the US embassy, wearing full Islamic robes.
I would be somewhat interested to know—and perhaps in her closing address Senator Nettle could refer to this, or perhaps we could refer to this a bit more closely in the committee stage of the bill—what the Greens’ response is to this apparent alliance between radical Islamists and the Friends of the Earth on whose behalf, I understand, the Greens have moved this motion today.
Time is running away from me, unfortunately, but I did want to turn to the provisions of the bill to address some of the issues there. With this new form of visa being encouraged by the Greens, one wonders what safeguards might be put in place to ensure that other matters were taken into account as well in relation to suitable entrance into Australia. We proudly have very strict immigration procedures. Over many years, both Labor and Liberal governments have been very generous with their immigration policies, but have been determined to ensure that people coming into our country and society do really have a commitment to Australia and all that Australia stands for. I would be interested to see in this bill just where this new form of visa would fit with the people who might be eligible to come in, because disasters, if they do strike as anticipated by this bill, will strike in many places and it would be very important, I think, for those in charge to carefully look at, as we currently do— (Time expired)

 (Senator Lightfoot)—Do you wish to table that document? If you do, you will need to seek leave, Senator Macdonald.
—If anyone doubts that it is here, I have it and they could come and see it. I do not think I need to table it.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION (CLIMATE REFUGEES) AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2007-08-09,"—I rise to speak on the Migration (Climate Refugees) Amendment Bill 2007 put forward by the Greens and want to start by noting that we currently have a migration program which is designed to serve economic, social and demographic objectives. As well, we have a substantial humanitarian program which resettles people who have been subjected to persecution or gross violence or violation of their human rights in their home country.
It has been traditional that we take significant advice from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees regarding our refugee and humanitarian program. They assist in outlining where they think the highest priority lies with the refugee population around the world, which is estimated to be somewhere between 20 and 25 million people. Obviously, Australia cannot take all of those people, so they have an orderly and reasonably fair process, and we are guided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We obviously sometimes have disagreements with them from time to time, and sometimes those differences are quite significant, but they are an appropriate body to assist us in making those decisions.
In 2005-06, our humanitarian intake was 14,000 people, and this is one of the most generous intakes in the world on a per capita basis. If you put per capita measures aside, we are one of the top three nations in absolute terms in relation to our humanitarian intake. We are up there with the USA and Canada; nations which are much larger than us. And, as I said, we are one of the top three nations in the world in absolute terms in humanitarian intake. I just wanted to put all of this in perspective.
We also have a very proud record in assisting people, both here and abroad, when it comes to a crisis. Aceh is a perfect example. I happened to be in Italy on Boxing Day in December 2004 at the time the tsunami occurred in Indonesia. Even though I do not speak Italian, although I did have reasonable Italian when I was about nine years old, it was quite obvious that Australia featured in the headlines of the Italian newspapers because of our quick, significant and world record monetary contribution to Aceh. We have a proud record in assisting people in crises. That did not happen to be global warming; that happened to be a seismic shift in the earth’s crust. I have to note that, in the bill, the Greens do not mention that. They do not even mention people being displaced as a result of a significant seismic shift which causes permanent changes in people being relocated. It is not even mentioned in this bill. We are only picking global warming because that is the sort of issue that they think they will get a run on.
Let me just say too that I happened to be Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and the Minister for Foreign Affairs when the Kosovars and the East Timorese were here. Four thousand-odd Kosovars at something like two weeks notice were coming to Australia and walking off those planes, some of them with nothing and some of them with nothing more than a plastic bag. And what happened? I am having difficulty, Mr Acting Deputy President, with the chatter that is going on; it is distracting.

(Senator Lightfoot)—Order! I can anticipate your difficulty, Senator Patterson, and I think the situation has naturally resolved itself.
—I watched as those people came down, and I was there as they came into the Qantas hangar—these people who had been taken in by Australia and accommodated, at two weeks notice, through the amazing work of the immigration department, which was subjected to some appalling treatment in the press while Senator Vanstone was minister. The immigration department and the defence department worked together cooperatively. I was staggered and moved by the way in which they worked together, and I changed my attitude towards the defence forces. My concept of the defence forces had come from my father, who was a lieutenant in the Second World War and ran our house like it was an Army camp—he made a fantastic contribution, but that was my impression of soldiers. When I saw the defence personnel working with those Kosovars—playing football with the kids and sitting down to talk to and comfort some of the people who had lost family and homes—I saw a different side of the training of the Defence Force.
I have to interpose something here about the Northern Territory emergency response. I was alarmed when I saw some of the press reporting of the Defence Force. People were saying, ‘The Defence Force is going into the Northern Territory.’ That showed a complete lack of understanding and knowledge of the modern training of our defence forces. They are trained in warfare but they are also trained in peacekeeping. I think that maybe our defence forces should wear pale green hats or something similar when they are doing humanitarian community work in Australia, like the work with the Kosovars or the work in the Northern Territory. We accept them as peacemakers when they have blue hats on, but when they went into the Northern Territory there were references to the tanks rolling in and the troops being brought in. I thought that was offensive, totally unacceptable and totally misguided about the role the defence forces can play in building communities—and that they have been playing since Minister Herron, when he was Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, tried to address the issues. You would think, from what happened in the press, that we had done nothing. We have put in measure after measure. One of them was to have the defence forces go in some time ago.
I want to state here that we brought together the resources of our community, of the Public Service, the immigration department in particular, and of the defence forces to work with the Kosovars and then the East Timorese. There were nearly 6,000 people on our doorstep within a couple of weeks. We accommodated them, met their health needs, returned many of them very quickly and kept some of them for over a year. So we have a strong and proud record when it comes to our refugee and humanitarian program.
I would add here that, as a result of the Howard government’s policies aimed at reducing the number of illegal immigrants who come to Australia, the victims of profiteering people smugglers, we have been able to accommodate over a thousand more refugees every year than was the case under Labor. There have been thousands more refugees who have been resettled in Australia in a more orderly fashion as a result of our measures. We have had a strong migration program focused on skills, a strong refugee program focused on those with refugee status—approved by the UNHCR, not by people smugglers—coming here to Australia, and, as I said, a strong response to crises like those of Aceh, Kosovo and East Timor. We can demonstrate that we do that. You would think, from the way these bills have been presented, that we do not have a record on it.
Of course, global climate change phenomena should be a focus of all governments. We have been involved in global dialogue and, in addition, we have been providing significant financial assistance to our Pacific neighbours to monitor changes and assist them to respond. I will outline some of those measures. Since the late 1980s and early 1990s, we have had a South Pacific Sea Level and Climate Monitoring Project—SPSLCMP, as it is known in a shorter form.
—As it’s easily and commonly known, Senator!
—As it is commonly known—SPSLCMP, however it might be pronounced! It was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s under the Labor government—you have to give credit—as an Australian government response to concerns raised by member countries in the South Pacific Forum over the potential impacts of human-induced global warming on climate and sea levels in the Pacific region. The primary goal of this project is to generate an accurate record of variance in long-term sea level for the South Pacific and to establish methods to make these data readily available and usable by Pacific island countries. The project is now in its fourth phase, which commenced in January 2006.
But let me go back over some of the earlier work, because I had a particular interest in this. It is amazing, in this job, how you scan across areas about which you knew nothing and have to learn a lot. When I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I went to a trade conference in Samoa. While I was there I launched the first of 12 continuous global positioning systems for the Pacific island countries as part of this $24 million program funded through AusAID. The CGPS is an early-warning system linked to a tide gauge to help Pacific island countries monitor and respond to any changes to sea level and climate as the result of global warming and greenhouse effects. This makes the Pacific region the first group in the world to measure changes in sea level with an absolute degree of accuracy.
So here we are, out there in front, assisting our Pacific island neighbours to monitor more accurately changes in sea levels. They needed much better data collection and analysis to assist them to develop policies and to properly plan for any problems associated with climate change and sea level rises. I was not aware until then that the challenge of measuring sea level changes is made difficult when factors like movements of the earth’s crust, earthquakes, tides and volcanic activities all have to be taken into account. The CGPS is linked to the tide gauges and will be used to determine the absolute sea level changes in individual Pacific island countries. In the past, water levels were measured to a level of precision plus or minus 10 millimetres using conventional tide gauges. This was suitable for monitoring changes to sea level due to storm surges, tsunamis and other natural hazards. But to look at the very small and gradual changes in water levels caused by global warming and greenhouse gases, conventional gauges were not sensitive enough. Using state-of-the-art technology, improved sensors, digital recording and additional meteorological inputs, ocean levels can now be monitored with an accuracy of better than plus or minus one millimetre. This is required, as the present estimate of global sea level rise is about 1.5 millimetres per year.
Other stations linked to the tide gauges will be installed in the Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Cook Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and the Federated States of Micronesia—and I think there are, at this stage, still two of those to be installed. The data will be sent to AUSLIG in Canberra, where scientists will analyse the data and information. AUSLIG work closely with the National Tidal Facility Australia, NTFA, at Flinders University in Adelaide, who are responsible for the tide gauge stations measuring relative sea level changes and then calculating the absolute sea level trends in the region. The results are fed back to scientists and government planners in each Pacific island country and to regional organisations. These stations have a life of more than 20 years to support this work and the Pacific governments, ensuring a continuous flow of sea level and climate information to the governments and the international community over that period. That is a major and significant contribution that has been undertaken, originally by the Labor government and continued by the coalition. That is a practical and sensible way of going about assisting Pacific island nations.
One of the other things we have done is to launch the Australian Pacific Technical College, which the Prime Minister announced in October 2006. The Australian government will provide $149.5 million for the establishment and operation of the new Australian Pacific Technical College. The college aims to provide Australian standard training to Pacific island students from throughout the region and will be a significant resource for island countries. It is to be headquartered in Suva and will include training centres and country offices in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Vanuatu. An important element of this college will be to ensure access by students from all island countries, including the smaller island states. This will be assisted by a generous scholarship scheme worth $10 million in the first four years.
This college aims to offer appropriate courses for people if they continue to live in those island states or need to move because of changing sea levels. It will offer courses in hospitality, tourism, health and community services, automotive trade, manufacturing and construction, and electrical trades. The first intake of students was to take place in July this year, and it is anticipated that in the first four years 3,000 students will graduate from that college. The courses will be delivered by Australian registered training organisations, contracted to the Australian government’s overseas aid agency, AusAID. The college will have close links to industry to ensure the relevance of training to employment. The college will assist economic growth in Pacific island countries by addressing skills shortages and increasing workforce competitiveness. It will also assist in the mobility of skilled workers between the Pacific Islands and developed countries.
Here we have just two measures which are practical and sensible: measuring sea level changes more accurately than is being done anywhere else in the world and training 3,000 people, in the first four years, from a range of countries in the Pacific in courses which will have relevance for their own country and if they need to move.
When Mr Howard was at the Pacific forum last year, there was some debate about the issue of changing sea levels and the issue of what should be done for people living in the island states most likely to be affected. Mr Howard told reporters that there were two sides to the labour mobility issue: shifting people was one argument, but some of the Pacific leaders were concerned that their skills base would be weakened if they lost too many workers to New Zealand and Australia. When we think something is a good idea, we have to consider what the impact will be on the country. By training those people, giving them skills and preparing for the fact that there may be changes, not only will they be able to help their country if sea changes are not as drastic as some people claim but also they will be assisted to be more highly mobile if there are changes. They may not come to Australia and New Zealand; they may choose to go somewhere else for their qualifications.
If they do not have qualifications, they will have very little choice other than to accept the sorts of suggestions being put forward by the Greens. I do not think that is the best alternative. We are a party of choice. If we can educate these people and if sea level change is not so great, they will be much more useful in their home states. If it is the case that they need to move, they will have greater mobility and greater choice, and they will be useful to any receiving country. I do not know whether we could take them all. If they have had training at Australian technical level, that will be an advantage to any receiving country.
Do you know what? Sometimes I would love to be in a minority party, because I read the explanatory memorandum. What does it say? It says: ‘There may be some financial implications. But don’t worry about that.’ They will not explain. They will not even try and estimate the financial implications. I will tell you what the financial implications are. My information might be a bit out of date, but, when I was the parliamentary secretary for immigration, every thousand refugees cost us $25 million over the first five years, and then they start to make an economic contribution. I imagine that would be higher now. We have one of the best resettlement programs in the world. If the Greens had done a modicum of homework, they might have been able to put a guesstimate in there. But instead they have this little, fleeting sentence, ‘There will be financial implications.’ Are we going to reduce our humanitarian intake? Are we going to put more money into the budget? The Greens can be as flippant as they like, but in the end we have to balance the budget. And to have, in their explanatory memorandum, some offhand comment about the cost shows that this bill has not been thought through.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION (CLIMATE REFUGEES) AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-09,"—I am pleased to speak, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, to the Migration (Climate Refugees) Amendment Bill 2007, a bill from Senator Nettle of the Greens. The bill seeks to recognise refugees from climate change induced environmental disasters. The Democrats have long called for Australia to recognise the reality of climate change and, particularly, to recognise the immediate and significant threat that it poses to many Pacific island nations. We have long called for Australia to develop formal mechanisms for enabling us to accommodate people from Pacific island nations who are affected by climate change.
That, I think, is something that we should all agree on. It is very unfortunate that the government speakers have sought to dismiss or avoid that core issue. You might have concerns about the mechanism being put forward; indeed, I have some queries that I would raise about using this mechanism rather than alternative mechanisms, such as those the Democrats and I have put forward in other legislation. But the core principle remains: Australia has obligations, particularly to people from poorer nations, and particularly to people in our own region and Pacific island nations. We have obligations to ensure that, if and when they are affected severely by climate change induced events, or by climate change more broadly, we provide assistance to them—including, if necessary, enabling them to resettle or reside, even on a more temporary basis, within Australia, depending on their circumstances. That should be a simple given. If Australia as a nation could send that simple signal to the Pacific island nations—that we will provide assistance to and opportunities for them to resettle or reside here in the event of these sorts of problems occurring in their home countries as a result of climate change and climate change induced events—that would make a big difference.
We can work out different ways to do that, whether or not we have a formal visa specifically for that purpose, as is proposed in this legislation. I am not convinced from Senator Patterson’s contribution that she has actually read how this proposed visa would work and the way it would interrelate with existing programs. But this legislation seeks to introduce a specific class of visa known as a climate change refugee visa. Should we do it via that mechanism, as a specific, discrete visa? Or should we do it via a mechanism that I think would work better, which is to use the broader mechanism of a complementary protection visa, which takes into account wider humanitarian circumstances—into which climate change induced disasters would clearly fit? Or should we do it through a much more flexible arrangement with regard to entry rights for people from particular Pacific island nations across the board, without having to establish more defined and constrained humanitarian criteria?
I think there are arguments for all of those approaches. I lean towards the second and third models rather than the model that is put forward in this bill. But I think that just to slag off the whole concept not only is unfair but also sends a poor signal to our Pacific island neighbours—who already, in many cases, are less than impressed with the attitude of the Australian government to climate change as a whole and to what sort of assistance we may provide to people from these island nations as they are more severely affected by climate change.
Let us not kid ourselves: this will occur, whether it occurs via a one-off related environmental disaster or through cumulative reduction in liveable areas and arable land. Either way—and probably both ways—these islands not only are going to be affected but, according to some reports, are already being affected. I draw the Senate’s attention to a report by Kathy Marks which was published in a number of newspapers around the world. I think it was originally published in the Independent, in the UK, in July of this year. I have a version that was in the New Zealand Herald of 21 July which talks about Tuvalu.
One of the issues with the model that is put forward in the Greens legislation that I think needs to be recognised, regarding the eligibility requirement for a climate change refugee visa, is that the legislation gives to the minister the power to determine whether or not something is a climate change induced environmental disaster. It also puts some requirements on the minister as to what the minister has to take into account with regard to the disaster, and it gives that power to the minister alone. In response to some of the criticisms Senator Patterson was making, I say that it actually enables the minister to set a limit on the number of climate change refugee visas that are issued pursuant to each declaration. So, if anything, it is actually too broad. A minister who had the mindset that Senator Patterson has just outlined would just put the limit at zero, and then we would not have any problem with all the other issues she has raised.
Obviously, in any circumstance, what is stated here is a criterion for a climate change refugee visa. The criterion is that the person must have been displaced as a result of a climate change induced environmental disaster. Whilst I hope no-one in this chamber any longer disputes that climate change is a reality, we all know that it is difficult to specifically state that any individual disaster can be clearly seen to be a result of climate change. Certainly it is difficult to demonstrate it in a legal sense, as opposed to it being a reasonable assumption for somebody to make based on the available scientific evidence.
The mechanism’s intent is welcome, but it could potentially be quite easily circumvented by a government that was not interested in using this visa. That is why I think the Democrats’ model, outlined in legislation I proposed last year regarding a complementary protection visa, is better. Complementary protection visas involve a wider group of people than the narrow definition of ‘refugee’ under the refugee convention. They are defined in the Democrats’ legislation as people who would face a substantial threat to their personal security, human dignity or human rights if they were to return to their country of origin. It is normally in circumstances where they are under some other, wider threat that does not fit within the narrow constraints of the refugee convention. It can also be for severe humanitarian reasons, which can include natural disasters. It enables that flexibility to be there. It does not require it to be clearly linked to climate change per se; it can just be related to a deterioration in circumstances in a particular country which make it no longer liveable for a certain group of people. It could be in response to a specific disaster which it would be reasonable to assume is linked to climate change, but it does not need to have that link demonstrated in any legal sense. I think that is a better way to go.
I also take issue with a couple of other things that Senator Patterson said. It is frustrating, disappointing and very tiresome to continue to hear the regurgitating of dishonest propaganda by the government. They continually use phrases like ‘illegal immigrants’. Again, when we are talking about people who are, and have been demonstrated to be, genuine refugees fleeing very serious and real persecution, their mode of arrival is irrelevant. It is certainly not illegal, and it is simply false to call them ‘illegal immigrants’. For someone who is a former parliamentary secretary in this area to be using such terminology is a sign of how deeply ingrained the government’s propaganda mantras have become in the consciousness of those who are forced to have to defend the indefensible approach of the persecution by our government of people who are fleeing persecution by other governments.
The notion that you can just say that refugees cost so many dollars per person is typical of the narrow, bean-counting Treasury mindset that has been used to try and create a negative attitude towards refugees. Of course, there are some costs involved in resettlement programs, but in any of the costings I have seen there is never any recognition of the contribution that people make, even in those initial periods when they are settling. There is some recognition that, after a few years, when people do get settled and established, they start making more immediate, clear-cut and definable economic contributions. But there is much more to the contribution that people, including refugees, make than just the tax take we get from their paying income tax, and those very narrow, dollars-and-cents measures.
Refugees have provided immense benefit to Australia in all sorts of ways, far beyond just counting how much it costs to have them in our health system versus how much tax money we get from their income and other mechanisms. It is typical of that clearly misrepresentative approach and the absurdly narrow and therefore misleading costing criteria that are used as a way to skew our migration and humanitarian intake towards business and skilled migrants, and people with stacks of money, and away from people in the family and humanitarian areas. Of course, you get more money immediately from people who are coming here to fill job vacancies in the skilled area, but the other, wider benefits should not be discounted.
Let me also emphasise, given that we are having debates in this place at the moment about the importance of citizenship and of people engaging in and becoming full members of the Australian community, that the evidence is clear-cut: the one group of people who become citizens most quickly, who are most keen to engage fully with Australia and all of its responsibilities, are refugees. Many of the people who come here under other visas and who are here as permanent residents for decades do not become citizens. That is fine; that is their right. But it is an indication of the different types of contributions people make and how you cannot just pull this all back to narrow, dollars-and-cents measures.
Returning to the article by Kathy Marks that I spoke about, from the Independent and the New Zealand Herald, it goes into quite a lot of detail about the very severe environmental impact that is already occurring in Tuvalu. Most Tuvaluans live just one to two metres above sea level. Whilst the article says that there is not enough data to establish a definitive trend, the data that is around does suggest possibly a half-a-metre rise in the next century. That does not mean they can just move another half a metre up the hill. There are no hills. Most of Tuvalu is not much higher than a few metres above sea level. It is not just about people standing on an island and the water slowly rising up until it hits their ankles and then their knees. It is about the vulnerability of islands so that they are unable to withstand severe weather events.
The article describes an islet that has already been lost in Tuvalu. It talks about the lagoon around Funafuti, a town in Tuvalu that used to have seven islets around its lagoon; now there are six. One of them has already been wiped out via a series of cyclones towards the end of the last century. It was sufficiently strong that it stripped off the vegetation. That meant the sand and soil were no longer held in place and got washed away. All that is left is a bit of rubble that is visible at low tide. Is that specifically caused by climate change? Who can specifically demonstrate that? But when you have that in combination with clear evidence of rising sea levels, clear evidence of more severe weather events and an obvious vulnerability, it is pretty clear that you do not have to quibble about whether it is 80 per cent climate change induced or 30 per cent. Whatever it is, some of these islands are already in serious trouble.
It also means that land that might have been arable at one stage becomes less so, or not usable at all for growing any sorts of crops or food. It can mean water tables become saline. It is not just about the land slowly becoming inundated. The evidence is clear, as that article shows, that this is already a serious problem.
There is an issue with using the title of ‘climate change refugee visa’. I do not mean this particularly as a criticism of the legislation, but it is one of the problems we face in this area and it is one thing the government has used to dismiss calls by many people, including the Democrats, for Australia to recognise its responsibility to take in climate change refugees. In the day-to-day parlance of the word ‘refugees’ it is completely appropriate. We all know what we mean when we talk about climate change refugees: we mean that people who have been affected by climate change can no longer live where they are, or not enough of them can, or the available land can no longer manage that level of population, and they need to flee. We all recognise that, but putting it in law under the label of ‘refugees’ means linking the concept to that of the refugee convention, and the simple fact is that it does not fit within the definition of the refugee convention.
The definition in the refugee convention—which is actually quite narrow, despite what you would believe if you heard some of the propaganda and rhetoric around the place—is that a person must have a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion and is unable to return, or so fearful that they are unwilling to return, to that country. You could probably stretch it to say that you are a member of a particular social group that is affected by climate change induced disaster, but I think that is stretching it further than is helpful. We all use the terminology, as we did when the tsunami occurred in Indonesia, of people being refugees from that disaster. We use it in the general day-to-day sense, but they would not, in my view, fit under the definition in the refugee convention. I do not think you could say they are members of a particular social group; they are residents of a particular location. I think also you would really be stretching it to say that they are not able to return because of a fear of persecution. They are not able to return because of humanitarian circumstances–their lands wiped out, their homes gone, no food or whatever it might be. The complementary protection mechanism is a better one because it has a much broader humanitarian component to it.
In my view Australia should take a much more liberal approach—’liberal’ in the true sense of the word, not in the totally bastardised sense of the word that we have had to swallow in this country by virtue of having the most illiberal party ever in government having the name Liberal attached to it; in the proper sense of the word ‘liberal’—to the ability of people from at least some Pacific island nations to be able to enter Australia. This is the reality in New Zealand, where a number of Pacific island nations have much freer entry rights, as we in Australia have in our partnership with New Zealand. There is a very valid case for considering trialling and potentially adopting such measures with Pacific island nations. We do not have anywhere near as strong links as we should. We do not have anywhere near strong enough a recognition of the realities of Pacific island nations.
Many of these nations are places that are not large in numbers of people. It would assist us to strengthen the ties and connections that we should have with the Pacific region and that tend to get totally and appallingly ignored in public debate and awareness and in political debate. It is my personal view—it is probably not a party position—that we should be looking very proactively at loosening the constraints on people from at least some Pacific island nations to be able to more easily enter and reside in Australia under various circumstances.
I have spoken in this place before about the Senate inquiry report that examined whether or not to allow Pacific island labourers into Australia under specific, confined circumstances and about the benefits that that could provide to economies in Pacific islands. I think we could explore more of those sorts of things. Whilst there is a genuine risk of climate change induced disasters—and we need to recognise our obligations there—there are wider difficulties in the Pacific islands, and they have got bigger problems than just climate change. Let us not kid ourselves: climate change is one of the threats to the economies of these nations. One of the ways we can assist them significantly in economic terms is to enable them to more fully connect with the Australian economy as people and as individuals. It would be valuable for them economically, and I believe it would be valuable for us socially, culturally, politically and economically. That is a wider call beyond the climate change issue, but if there were much freer scope for people to reside here it would also then reduce the need to try to find mechanisms like this. Obviously, if their home became unliveable for whatever reason they would have that opportunity in Australia and New Zealand. I think that would help bind the whole region together— (Time expired)

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2007-08-09,"—In commencing, I want to acknowledge the work done by Senator Nettle and, in particular, by Senator Milne in bringing the Migration (Climate Refugees) Amendment Bill 2007 before us. It gives us the opportunity to again debate in this place the genuine issues around climate change and also the real responsibilities that we have in Australia to accept our part in what must be a global response to a global problem.
Certainly we are looking now—immediately and not some time in some nebulous future—at a crisis occurring in many parts of the South Pacific. The evidence is there. One of the clear differences between the debate we were able to have this afternoon and ones which we have been able to have in the past in this place is that there is no confusion or argument about the reality of the problem. That shows that we have moved forward together and that the amazing amounts of evidence that are before us and have been building up over a long period of time indicate that there is no room for doubt that the impact of climate change on our environment has had a devastating impact on communities across the world. Whilst in the South Pacific and in the Oceania region it is something with which people live on a daily basis, we in Australia can sometimes distance ourselves from the problem because we can pretend that it is elsewhere.
Certainly many people who live in Australia, if they took the time to consider the evidence, to listen to the reports and to engage in the necessary community discussions, would understand that many of the climate change issues that are impacting on us are also affecting others. We have before us and we understand the impact of the major horror of the drought on many parts of Australia, the land changes and also the effect of temperature changes. We would be able to make the links to show that environmental changes are impacting on each of us daily. However, the luxury of being able to remove ourselves from the equation is not one which is shared by people who are living on islands in Oceania and the South Pacific.
Several weeks ago I was able to meet with a delegation of people from Tuvalu. I had to admit a certain ignorance, with my appalling geography, of knowing exactly where Tuvalu was. I was able to get a copy of the globe and, with their help, find the very small islands that are Tuvalu. There were also some women with them from Kiribati, another part of the world of which I had heard but have not been able to visit. I was largely ignorant of the issues that were facing them as a community. They could not take an objective view of the impact of climate change. Their personal experiences and the photographs that they brought with them to the meeting showed that their land is disappearing. That makes a confronting argument. It is no longer theoretical; it is no longer academic. It is not something you could include in a footnote. Where you were able to have animals, where you were able to walk, where you were able to gather as recently as three or four years ago is now under water. The positive aspect is that the people are receiving international support. Years ago it was only a few dedicated enthusiasts in the area that took the time to acknowledge the problems, study them, examine them and bring them back into the wider debate. Now, through very strong international environmental links, the knowledge that is gained by working with the people in those areas can be brought immediately back into the debate, which we must all have.
There is no argument that the land is disappearing. There is no argument that the long-term prognosis is that some of these whole communities are going to cease to exist. It is not something that people are happy about, certainly. It is not something from which we can distance our communities in Australia. It is our clear responsibility as global citizens to find out about what is happening, to identify what the causes are and, most importantly, to share that knowledge and to support the people who are living with this reality. In that context we must continue with the amazing work of so many of our academics across a range of institutions in this country. There is academic knowledge, scientific knowledge and the work of centres of excellence that have been established at several universities in our country. They have been working, studying and being part of global knowledge-sharing on the issues of climate change and environmental progress. We have responsibilities individually and as a community to change the way we live and to acknowledge that every change must have a reaction. We are able to work with the world to make a difference and to help people who may not have a future if we do not make these decisions.
The bill that Senator Nettle has brought before us puts forward one solution. Whilst that is not a solution with which the ALP is currently totally in support, it should be debated. We should see the focus of that bill as part of whatever response we as an Australian community must make. The very sense that there are people who will be made homeless, who will have their futures curtailed, who will not be able to stay living on their land—the very fact that those people will exist—must be acknowledged openly. Australia must take some role in looking at an international solution, whether that means we should take a certain number of people or whether that means there should be a new visa status created. I share the views Senator Bartlett put forward at the end of his contribution. I am uncomfortable with just creating a new visa category in our immigration process. I do not accept that that is the best step forward. We do accept and acknowledge that there will be people on our globe that will be climate change refugees. It is something about which we must make long-term plans. We must see how we, as a country, can work with other services, not just our immigration program.
Of course our immigration program will have a role to play in whatever the Australian government is prepared to move forward with. We have heard a number of speakers this afternoon wax lyrical about the way the Australian immigration program operates. While there are problems and there have been problems—many of them have been identified in this place and in wider reviews of the way our immigration program operates—I think there is real strength in many of the processes that are in place through the department of immigration. There is real commitment and professionalism by so many of their staff. I think that using that skill and knowledge is one of the steps that we could take in looking at what we could do as part of a global response. So using, reviewing and understanding the way the current immigration system operates is a threshold issue. That must be done.
How we then look at the various claims from people who are seeking immigration support must be considered amidst all the other things that are in front of any government looking at long-term policy. The immigration process is one response. But, building on that, we must also use the knowledge and the skills of so many other parts of our Australian government services. Certainly the Australian Labor Party has long supported the concept of effectively working with our aid budget, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to look specifically at how we can work with communities so that they can play a role in developing their own futures. Working with the effective people who are currently in the AusAID program, we would be able to work with people in their own countries to establish specific areas of research and support and to make short-term and long-term plans for their futures.
Indeed, that must be the process that we would all be following. It is not imposing a solution from outside, because, when that happens, that dismisses the history, the knowledge and the experiences of the people who are most in need of support. That process could be extended to all areas where there is a need for support. Having outside assistance identified and then imposed on any community may offer some short-term relief, but, as a long-term solution, it is not the best way to go. Certainly there must be an ongoing effort in this country to look at our overseas activities. The last AusAID program particularly looked at our closest neighbours. So many of the people who are confronted by the immediate impact of climate change on their land are our neighbours, so not only do we have a neighbourly responsibility because they are people who live closest to us but we also have an established responsibility in international support in the aid program.
There has been some particularly interesting work done linking some of the Millennium Development Goals, which we have talked about many times in this place, to the impact of climate change and looking at how the MDGs can be implemented in various countries. Using the established programs that we have and using the skills and the commitment of people who are already working in the field, we need to make sure that an awareness of climate change impacts and environmental impacts of any decision is linked into the planning processes and also the evaluation processes of planning that is done. Just by taking that one step, we keep the message before all of us and before the people across the globe.
We must accept that Australians cannot self-assess themselves out of this issue. It is not enough that we understand the impact of climate change on our own environment—and that is becoming much more widely accepted and people are thinking about that. As recently as yesterday, we heard a submission from Australian Seniors talking about the issues that their extensive survey shows Australian citizens over 50 are interested in as we head towards the next election. What were the things which they were concerned about? For the first time environmental issues—the issues of climate change and of our land, our climate, our wonderful resources, water, air quality and all of those things—and their impact on citizens were identified. Our seniors identified that they were concerned about what kind of world they were going to be leaving to their children and grandchildren. It was a key issue in the Australian Seniors survey.
It would be useful if that awareness and knowledge about our own environment were extended to understanding the impact that these things are having on people who are our neighbours. That is one of the things we can achieve through having a debate around the bill that the Australian Greens have brought to us: identifying the issues that have caused people to lose their land, to lose their citizenship. If we identify what has caused those issues then we can act globally to address those causes and not only to look at what we can do to make changes in their environment but also to welcome, where possible, the relocation where it is best able to be done.
The process for the future must include the acknowledgement that the UN processes provide a wonderful mechanism for that international discussion, consultation and sharing of knowledge. There have been numerous UN conferences, and there have been some in which Australia has taken a role, but I think we need to continually reinforce that the United Nations—the environmental committees, the future acknowledgement of the global environment in which we operate—provide an effective mechanism for all of us to operate in and to share our knowledge. So the ongoing role of Australia in any of those community development programs must continue. We must take our responsibilities in there and effectively fund that, because it is no longer good enough just to have strong commitments and rhetoric around what we think ought to happen. Through the processes that are already in place, we need to make sure that we adapt appropriate mechanisms of funding and also make sure that our people are actively involved in all levels. We need to make sure that any of the programs that are put in place are effectively evaluated and that evaluation involves the communities in which we are working. That is developing and becoming better through the AusAID process, but it is certainly one of the key links that we must take into whatever happens next in this debate.
There is goodwill around acknowledging that the environment is important to all of us, and that is something that has not always been in place. When I was listening to the stories of the women from Tuvalu and Kiribati, goodwill was certainly not enough, but it was the opening gambit to any ongoing conversation. I cannot but help make a comment about the organisation Friends of the Earth, which I have worked with for many years and which was the sponsor of the community consultations that I was invited to a couple of weeks ago. We have heard that the Friends of the Earth have a longstanding credibility in this area. While people do not always agree with everything that any organisation puts forward or is involved in, we certainly need to acknowledge the wonderful commitment and the international credibility over the years of people who have worked for and who have been members of the Friends of the Earth. If we can at least hold on to the title—if there is an organisation called Friends of the Earth, all of us should be keen to be part of that because, as citizens of this planet, we automatically need to be friends of the earth.
The ALP do not support the bill as it is in front of us. To keep the debate moving forward, it is absolutely essential that we continue to be involved in discussion about the impact of climate change and the reality that for some people the impact is not discomfort; it is disaster. We need to make sure that we, as global citizens, are part of developing solutions to the program and not dismissing it. We need to include all people who wish to be involved and ensure that we bring science, as well as a very strong element of compassion, into any ongoing debate—and I am sure the debate must be and will be ongoing.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION (CLIMATE REFUGEES) AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2007-08-09,"—We are here today debating this private senator’s bill from the Greens, the Migration (Climate Refugees) Amendment Bill 2007, which aims to provide a climate change visa for victims of natural disasters consequent upon climate change. The bill inserts into subsection 5(1) of the Migration Act a list of a variety of natural and other disasters, which it says might result from climate change. These include sea level rise, coastal erosion, desertification, collapsing ecosystems, freshwater contamination and more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events, such as cyclones, tornadoes, flooding and drought, which mean that inhabitants are unable to lead safe or sustainable lives in the immediate environment.
Indeed, all of those things are very serious and dramatic environmental events that would occur anyway, whether or not there was climate change, and which could amount to a disaster in any community. We could add to them the great floods which occur from time to time in our region in countries such as Bangladesh and the tsunamis which have occurred in Indonesia and Aceh within the last four or five years and which occur periodically around both the Indian Ocean Basin and the Pacific Rim. Even the droughts that we have in Australia rather than in other countries are environmental disasters which affect people’s lives.
I suppose the idea of having a special visa for climate change induced disasters begs the question: does this really add anything to Australia’s way of dealing with these kinds of disasters around the world? It is not a question that is easy to answer because these kinds of environmental events occur in any case and Australia, if I might say so, does have a very good record of providing assistance to countries which suffer environmental disasters of various kinds. We are, in fact, a very good global citizen in the way that we do respond to disasters around the world.
We certainly have an excellent record of having jumped in and assisted with local responses very quickly after the problems in Aceh following the tsunami which occurred there. We have not only assisted in the immediate aftermath of disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, fires, drought and so on; we have also assisted with medical services both locally and in evacuating victims to Australian hospitals. More importantly in places such as Aceh, to use that as an example, we have put in long-term plans to restore the communities to the kinds of conditions or better than they were before these disasters occurred.
Australia has a great record of working in cooperation with international and domestic partners to improve disaster preparedness and engage in risk reduction strategies. In fact, around the world, Australia provides something like 150,000 tonnes of food aid every year valued at about $65 million to people in countries subject to frequent environmental crises. These include: Bangladesh, which is very often subject to massive flooding; Indonesia, where the tsunami occurred in Aceh but which suffers also from episodes of very heavy rain during the monsoon season and frequently needs assistance; Sri Lanka, where we have provided assistance; and Africa, in Sudan and Chad, where Australian aid has been very helpful in assisting people who have come through the impacts of droughts which have compromised food supplies.
Australia does provide as I said 150,000 tonnes of food aid every year—half of the tonnage comes directly from Australian farmers and suppliers and the rest is sourced around the world. Australia contributes financially to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and we also support other humanitarian agencies around the world, such as Oxfam and Save the Children. In fact, in global terms, Australia has a very enviable record as a good citizen in supporting people suffering the consequences of environmental disasters.
We support protecting and improving conditions for refugees, finding durable solutions to refugee crises and assisting with the reintegration of refugees in their homelands, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The Australian government provides long-term support to areas that have been struck by disaster or conflict through the support of rehabilitation and reconstruction activities. As I said earlier, this was the case in Aceh, where we are now moving into the phase of the reconstruction and re-establishment of housing, schools and other facilities such as hospitals. Beyond that we do assist in other programs such as mine clearance, mine awareness and victim assistance programs. Of course those are not the subject of this private member’s bill; but they are, nevertheless, indicative of the kind of compassion which Australia exhibits towards people who are the victims of disasters around the world.
The principal department in the Australian government providing relief and assistance in emergencies, such as those which might occur during extreme weather conditions, is AusAID. AusAID is an excellent department that is active from the moment it becomes aware of a disaster. The first priority of AusAID is to assess the situation and gather information to ensure that help is provided to those in need. Once a country has officially requested assistance, AusAID and the Australian government respond quickly. A good example of that was on 2 April this year when there was a major earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale in the north-west of the Solomon Islands. The earthquake prompted a tsunami believed to be between two and 10 metres high which struck the western Solomon Islands and caused quite a lot of damage. It is thought that at least 52 people died and up to 7,000 were made homeless. AusAID moved quickly and provided $3 million for emergency relief and reconstruction assistance to the Solomon Islands. We sent in six medical teams to attend to disaster victims in the affected areas of the Solomons, including the most remote villages and islands. So Australia responded very quickly to that environmental disaster. I suppose from that one can conclude quite reasonably that Australia does play a very important role in attending to the consequences of environmental disasters in our region.
I will now come back to the subject of this debate, which is whether or not a special visa for refugees who are victims of environmental disasters consequent upon climate change would really add anything to our armature of help for the victims of environmental disasters. I have to conclude that the answer is probably no. Australia is already providing aid and support to victims of a wide variety of environmental disasters on a broad scale, and I do not think a special visa of this kind would add anything meaningful at all to the kind of assistance that Australia gives.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—I call Senator Humphries. Senator Humphries, you are aware that you have approximately four minutes to speak.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION (CLIMATE REFUGEES) AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2007-08-09,"—I am aware of that but I hope to make up for my lack of time with the quality of my contribution in this debate. In the brief time that I have, I want to put on the record very clearly that Australia cannot afford to ignore the implications of climate change. We have heard predictions that global warming will contribute to a rise in average world temperatures over the next century or so of somewhere between one and six degrees and that this will inevitably result in the loss of ice from the extremities of the planet which will contribute to rising sea levels. The estimate as to how much sea levels will rise is, of course, a matter of some debate. But we need to be aware that, at the more extreme end, those estimates range up to a sea level rise of at least five metres for each degree of temperature increase. If that occurs, we will have a major environmental and humanitarian disaster on our hands. If that comes about, clearly Australia will need to engage in that. I might add that a sea level rise of that order would of course impose a massive change on Australia itself and we would be looking at dealing with a great deal of dislocation and social anxiety within Australia itself. Nonetheless, we have always shouldered our responsibilities to our region; and this would be no exception, I am certain.
Having said that, I note that the Migration (Climate Refugees) Amendment Bill 2007 bought before the Senate by the Greens does smack a little of being a stunt. There is no clear indication given in this debate as to why a particular category of refugee needs to be created. Given the background of Australia as an extremely generous contributor in opening its doors to those migrants affected by humanitarian and other disasters around the world, I see no reason to adopt this particular piece of legislation. We have a proud and consistent record of being prepared to assist citizens of other nations who cannot, for whatever reason, live in those nations any longer. Since at least the Second World War our doors have been open wide to those people. Whatever the reason a person finds it necessary to leave their homeland, Australia has been prepared to offer refuge; and we will continue, I am sure, to do so. Since the Second World War 6.6 million people have found refuge in this country. I have no reason to doubt that that policy would continue. Why we need to make the change evident in this legislation has not been explained. What is inadequate about the present migration legislation has not been explained. I think we need to be very cautious about elevating this issue for the sake of a stunt by the Australian Greens, where the playthings for this stunt are the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands. We already have a very close relationship with those inhabitants, and we will continue to support them in a variety of ways. Others in this debate have pointed to the support already being provided by the Australian government to assist those countries to deal with climate change. I have no doubt that that will continue and I have no doubt that Australia’s generous approach to these matters will continue.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-09,"—I would like to speak to document No. 1, which is the report for the last six months of last year on livestock mortalities for exports by sea. It is a requirement under the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act for the federal government to table details of all export of livestock and the mortalities involved in each of those voyages for each six-month period. This particular report deals with the six months from July to December last year and details a whole range of different voyages, their points of departure, their destination points, the length or duration of the voyages and the number of livestock on each vessel—the vast bulk of which are sheep. Over two million live sheep were exported from Australia during that six-month period, as were 363,084 cattle plus relatively small numbers of goats, buffaloes and camels. On this occasion there were no deer.
The reason why this process is followed is because of what is known as the Kenery review, which occurred after one of what has been a continuing string of disasters involving the live export trade over many years. Every time there is a disaster, whether it is a fire at sea, ships not being able to offload their livestock or details of appalling cruelty, the government says this is a one-off aberration. They then hold an inquiry, bring in some recommendations, make a few changes at the edges and then assure everybody that everything about the trade is now humane—that is, until the next expose shows that the facts are completely different. The simple fact is that there is an alternative to the live export trade. The chilled and processed meat trade is already significantly greater than the live animal export trade. If we put the same energy into expanding that trade as the government, and those who benefit from it, put into maintaining and expanding the livestock trade, then not only would we have a significant reduction in animal cruelty but we would also have significant value adding for jobs in Australia—although I do accept that there is the minor issue of being able to fill those jobs due to the skills and labour shortage in many parts of Australia.
I want to specifically point out one voyage detailed here, and that is a voyage through Livestock Shipping Services that left Portland and Fremantle in November of last year. It was a voyage of over 30 days and included more than 72,000 sheep and 7,805 cattle. One of the mechanisms of the report is that if there is a percentage of deaths over what is known as the reportable percentage—which I think is two per cent—then an inquiry is required. I draw senators’ attention to just how much transparency there is or is not in this area. This is one of the things they point to. They had the Kenery review and they say, ‘We have this detailed report which is tabled in the Senate every six months. You can’t get any more transparent than that.’
What happens is that once a report or inquiry is triggered because there are too many deaths—as occurred in this case with over three per cent of the cattle dying on this voyage—there is an inquiry through AQIS. But all the summary of the report that was made public said was that pneumonia and heat stress were the main factors causing the deaths. It has taken six months through freedom of information inquiries for the organisation Animals Australia to get the full report from AQIS about the real reasons. Firstly, it is outrageous that they do not have access to that report straightaway. If we are about transparency then why the hell isn’t that made public? Secondly, it became apparent that the deaths were due to a range of other issues, including prolonged recumbency and leg infections due to abrasive flooring. Indexes 2 to 7 said: ‘The relative difficulty of the cattle in getting up off the floor with abrasions, and wet flooring caused skin damage which became infected because of the wetter than normal conditions. Once infected, the cattle spent an increased time recumbent and the cause of death is septicaemia.’ Why aren’t those things made public straightaway? Why is it up to an animal rights organisation to have to work for six months to get the facts out in the open, if we are about transparency? I draw people’s attention to the piece on the back page of the Sydney Morning Herald today by their freedom of information editor, Matthew Moore, which goes into the situation in more detail. It simply shows for all of the smokescreens—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Regretfully I must interrupt you, Senator Bartlett, because the time allocated for the consideration of government documents has expired. Senator Macdonald, I can assure you that those orders relating to government documents that have not been considered here tonight—that is, every one but one—will remain on the Notice Paper and will be considered on the next day of sitting. The question is that the Senate take note of document No. 1.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Meat and Livestock Industry</title>,Documents,34,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-08-09,"—I want to very briefly talk to the report from the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which is a committee I have the honour to be a member of. It is a very hardworking committee chaired by Dr Andrew Southcott, from the other place. The treaty committee looks through a great number of treaties. It is a surprise to me, having just joined the committee, how many treaties the Australian government deals with each month. There are an enormous number. I think that most people would be surprised at the number of treaties that are dealt with.
It disturbs me that the committee which is meant to scrutinise these particular treaties does so only after they have all entered into operation. It seems to me that parliamentary oversight of these treaties would be better done at an earlier stage in the process. I remember I was speaking on a treaty here in this chamber and then a couple of months later when I went to my first treaties committee meeting I found that the committee was then just looking at that treaty which had already been adopted and been through parliament. The process seems wrong to me. This is something that I think the government should have a look at. It is not an urgent matter, but I think in the next few months, perhaps following the election, the government should really have a look at the purpose of having parliamentary scrutiny of treaties. There seems to be little point in having scrutiny of treaties if the treaties are already signed and in operation by the time the scrutiny takes place. Why do we bother? I think that is something the government should have a look at in the fullness of time.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2007-08-09,"—Tonight I want to talk about the topic of respite, in the sense that the term is currently used to describe the support given to families who care for a person with a disability. According to the Oxford dictionary, ‘respite’ means ‘a short period of rest or relief from something difficult’. There is no doubt that full-time, unremitting care for a person with a disability can be something difficult. Many families undertake extraordinary workloads, with very little support. A recent report from Carers Australia showed that on average the carers of people with mental illness spent an average of 104 hours a week in the care and monitoring of that person. One mother commented:
It’s so undignified asking for help. I virtually had to slash my wrists and drop blood all over their desks before the administration would give me respite.
And, chillingly, there are parents who, in desperation, have done worse.
I am proud that our government has recognised the needs of these families, with funding of $1.8 billion for respite and accommodation services. But now that the public call for tenders for provision of these respite services under this funding has been made, I would like to urge all those in the disability sector to rethink respite. In fact, I think it is time we found a whole new term for it. The term ‘respite’ describes a one-way street—a break from—not a mutual opportunity for productive and enjoyable time apart for all the parties involved.
Every member of any functional family group needs respite from the other members of that group. No matter how dearly we care for those we live with, almost none of us could cope with 24 hours a day, seven days a week together. For some families, respite means dad’s Saturday golf, and it is not just respite for dad. And then there is work, school and many different sporting and recreation activities that constitute a normal life. But in most families these opportunities for respite are wound into the fabric of everyday life. They are chosen freely by the participants because the individual enjoys them and finds them productive.
So it is not in fact the respite itself that any of us need. What we all need are opportunities for productive and enjoyable stimulation, relaxation, rest or recovery. It is only within the disability and aged sector that respite is generally seen as the answer to that need. There is a danger, when we characterise respite for families that include a person with a disability as a break away from the person with a disability, that we ignore or discount the needs of that person with a disability. There is a danger, when we view the person with a disability only as a burden, that the person with a disability is placed into a program, any program.
Research shows that very few families—and even fewer people with a disability—are happy with the respite service opportunities that are currently available. In my view, this is because the respite opportunities are generally inflexible and completely at odds with that idea of respite as part of a normal life or of normal routines. At present, most respite services offered are in day centres or overnight care for varying periods, and sometimes, occasionally, in-home assistance is available. In many cases, these services are just a temporary fix. They do nothing to improve the overall lives or quality of life of families or the individuals within them. Families may get a break from the physical care of the person with a disability, but that is all. Their concern, even guilt, about leaving their loved one in an unfamiliar environment where their needs and wishes are often poorly understood certainly does not provide mental rest and recovery for the family. On the flip side, many people with a disability view respite as punitive. A week or so in a strange and stressful environment often means the person returns home more stressed than when they left, and the circle and the need for respite within the family starts all over again.
I would like to turn around the way we view respite for people with a disability and their families. Respite must be normalised. By that I mean that, instead of formalising respite by taking the person with a disability out of the family and into a structured, inflexible program or service, we need to look at how other families achieve respite from each other—the Saturday afternoon golf and so forth that I was talking about before. We need to bring respite into the family, to weave respite into normal everyday life for families that include a person with a disability—just like other families do. Most families do not see the natural breaks that they have from each other as respite because they have functioning and supported lives. For families caring for a person with a disability there may well be very little support. Families can live very isolated lives, but the provision of respite services does nothing to assist this. Taking the person with a disability away does not diminish their social isolation within their local community and it brings nothing new into the lives of the families and the parents.
I truly appreciate that there are many families desperately in need of support in their full-time care of a loved one with a disability. But respite, as the term is currently understood, is not the answer. The answer is to build opportunities for rest, recovery and stimulation into the everyday lives of these families. And this is not best done in a bricks and mortar respite centre away from the local community and away from the family home for slabs of time. It is best done by supporting the rhythms of everyday life, of ordinary life—perhaps someone who can assist at mealtimes, perhaps someone to come to the house to offer art or music classes while the rest of the family go about what they would like to do, perhaps someone to accompany the family on holidays so everyone gets a break.
Currently, much respite simply helps dysfunctional families to remain dysfunctional: they are not quite in crisis, but they are on the verge of it. If we continue to provide respite by making it a fix that goes outside the network, outside the family and which does nothing to help build social relationships and community relationships for these families and for these people, then we just continue this cycle. We do nothing to improve the lives of the person with a disability; we do nothing to improve the community connections and the relationships of the other family members within this situation. To me, the more normal we can make respite services, the better and more long-lasting the benefits for families will be. I encourage any organisation—I particularly encourage smaller organisations—to consider applying to offer the respite services under the government round of funding that is currently available. But I would ask them to look at this in terms of how you might bring respite into a family’s life, not take a person out of the family to offer them respite. We can make some big advances in improving overall lives, not just having little fixes that improve things for that instant but do not improve things overall.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Respite</title>,Adjournment,37,1
