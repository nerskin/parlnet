"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2009-08-11,"—I continue my speech about the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and what is proposed to this chamber. As I said when last speaking on this, Bayswater power station in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales produces 40 per cent of the electricity for New South Wales. The cost of their coal under the proposed emissions trading scheme, as they have reported to me, will rise from $350 million a year to a massive $950 million a year.
What cost will this put on business and what cost will this put on households? Sure, the government is saying that there will be rebates. There will be rebates until the government runs out of the money, and at the rate the debt is building that will not be long. I want to give you one example. Bindaree Beef, the abattoirs that I am so proud of for the way they carry out their business in Inverell, the town I live at, employs 600 people. Bindaree Beef pays around $160,000 a month for their electricity bill. If that is going to rise by 50 or 60 per cent, as the models have said electricity prices may well rise, that is going to be an extra $1 million a year for that abattoir just to pay the electricity bill.
But of course under the Waxman Markey bill proposed in America there are no such costs on the abattoirs in America. How does a value-adding business like Bindaree Beef compete and retain markets into places such as Japan and Korea when their overseas competitors do not have these extra costs lumped on them? This is a crazy situation we are facing. We are going to close down industries and increase unemployment—and we ask the question: what for?
The carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are currently around 380 parts per million. Assuming the rest of the world remains at balance on that, considering that places like China, India and Indonesia are most unlikely to make reductions, Australia could be billed for as much as $200 billion by the year 2020. That will have the effect of reducing the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere from 380 parts per million to 379 parts per million, which is a reduction of one part per million. As you would be well aware, if you have a big tub in front of you with one million dollar coins in it and you took one coin out, then the change would be miniscule, minute—call it what you like—it would be nothing. And it would be at the cost of some $200 billion to the Australian industry and the Australian people.
I just want to highlight the way that countries all round the world that are talking about cap and trade systems have excluded agriculture. But not in Australia—we will make a decision on that in the year 2013 and perhaps agriculture may be excluded or included in the emissions trading scheme and the CPRS. This is a crazy situation, however. Farmers, the very people who feed this nation, will be living in limbo until 2013. How do they plan their future, their cash flow, their borrowings, their investments, their expansions, when they do not know what their costs are going to be? Yet the Kyoto agreement does not recognise carbon in the soil, and it is one of the great things that our farmers can do. So farmers are going to face the bills, more than likely, but not receive the credits. As I said in my first speech to this place in September last year, do not take the supply of food in this nation for granted. Our farmers work hard against all sorts of odds and deliver high-quality, cheaply priced food.
In conclusion, what have we seen? We have seen politics introduced into this policy. We have heard Senator Wong say that we must act straightaway, that it is important we act straightaway to save the globe. So what do we do? We delay the introduction for 12 months because it is no longer really important. What is important is that we have an election before we actually start the program so that those industries that are moved overseas, those industries that are shut down, those people that are going to lose their jobs, will have to vote before it happens. Unfortunately, this is a politically driven scheme which is unrealistic, and we will certainly not support it. Thank you.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2009-08-11,"—It is a great pleasure to rise to speak today on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009 and related bills. This is one of the most important pieces of legislation to ever come before this parliament. I want to give an overview of why I believe the Senate finds itself in the position it is now in, apparently poised to reject a bill which the overwhelming majority of Australian people want to see passed.
Let us begin by remembering that those opposite were in office for 11 years. In those 11 years they did nothing whatsoever about climate change, despite years of warnings from scientists and economists both in Australia and overseas. Inaction was their only action. Despite statements of good intentions from successive ministers, including the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Turnbull, this subject was ultimately just too hard for the Howard government. It was just too hard for a cabinet who apparently believed that the Arctic icecap was melting for no apparent reason, or that it was being caused by sunspots. It was a cabinet enthralled perhaps by Andrew Bolt’s blog. It was a cabinet who failed to take action on climate change and, in part, it was a cabinet no doubt motivated by the fact that there was too much resistance from the National Party. The National Party appear to believe that climate change will disappear as long as they resolutely keep imagining that it is not happening.
Those opposite were well aware of the mounting tide of evidence that dangerous global climate change was caused by human activity and that it was posing an increasingly dire threat to Australia’s economy, to Australia’s environment, to the Australian way of life and, in particular, to the future of Australians who live in rural and regional areas—regions which are of course most dependent on rainfall, river flows and healthy landscapes. Those opposite know all these things. Year after year, they have talked about climate change. They set up committees to study it. They promised that they would do something about it soon, but they did nothing for 11 years. And so it has been left to the Rudd government to take action in this area, as in so many other areas.
It took the Rudd government to sign the Kyoto protocol, committing us finally to take action on climate change. It took the Rudd government to get to grips with the science and the economics. It took the Rudd government to design a carbon pollution reduction scheme that will cut our carbon emissions without damaging our economy or increasing unemployment. It took the Rudd government to negotiate with all the industries that would be potentially affected by this dramatic change and by this very important scheme. It took the Rudd government to produce a green paper, a white paper, an exposure draft and, finally, the bill we have before us today. It took the Rudd government to listen to the concerns of the community and to engage in the process of creating and finetuning a scheme that can meet those concerns.
I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Minister for Climate Change, Senator Wong. As well as developing an unmatched expertise in every area of this subject—something she demonstrated again and again when those opposite were brave enough to challenge her in debate—she has shown extraordinary patience and persistence in getting this bill before the parliament, in the face of very formidable obstacles—the least of which, I might say, are those opposite at the moment.
During April and May I, along with my colleagues Senators Cameron, Furner and Pratt, together with Liberal, National, Green and Independent senators, had the privilege of serving as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Climate Policy. As part of the workings of that committee, we travelled all over Australia and heard evidence from hundreds of witnesses. We received thousands of submissions. I want to restate my thanks to all those who participated in that committee’s inquiry—most particularly, the committee secretariat whose work made our inquiry, our report and, indeed, our findings possible.
During those hearings and the deliberations around them, the divisions that exist amongst members of the coalition parties became extremely obvious. It was, if you will, a small vignette of the greater disturbance in the force that seems to affect those opposite. It is these divisions that are preventing Mr Turnbull from taking a firm stand one way or the other on what to do about climate change. That is why, yesterday, in order to divert attention from his many other self-inflicted wounds about which we heard earlier and to cover up the fact that the coalition parties cannot actually agree on what to do about climate change, Mr Turnbull announced his own personal climate change policy. It is well described as the ‘magic pudding policy’. Apparently, Mr Turnbull has single-handedly discovered how to cut emissions while protecting all industries and saving everyone’s job—and all for free. Of course, this is nothing more than frantic improvisation from an opposition that is today in the market for finding an excuse, not a policy.
Senator Cash argued that even the majority report of the climate policy committee did not give enough credence to climate change deniers. Senator Boswell said that he could not decide whether climate change was real or not, because scientists themselves disagreed. This assessment flies in the face of the powerful scientific consensus—a virtually unanimous consensus that climate change is real, that it is dangerous, that it is accelerating and that it is caused by human activity. It was very striking that, when the climate change deniers in this Senate were give an opportunity at our committee hearings to come up with some qualified climate scientists to challenge the views put by the Royal Society, the Stern report and many other scientific bodies, they were unable to do so in any serious manner. They put before us a retired geologist and an engineer. Neither of these witnesses had any formal qualifications in atmospheric physics or other disciplines relevant to climate science and nor had either of them ever worked as a climate scientist. The arguments they put forward were the same old stuff that had been refuted by eminent climatologists many, many times before. Their views were refuted yet again by those scientists who did appear before us.
Then we had Senator Macdonald, who says that he is not a climate change denier and that he believes climate change is real but who of course does not want to do anything about it. He spent his whole time at the hearings trying to come up with reasons why we should not proceed with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, claiming that it would be the ruin of every interest group, every industry and every region—anything he could think of. But the thing that Senator Macdonald should be encouraged to think very seriously about is that his state of Queensland relies enormously on a tourism industry that in turn hangs upon a natural environment—the Great Barrier Reef, the forests and the coast lands. These assets of Queensland are under very grave threat. They are being devastated by climate change.
We all understand the numbers in this Senate. If a bill is opposed by the coalition senators and Senator Fielding, it will not pass. We know that Senator Fielding thinks that climate change is being caused by sunspots—and, frankly, that is pretty much all I can say on that particular subject. So it all comes down to the coalition senators. This is the time when they need to face up to the facts; put aside their anger, their disappointment, at not being in government; and put the interests of Australia, the interests of future generations of Australians, ahead of their various petty squabbles and disagreements both with us and with one another. It is not necessary that they agree with every part of the bill. We the government drafted the bill and we will be responsible if the bill turns out to be ineffective. That will be our responsibility. We are not a government that has shied from the responsibilities of government. But those opposite will be responsible if the bill is rejected and, as a result, Australia takes no action on climate change.
In December we will be attending the international climate change conference in Copenhagen. If coalition senators oppose this bill and they maintain that stand for the remainder of this year, they will put Australia in the position of going to Copenhagen with no bill passed by this parliament, with no plan in place to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. What kind of influence do they imagine Australia will exert at Copenhagen if we get up and say, ‘Australia wants to see the world take tough action on climate change but, by the way, our parliament just voted to do nothing about it’? Australia would be a laughing stock and we would exert the same amount of influence going forward as we have over the last 11 years—that is, not enough.
The Australian Greens do not support our legislation because they think we should be going further, that higher target settings for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are in order. They would apparently prefer that we do nothing at all than embark upon Labor’s plan. ‘It’s our way or the highway’ is the Greens policy.
Senator Xenophon, by contrast, thinks that the CPRS goes too far too fast and that we should be following an entirely different strategy, not a carbon pollution reduction scheme. He has apparently now formed a united front with Mr Turnbull for some variant of his scheme—although Mr Turnbull, as I understand it, has not yet convinced all of you that this is worthy of being the Liberal Party’s policy. Whether, at the end of this united front, Turnbull becomes an Independent or Nick Xenophon becomes a Liberal remains unknown.
I respect the positions held by the Greens and by Senator Xenophon but I do not accept them. I think, on the basis of the evidence the Senate Select Committee on Climate Policy heard during our weeks of evidence, that the targets embodied in this bill are the most realistic and attainable targets for Australia at this time. Our message to the Greens and others is that we are a commodity based, trade-exposed economy. Our message to the opposition is that we must take action on climate change. The CPRS is the scheme that embodies both of these important targets.
If this bill is passed, Australia will go to Copenhagen in December with a commitment to reduce our emissions by 25 per cent by 2020 if we get a commitment from other—
—India, China, all those places?
—good on you, Wacka!—if we get a commitment from other countries to do the same. It may be that in the period after Copenhagen a consensus will emerge that higher targets are needed if climate change is to be arrested. When and if that happens this government will of course deal with that in a responsible way, but at present the government’s view is that the targets in this bill are the most realistic and the most attainable, and I think the evidence clearly supports that view. I also think that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in this bill is the best model of the various models on offer for attaining these important targets.
As Senator Xenophon knows, I was happy to listen to a presentation of his alternative scheme—but I was not persuaded. If we were to drop the CPRS now and embark on a totally new scheme, it would entail many months, maybe years, of further delay and it would also put us out of sync with other countries that are adopting emissions trading schemes similar to the one found in this bill. What those opposite need to remember as they look at Malcolm Turnbull’s fig leaf of an input—not a policy but an input—is that it would mean that Australia would embark on a model no other nation has embarked upon and we would design a scheme incompatible with any being developed across the world. That in itself makes it a nonsense.
Ultimately, it does not matter what the Greens do; they have chosen to be spectators rather than participants in this process. It ultimately does not matter what Senator Fielding and Senator Xenophon do. The fate of this bill depends on the coalition senators. Their negative and obstructionist attitude, which their weak and indecisive leader has been unable to reverse, will seriously impede this country’s ability to play an important role at Copenhagen and to play its proper role in action on climate change. Australia did nothing about climate change while those opposite were in government, and now they are trying to ensure from opposition that Australia continues to do nothing. Every opinion poll tells us that the Australian people want this government and this parliament to take strong action against climate change. Those opposite are very keen to demand more and more modelling of every possible consequence, every possible change and every possible permutation of the CPRS.
—It’s called responsible government. It’s called responsible policymaking.
—It is not responsible policymaking; it is the art of delay. It is the art of delay from an opposition that are determined to find questions to hide the fact that they are opposed to there being any action on climate change. The tragic political truth is that your obstructionism has imprisoned your leader politically in an unsustainable position—and, to be honest, I do at times find that as delightful as you do, Senator Cash; I genuinely do. But the bill before this parliament has consequences which are far too important for us to play these small and irrelevant opposition games, even when they are as entertaining as this.
I have done some political modelling. I think, to be fair, the inputs into my political modelling are the same sorts of inputs that have occupied the minds of those opposite in recent days. There are some interesting findings. One of the consequences of the political modelling is that the opposition are going to crush the tiny remnant of their leader’s credibility. But those opposite do not care about that, and I suppose, in the final analysis, neither do I. But the Australian people want this bill passed, and my political modelling shows that if those opposite persist in being the Dr Noes of Australian politics then there will be a reckoning. There will be a reckoning. As Tony Abbott has implored you, you must see sense, because this is simply an argument that the Australian people will punish you for prosecuting. You stand in the face of a government mandate, you stand in the face of the will of the Australian people and you stand in the face of a global determination to take action on climate change.
The political fate of those opposite is, while fascinating and at moments delightful, not the most important consequence of their causing the Senate to reject this bill. Far more important would be the fact that as a result of the Liberal and National parties having made Australia irrelevant to international climate change policy for 11 years—11 years during which carbon accounting schemes were designed that do not operate to the best effect for Australia, and we heard extensive evidence of that in our committee deliberations, and 11 years during which we failed to exert the influence we needed over this very important piece of policy—we would tragically continue to not exert the policy influence over those systems going forward.
Despite the fact that this government ratified the Kyoto protocol, the opposition remain resolved to making us irrelevant in this important debate for another 10 years. By preventing Australia putting a carbon pollution reduction scheme in place, they are putting us behind the pack in action on climate change, in transforming our economy and in taking the steps that everyone now understands need to be taken. Future generations of Australians will contemplate the damage done to our economy, to our environment, to our tourism industry, to our agricultural industries and to our international standing by the position of those opposite and my political modelling says those opposite will suffer a grim fate as a result.
We have now had months and years of debate about climate change and the best way to tackle it. We have had Senate inquiries. We have had weeks of hearings, at which everyone with an opinion, and indeed some with an uncertain opinion, have had their opportunity to have their say. We have had several reports and those reports have given rise to important public debate. The time for delay has now ended. Australia needs action, the Australian people want action and, God forbid, the climate needs action. The future of Australia depends on the action of this parliament and the action we as senators take on this bill. If the bill is rejected, we will bring it back again and we will keep bringing it back until those opposite meet their responsibilities.
I commend this historic and important bill to the Senate and I implore those opposite to act not only in the country’s interest, not only in the interests of their own fragile and tottering leader, but indeed in their own narrow political interest because for them this may very well be a question of survival.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2009-08-11,"—I also rise to speak on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009 and the series of cognate bills that are before the Senate. No matter how shrill those opposite are—and we have had a lot of shrieking from the other side claiming that Rudd Labor has a strategy to tackle climate change—the only strategy that Labor has is a political strategy that falls apart when subjected to closer examination by the Australian people. This has now been further confirmed with the release of the independent economic research commissioned by none other than those people who are actually serious about making policy in this country—the coalition and Senator Xenophon. This demonstrates that the Rudd government’s emissions trading scheme ‘will unnecessarily drive up electricity prices, destroy jobs and expand the size of government in Australia’. What we have had to date from the Labor government is policy on the run. It has taken the easy, the cheap and the popular decision, but not the right decision. For goodness sake, it is those of us on this side of the chamber who have had to go and commission Frontier Economics to undertake the modelling that those on that side of the chamber refused to undertake because they knew what the results of that modelling would be. The results have proved yet again that their scheme is diabolically flawed. Those opposite have told the people of Australia that regardless of its consequences, regardless of the fact that there will be no positive benefit to the environment—in fact it has been proven that carbon leakage will be the end result—Australia must have the Rudd ETS, no matter how flawed.
These bills represent just another one of the many stepping stones that Mr Rudd is using to gain himself celebrity status on the world stage. These bills are nothing more than political convenience aimed at portraying Mr Rudd in a positive light at the expense of the Australian people. I will never agree with, and I will never be a party to, taking action at the expense of the Australian people. That is what Labor is asking us to do with this legislation—take action at the expense of the Australian people. Labor’s scheme puts at risk thousands of Australian jobs but, worse still, may have the perverse outcome that, if this scheme is implemented in Australia, it will actually lead to an increase in global CO2 emissions. That is completely contrary to the promise made by Mr Rudd prior to the 2007 election that, if elected, his party would introduce a scheme which would ‘produce deep cuts in CO2 emissions but would not disadvantage Australia’s export and import competing industries’. What a joke! The evidence now clearly proves that this government’s scheme fails to reduce carbon pollution at the lowest economic cost, fails to put in place long-term incentives for investment in clean energy and low emissions technology and, worse still, fails to contribute to a global solution to climate change.
One of the major flaws of Labor’s scheme is the stubborn rush by this government to introduce an ETS before the rest of the world. As is perfectly apparent to all serious policymakers, and we could hardly accuse Mr Rudd of being one of them, there is no unilateral solution to climate change; there is only a global solution. As a serious policymaker, I would have thought it was significant that our ally and trading partner the United States, in its draft emissions trading legislation includes very specific provisions providing 100 per cent protection to US export and import competing industries in any emissions trading scheme until 2025. But, further than that, the draft bill also provides that these industries will only see a reduction in their protection when more than 70 per cent of global output for that sector is produced or manufactured in countries that have a scheme equivalent to that operating in the United States. As I am sure senators in this chamber will appreciate, the provisions in the US draft legislation may mean that the rest of the world will never see a reduction in protection in relation to some US export and import competing industries. Unlike Mr Rudd and those on the other side, President Obama cares about his country’s competitiveness, cares about the fact that Americans need jobs and is not about to subject his country to risk through flawed emissions trading legislation. In contrast, the Labor Party is prepared to impose higher taxes and charges on Australian industry without restraint, which will result in Australians losing their jobs.
The United States is but one country, albeit an extremely significant one. We also need to understand what other countries are doing to reduce their emissions. In December this year Copenhagen will host an extremely important multilateral forum to discuss emissions trading, emissions targets and what can be done globally to reduce CO2 emissions. Until the Copenhagen conference has a chance to negotiate the many complicated issues that will arise from setting carbon abatement targets, it is sheer folly for Australia to prematurely legislate—that is, to do so before we find out what our international trading partners and competitors are doing.
With Australia’s emissions at just 1.4 per cent of global carbon emissions and declining, is it honestly likely that we are going to lead the debate in Copenhagen especially with a scheme that may or may not be compatible with what is negotiated in December? I think not. In fact, the Institute of Public Affairs gave said the following in its submission to the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics into the exposure draft of the legislation to implement the CPRS:
With only one per cent of world GDP, we are neither prominent among world nations nor particularly influential within world councils … Accordingly, it is pure hubris for Australia to attempt to take the lead in abatement activity.
We have no way of knowing what the international community will be doing, whether or not they are going to decide to move in the same direction as Australia. But, if the international community miraculously does, you can be sure that it will be after considered discussion, not because we in Australia arrived at our position first. Unlike Mr Rudd, other world leaders see the issue of climate change as a serious global challenge and not just as an opportunity to promote themselves on the world stage. Our international trading competitors must be rubbing their hands with glee at Mr Rudd’s insistence on strutting the world stage rather than protecting Australian jobs.
Evidence that this legislation is being run to a political timetable, as opposed to one that exhibits good public policy, is reflected in Mr Rudd’s arbitrary decision to delay the start date by 12 months. I can only wonder how the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, the ETS vigilante, felt as she tirelessly trumpeted the government line that there would be a commencement date of 2010 but was then ambushed by the Prime Minister. That the minister can stand in this place and not laugh when she argues for the revised start date shows that consistency of argument will never ever get in the way of selling Mr Rudd’s message of the day. Minister Wong’s claims that this legislation must be passed to provide momentum to the crucial UN negotiations in Copenhagen in December are absurd. What momentum? The only momentum that Minister Wong is looking to achieve is the momentum for the Rudd spin machine to go into further overdrive.
The current Labor line is that this unseemly rush to put the legislation to a vote is all about giving business certainty. Well, let us look at comments made by the Chief Executive Officer of Anglo Coal, who said, ‘We don’t want the certainty of a bullet.’ And what about the economic cost to business of Labor’s scheme? In asking the Senate to pass this legislation before the international community has collaborated, the Rudd government has decided to impose a massive taxation burden on Australian industry. This legislation will seriously damage the competitive position of many of our industries and will see Australian jobs, investment and CO2 emissions exported to countries where no price is being imposed on carbon. Goodbye, Australia, and hello, China! Let me spell out the problem for business. The Labor government is imposing on Australian businesses a significant new tax, either directly or indirectly, that their competitors will not be paying. How is that good public policy? Those on the other side of the chamber seem to have forgotten that employers, business and industry create jobs and that governments do not create jobs. What governments can do, though, is create an environment which is conducive to creating jobs or, alternatively, as with the legislation before us, an environment that will inevitably result in job losses.
Let us have a look at what has been stated on the record in relation to job losses. The Minerals Council of Australia have stated that the CPRS legislation in its current form will cost over 66,000 Australian jobs in the minerals industry over the next 20 years. In my home state of Western Australia, an Access Economics report has been reported to confirm that the Labor ETS would cost 13,000 jobs in WA alone and more than 126,000 jobs nationally. Remarkably, the Access Economics report was commissioned by the state premiers, who all bar one are Labor.
—Bar a good one!
—Bar a good one in Western Australia—thank you, Senator Cormann! It would seem that even Mr Rudd’s most senior Labor colleagues are worried about the impact of the ETS on jobs in their home states. Otherwise they would not have commissioned the modelling that was undertaken in this report. I will stand up for Western Australia, even if those opposite will sell it out to a spin-driven political timetable. I will not stand by and vote for a scheme that will destroy jobs in Western Australia and negatively impact on my state’s economy.
As a senator for Western Australia, I would now like to highlight a further flawed area of this legislation insofar as it relates to the Western Australian electricity market. The WA energy market, in which gas power is dominant, has not been distinguished from the eastern states energy market in the determination of ESAS assistance, insofar as the Treasury modelling uses the same competitive spot market assumptions for electricity sales for all states. This fails to distinguish the unique circumstances in Western Australia. The WA energy market has fixed priced contracts which do not allow the sector to pass on the increasing price of carbon, which generators will bear. This is not the case for the eastern states, where the price of electricity is based on a competitive spot market, allowing the additional cost of carbon to be passed on to consumers through the market clearing price. There have been several sensible suggestions put forward by Griffin Energy to deal with the unique circumstances that apply in Western Australia.
While I am aware that the energy sector is in talks with the government, it is patently wrong and commercially ludicrous for Western Australians that the federal Labor government should demand that the Senate vote on this legislation before the vital issues that have been raised by Griffin Energy are resolved. But in Western Australia we have not only problems with the federal government not recognising the unique circumstances that apply to the WA energy market but also concerns, as raised by Griffin Energy and by the Western Australian Department of Mines and Petroleum in a letter dated 15 June 2009 to Dr Martin Parkinson, Secretary of the Department of Climate Change. There is concern that the open-cut coal industry at Collie in Western Australia is being wrongly treated because of an apparent error in the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurements) Determination 2008. As Mr Noel Ashcroft of Griffin Energy stated in a letter to me:
We find that in October 2008 we were allocated a default coal mine methane fugitive emissions factor in the greenhouse gas statutes (Determination) which bears no relation to the reality of the situation, that is, that WA Collie coal does not have methane, as is the case with Queensland. Nor have we any idea how it got there as there was no consultation.
In the past we were assumed to have the same default fugitive emissions factor as Victoria and South Australia but without reference to us this was changed last year to the equivalent of Qld and NSW at the last determination. It is well known that Qld and NSW have significant methane.
As this factor is to be used as the penalty emissions factor for CPRS it will cost us—
Griffin Energy—
well over $1.25 million per annum and rising as the mining increases to accommodate new projects.
As previously set out in a letter from The Griffin Group to the Department of Climate Change dated 11 May 2009, Collie coal does not have methane, a fact borne out by its absence from the WA mining and safety legislation and supported by the Geological Survey and the state Mining Engineer. Nonetheless Canberra is effectively saying we have to do very expensive research/drilling to verify that we have a low methane situation. It seems that they have adopted a position of “guilty until you prove yourself innocent” in a regime where the cost of proving what is well known is exorbitant!!
What other errors are being made in relation to Western Australia in the formulation of the CPRS and the associated bills? As a senator for Western Australia I reiterate that it is patently wrong and commercially ludicrous for Western Australians that the federal government should demand a vote on this legislation before such vital issues are resolved. Prior to the 2007 federal election the Prime Minister, as then Opposition Leader, said:
In taking the lead before an effective international agreement is in place, it is also vitally important that a domestic scheme does not undermine Australia’s competitiveness and provides mechanisms to ensure that Australian operations of energy-intensive, trade-exposed firms are not disadvantaged.
Well, it would seem that Mr Rudd was a little loose with the truth. When held up to scrutiny the Rudd Labor CPRS fails on all counts: it will cost Australians their jobs, it will kill investment in Australia and it will do very little, if anything, to reduce CO2 emissions. The only action that a government should take to reduce carbon emissions is responsible action. Action taken at the expense or to the detriment of the Australian people should not be supported. The government’s current CPRS, if agreed to in its present form, will result in action being taken at the expense of the people of Australia. But worse than that its implementation in its present form is likely to achieve the perverse outcome of Australia contributing to an increase in global emissions. As a proud Western Australian I will not be selling my state out to indulge Mr Rudd’s appetite for celebrity status on the world stage. This legislation must not be supported.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2009-08-11,"—I rise to speak on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009 and related bills. By voting to support these bills, we will be able to stop the rise in carbon emissions in Australia and begin the trip along the path to a low-pollution future. This has to be done because, quite simply put, climate change threatens Australia’s way of life, the environment and ultimately the economy. Now is the time for reform and essential to that is placing a limit and price on carbon emissions.
The design principles for an emissions trading scheme have been around for a long time, and the Rudd government has held to these principles. This scheme has not been developed simply for today; we are thinking of the future of Australia. Our proposal will change the way our economy and the market work, ensuring that economic decisions in the future factor in the climate. The Rudd government has had a clear picture of what we want to achieve in this area—that is, to significantly reduce emissions at the lowest economic cost but with the potential to drive growth, establish jobs and build up new industries. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will see the most significant environmental and economic reform in Australia’s history. The CPRS aims to reduce the carbon footprint of each Australian by one-third as a minimum over a 10-year period. The Rudd government understands the effects of climate change and knows that action must be taken now for the benefit of generations to come.
The Implications of climate change for Australia’s World Heritage properties report commissioned by the ANU and released recently finds that 17 of Australia’s iconic World Heritage properties are at risk from climate change. Sites such as Kakadu National Park, the Great Barrier Reef and the Tasmanian wilderness in my own home state, to name just a few, have been identified as particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change by reduced rainfall, higher sea or land temperatures, rising sea levels or more severe storms. The collapse of our World Heritage areas would be a severe loss to both local and global communities. We need to take action now to make sure they are safe in the future. The Rudd government is committed to decisive action on climate change both at home and globally. The Rudd government recognises that building resilience to climate change is critically important. The Rudd government acted early by ratifying the Kyoto protocol, which the former Liberal government failed to do. Now we are acting by introducing the CPRS.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which consists of over 1,250 scientists from across the world, cites Australia’s vulnerability to the vagaries of climate change, with our water resources, coastal communities, natural ecosystems, energy security, health, agriculture and tourism all to be seriously affected if temperatures across the globe rise by three degrees Celsius or more. As we all know, Australia is a massive continent, with the majority of its population living in the coastal regions. This means that most Australians are at serious risk if the ocean level continues to rise, with homes and businesses likely to suffer. It is credible to say that the water level may rise by one metre before the turn of the century. The recent Copenhagen synthesis report found that climate change was accelerating and the risks were more serious than previously thought. Changes to Australia’s climate are already occurring over and above natural predictability, and these changes are expected to have an impact on Australia’s biological diversity. The Third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded:
Australia will be vulnerable to the changes in temperature and rainfall that are projected to occur over the next 100 years.
The report also identified that natural resources and biodiversity conservation are likely to be strongly affected by climate change, as climate change is likely to add to the existing substantial pressure on these areas. There is a growing catalogue of documented changes that are consistent with climate change predictions, and there is reasonable scientific consensus on the expected types of impacts on species and the ecosystems from future climate change. A significant loss of biodiversity is expected by 2020.
Climate change is a stress to Australia’s biodiversity and ecosystems, which are already under pressure from human impact. Although our plants and animals have evolved to cope with large year-to-year climate variability, there are many species that have narrow long-term average climate ranges. These species and ecosystems could be highly vulnerable to the rapid and sustained increase in long-term average temperatures of one or two degrees Celsius, which have been projected under climate change scenarios. The reality is that climate change is with us and unless we act now it will only get worse.
Responsible management of climate change is also responsible management of the economy. The two go hand in hand. The earlier the government acts on climate change, the less expensive that action will be. The former Howard government had 12 years to act but, despite much research and many reports, failed to do so. The Rudd government is making up for lost time. Treasury modelling has shown that countries that delay action will face costs 15 per cent higher than those that act now. Such a significant saving is just another reason why we need to take action now. The Liberal Party argue for a lower deficit but will not support this opportunity to save some money in the long term. The present global financial crisis has made life tough for Australians but has not lessened the effects of climate change or the benefits that taking action will bring. In fact, the GFC has made it even more important that we act now to manage the economic challenges we are facing. At greatest risk are the agriculture and tourism industries. We need to act responsibly to ensure that these industries are protected. Failure to do so will certainly mean a significant number of jobs will be at risk or lost. One of the many positions that the Liberals has involves Mr Turnbull wanting no less assistance for Australian industry than will be offered by the United States for industry there.
From the outset, the Rudd government has committed to a cap-and-trade system. This is the only approach that can give Australia the assurance that carbon pollution will be reduced. Australia has committed to clear targets that enable us to be part of the global solution. The CPRS will best manage the economic impacts of transition to a carbon constrained economy, and the G8 summit in Italy reinforced that this is the way the world is moving. To ensure fairness and the greatest cost-effectiveness in spreading the burden of reducing carbon emissions, our scheme should have the greatest possible coverage. Our scheme will link internationally in order to enhance opportunities for Australia and to strengthen global carbon reduction efforts. And, importantly, we have committed to supporting industry’s transition to a low-pollution future and assisting households to adjust to the impact of putting a price on carbon.
According to CSIRO research, taking action against climate change now may create as many as 340,000 jobs in the transport, construction, agriculture, manufacturing and mining industries over the next 10 years. Within the agricultural industry, failure to act on climate change could see exports fall by up to 63 per cent in the next two decades. By 2050 exports may have decreased by up to 79 per cent. Under the CPRS there will be no cap—that is, no limit—on the number of free permits available to emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries. To start with, more than 25 per cent of all permits will be free and that number will automatically rise as necessary with growth in these industries. Under the CPRS, Australian emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries will receive a greater proportion of free permits than is being proposed in the US, and the US proposal is firstly to cap and then to reduce free permits. It is wrong for the Liberals to say that the Waxman-Markey proposal is more generous than the CPRS. Where industry in the US will have to share in the 15 per cent of free permits being allocated at the beginning of the scheme, in Australia industries will have certainty on the number of free permits they will receive over many years.
Businesses largely recognise the unavoidability of a carbon price and last year rejected the US approach on emissions in consultations. We accept that businesses need to know, and have every right to know, how the price will be determined. In order to make investment decisions, it is critical that businesses know how the price of carbon emissions will be determined. The CPRS will make it possible to set a price through market mechanisms. This certainty is needed to protect not only jobs but the economy as a whole. The Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group recognise the importance of having this certainty. Businesses want the government and the coalition working together to provide this certainty. Unfortunately, though, the coalition have been doing everything possible to hinder the passage of this legislation. They think Australia should wait and see what the United States does with regard to this issue. Deferring decisions until after this issue is resolved in America will only lead to ongoing uncertainty for Australia and Australian businesses.
The Australian government has clearly indicated what will happen and has set aside money in the Climate Change Action Fund to help make the transition smoother for all concerned. In Australia, all the money that comes from the permits will be used to help both businesses and households manage the increase in everyday living costs. In 2009-10, the government has put $200 million into the Climate Change Action Fund. Initially, the CCAF money will be used to help businesses to identify areas where efficiency can be improved and to help make those improvements a reality.
Yet another position of the Liberal Party is that they want the Productivity Commission to review the CPRS. This is pretty ridiculous, as the commission has already undertaken a review and that review contradicted the apparent views of the Liberals. So I am not quite sure why they want the commission to review the scheme again, other than as another delaying tactic. It is beyond me but, as I say, it is yet another delaying tactic.
Australia is in the leading group of nations when it comes to understanding and acting upon climate change. Australia will continue to be a world leader under the Rudd Labor government. The coalition are clearly wasting time by refusing to pass this legislation. If they really believed the government’s policy was wrong, they would offer an alternative, but they have not—or at least they have not offered a policy agreed to by the party. They are a political party in turmoil. Refusing to put the best interests of the Australian public first is reason enough to conclude that the opposition are not suitable to govern this country. Of course, there are numerous other reasons to arrive at this conclusion, but I will not go into those in the short time I have left.
The Australian public obviously agreed with this sentiment in November 2007 when they voted for the Labor Party to act on this and many other issues. The business community has been given more than adequate notice about this legislation and the impact it will have if it is given royal assent. The finance industry has said that the impact on businesses will be minimal. In their analysis, Goldman Sachs JBWere stated:
… Far from putting companies in financial trouble, the CPRS will have negligible financial impact on Australian Companies.
The government stands behind the CPRS and the research that has been used to draft the legislation, including the modelling undertaken by Treasury that shows that the CPRS will cause major industries to see considerable increases in employment by 2020. I reiterate: The Rudd government is committed to being a world leader on climate change. The CPRS is the first step towards tackling the serious problem that is climate change. This legislation is backed by solid research and is supported by the business community. The opposition are without a doubt divided on this issue and, as I said, have not put forward any credible alternative policy. On one hand they extol the virtues of mirroring the US emissions trading scheme, but on the other hand they want us to consider the completely different approach that was put out by Mr Robb recently of an untested baseline and credit. The Liberal Party lack credibility, especially economic credibility. They lack cohesion, they lack detail and, most of all, they lack relevance. A party that cannot determine its own policy is no alternative government for the people of Australia. This is the most important environmental and economic reform in Australia’s history. Those in the Liberal Party know what they should do: they should vote for it.
In my conclusion, I would like to point out to members on the other side that yesterday a report was released that shows Australia’s carbon pollution will continue to rise if the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme does not become law. The Tracking to Kyoto and 2020 report shows that without the scheme in place emissions will be 20 per cent above 2000 levels by 2020. The increase in carbon pollution that will occur if we do not put this scheme into place is equal to more than doubling the numbers of cars on our roads between now and 2020. Our commitment under the Kyoto protocol to limit the growth in carbon pollution against business’s usual projections is only a first step in taking responsible action on climate change. We need to actually reduce our carbon pollution, and this will not happen unless the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is put in place. I commend the bills to Senate.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2009-08-11,"—Let me get straight to the point and dispel some of the myths peddled by the Labor Party and the radical green movement. I am not a climate change sceptic. Historical evidence suggests the climate of our planet has continually evolved and changed, and it always will. Thus I am 100 per cent sure that our climate is changing. Of course, that begs the question: what is driving that change? The government will have you believe that climate change is being driven by carbon dioxide—or, more specifically, that man-made CO2, which comprises less than one per cent of atmospheric carbon mass, is the culprit. Despite the plethora of evidence to the contrary, those committed to the anthropogenic climate change industry have too much of themselves invested in this new religion to admit they actually might have it wrong.
When I say there is a plethora of evidence refuting their claims, I mean there really is a tonne of the stuff. Firstly, we have the irrational claims made by the high priests of climate change themselves. Alarmist of the year Tim Flannery once stated that the seas were going to rise by 100 metres, not the one metre that Senator Bilyk just told us. He was wrong. Great video hoaxer Al Gore won a Nobel prize for producing a flawed and alarmist mockumentary that contained a litany of errors and that required a guidance note before it could be viewed by British children. For over two decades the shrill cry of the alarmists declared we only had five years to prevent a climate change catastrophe. I could go on and on. The extremist mumbo jumbo uttered by those who profit from fear, either financially or electorally—and one could call them the prophets of doom—gets louder and louder. They must raise their voices not because any of their predictions have been realised but simply because they have not. When confronted with the very inconvenient facts that they have been demonstrably wrong again and again they simply raise the decibel of their cry and the level of the hyperbole attached to their claims. Tonight I shall leave the rebuttal of their hysteria there. Suffice to say there are many examples of attempts to scare the public by the prophets of doom.
Yet, despite these very loose advocates, I do have an open mind on the bill before the Senate today. By an open mind, I mean I am genuinely undecided. I am unsure if this bill and the associated bills are the worst or simply the dumbest pieces of legislation ever dealt with in this chamber. Either way, the bills are built on flawed science, fuelled by unsustainable hysteria and lacking in any demonstrable benefit to our great nation. After all, ask yourselves: isn’t it the primary requirement of any government to act in Australia’s best interest? Isn’t that why governments are elected? Isn’t it to defend the country and its citizens by looking after their interests? I certainly hope most senators in this place agree with that comment. But, alas, the supporters of this bill seem unconcerned with the interests of our nation. If they were committed to acting in Australia’s best interests they would not endorse a new tax that will impact on every man, woman and child in this country without any meaningful benefit. They would not advocate a scheme that will cost tens of thousands of jobs without any meaningful benefit. They would not champion a plan to export domestic industry, domestic jobs and domestic profits to foreign lands without any meaningful benefit.
How can I state so unequivocally that there will be no meaningful benefit? The stated aim of these bills is to address dangerous climate change. They fail to do that on several levels, and I would like to touch on just a couple. Firstly, the government’s own adviser, Mr Ross Garnaut, has given evidence that this scheme is flawed and might actually be worse than doing nothing. In response to this question by Senator Macdonald, ‘If the scheme were not modified, would it still be better than nothing?’ Professor Garnaut said:
That is a really hard question. Let me say it would be finely balanced.
It was further reported that Professor Garnaut said:
... it might be better to drop the proposed model and “have another crack at it and do a better one when the time is right.”
Secondly, the purpose of the wealth transfer scheme advocated by the leftists in charge of this is to change people’s behaviour. This scheme actually compensates a group of people in excess of the cost of the introduction of the ETS. This might seem like a generous gesture by the government, but to me it is further evidence that the scheme will not achieve what it is intended to do. Instead, this bill sets in place a bureaucracy that will have an insatiable appetite for transferring cash from industry to government.
The question for the advocates of this scheme is: why could anyone acting in the national interest actually endorse such a ridiculous proposal? Of course they will say it is to act on climate change, but it will not make any difference. Because it will not make any difference, you have got to ask, ‘What the heck are they doing it for?’ I am now reminded that Mr Rudd claimed this as the greatest moral issue of our time, where the cost of inaction is greater than the cost of action. Why, then, has the government delayed the commencement of this scheme? Has reality smacked the disingenuous Rudd government in both of its faces? If so, here is a little more reality for you to contemplate from your gilded cage: this bill will damage our economy. It will lift taxes, it will kill jobs and it will not make a jot of difference to the climate. Under the Rudd-Wong scheme Australian industry will be taxed an extra $12 billion over five years. Many of these industries will not be able to pass on these costs. Some will simply close down or move overseas.
The already struggling and, in most cases, poorly managed state governments will also suffer, with one estimate being that they will be $1.4 billion poorer as a result of this scheme. Even the most uninformed would have to realise that this would result in higher state taxes and charges, a decline in services or possibly both. This scheme will also affect wages. Treasury secretary Dr Henry has stated:
It is my understanding that in general terms the real wages in alternative employment would probably be lower than the real wages offered in the mining sector.
In other words, this scheme will force some people out of their current jobs into lower paid jobs—hardly the outcome designed to boost prosperity in an already damaged economy. According to the minerals industry, this scheme will impose costs of $2 billion per annum and seriously damage their competitive position. The grains industry, a very low emitter, will be slugged with an annual indirect cost of more than $500 million—hardly the stuff to support their international competitiveness on an already uneven playing field.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-08-11,"—I want to take the opportunity to correct the record of a contribution I made on Thursday, 25 June 2009, in responding to a question from Senator Humphries. The transcript shows that I said the Rudd government was providing $750 billion to state and territory emergency departments. Clearly my Queensland accent substituted a ‘b’ for an ‘m’. The figure is of course $750 million, which will assist with blockages in our emergency departments. To clarify: I also referred in the same answer to a $10 million contribution by the Rudd government to the ACT to provide for elective surgery. This $10 million is to be provided under the government’s emergency department funding. The ACT government has received a total of $9.1 million under the first two stages of the Rudd government’s elective surgery strategy. I ask that the record reflects these corrections.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Hospitals</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,7,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2009-08-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Faulkner) and the Minister for Climate Change and Water (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by senators today.
Recent events have indicated that there is no higher responsibility upon the government of the day than national security. Sadly, this government has disclosed a clear attitude and policy direction that is very soft on border protection. It has also disclosed a preponderance of softness on illegal immigration. What we have seen with respect to defence bases indicates that the government is also very soft on security at ADF bases around Australia.
The minister answered my question by highlighting that safe base threat levels went from Bravo to Charlie with respect to the matters arising in Melbourne, giving rise to the arrest and charging of several men related to alleged terrorist activities. What does moving from Bravo to Charlie actually mean? It simply means that the personnel at the gate of bases, particularly TAG/East, which is Holsworthy, began to conduct random vehicle checks and some random identity checks. I have to say that that causes me some considerable concern and I believe it causes all Australians some considerable concern. It follows that we are more than concerned—that is, we are very, very alarmed—that two journalists, following the publication of this material, simply wandered into Holsworthy and began, I think, to take photographs. It causes me some considerable alarm, that, notwithstanding the media publication of what was going on, we still did not respond to tighten up security.
The most important thing is when I and other members of parliament in the opposition receive emails and correspondence from soldiers saying that security at bases is substandard and that they are concerned. That is very, very important. Everybody now knows that security at Australian Defence Force bases is of concern. It is substandard. It is not adequate. Everybody except the Minister for Defence knows that.
—That is absolute rubbish! You are such a hypocrite.
—Order! Senator Collins!
—It is outrageous.
—Order! You will get your chance later.
—Holsworthy is not just any base; it is the home of TAG/East, the SAS equivalent on the east coast of our counterterrorist assault troops. If we cannot provide adequate security for that base, where are we? We are at a level of great concern with respect to what is happening here. This base contains a childcare centre. This entire story indicates a grievous problem with respect to understanding what is required to provide adequate security for military bases. I seriously hope the minister will engage in the debate regarding security at bases and will release the review being conducted.
Can I also say how concerned I am that al-Shabaab has not been put on the list of terrorist groups. Why the government has not proscribed this group absolutely worries me greatly. There must be some explanation for that. This group clearly is a problem. The United States says it has distinct links to al-Qaeda. The group was recently involved in kidnapping two French intelligence officers in Somalia. Why this group, having clear links and a nexus to these persons and the evidence giving rise to these arrests in Melbourne, has not been proscribed is an unanswered question that must cause everybody concern. What is going on? We have seen cutbacks in Customs, we have seen cutbacks in Australian Federal Police counterterrorism and we have seen a movement away from strict immigration policies. This government says the right things but does nothing. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-08-11,"—This government has a number of clear and major successes on the table resulting from its hard work over the last 18 months, since it was elected in late 2007. In no particular order I refer to pension fairness, economic management, successive stimulus packages and education grants. There is work in progress going on in critical areas that were deliberately ignored by the previous government in the area of broadband and climate change. Those matters are all well known, and they are all on the public record and open to public discussion and debate. One area where this government can claim a great deal of credit—and it really is unsung—is its attention to the area of national security, defence and military procurement. In those areas, generally under the heading of ‘national security’, this government has gone quietly and effectively under a range of ministers and parliamentary secretaries to reform the dog’s breakfast that had been created and sustained by the previous government over a period of some 10 or 12 years.
Senator Johnston referred to matters relating to national security and pinpricked one or two matters that have been in the press in more recent times. What he did not address, what he did not discuss, was this government’s commitment to military spending, to defence reform, and the publication of the defence white paper some two months ago to almost unanimous approval amongst those people who take part in debates around defence, national security and military matters.
Senator Johnston referred to national security and some minor cuts in defence outlays, border protection and immigration. What are the facts that need to go on the record on Australia’s national security and the protection of Australia’s borders? What does this government say, what funds does it allocate and what are its areas of priority in protecting and advancing Australia’s national security and protecting our borders? Firstly, we say without equivocation that protecting Australia’s national security and the integrity of our borders is the highest responsibility of the national government, without exception. Even in a global recession the government have continued to invest in protecting our borders and strengthening our national security. As the Prime Minister said in his national security statement to the House of Representatives last year, the Rudd government have a long-term national security reform agenda and have been clear in our national security policy framework now and into the future.
What are those elements of our national security plan and national security policy framework? They go to defence matters, particularly the white paper, and remedying the huge problems we have in procurement. We were paying tens and tens of millions of dollars for items one after another that were delivered late, not on time or without the capability that government had contracted for and expected. Secondly, in the area of defence reform, we have paid an enormous amount of attention to remedying the black hole of people choosing not to join the armed forces. In Army and in Air Force, particularly, recruitment and retention rates have gone through the ceiling and we are hitting all of our targets. Navy is significantly improving as well. In the area of national security and border protection, the government provided more than $1.3 billion over six years for non-defence national security, border protection and anti-people-smuggling measures in the 2009-10 budget. This included—listen to it—$654 million for a whole-of-government strategy to combat people-smuggling and strengthen border security, the precise matters that Senator Johnston criticised.

"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2009-08-11,"—There is one point in his contribution to this debate on which Senator Bishop and I might agree, and that is that the highest responsibility of government is protecting its citizens from danger and from threat. That is the responsibility of government. In the area of national security, the manifest threat, Senator Bishop, has for a long while been—and remains so, as we have seen from recent events—that of international terrorism. In your contribution to this debate today, you barely could mention the word. Senator Wong, the Minister representing the Attorney-General, came into the chamber this afternoon for question time and she clearly was not prepared for the questions which were likely to be raised with regard to counterterrorism. She struggled to answer the questions that were put to her from this side of the chamber. She had absolutely no idea about the issues that needed to be addressed.
What a contrast with the way in which the former government addressed this problem. There was a comprehensive counterterrorism policy for almost the whole period that the Howard government was in office. There was increased expenditure on counterterrorism activities. In 2004 the government released a counterterrorism statement to make its position clear. There was active work with our neighbours through bilateral engagement on counterterrorism activities, including a very successful program of building the capability of the Filipinos and the Indonesians to deal with this need. We worked with our neighbours diligently and conscientiously on this problem. Of course, as Senator Brandis mentioned in his question to the minister today, there was a comprehensive revision of the antiterrorism laws in this country so that in the domestic arena we were prepared to deal with the challenge which now confronts us. We were dedicated to what might be called a clear and present threat.
What a change occurred on 24 November 2007. That date is significant because that is the date on which the Rudd government won office. From that date there was a fundamental change in the government’s attitude towards the danger of terrorism. It essentially became an issue of almost no importance to this government. There was a conscious movement of priorities. Mr Rudd, who sets the agenda on foreign policy, national security and just about everything else that the government does in this arena, decided that the priorities were elsewhere. He decided that the government ought not to be focusing on the issues that threatened the lives of Australia’s citizens—as, sadly, we recently witnessed in Jakarta. He decided that our foreign policy agenda should focus on pretty well everything else. He decided we should focus on gaining a seat on the United Nations Security Council. We ought to focus on an Asia-Pacific community. We ought to put forward $9 million for an international commission on disarmament and arms control. We ought to focus on rejigging the international financial framework through the G20. Apparently the government’s real focus ought to be on spending $13 million on opening a new embassy in Rome for the Holy See. That is where this government’s priorities have been. They have been nowhere near what is widely recognised as the main threat that faces this country and its citizens—the threat of global terrorism.
Senator Bishop mentioned the white paper. What a good idea that was. In 200 pages, there was half a page devoted to the issue of terrorism and no funding and no commitment to deal with it. Now, as a result of these recent events, we arrive at a situation where the government has been caught short. It has failed to deal with this issue. (Time expired)

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2009-08-11,"—I appreciate this opportunity to follow that tripe presented to the Senate by Senator Trood. What has been discussed today by members of the opposition amounts to nothing more than scaremongering to divert attention from the critical issues of the day. We saw in the questions asked during question time that the scaremongering from this opposition, which is trying to divert attention from the debate around the CPRS and from its problems in other areas such as the OzCar scandal, is aimed at an area we should not be politicising at all.
Defence based security should not become an area for a cheap political point-scoring. I was brought up on Defence Force bases and I can tell you that the cheap point-scoring I heard today about security of and access to Defence Force bases is outrageous. It was suggested that there were emails coming to the opposition about the quality of that security, when every Defence Force officer knows these are not issues for public debate. They understand that security is compromised if details such as those raised by Senator Johnston about random searches or the method of operating security become matters of public debate. Defence Force personnel understand the issues that the opposition clearly does not in this area.
Let us look at the credentials of what they have put forward today. The defence security committee visited Holsworthy shortly before the current incident. On entering Holsworthy on 5 June, we did not hear concerns from Mr Baldwin about the problems and the issues he believes should be addressed. No, we only hear them now, opportunistically raised after the recent incident. What is worse is the suggestion that the opposition is receiving emails from people highlighting these problems—but of course no clear substance at all is presented.
What the public also does not know is that the opposition cannot reach a consensus in its views about the issues associated with Defence Force base security. We had the opposition defence, science and personnel spokesperson, Mr Baldwin, quoted in the Australian on 5 August saying:
Now is the time to be proactive. Events overnight have shown that now is the time to introduce armed defence personnel to guard our bases.
But then we have the shadow defence minister, Senator Johnston, saying to Ten News on the same day, ‘I don’t want to see defence personnel running boom gates.’ The shadow defence minister and the shadow defence personnel minister clearly need to get their act together, and they need to get their act together before they try and politicise this issue in the way they have in the chamber today. It is clearly cheap political point-scoring in an area it is critically important we do not politicise. National security and dealing with terrorism are indeed areas that we cannot afford to politicise in the way this opposition is seeking to do.
Let me deal with the substance of the matters about defence base security. Defence has acted appropriately and initiated an immediate review into defence base security, which will report quickly and identify whether any changes need to be made. It was the case that soldiers used to man the gates of our bases. This changed during the period of the Howard government. The view reached then was that our soldiers could be better used doing the work of soldiers, not opening and closing entry gates. Defence started contracting out base security from 1997 to 1999. The move stemmed from the Defence Reform Program initiated in 1997 to implement the recommendations of the Defence Efficiency Review, which investigated market testing and outsourcing as one means to increase the proportion of military personnel employed in the sharp end of combat and combat related positions. The Commercial Support Program proposed the contracting out of support functions where this was operationally feasible, practical and cost-effective. Let us remember that we have 1,200 contractors guarding our military establishments, freeing up defence personnel to train and deploy; in contrast, Australia currently has just over 1,300 troops in Afghanistan. Those troops deserve our support. They do not deserve cheap politicising of issues around defence base security, and this is what this opposition has been doing.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>National Security</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,9,1
"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2009-08-11,"—I would like to agree, for once, with Senator Collins and suggest that our troops do need our support. They need our support in every way possible. I would firstly like to go back to some comments that Senator Bishop made assuring us of the government’s attention to national security and defence and about the development of the white paper and the government’s commitment to military spending and reform. I applaud Senator Bishop’s personal and genuine interest and commitment in this area, but I would have to suggest when he says that they also have an ongoing commitment to border protection he is erring on the side of farce. Since this government has been in place, we have had some 24 boats holding some 1,155 illegal entries enter the waters surrounding Australia. So I would suggest that facts actually speak louder than words.
So it is today in relation to the Holsworthy barracks. This was no mere security concern. This was a significant imminent terrorist threat on our own ground, in our backyard, here in Canberra. We were all horrified when we woke up and heard on the radio what had happened and who had been working in our midst—terrorist cells in our midst in Victoria and in New South Wales. So I ask you to just for a moment imagine the horror of those service personnel at the Holsworthy barracks when they turned on their radios and heard about an imminent threat to their base. These are men and women who have chosen the most honourable, laudable, worthy career: to serve this country and protect the rights, freedoms and liberties that we all enjoy. How doubly appalled would the mothers and fathers amongst them have been when they woke up to hear that news. Many of these people have chosen to place their children in child care on that base. It would be reasonable for them to presume that this would be the safest and most secure place their loved ones could be cared for.
At the Little Diggers Child Care Centre at the Holsworthy barracks there are some 49 little ones who are cared for, from 6.45 in the morning to six o’clock at night. Some of them are babies—19 of them are between a few weeks and three years of age—and the 20 others are between the ages of three and five. How horrified those parents would have been that this childcare centre, which is in the heart of this base, that is caring for their young ones, was also at threat. Amongst the different bases, there are close to 500 children. I raise this because these bases are not only looking after and delivering intensive training for our specialist forces but also caring for the young ones of these families that are dedicating their lives to protecting our rights. Across the bases—and there are some nine bases across the ACT, New South Wales and Victoria—there are close to 500 young children who we have to keep in mind, whose futures and lives are in our hands.
So it is not politicising it, as Senator Collins just said, to question what the security arrangements are on these bases. It is not politicising it to follow up on what Senator Johnston questioned, which was the upgrading of the threat level from Bravo to Charlie. It is not politicising it; it is what these people deserve and should expect. It is what we should be doing, and we should be doing it to protect our own families and our serving men and women. Senator Collins said that there was no evidence that there was anybody within the armed forces who had raised concerns. I would like to direct her to comments to the national president of— (Time expired)

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2009-08-11,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 18 July 2009, of Private Benjamin Ranaudo, while on combat operations in Afghanistan, and places on record its appreciation of his service to his country, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
I have met many men and women of the Australian Defence Force and I am always impressed with their professionalism and courage. And Private Benjamin Ranaudo, whose life and service we honour today, was himself a brave and dedicated soldier.
He joined the Army over three years ago and had previous operational experience in East Timor. Private Ranaudo was a popular and valued member of the Townsville based First Battalion Royal Australian Regiment and he was serving with the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force on his first tour of duty in Afghanistan at the time of his death. On 18 July this year, Private Ranaudo was killed by an antipersonnel explosive device during a cordon and search operation in the Baluchi Valley, some 25 kilometres north of Tarin Kowt. The same blast that claimed the life of this fine soldier also injured another Australian serviceman and three innocent Afghani civilians—and our thoughts are with them as they recover from their wounds.
Private Ranaudo’s career record speaks of a professional young man, very well trained, with an extraordinary array of completed courses. I have heard how highly skilled an infantryman he was—someone who always put his mates first, who was a pleasure to be around and who displayed the true qualities of an Australian soldier. All of us in this chamber know that we are, in Afghanistan, engaged with the international community in a very challenging campaign. Our troops in Afghanistan are doing a dangerous and difficult job. As we remember Benjamin Ranaudo today—the 11th member of the ADF to be killed on active duty in Afghanistan—that danger is brought home to us. Today, as we offer our sympathy to Benjamin Ranaudo’s family and friends—and of course as we offer our support to them as well—we say to the family and friends of servicemen Sergeant Andrew Russell, Trooper David ‘Poppy’ Pearce, Sergeant Matthew Locke, Private Luke Worsley, Lance Corporal Jason Marks, Signaller Sean McCarthy, Lieutenant Michael Fussell, Private Greg Sher, Corporal Mathew Hopkins and Sergeant Brett Till that we have not forgotten you, either. We have not forgotten the brave Australian soldiers whom you and we have lost in the fight against the Taliban.
For our troops in Afghanistan, danger is an everyday reality. They face it with the courage and the dedication that is the hallmark of the Australian Defence Force wherever they may be. The continued use of mines and improvised explosive devices by the Taliban is an insidious part of this insurgency. These devices, by their very nature, are designed to kill and to maim indiscriminately. IEDs are responsible for a substantial number of civilian and ISAF casualties each month in Afghanistan. And as competent, careful and professional as our soldiers are, IEDs are a constant danger.
Our hearts are very much with the family of Private Benjamin Ranaudo. I spent some time with them at the ramp ceremony and the funeral service. Both occasions were very moving and great tributes were paid to Private Ranaudo, not only by his family but also by those who served alongside him. On behalf of the government I offer my very sincere sympathy to his family—to his mother Jennifer, his father Angelo and all of his brothers and sisters. It is a very sad and extraordinarily difficult time for them. I can only hope that they do find some comfort in the recognition that the Australian parliament is giving to Private Ranaudo today.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Private Benjamin Ranaudo</title>,Condolences,10,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2009-08-11,"—On behalf of the coalition, I rise to support the motion moved by Senator Faulkner and to join with the government in expressing our sincere condolences to the family of Private Benjamin Ranaudo, killed on operations in Afghanistan on 18 July. As Senator Faulkner has said, Private Ranaudo was killed by one of these—as he properly described them—absolutely insidious improvised explosive devices while on operations north of Tarin Kowt. And that incident also resulted in very serious injuries to another Australian soldier, Private Paul Warren, as well as, tragically, Afghan civilians. That just shows the depths to which the Taliban will go—to kill their own fellow citizens. Senator Faulkner has properly reported to the Senate on Private Ranaudo’s membership of the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force—a great initiative of the ADF in Afghanistan.
He was only 22 years old. I have a 23-year-old son, and it strikes you just how young these soldiers are and how tragic it is that the 60-odd years of life Private Ranaudo might have otherwise had have been denied him. His parents have described him as ‘a proud soldier’ who ‘believed in what he did’, which is very, very important. Our thoughts are with his parents during what must be a dreadful time for them. The Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston, has described Private Ranaudo as:
… a professional soldier who served enthusiastically and with distinction … dedicated to his career as a soldier and committed to the profession of arms.
There could be no better statement than that. The 2nd Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force Regimental Sergeant Major, Warrant Officer Class One Darren Murch, described Private Ranaudo as ‘a highly skilled infantryman’ who ‘always put his mates first’ and ‘displayed the true qualities of the Australian soldier’.
This reminds us, as Senator Faulkner properly said, of the enormous challenges that all coalition forces are facing in Afghanistan. Private Ranaudo was the 11th Australian soldier to die proudly fighting for what we believe in and for Australia’s interests against this dreadful terrorist threat. In fact, it is an enormous credit to the ADF that our losses are so relatively light in what is a dreadful war zone. I think we can all be proud of the ADF and what it is doing.
Private Ranaudo’s parents, very importantly, said in their statement that they prayed that Benjamin’s death and the other 10 Australian fatalities in Afghanistan will not be in vain. I think that is very important. We join with the government in the resolve to ensure that Afghanistan does not fall back into the hands of the Taliban. We acknowledge the important role we play in ensuring that. As a member of the cabinet that first committed Australia to action in Afghanistan, I say that it is absolutely imperative that Australia not lose its nerve as a nation. The consequences of failure in Afghanistan, in my view, would be disastrous. I commend the government for its deep commitment to this cause. We respect the service of all Australian men and women in Afghanistan and the enormous sacrifice that they make.
We also send our best wishes to Private Paul Warren and his family. I gather he has returned to Australia following the very serious injuries that he suffered. We wish him all the very best for his rehabilitation. We acknowledge and thank him for his courageous service in Afghanistan, and our thoughts and prayers are with him in his rehabilitation. Of course, our thoughts and prayers are also with the family and friends of Private Ranaudo. I want to emphasise our support for all the families of defence personnel serving abroad. We appreciate that they are serving Australia with great distinction and we acknowledge the enormous dangers that they face.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Private Benjamin Ranaudo</title>,Condolences,10,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-08-11,"—I rise to briefly concur with the remarks of Senator Faulkner and Senator Minchin and the remarks that will no doubt follow. It is terribly important that we recognise that the death of Private Benjamin Ranaudo was not in vain. At 22 years old, as Senator Minchin pointed out, his life was in front of him. He made the supreme sacrifice for his nation, but his family, Angelo and Jennifer and his sisters, should realise that we acknowledge completely that he engaged in a battle in Afghanistan so we do not have to engage in it here. The families of the people who go forward must always realise that we hold them in the highest respect for their supreme sacrifice and that we recognise that it is their sacrifice that keeps our nation safe. That supreme sacrifice shows their love for our nation. They engage in battles that would be terrifying to so many and they make the sacrifice. Every time it happens we must do our utmost to recognise that.
To his colleague Private Paul Warren, we pray for your speedy recovery and acknowledge also the impairments that you have suffered because of your sacrifice to our nation. To the three other civilians who were proximate, we obviously keep you in our thoughts as well. To his colleagues in 1RAR, we acknowledge the great work that you have done and continue to do in the 2nd Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force. We acknowledge you all the time, and this chamber will never, ever put aside the sacrifice that all of you make, often with your lives. We will today show that in this chamber and let you know that we keep you in our thoughts and our prayers.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Private Benjamin Ranaudo</title>,Condolences,10,1

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-08-11,"—I add to the remarks of others in the condolence motion on behalf of Family First. Private Benjamin Ranaudo was a 22-year-old from Ferntree Gully in Victoria, very close to my neighbourhood. I did speak directly with his father to share our condolences. I think it is important that the Senate and indeed Australia acknowledge and reflect upon the death of any Australian who puts their life at risk for our freedom. Private Ranaudo paid the highest price for his courage, loyalty and commitment to the ideals of freedom. We can be humbled and proud of Private Benjamin Ranaudo.
Our sincere condolences go to his parents and sisters and also his girlfriend, who would also be devastated by the loss. According to Brigadier Stuart Smith, Ben had ‘a reputation as a young man of decency and goodness with a strong regard for the feelings of others’. We stand with the family.

May I particularly adopt the words and sentiments of Senator Faulkner and my leader, Senator Minchin.
I did attend the funeral of Private Benjamin Ranaudo in Melbourne some weeks ago. This was a very fine 22-year-old private. He was an outstanding solider. May I also go on to say he was an outstanding Australian. I extend my heartfelt condolences to Benjamin’s family and to his girlfriend, Hayley. He was on deployment in Afghanistan, a very dangerous place. He was away from family and friends yet was with his brothers in arms. He was a most honourable young man. I say to his family that his sacrifice will never, ever be forgotten.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2009-08-11,"—Before I was interrupted by question time I was commenting on the cost to industry of the CPRS. I make the note that dollars and cents are one thing. To this government they are simply entries on a balance sheet, with no thought of the impact of their spendthrift and damaging policies. But, in the end, this should not just be about numbers; it has to be about jobs. A few brave companies have been prepared to go public with the impact on their workers of this CPRS. The Minerals Council has found that over 66,000 jobs will be lost or forgone as a result of the CPRS. Rio Tinto has stated that ‘the CPRS as proposed will cost jobs—now and in the future’. Xstrata predicts that between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs nationally will be lost. Alcoa has concerns about 1,800 jobs at risk in Geelong and Portland. Exxon predicts the loss of 350 jobs at their Altona refinery. Hundreds of jobs will or could be lost at BlueScope and OneSteel. The aluminium smelting industry would cancel their expansion plans, with a loss of 3,000 permanent jobs and up to 15,000 construction jobs.
Even the clean energy projects at ZeroGen and Envirogen could see 1,000 jobs go begging as a result of this CPRS. The list of jobs lost or foregone could go on and on. Hundreds of thousands of jobs could disappear under this scheme that—just as a reminder—will not make a jot of difference to the climate. Research commissioned by the New South Wales government found that regional centres across Australia would shrink by 20 per cent under the government’s scheme. In some one-factory towns, the loss of industry would effectively shut the community down. This scheme is just another stake through the heart of regional Australia.
As I mentioned earlier, the government will be offering financial support for low- and middle-income families to help cope with the increased costs caused by this scheme. Why, then, are the government burdening all Australians with higher costs when the CPRS will make no meaningful difference to the world’s climate? Put simply, the price of emission intensive goods will increase, the cost of electricity will increase by up to 50 per cent, the cost of gas and other household fuels will increase for every household and food prices will increase. I ask once again: why are Labor trying to place this burden on Australian families? Why are Labor threatening their jobs, their prosperity and their lifestyle when the action that Labor are proposing will have no impact on global climate change? The only reason is that Labor have turned their backs on Australia’s interests in an ill-fated attempt to ingratiate themselves among the leaders on the world stage.
Frankly, the national price alone is too high for me to support this bill. While, by virtue of our position in the national parliament, we must consider our county’s interests, I am a senator for South Australia and I will and must consider the interests of my state. You see, when talking about job losses and increased cost, it is easy to think that it will not happen in an area near you. This scheme will affect everyone. But some, of course, will be much worse off than others. South Australia, for example, relies on agriculture, manufacturing, mining and other energy intensive industries that will all be disadvantaged by the introduction of Labor’s CPRS. It is estimated that the South Australian government will experience a net additional cost of $99 million. This will place a significant burden on other areas of state government expenditure, such as health care, just to cover the costs of this scheme.
The town of Whyalla, where I was last week, currently facing such a promising future, would once again be plunged into uncertainty as a result of this scheme. Nyrstar, a metals processing and recycling company operating in Port Pirie, estimate that a CPRS could make their smelter unviable. This would cost up to 1,700 jobs, around 30 per cent of Port Pirie’s working population. Imagine that: one third of a large town’s population out of work as a result of a scheme that will not and cannot achieve its stated aim. It fills me with dread, and it should fill every South Australian senator with dread, too.
South Australia’s future is reliant on the very industries that the rabid greenies consider unfriendly to the environment. We have to accept, though, that industry is needed to continue the growth of our state. We need to see the development. We need to see the development of our mining industry. We need to see the development of new power stations, including the proposed $350 million, 450-megawatt, gas fired power station planned near Mallala—a project the viability of which is threatened by Labor’s irrational CPRS. In the south-east of my state, the Kimberley Clark pulp and paper mill at Millicent will suffer under the CPRS, threatening the future of its 630 employees. Every single job lost will have a flow-on impact, not only for Millicent but for the neighbouring townships and the south-east region of my wonderful state.
South Australia is reliant on more than mining and industry for its prosperity. We also have a big agricultural presence that contributes a large amount to our state economy. The proposed CPRS could take up to 22 per cent of a farmer’s income to—I remind the Senate once again—achieve no meaningful benefit for the environment. Beef eaters will pay more and beef producers will make less under this scheme. In fact, input costs will rise and profits will fall for all farmers. The inevitable result will be more farmers leaving the land, placing further pressure on regional communities. I do not have time to further extrapolate on the danger this bill represents to the national interest and the interest of South Australia.
Local industries will be forced to close, only to reopen elsewhere, effectively exporting Australian jobs and profits to other countries. Every Australian—every Australian family—will bear the cost of this scheme in the form of higher food and energy prices, through loss of jobs, through the decline in real wages and through the closure of communities.
This CPRS is like a wish list of anti-Western, ultra-green ideology. It places hypothetical environmental benefits above the interests of every Australian. The economy, employment and families are ignored in favour of Al Gore’s alarmist and discredited apocalyptic future of the world. And for what? It will have no meaningful effect on reducing global greenhouse gas levels. No matter how extreme our own approach to reducing carbon emissions, Australia can achieve nothing alone. In the absence of a global agreement including India and China, Australia will simply be a loser by being an observant climate change disciple. We cannot and should not pursue causes, no matter how well-meaning they might be, if they will have no positive impact on the global environment and yet threaten the very future prosperity of our country. Accordingly, I will be acting in the national interest and the interest of South Australia by voting against this bill and by flagging my objection to any future incarnation that does not serve the interests of my state and my country. I ask that every South Australian senator, and in fact every senator in this place, makes that same commitment. To do anything less is abrogating their responsibility under our constitution.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-08-11,"—I rise today to talk about something that is close to my heart: the environment. Today we are facing one of the biggest problems of our lifetime: climate change. Climate change is affecting everyone and it is time we step up to the mark and fix what we as humans have broken before it is too late. I was privileged, like other senators, to be part of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee’s inquiry into the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009 and related bills, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Climate Policy and a participating member to the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy at its Gladstone hearing.
The experiences were an opportunity to hear from copious witnesses from renewable energy technology areas, environmental conservation groups, a variety of all types of businesses, scientists and action groups. I take this opportunity to thank the secretariat and my fellow senators, particularly Senators Cameron, Feeney and Pratt, for their commitments in dealing with possibly the most crucial piece of legislation this century and with over 8,000 submissions.
—What about me!
—I mentioned ‘all senators’! Overwhelmingly, evidence among climate scientists both in Australia and internationally is that climate change caused by human activity is posing a major and rapidly escalating threat to the earth’s physical environment, to the economies of every country and, ultimately, to the sustainability of human life on this planet. Australia is one of the hottest and driest countries in the world and will be hit by the brunt of climate change if we do not act. The state of Queensland, which I represent, is one of the states that will be greatly affected by climate change. We have been exposed to drought, floods, cyclones and fires. With a population of more than four million people we cannot afford to sit back and watch sea level rises potentially cause floods. We cannot risk carbon dioxide levels doubling. We cannot risk temperatures rising further and nor can we just sit and watch the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef or the demise of our agricultural industries. All of these would have huge implications on our state, not just our health but our businesses and our livelihoods for many generations to come. If we sit here and do nothing there will be nothing left for our children or our children’s children. I am not prepared to tell my great-grandchildren that we sat here and did nothing to stop it.
I believe in tackling tomorrow’s issues today and that is also what the Australian Labor Party believes in. The Rudd Labor government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will do just that. The strategy is based on reducing Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions, adopting a climate change strategy that we cannot avoid and helping to shape a global solution. The government’s commitments are targets of an unconditional commitment to reduce carbon pollution by five per cent from 2000 emissions levels by 2020 and a new ambitious 25 per cent target by 2020 if the world agrees to an ambitious global deal to stabilise levels of CO2 equivalent at 450 parts per million or lower.
The way Australia will achieve this goal is through a cap-and-trade scheme, which will see companies and individuals pay for their carbon emissions. For every tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted into the atmosphere, one emissions permit must be surrendered. The way the cap-and-trade scheme will work is by auctioning off the permits. Those who need the permits the most will pay more for them. There will be a limited number of permits issued, pushing the prices up higher. With the price of the permits being too high for some emitters, they will be motivated to find more environmentally friendly ways to conduct their business as it would be cheaper to just reduce emissions. Users will also be able to trade these permits. The cap-and-trade scheme is an effective way to reach our targets by 2020. The cap will help us reach the target of reducing carbon pollution and it will give carbon a price. Trading will enable emissions to be reduced at the lowest possible cost. The quantity of emissions will be monitored, reported and audited and those who do not comply will be penalised.
The scheme will affect about 1,000 Australian companies that produce more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon pollution each year. This is just one per cent of the number of registered businesses in Australia. The sale of these pollution permits will help us all to adjust to this scheme and to become a more environmentally friendly country. While the government understands that this will be a very big task, we are doing everything in our power to ease the transition to becoming a greener Australia.
The Rudd Labor government will cut fuel taxes on a cent-for-cent basis to offset the price impact on fuel by the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. This will be assessed periodically and a review will be held after three years. The government has decided to delay the start of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme by one year in order to help Australian companies manage the impacts of the global recession. We in the Labor Party do not accept the view that Australia should wait until there is an international agreement on climate change before taking action. We also reject the view that Australia will be alone in taking such action. A global agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions is the most desirable way to proceed. Nevertheless, other countries are acting in advance of such an agreement, and so should we.
Australian businesses are currently dealing with the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression. In this environment, the government has decided to act to further support jobs and assist businesses during these difficult economic times through the following measures: a new global recession buffer, which will be provided as part of the assistance package for emissions-intensive trade exposed industries; a one-year fixed price phase will apply, with the transition to full market trading from 1 July 2012, and during this fixed price phase each carbon pollution permit will cost $10; and funding for eligible businesses and community organisations to undertake energy efficiency measures in 2009-10 as part of a $200 million tranche of the Climate Change Action Fund.
To encourage carbon pollution reductions before the scheme starts, reafforestation will be eligible to voluntarily generate permits for carbon stored from 1 July 2010, creating economic opportunities in regional Australia. The expanded Renewable Energy Target will also be in place as planned from 2010 to drive investment in Australia’s vast renewable energy resources.
The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme represents one of the most significant reforms ever of the Australian economy. Unfortunately, there is no cost-free way to transition to the low pollution economy of the future. That is why the government has set out a comprehensive package of financial assistance for Australian households. Through the household compensation package pensioners, seniors and carers will receive additional support, above indexation, to fully meet the expected overall cost of living flowing from the scheme. Other low-income households will receive additional support, above indexation, to fully meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the scheme. Around 90 per cent of low-income households—or 2.9 million households—will receive assistance equal to 120 per cent or more of their cost-of-living increase. Middle-income households will receive additional support, above indexation, to help meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the scheme, and for middle-income families receiving family tax benefit part A the government will provide assistance to meet at least half of these costs. Around 97 per cent of middle-income households will receive some direct cash assistance and around 62 per cent of all middle-income households—or 2.4 million households—will receive sufficient assistance to meet at least half of these costs. And motorists will be protected from higher fuel costs from the scheme by cent-for-cent reductions in fuel tax for the first three years.
Already the government has acted decisively in introducing the Appropriation (Nation Building and Jobs) Bill, Energy Efficient Homes program, which not only provides environmental investments for householders by reductions in energy use and savings on energy bills but also generates thousands of jobs in this global financial crisis. The legislation will support jobs and sets Australia up for a low-carbon future in installing free ceiling insulation in around 29 million Australian homes. In addition, under the Energy Efficient Homes investment, the solar hot water rebate has increased from $1,000 to $1,600. The Energy Efficient Homes package will modernise Australia’s homes and will enable almost all Australian homes to be operating at a minimum two-star energy rating by 2011. It is up to us to ensure something is done to slow down climate change so that there is something left for our future generations. That is why it is important that Australia steps up on the international arena with its own scheme.
By implementing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme we will put ourselves in the company of other developed nations who are fighting climate change and trying to reduce their carbon emissions. There are schemes already operating in 27 European countries. Twenty-eight states and provinces in the United States of America and Canada, as well as New Zealand, have introduced emissions trading schemes and Japan is considering its own scheme. By joining other countries taking action on climate change, we are putting ourselves in a better position at the international negotiating table. It will be better for us economically and will enhance opportunities of becoming a low-carbon-emitting country.
Taking action earlier rather than later will enable us to have a smooth transition to becoming a more environmentally friendly nation. According to Kyoto accounting provisions, Australia’s net greenhouse gas emissions were 576 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Our biggest contributor is the energy sector, which emitted 400.9 tonnes. The second highest contributor is the agricultural sector and then transport.
The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will have broad coverage to ensure prices are kept lower for consumers. These sectors include stationary energy, transport, fugitive emissions, industrial processes, waste and forestry sectors, as well as all six greenhouse gases counted under the Kyoto protocol. The scheme will be managed by giving direct obligations to facilities with large emissions and obligations on upstream fuel suppliers to offset the emissions produced from the combustion of fuel. Forest landholders will be given the opportunity to opt in and agriculture emissions will not be included at the commencement of the program. Instead the government believes it needs more consultation with industry to determine the best way to include the agricultural sector and to reduce emissions.
As well as helping Australians become more energy efficient, assistance will be provided to businesses via the Climate Change Action Fund. This will help businesses transition by providing a range of activities through partnership funding, including investment in innovative, new, low-emissions processes, industrial energy efficient projects with long payback periods and dissemination of the best and innovative practice among small- to medium-sized enterprises. Transition assistance will also be provided to emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries. Companies may find it difficult to compete in the international market if they are competing against countries that do not have an emissions trading scheme.
Evidence provided during the inquiries from high-emitting industries claimed that they may look at moving overseas, which would be no benefit to the environment. This is called carbon leakage. To prevent carbon leakage, the government will be assisting EITEs by providing a share of free permits. This will only be applicable to businesses that are at high risk of carbon leakage. The opposition were quite vocal on their concern with the cost of this scheme. If we sit here and do nothing, the cost will be even greater to our future generations. This is explained in Australia’s low pollution future: the economics of climate change mitigation.
According to the comprehensive report and overwhelming evidence provided during the inquiries, early global action is less expensive than later action; a market based approach allows robust economic growth into the future, even as emissions fall; and many of Australia’s industries will maintain or improve their competitiveness under an international agreement to combat climate change. This was supported by many businesses and credible financial institutions who provided evidence throughout the inquiries.
The Treasury’s modelling even states that Australia and the world will continue to prosper while reducing carbon emissions. It also demonstrates that Australia will have advantages by taking early action on climate change. If emission pricing expands gradually across the world, economies that defer action will face higher long-term costs as global investment is redirected to early movers.
I must also stress that consultation has been an imperative part of the CPRS process. We have ensured that everyone has been given the opportunity to have a say when it comes to this important scheme. When the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme green paper was released last year, the government received about 1,000 submissions. We also conducted a number of industry and non-government organisation roundtables. The Garnaut review, which consulted extensively, was also established. The Minister for Climate Change and Water and other ministers held meetings with stakeholders. The Department of Climate Change ran regional and city based forums after the green paper was released and again held capital city based forums after the white paper was released. The exposure draft of the legislation was released and referred to the Senate select committee inquiry, which took submissions and has delivered its report. From that list of consultation processes, it is evident that the government is committed to giving everyone a chance to have their say on this important piece of legislation.
Keeping people employed is important to the government. At a Senate Economics Committee meeting in Canberra on Wednesday, 25 March 2009, Dr Heinz Schandl, Senior Research Leader, CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems, said a greener economy would see an extra 2.5 million to 3.3 million jobs for Australians, with 230,000 to 340,000 high-impact environmental jobs in the energy, transport, agriculture and construction sectors. Dr Schandl said, ‘We conclude, therefore, that achieving the transition to a low-carbon economy will require a massive mobilisation of skills and training both for existing workers and new workers.’ By reducing our carbon emissions and becoming a greener economy, not only will we be providing a better future for our children but also we will be putting more jobs on the table.
As a senator from Queensland I believe it is important that we take action to protect the environment and make sure that we have something left for our children and their children to inherit. A carbon pollution reduction scheme is the best way forward in tackling climate change. By reducing our carbon emissions we can reduce the effects of climate change. If we do nothing, the sea levels will keep rising, temperatures will soar, we will see more and more tropical diseases such as dengue fever and malaria and we will lose ecological wonders like the Great Barrier Reef.
The Queensland government put forward a submission to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme green paper. I will read into the Hansard an extract, in part, of that submission. It said:
Scientific modelling indicates that Queensland is particularly vulnerable to the physical impacts of climate change, with two of the six IPCC ‘hot spots’ being Queensland’s wet tropics (including the Great Barrier Reef) and south-east Queensland. Major vulnerabilities include extinction of species, deterioration of coral reefs, loss of buildings from increased flooding and storm surges and reduced availability of surface water.
                         …                   …                   …
... Queensland is the most heavily affected of the States compared to a business as usual scenario.
Australia had a decade of denial, delay, reviews and neglect under the past government. The world will meet in December this year to nut out a global agreement. Passing the CPRS will ensure we play our part at Copenhagen and sign up to do our bit. Failing to legislate the CPRS will give other countries an excuse not to act.
In the 2007 election both major parties promised to introduce an emissions trading scheme to reduce Australia’s carbon pollution. Mr Turnbull, who was then the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in the Howard government, supported an emissions trading scheme. He told the National Press Club in May 2008 that ‘the emissions trading scheme is the central mechanism to decarbonise our economy’. He also indicated that the coalition would back the government’s target range of five to 25 per cent at global negotiations at Copenhagen in December this year.
Since then there has been a steady retreat from this position, apparently under pressure from climate change sceptics—or should I refer to them as the ‘crazy uncles’?—in his own party and in the National Party. It is important to reflect on the words of the member for Wentworth in the Hansard of 26 March 2007. As the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources he said:
The Australian government is working closely with industry and with the community on practical programs that will ensure that Australia continues to lead in its climate change strategy.
                …            …            …
The Australian government is committed, and has been committed for many years, to dealing with the challenge of climate change. We are dealing with it with practical, workable measures that have results.
There have been no results, no change and no position—nothing but empty statements coming from an opposition that would not do anything for climate change during their time in government. They do not seem to have the credentials in this chamber. In June this year they deferred until now the debate on this particularly important piece of legislation. They certainly did nothing on climate change while they were in government for 11½ years, and now in opposition they wish to drag it out even further. Just like their recent disgraceful and misleading attacks on the Prime Minister over fabricated emails, the opposition have shown who they are. How can the public trust them on climate change let alone with the capacity to govern? Once again there is no proposal from the opposition, only divided rhetoric resulting in an 11th hour magic pudding.
Every poll shows that the Australian people continue to support strong action against climate change. The government has a mandate to act on this matter and should do so without further delay. The Australian people will judge harshly those parties and individual legislators who place our country’s economic and environmental future at risk by obstructive action on such a vitally important issue. In fact recent research indicates that 78 per cent of voters want the Liberal Party to back the CPRS laws. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2009-08-11,"—I rise to speak on this package of bills related to the government’s emissions trading scheme. At the outset I think it is important to look at the underlying motives and reasons for this package of bills, as many senators have done.
Do I know for sure that man-made actions are influencing global warming and climate change? No, I do not. I am no expert, nor do I believe that, either in this chamber or in the other place, this parliament has terribly many experts in this field. Many of us have tried to gather information. Many of us have tried to ensure that we are as informed as possible. But none of us, that I am aware, has the expert scientific knowledge to lay claim to being people who know exactly what is occurring to the planet. Indeed it is possible that nobody knows exactly what is occurring to the planet. But what I do know is that, outside of this parliament, throughout the world there are many people who put themselves forward as experts, there are many people who have the level of scientific training that perhaps, hopefully, means that they do understand what is happening to our planet and the potential impact of climate change.
It seems that the balance of the scientific opinion out there suggests that man-made actions are having an impact. I recognise and I respect the views of those who believe they are not. I hope those people are correct. Indeed it would be a far better future if those people who argue that climate change is not real were correct. However, I believe that the majority opinion in the scientific community, and it appears to still be a significant majority of those with expertise in this field, needs to be given the benefit of the doubt. It needs to be recognised as the consensus opinion. We do need to give, as our leader and others have said, the planet the benefit of the doubt when considering this issue.
Before I came to this place to give this speech today I looked back at my maiden speech. In that first address to the Senate I said:
You do not need to be Einstein to work out that continued growth using current resources will ultimately be unsustainable. You should not even need to be 100 per cent convinced of the science behind global warming to know that the environmental footprint of man across this planet must have its limitations.
Reflecting back on those remarks at that stage, to this day I still hold the view that the continuous exponential rise of emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere—or of any other chemical compound—cannot go on forever without having some impact. I do not know what that impact will always be but I am conscious that every action we perform on this earth has some small repercussion. Whether it is a repercussion with very insignificant consequences on what is happening around us or whether it is cumulative—as it has been over the last 100 years, where we have gone from being a populace on this earth of about one billion people to being a populace closer to six billion people, and still growing—we have an impact.
So I come to the view that climate change is an issue that should be considered and taken seriously because of two clear reasons: as I said, we have some level of natural limitations and we have the balance of scientific opinion. Throughout the last couple of decades this has been an ongoing subject of discourse in this place, throughout the community and throughout the world. We have actually taken great steps on climate change awareness and action. Some of those steps and some of the work undertaken are all too easily forgotten in the discussions and debates that we have in this place.
The previous Howard government did set itself out from the rest of the world when it established the Australian Greenhouse Office back in 1996. It took action from day one in government to recognise that Australia needed to position itself for its place in this debate in the world and needed to prepare itself for whatever transitions to its economy and its industry were going to be required. It backed up that establishment of the Australian Greenhouse Office with a mix of measures, including the Australian greenhouse challenge, a voluntary industry measure. In my time working at the Australian Hotels Association, I assisted many of Australia’s major hotel chains to implement measures that reduced their energy consumption as part of the voluntary package of the Australian greenhouse challenge. Under the previous government we put in place programs that sought to help the transition. Indeed, we have seen many industry sectors already pick off what might be described as the low-hanging fruit—the easy gains in how you improve your energy efficiency and reduce your carbon footprint.
We introduced the first mandatory renewable energy target. It was another major step by the Howard government to position Australia for the future; to provide some market incentive for growth in the renewable energy sector. It mandated a five per cent limit and established a system where the growth of renewable energy had some value to it through the trading of the renewable energy certificates. We put in place the initial reporting frameworks for a potential carbon trading scheme as well.
So we put in place the framework to step Australia onto the pathway of having a broader carbon trading framework. Through all of these actions we actually set Australia up to be one of the very few countries in the world who will, by the conclusion of the time frame of the Kyoto agreement, have actually met its targets. Australia will have met its agreed targets under Kyoto, or will come extremely close to having met them, at the end of its time frame. It is no credit to the current government or those sitting opposite that Australia will have met those targets because all the hard yards—as it is with so many areas of the management of Australia—were done by the previous government. That is when the trajectory for success on Kyoto was put in place.
Internationally, Australia helped set up the AP6 group—the group of six Asia-Pacific countries to help develop and transfer low-emissions technologies. Setting up an international group may not sound like much except for the fact there was one major piece of significance around this group: that is, that it was—and still is to date—the only international agreement on climate change that actually brought together China, India and the United States. It put those three countries around the one table to discuss climate change matters—those three countries that are so integral to having any chance of tackling this issue.
So Australia had some great runs on the board as we come to this debate today. Did we always get it right? No. There were definitely some negatives. There were negatives particularly surrounding the symbolic. The new government has been very good both in opposition and in government at actually capturing and making hay out of the symbolism; and in particular, the symbolism in this issue of the ratification and signing of Kyoto. It was a tragedy in the end that Australia had not signed Kyoto because it was used with such great political success by the now Prime Minister in the last election campaign. Full marks to him for his political skills in turning an issue against us—where we had actually been succeeding as a country in meeting our targets and obligations—purely over a piece of symbolism. It is very clear that a political mistake was made by the previous government in not signing Kyoto.
Those negatives of perception of course have been played out by the Prime Minister and Minister Wong and others throughout this debate and exploited in a particularly ruthless way. In doing so, they have sadly politicised the debate around climate change to such an extent that it is hard to see a clear pathway forward for Australia now. As they have played politics with climate change they have managed to manifest a position of black and white. This is not a debate of black and white. As I said in my introductory remarks, from the very genesis of the science around climate change, there are shades of grey and those shades of grey are now very clear in the policy position we take going forward.
It is not a matter of their ETS being the only option—far from it. Their ETS is probably a terrible option. It has many flaws to it, many of which have been outlined by numerous colleagues of mine. Their ETS unfortunately will do little to help the environment in the way they are pursuing the policy, but at the same time it manages to pose a significant risk to Australia. It will do little to help the environment because they have forgotten that global warming is known as global warming for a good reason—because it is a global problem. It is not an Australian problem; it is a global problem. It is one thing taking Australia with you, but you actually have to take the world with you too, and that is where the Rudd government is failing to deliver on its climate change policy.
They were elected on a promise of introducing this emissions trading scheme by 2010. That is actually next year. It is not that far away. That was the initial promise. That was part of the politics of the debate. Why was it part of the politics? Because the Howard government had a sensible time frame in place to introduce some type of emissions trading regime. The Howard government had committed to do so, but to do it in a sensible and timely manner. But no, to win the election, Mr Rudd had to say: ‘We will do it sooner. We will rush it in.’ That was their commitment. It was a bit of political one-upmanship. It was all about posturing for the campaign.
Eventually, after much haranguing and free advice from this side of the chamber, they saw the light and delayed the introduction date. Yet now, still in a game of politics, they choose to try to push and rush this legislative package through—rush it through now even though it is not required for legislative purposes until next year and for operational purposes, beyond that. But no, they want to rush it through despite the fact that the world will come together later this year in Copenhagen to discuss the global approach to climate change. That is where the government should be applying its focus: working towards a good outcome at Copenhagen, one that builds on the work of the Howard government in bringing China and India and the United States to the table together to actually achieve a global agreement that will make some difference. Australia’s one per cent of global emissions, no matter what we do here, is not going to make a jot of difference. No matter how much I think we need to do the responsible thing and take action in Australia, it will not matter. We could shut the whole place down tonight, pass through some emergency legislation and shut the whole country down, and it still will not make a jot of difference, because the rest of the world will keep powering on and the growth we see in China and India, in particular, demonstrates how important it is for us to have them on board for any action at all to be meaningful.
So we have this ridiculous timing approach, trying to jump ahead of Copenhagen and the potential of a global agreement just because the government want to play politics. They want to wedge the opposition. They want to create a double dissolution trigger. They want to do whatever it is on a political front and they do not care about the correct policy footing.
In the United States we have the discussion around the Waxman-Markey bill that is progressing through congress. It has passed through the House of Representatives but not yet through the Senate. The US Senate will, I have no doubt, take its time, as it usually does, and give careful consideration to the proposal. It may well decide to wait until after Copenhagen before final passage of the legislation. But, notably, it is a system that is markedly different from the one proposed here by the Rudd government. It provides much clearer protection for their trade-exposed industries and ensures that they are not selling out their industries before the rest of the world is clearly on board. In fact as well as providing significant protection up till 2025 for their industries, it even then still has a trigger requiring that some 70 per cent of global output for any manufacturing sector is covered by some type of emissions trading regime before that manufacturing sector or industry in the United States faces its emissions trading scheme. So there is a protective mechanism in there for the long term, not just for a fixed date but actually to ensure that there is majority coverage of the globe in a particular industry sector.
So we see a markedly different approach. In Australia trade-exposed emissions-intensive industries have largely been sold out. Yes, you hear lots of numbers thrown around about free permits and what proportion of permits they might get for free, but the truth is that those permits and the value of those permits diminish over time under this government’s ETS and by diminishing they will increase year upon year the pressure on those industry sectors. And if the rest of the world is not on board or the major competitors and the major trade competitors of China and India are not on board, then those industries will move offshore.
Senator Furner before me mentioned carbon leakage. He mentioned it, but his government has failed to comprehensively address the potential threat of carbon leakage, of our going through all this economic pain in Australia and of the job losses that Senator Bernardi spoke about earlier, only to see these industries move offshore to less efficient countries where we may well end up seeing higher emissions outputs in net global terms. And this, I come back to, is a global issue we are meant to be tackling.
We also see some specific, detailed problems in this legislative package. The capacity of industry to pass through costs is an issue that none other than the Queensland Premier, Anna Bligh, has raised with the Rudd government. It is about the capacity of mining companies and those who have international trade agreements, signed and in place, to pass through their industry costs at either a domestic or a trade level of doing business. Santos, a major South Australian company, has made strong representations to the government about the need for the package to be changed in this area. But each time it has done so, it has been greeted by a door being shut in its face. When Premier Bligh cannot get changes and major employers like Santos from the minister’s own home state cannot get changes, you have to wonder at the recalcitrance of this government. They are clearly unwilling to listen to the concerns of stakeholders in this sector.
This is a bad package, but there are no lack of alternatives. Yesterday Mr Turnbull released one alternative suite of packages. It is well modelled. It is does not churn as much funding as the government’s scheme does from selling permits through the economy. It provides for higher targets. It is a cleaner, greener, smarter model of emissions trading—one that could give us more bang for our buck. Better still, we could and we should take the time over the next few months—past Copenhagen—to consider the model provided by Mr Turnbull. We could come back here in January or February next year to have this debate. We should have this debate when we know what direction the rest of the world is going in and when we have given full consideration to the much better policies that the Liberal Party have outlined, as we have historically always done in this key policy area.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2009-08-11,"—I believe climate change is real. I come from the south-west of Western Australia. I grew up in Busselton, down on Geographe Bay. When I was a little boy, there were very wet winters in the south-west. During the wintertime, I would go to sleep at night listening to the patter of rain on the tin roof of my parents’ house. It rained every night for months and months and months. But the south-west of Western Australia is an area where the evidence of climate change is now very real, because the rainfall in the south-west has dropped by about 25 per cent over the last 30 years. I have a brother who lives in Germany. He is very fond of skiing, but he could not go skiing last winter because there was no snow on the Bavarian Alps. And now we are hearing stories about icebergs off Auckland.
I think there is a change in the world’s climate, but the issue is: what is its cause? Some scientists point to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as being the only cause. Others point to the geological record which shows that cyclical climate change has occurred over many, many thousands of years—over the millennia. Greenland is called Greenland because 400 years ago it was a green land. It is now covered in ice. I have read that 1,000 years ago there were vineyards in Sweden. People quite often refer to the fact that sea levels are rising, especially in the Pacific. But sea levels have risen and fallen over the centuries. The Pilbara, for example, was once a seabed. That great mining area has all the characteristics of an old seabed, including having seashells there. There was clearly once a land link between Indonesia and Australia. One only has to look at the dingo and then visit Indonesia to find that Indonesian dogs look remarkably like dingoes. They obviously walked across that land bridge centuries ago and became wild dogs in Australia.
There is no doubt at all that since the industrial revolution levels of carbon dioxide have risen in the world, but whether or not this is the sole cause or just a contributor to climate change is, I think, an unanswered question. The coalition have said that we should give the earth a chance; we should give it the benefit of the doubt. However, in this atmosphere of uncertainty, I believe the proposed Rudd-Wong emissions trading scheme is totally out of proportion to Australia’s position in the world as a country which contributes only 1.4 per cent of global emissions and which has a GNP representing just one per cent of the global economy. As I said, this scheme is totally out of proportion to whatever contribution we make to carbon dioxide emissions in the world and can only be described as grandiose. If implemented, this scheme will impose enormous costs on Australian industry, decrease Australia’s international competitiveness, result in the loss of investment in new projects and see existing plants relocated to other countries. All of this will contribute to a massive loss of jobs and increase the cost of living for many Australians.
It may be that there is a need for Australia to play a role in reducing global carbon emissions but this proposal is out of proportion, as I have said, to what might be regarded as a reasonable contribution to this objective by a small country such as Australia. I think, as the coalition in general does, that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009, the Rudd-Wong CPRS, should be reconsidered. Coalition senators believe a seriously flawed scheme will be worse for this country than no scheme at all, and it has to be said that is also the view of Professor Garnaut.
Mr Rudd promised before the election to introduce an ETS which would produce deep cuts in carbon dioxide emissions but would not disadvantage Australia’s export- and import-competing industries. However, it is quite obvious that this immensely complex ETS will damage our export- and import-competing industries, it will cost thousands of jobs and it will stifle investment; yet it will not produce any meaningful reductions in carbon dioxide emissions around the world. In fact, emissions from high-emission domestic industries will not be diminished at all because instead of reducing their emissions these industries will be able to trade them off—for example, by buying a rainforest in Indonesia. How does that benefit Australia, you might ask, and how does that benefit the world? I really cannot see any benefit at all in a scheme like that if it does not actually reduce emissions in this country.
In the opinion of the coalition, the rush to introduce this scheme without knowing the outcome of the December 2009 global climate change summit in Copenhagen, without knowing what President Obama will do and without knowing the impact of the global financial meltdown on our real economy is a big step and should be reconsidered.
There were serious flaws in the process of developing the CPRS. For example, the Treasury was not permitted to model any alternative scenarios or methods. Instead of considering possible alternative models—of which there are many, as has been presented in evidence to the various Senate committees which have looked into the CPRS—and the appropriateness of these various models to Australian conditions, the government simply put in place a predetermined CPRS model. We had to take it or leave it; that was it. Nothing else was considered.
The design of the Rudd government scheme assumes, among other things, that our major competitors will move to put in place a major new tax on carbon emissions in their economies. However, again, evidence given to the four Senate inquiries into the CPRS was that it is considered extremely unlikely by very reputable observers that our major trading partners will in fact introduce an ETS at all. For example, Dr Alan Moran of the Institute of Public Affairs, in his submission to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into the CPRS bills, said that he thought it was highly unlikely that China, Japan or Korea would introduce ETSs, and the idea that India will have an emissions trading scheme is just not taken seriously by anybody of any repute.
The Rudd scheme involves generating permit revenue of nearly $13 billion a year, which is in effect a massive increase in taxation and will be a huge burden to the Australian economy. This will see a huge administration set up to churn these billions of dollars back through the economy, with the government picking who gets compensation and who does not.
One of the alternatives to the Rudd-Wong CPRS is a carbon tax, which commentators such as Robert Gottliebsen and Geoff Carmody, both renowned economists, feel would be more appropriate to Australia’s needs and could be administered through the existing taxation bureaucracy. It would not involve the creation of the huge bureaucracy to administer the proposed permit and trading system that will be necessary under the CPRS. A carbon tax, many people feel, is a much simpler, more effective and more cost-effective way of Australia contributing in a real way to reducing carbon emissions around the world: by starting at home.
Providing certainty to business is one of the government’s most repeated reasons for this legislation needing to be passed. However, businesses have said they do not want the certainty of not being able to compete—because Australian industry will not be able to compete if this scheme is introduced. They want a scheme which preserves their international competitive position in a competitive world, but that will be compromised if none of our trading partners, such as China, Japan, India and Korea, establish emissions trading schemes so that trading can in fact occur. The only thing that will happen is that Australian industry will be saddled with a new, very high tax.
The government’s argument that its emissions trading scheme needs to be rushed through parliament prior to the Copenhagen conference has been undermined by the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Yvo de Boer, who has stated that the UN does not require countries to have legislation in place before the conference—which leads to the question: why is the Rudd government attempting to rush this legislation through the parliament before full consideration has been given to its impact?
One of the comments being made by Labor Party spokespersons is that the Howard government proposed an emissions trading scheme some years ago. That is true; it did. But the level of knowledge which the community now has about the implications of emissions trading compared to that at the time the Howard government proposed an ETS is substantially different, and I think one needs to consider the ETS in terms of contemporary knowledge, not what was known or thought to be known 10 years ago. Surely it is more important to have the right scheme in place rather than just any scheme for the sake of being able to claim to have a scheme.
The changes announced by the Rudd government on 4 May to vary the CPRS were no more than tinkering around the edges. There is still no credible demonstration that the government’s scheme is the most cost-efficient way or effective way to reduce carbon emissions; there is still no forecast of the near-term, real impact of an ETS on jobs and economic growth; and Australia’s trade-exposed industries will remain at a disadvantage compared to their competitors.
My colleague Mr Don Randall, the member for Canning, speaking in the House of Representatives on 3 June, referred to the impact the CPRS would have on the alumina—
Sitting suspended from 6.30 pm to 7.00 pm
—Before the break, I was saying that my House of Representatives colleague Mr Randall, the member for Canning, referred to the impact the CPRS would have on the alumina industry, which employs nearly 2,000 people in and around Wagerup and Pinjarra in his electorate. He said that Alcoa had informed him that the cost of buying permits for refining is $25 million and the cost to Alcoa for all its operations, with the introduction of the CPRS, could be up to $95 million. That is a cost Alcoa will have to bear in full, making them less competitive in the international market. The cost cannot be passed on because the price is set by the London Metal Exchange.
In the Australian Financial Review of 5 May, Mr Don Voelte, CEO of Woodside, was reported as saying:
Even as amended, the CPRS risks halving the size of the export natural gas industry than it would otherwise be by 2030.
This is because fewer new developments would occur in the north of Western Australia. We have to remember that Australia has many competitors for investment in resources and resource projects. While the fact that Australia is a politically stable country with a reliable legal system gives us a competitive advantage, that advantage will not be so great if the cost of operating resource projects in Australia becomes too high. The developers will not hesitate to go elsewhere—the bottom line is what counts to industry.
In response to my question during the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme hearings on the impact the CPRS would have on investment in Australia, Mr Mitch Hooke, the CEO of the Minerals Council of Australia replied:
What Australia is doing, wittingly or unwittingly, is increasing the sovereign risk associated with those investment decisions. If we impose a tax or a price on carbon that, in effect, becomes a tax, because we do not have the technologies to adjust …
It means our competitors who are not facing the same kinds of costs will inevitably have an advantage over us. The implication of this comment by Mr Hooke is clearly that Australian based operations will become uncompetitive and many will move offshore or close down, meaning in either case the loss of jobs for Australian workers.
I recently attended a presentation in Parliament House put on by the Friends of Mining, by an oil company, at which we were told the impact of the additional costs arising from the CPRS would mean that it would no longer be profitable to continue oil refining in Australia and that instead it would be cheaper to simply import oil from Singapore. In WA, this could mean the closure of the Kwinana oil refinery, with consequent losses of jobs in Medina and Rockingham. Other emissions intensive industries in the Kwinana industrial strip, such as fertiliser plants, could also close down due to the additional costs imposed by the Rudd-Wong CPRS making them relatively less profitable than importing products from Indonesia or other Asian countries. Cement production is another industry where this would be the case. It is anticipated that the introduction of the CPRS could result in the cessation of cement production in Australia, requiring the importation of our cement from China.
According to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, CPRS induced increases in energy and transport costs will impact directly on the profitability of small- to medium-sized enterprises, resulting in lower employment across Australia in this sector. The government, of course, argues that any job losses will be compensated by the creation of green jobs elsewhere. However, at the hearings held by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee into the CPRS, Dr Ken Henry, the head of Treasury, said that, while indeed green jobs will be created, those holding them will have to accept a lower standard of living because wages will have to be lower to preserve employment levels.
These factors, in my estimation, add up to the conclusion that the Rudd-Wong CPRS proposal is seriously flawed and needs to be reconsidered in the interests of preserving employment in our society and not imposing unreasonable increases in costs on consumers through higher electricity charges which will flow through to increased costs for consumer goods. Any emissions trading scheme will undoubtedly have a profound and long-term impact on Australia, its citizens and our industries. This is a matter requiring cautious assessment before decisions are made and certainly the present haste can only be regarded as inappropriate and irresponsible.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2009-08-11,"—I rise tonight to make some remarks about the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme bills that we have before us. When I came into this place as a Nationals senator my focus was, and still remains, on regional Australia and on making the best decisions I possibly can for regional Australia. To not support this ETS is the only decision I can possibly make. As my very good colleague Senator Joyce said the other day, this is an employment termination scheme; it is an extra tax system. That is what it is, and it is going to rip the guts and heart out of regional communities.
Let us have a look at what the government wants to do. The government very simply wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but what we are seeing is a Prime Minister who, as my colleague Senator Cash said earlier, is strutting his stuff on the world stage trying to promote himself as the global leader in making sure we take the right steps forward. It is an absolute load of rubbish. Any solution to reduce emissions has to be global. We cannot simply do it from Australia. Only 1.4 per cent of global emissions come from this country. Quite simply, if the rest of the world is not on board, we are not going to make a drop-in-the-ocean difference—not one drop. Yet what have we seen? Very little movement from the rest of the world and our gung-ho Prime Minister determined to show that he can lead the rest of the world on what we should be doing. What is the point of that if our emissions—at only 1.4 per cent of the global emissions—are the only ones on the playing field?
And this will be at what cost? The costs are going to be absolutely huge. There will be costs to jobs. Two-thirds of the unemployment that will result from the ETS will occur in regional Australia. I am not going to stand here and say: ‘That’s okay, Prime Minister; that’s fine. We’ll watch two-thirds of those jobs disappear out of the regions.’ It is not right and it is not on. And for what? An Access Economics report said that Labor’s ETS would cost more than 126,000 jobs nationally. I think there would be around 66,000 jobs in the mineral industry alone. What are we looking at? Let us look at it from both sides. There would be 126,000 jobs gone, but for what benefit? If the rest of the world is not on board, what would be the benefit? I am not going to stand here and watch an ETS rip the guts out of jobs in our regional communities and say that that is okay, because it is not okay and it is not right. The costs to regional communities will be enormous.
The agricultural industry will be particularly hard hit by the Rudd government’s ETS. What have we seen? There will not even be a decision made until 2013 about agriculture and it may then be in 2015. What kind of certainty does that give to our farmers? What kind of path forward do they have when they have no idea what the future holds for them? My colleague Senator Adams in Western Australia knows very well the consternation that this is causing and the absolute disregard we are seeing the Labor government have for our agricultural communities. As if it were not bad enough for agricultural communities at the moment, they have to also deal with whether or not this is going to come in.
The interesting thing is that, even if agriculture is excluded, regional Australia and our agricultural industries are still going to be incredibly hard hit. Our farmers are at the bottom of the food chain. They are at the end of the line and the buck stops with them. Everything flows down to them. We know that as a result of the ETS there will be enormous imposts and huge increases on things like transport, fuel and electricity and inputs for farmers such as fertiliser and packaging. Guess what? The buck stops with the farmer. All those costs are going to be dropped in the laps of the farmers in those communities. So, even if agriculture is not included, our regional communities and our agricultural industries will still have to deal with the enormous negative impacts. To simply say, ‘Agriculture might not be included,’ is not good enough. It is not good enough because the difficulties they are going to face are still there and they have no capacity to offset the costs.
One thing we do hear talked about quite a lot is carbon sequestration and how important it is in terms of getting carbon back into the soil. Interestingly, under Kyoto it is not even counted. They will not even let you get the credits for it. All this good work that the farmers do is not counted. Farmers know that if they do not look after the land then the land will not look after them. We have seen such tremendous changes in practices and innovation across our farming communities for years now—improvements to how we look after the land and the environment—and what is happening to our farming communities? They are getting kicked in the guts by Labor’s ETS. Labor could not care less about our farming communities. They simply do not care.
As if farmers were not doing it tough enough already with years and years of drought, we have seen increases in inputs over the last 10 years, particularly for things like fertiliser, ripping the guts out of the farmers, their enterprises and what they are trying to do. What is the Labor government now going to do? Whack on another tax—and I take you back to my opening remarks—for what? For 1.4 per cent of the world’s emissions. All of this is going to be sheeted home to our farmers. They are going to have to cope with it, and for what?
I want to go to some of the reporting that has come out on regional communities. It is interesting to note that some of these reports—both government funded and by government departments—have significantly focused on the impact that this is going to have on our regional communities. ABARE’s 1 June report states:
Even if the agriculture sector is not a covered sector under the CPRS, agricultural producers will face increased input costs associated with the use of electricity, fuels and freight and may face lower farm-gate prices for their goods—
and we know that is going to happen—
from downstream processors. These will have implications for the economic value of farm production.
ABARE says that the economic value of farm production in broadacre industries could fall between 0.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent in 2011 and by 2015 that fall could be between 9.1 per cent and 14.5 per cent.
Then on 4 May the government funded Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation released a study on farm impacts of an Australian ETS, prepared for them by the Centre of International Economics. These are some of the key findings. The CPRS will affect agriculture both directly through cost associated with a need to either buy permits or reduce emissions and indirectly through cost increases elsewhere in the economy. Farm costs will rise even if agriculture is not included in the CPRS. The CPRS will have a significant impact on the livestock sector. Farm cash income for the average beef farm would fall by over 60 per cent under a full participation scenario with a carbon price of $25 per tonne of CO2, or 125 per cent at a carbon price of $50 a tonne. These are the sorts of figures that our farmers are looking at at the moment. This is followed by an average beef-sheep farm with cash income down by 90 per cent if the permit price is $50 a tonne. Profits for all farms would fall.
This is the sort of future that our farmers are facing under this ETS—it is simply not right. I thank Senator Adams for her interest in what I am saying because I know, as I said before, she understands—as so many of my colleagues do on this side of the chamber—the impact that is going to fall onto our regional communities. They are not going to be able to cope. It is as simple as that. Yet this government goes forward and puts in place an ETS that is going to rip the heart out of our regional communities. We have heard a lot from the other side, and, of course, we are very well aware of the global economic downturn, that agriculture is the very sector that is holding this country up at the moment. It is the very sector that is working its guts out. It is one of the shining lights that we can actually see across this country making sure that we have a viable future. So we have this sector that is doing the work—that is the engine room of this country—and this government is trying to rip the guts out of it through the imposition of an ETS. It is simply wrong.
We have seen the Australian Farm Institute also come out with a number of findings. One finding which is particular interesting is that by 2030 beef gross value of production is projected to fall by $6.6 billion if agriculture is included in the ETS. This is followed by: wool, $1.1 billion; sheep meat, $1 billion; dairy, $793 million; wheat, $497 million; pork, $318 million; and poultry, $318 million. Under the ETS, this is what is going to happen to the sector that we want to drive the future recovery of this nation.
The New South Wales government, under some research commissioned into the regional impacts of the scheme, found that regional centres such as Gippsland, Geelong, central western Queensland, Hunter Valley, central Western Australia, Kimberley, Whyalla and Port Pirie would shrink by over 20 per cent under the ETS. Could you imagine if we said to everybody across Australia, ‘By the way, the economy is about to shrink by 20 per cent right across the nation.’ There would be an outcry. But, oh no, it is fine if we can look at that happening in the regions because the regions are ‘over there somewhere’, they do not particularly matter! Well, they do. They matter enormously and it is extremely disappointing that the other side of this chamber do not understand how important it is.
That New South Wales report is talking about how the regions may experience economic impacts much more severe than the average. In the Hunter, we are talking about five times the average. In the Illawarra, it is going to be twice the average. There is a significant amount of work in the report showing how much the regions are going to be belted.
Farmers are at the bottom of the food chain, with no ability to pass on those costs, and for what? I will not stand here, in this chamber, and vote for this ETS when we know quite clearly and simply what it is going to do to our regional communities. I said at the beginning when I came into this place I would make sure that I made the right decisions for regional communities—that I would do the right thing by them. I will not stand here and vote for legislation that is going to rip the heart cleanly out of regional Australia.
The following point is extremely important: there is not a direct correlation between support for the ETS and supporting a cleaner, healthier future for the environment. Many people out in the community, who have been caught up in the Labor spin on all of this, are under the impression that if they support an ETS they are supporting a better environment. This is simply rubbish. I say to the people of Australia that you can absolutely—as we do on this side of the chamber—support a cleaner, healthier, viable future for the environment, not only right across this country but also right across the globe, without supporting this ETS. They are not tied.
I also say to the people of Australia—if indeed anybody is listening—
—I am listening.
—Thank you very much, Senator Payne. I do also note how concerned you are about this issue. I say to every single man, woman and child across this country who believes in an ETS: do you know what an ETS is? Just sit down and think to yourselves: do you know how it is going to work? Do you know what it means? Do you know how it is going to impact your life? Do you know if it is going to impact your job? Do you know if it is going to impact you when you walk into that supermarket once the ETS comes in and prices go up? Do you know how this scheme works? If the only reason you are supportive of an ETS is because you think you are doing your bit for the environment, then I would ask you to reconsider. There are so many other ways to ensure we have a viable future and a very clean, healthy environment right across the world without supporting this ETS. There are other ways you can do it and I would ask you to very seriously consider this: if you support an ETS do you really know what it is?
We need to make sure that we continue to do everything we can in terms of renewable energy. One of the interesting things that the world is grappling with is peak oil. We should be out talking about our reliance on fossil fuels and making sure that we can reduce that reliance. Scientists predict that in about 2010 we are going to hit peak oil. Where are we going with our renewables? We must make absolutely sure we do everything for the environment in terms of renewable energy. We must make sure that we do not miss the opportunity to provide incentives to businesses to reduce their emissions regardless of an ETS. We must make absolutely sure that we have policies in place so there is a carrot for those industries to reduce their emissions.
It is a very interesting road that we have been travelling along in this debate on the ETS. One point is that there has not been much debate about global warming around this whole issue. Over the time that it has been at the forefront, debate about global warming has not really been allowed. I agree with what my colleague Senator Eggleston said before when he said he believed in climate change. So do I, absolutely. The climate has been changing for millions and millions of years. It is about the cause and, far more importantly for farmers, it is about adapting to change and making sure that they have got risk management practices in place to adapt to that change.
One thing that has concerned me is that we have not had a debate about whether or not global warming is occurring. It is a bit like the Spanish Inquisition. If you dare to even ask the supporters of global warming a question about some of the science, you may as well be under the Spanish Inquisition because you are a heretic. That is not right and that is not on. I was brought up to question things, to think about things and to ask questions about the issues that were put before me. But have we ever seen that in this debate? No, because we have been given one side of the argument. If you do not take that side of the argument then you are an absolute sceptic; you are a nonbeliever. Well, I would say that questioning is healthy, sensible and smart. There are a range of scientists out there who have a different view. Ian Plimer, Bob Carter and Bill Kininmonth are among a number of scientists out there who have a different view. I would say: have we actually listened to an alternative view at all? Do we ever actually think about whether or not the premise for global warming is actually correct? I would suggest it has been a very one-sided debate.
In conclusion, I will never step away from the people of regional Australia. I will never stop making what I believe are the right decisions for regional Australia regardless of the impacts those might have, because regional Australia is the engine room of this country, it is driving this country and it is driving this nation. We should start giving the farmers of this nation the respect that they deserve, because they are out there, day in and day out, producing for us, making sure we can feed our nation and making sure we can feed the rest of the globe. Food security is an issue for another day. We need to make sure they have our support every single day, day in and day out. They will have mine on this issue and I will not be supporting the ETS.
Debate (on motion by Senator Stephens) adjourned.
Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2009-08-11,"—The government this week are asking the Senate to support passage of a package of no less than 11 separate bills, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009 and related bills, to give effect to their Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, as they call it. This scheme represents one of the most dramatic and far-reaching interventions into the Australian economy ever proposed by an Australian government. Its passage and entry into force would have enormous impacts on the Australian economy and the economic circumstances of millions of Australians. The government knows there is no Senate majority for this legislation, yet it is determined on what is nothing more than a cynical political exercise.
This legislation should be withdrawn for a number of reasons. Firstly, it proposes a scheme which will not commence operation for another two years. There is absolutely no justification for the government’s insistence that the parliament deal with it now. Secondly, the government is seeking to legislate an emissions trading scheme for Australia well in advance of the UN meeting in Copenhagen in December, which will determine the extent to which, if any, the world is prepared to act in concert on CO2 emissions. It is utter folly for Australia to legislate a scheme prior to the Copenhagen conference. And, thirdly, the United States, currently the biggest emitter, is currently considering the issue of an ETS. It is, in our view, cynically irresponsible to propose that the Australian parliament lock in an Australian ETS prior to the US—as I said, the biggest emitter of CO2—before it determines whether or not it will commit to an ETS and, if so, the nature and design of such a scheme.
For these reasons, the opposition condemns the government for its naked political opportunism in forcing the parliament to consider its so-called CPRS at this time. Not only is the timing of this legislative initiative to be condemned, so too should the very name given to this package of legislation be condemned by this parliament. It is regrettably typical of this spin-driven government to use such a grotesquely Orwellian approach to the description of this legislation. For no more than base political purposes, the government has called its emissions trading scheme a ‘carbon pollution reduction scheme’. This is of course the perpetuation of a cruel hoax on the Australian people, childishly simplistic and misleading. The scheme proposed does not deal with carbon. It purports to deal with something quite separate—carbon dioxide emissions—and the scheme does not deal with pollution.
Whatever the climatic role of human induced emissions of CO2, CO2 is not by any stretch of the imagination a pollutant. CO2 is, as we know, a clear, odourless, colourless gas vital to life on earth. Indeed, CO2 is essential to a healthy environment. One of the most cynical and deceptive manoeuvres of the climate change fanatics is to seek to convince people that CO2 emissions are pollution, to demonise CO2 per se. Anyone with any understanding of science knows this to be a complete falsehood. Indeed the Rudd government knows it too. Its own environment department’s website has a link to the official Australian National Pollutant Inventory, which lists 93 pollutants. Surprise, surprise, carbon dioxide is not listed among them. Mind you, after this speech, I bet some poor public servant will be bullied into adding CO2 to the list. So even the government’s own official list of pollutants, all 93 of them, does not include carbon dioxide.
It is also typical of this deceitful and spin-driven government to so cynically misrepresent the nature of carbon dioxide. Of course this whole extraordinary scheme, which would do so much damage to Australia, is based on the as yet unproven assertion that anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are the main driver of global warming. I want to commend Senator Fielding for his questioning of the government over the causes of global warming. The Rudd government arrogantly refuses to acknowledge that there remains a very lively scientific debate about the extent of and the main causes of climate change, with thousands of highly reputable scientists around the world of the view that anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are not and cannot be the main driver of the small degree of global warming that occurred in the last 30 years of the 20th century.
No-one, of course, disputes the reality of climate change. Of course the climate is constantly changing—it always has; it always will—but the main drivers of the small degree of warming that occurred in the 20th-century and the extent to which we should be concerned about it are hotly disputed in scientific circles. One of the world’s most eminent atmospheric scientists, Professor Richard Lindzen of the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology, recently observed:
The notion of a static, unchanging climate is foreign to the history of the earth or any other planet with a fluid envelope. The fact that the developed world went into hysterics over changes in global mean temperature anomaly of a few tenths of a degree will astound future generations. Such hysteria simply represents the scientific illiteracy of much of the public, the susceptibility of the public to the substitution of repetition for truth, and the exploitation of these weaknesses by politicians, environmental promoters, and, after 20 years of media drum beating, many others as well. Climate is always changing.
That is Professor Richard Lindzen, one of the world’s most eminent atmospheric scientists, who I suspect knows a little bit more about this subject than Senator Penny Wong. On Tuesday, June 23, writing in the Australian, Professor Peter Schwerdtfeger, Emeritus Professor of Meteorology at Flinders University, in Adelaide, reinforced this:
Repeatedly in science we are reminded that happenings in nature can rarely be ascribed to a single phenomenon. For example, sea levels on our coasts are dependent on winds and astronomical forces as well as atmospheric pressure and, on a different time scale, the temperature profile of the ocean. Now, with complete abandon, a vociferous body of claimants is insisting that CO2 alone is the root of climatic evil.
I fear that many supporters of this view have become carried away by the euphoria of mass or dominant group psyche. Scientists are no more immune from being swayed by the pressure of collective enthusiasm than any other member of the human race.
To acknowledge the reality of continuing scientific debate is not to say that Australia should not act in concert with other nations to give the planet the benefit of the doubt and to seek a global agreement to contain CO2 emissions. To the extent that anthropogenic CO2 emissions may be a cause of the limited global warming that has occurred, and to the extent that that warming is considered to be damaging, internationally coordinated measures to contain emissions at the least possible cost may be warranted. Indeed, as someone trained in economics, I proclaim the virtue of an approach based on ensuring the most cost-efficient use of finite resources. The world has not measured up to that standard in relation to its use of energy. But, given the continuing scientific debate, it is especially important that a country like Australia only take steps in relation to CO2 emissions that are in concert with the rest of the world and clearly involve the least cost and most economically efficient means of CO2 containment.
The government’s CPRS clearly fails that test. The case against this scheme was convincingly made by my colleague the member for Goldstein, Mr Robb, in his speech on this bill in the House of Representatives. I also commend the work of my coalition colleagues on the Economics Legislation Committee in their reports on these bills and of Senator Xenophon on his minority report, which is a well-argued condemnation of this CPRS. I should also make mention of the critical analysis of this CPRS undertaken by the Select Committee on Climate Policy, chaired by my colleague Senator Colbeck, which exposed the CPRS’s many, many flaws.
Not enough is made of the reality of Australia’s circumstances in the consideration of measures to contain anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Australia contributes a little over one per cent of the planet’s CO2 emissions. If we were to completely shut down the Australian economy tomorrow, Australia’s CO2 emissions would be fully replaced by China within nine months. It is indisputably the case that nothing Australia does on its own can have any impact whatsoever on the earth’s climate. The deceit perpetrated by climate change fanatics that an Australian ETS will save the Barrier Reef is utterly contemptible. The manic determination of the government to impose this scheme on Australia also ignores the reality of the Australian economy.
Australia’s economy and our higher standard of living have been built upon our access to relatively cheap and abundant supplies of energy generated by coal-fired power stations. This is regrettably not well understood in this parliament let alone in the wider community. It was my privilege to serve as Minister for Industry, Science and Resources for three years in the Howard government, an experience which reinforced this fundamental reality about Australia: all the great manufacturing and value-added industries of Australia, which this Labor government professes a commitment to, have been built on and are sustained by access to cheap, reliable energy derived from coal. That is why an ETS, essentially an energy tax, is such a threat to this country. As Terry McCrann so accurately said in the Australian of 20-21 June:
... an ETS threatens to kill the Australian economy. It is a direct attack on our core comparative advantage: bluntly, the production of CO2.
Power generated from cheap and abundant coal is a, perhaps the, core building block of both our standard of living and our entire economy.
That is a reality which this government wilfully ignores. What we see here is a Labor government sacrificing workers in energy-intensive industries on the altar of green votes. The cruel joke is that all those thousands of jobs to be destroyed by Labor’s CPRS will be in vain, because this scheme will make absolutely no difference to the global climate. Most Australians clearly do not understand what an emissions trading scheme is, how it would work and what its consequences would be. That is perfectly understandable. I suspect most of the Labor caucus has no idea, either. Essentially it will be a very substantial tax on energy, and that is why Labor’s flawed CPRS is such a threat to our economy, dependent as it is on relatively cheap supplies of energy. Hence the utter folly of Australia designing and implementing this scheme ahead of the rest of the world.
Labor’s CPRS is a serious threat to many regional economies and the jobs they support, and I commend Senator Fiona Nash for her eloquent espousal of their cause. In my own state of South Australia it is estimated that it will cost 2,000 jobs by 2020 in the minerals industry alone. As a senator for South Australia, I do not see how I can possibly vote for this legislation, nor do I see how any government senators representing South Australia can vote for it. While the financial capitals of Melbourne and Sydney may relish the creation of a new financial instrument to be traded by 20-something bankers, the people of a state like mine will pay the price in a higher cost of living, in industries and jobs destroyed and in a reduction in competitiveness—all for zero environmental gain.
It is also reprehensible that Labor would seek to legislate this serious attack on the Australian economy at a time when, as Mr Rudd constantly reminds us, we face a very serious set of economic circumstances. Mr Rudd loves to remind us of the seriousness of the so-called GFC and its threat to Australia. Indeed, it is his justification for the most massive explosion in government spending, government deficits and government debt seen since the 1930s. Yet, while talking endlessly about our serious economic situation, he seeks to fit Australia up with a set of concrete boots called his CPRS. As Geoff Carmody, one of Australia’s most eminent economists, wrote in the Financial Review on 23 June this year:
The CPRS is ‘the GST from hell’, delivering negative protection. Why should any country unilaterally tax its exports and effectively subsidise its imports, for no global emissions reduction?
At a time when policy should be wholly directed at maximising the efficiency, productivity and international competitiveness of the Australian economy, Mr Rudd seeks to impose a unilateral massive new tax on Australian industry and consumers which will damage our economy and do nothing to combat global warming. The government’s pursuit of this legislation at this time is nothing more than an act of vanity on the part of Mr Kevin Rudd. This most vain of prime ministers wants to strut the stage at Copenhagen in December with a legislated ETS in his back pocket. He and his government propose to sacrifice Australia’s national interest on the altar of his vain desire for international acclaim from the vast UN bureaucracy being built around climate change policy.
The Australian parliament should not even be considering legislation for an ETS until we know the outcome of the UN’s Copenhagen conference and the US Senate’s consideration of the Waxman-Markey bill. The Australian people agree with this view. An Australian Newspoll conducted on the weekend of 24 to 26 July showed that 53 per cent of Australians wanted their government to either delay the introduction of an emissions trading scheme until after the Copenhagen conference or not introduce an emissions trading scheme at all. On that basis, and for the reasons I have outlined to the Senate tonight, I urge the Senate to reject this package of bills.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2009-08-11,"—I also want to contribute to the debate on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009 and related package of bills. In doing so, I want to first of all put both my credentials and those of my party on the table for that purpose. It has been suggested by senators opposite in this debate that coalition senators are ignorant about climate change, are unsympathetic, do not understand the imperatives facing the world and do not have any affinity with the needs of the environment. I remind all members of the Senate that the party I belong to has a long and proud history of protecting and acting on the needs of the environment. It is the party which introduced Australia’s first pollution control legislation at the state level, the party that ended sandmining on Fraser Island, the party that, a little over a decade ago, set up the world’s first greenhouse agency, the party that ended whaling in this country, the party that introduced a renewable energy development scheme for the first time and the party that sponsored the Global Initiative on Forests and Climate. It is also the party that, over the life of the Howard government, was able to ensure that Australia was one of only five or six countries in the entire world which actually met its Kyoto emissions targets. It was not Spain, Canada, Japan, New Zealand or the United States of America but Australia, under John Howard, that actually did reach those targets.
Personally, I can also claim a commitment to action of that kind. As the Australian Capital Territory Minister for Environment, Land and Planning, in 1997 I travelled to Nagoya in Japan, where, on behalf of the ACT community, I signed the Cities for Climate Protection charter. In doing so, this territory became the first in Australia to sign up to Kyoto-like targets for greenhouse gas reduction. I will inform the Senate what those targets were, because they will make an interesting contrast with the policy of the present federal Rudd Labor government. More than a decade ago, the ACT Liberal government committed to reduce our greenhouse emissions in this territory to 1990 levels by 2008 and then to further reduce those emissions by 20 per cent on 1990 levels by 2018. It was a leadership signal from a territory that has often provided leadership signals in public policy. It was universally applauded by this community at the time, including by the ALP opposition. It put a heavy emphasis on community or householder action in dealing with climate change and it encouraged and stimulated investment in the sorts of things that we would all like to see, such as new green technologies. Incidentally, that commitment was torn up by the present Stanhope Labor government in 2005 and replaced by a much less ambitious greenhouse target.
So the Liberal Party generally are entitled, and certainly I am specifically, to enter this debate with a sense of commitment and understanding of the needs of the environment. I acknowledge that climate change is a key issue for our generation—some would say it is the biggest issue in our generation. It is more than a campaign tagline, more than a bumper sticker and more than an opportunity to argue who is greener than the next person. It is a complex interlacing of science and politics and it deserves all the careful consideration we can muster based on all the available evidence. It deserves detailed analysis of economic and social impacts of various climate change responses and, in all those terms, it deserves bipartisanship.
But we will not see bipartisanship on this issue. The question is: why? The reason is that the Labor government in this debate at this time is committed to not achieving bipartisanship. It is committed to achieving, in fact, conflict on this issue. Why? Because it wants a trigger in its pocket to fight the next election with a double dissolution and the opportunity to make political advantage out of the disagreement in this place on climate change. It sees more political advantage in conflict than it does in consensus.
I want senators to consider some of the features of this debate to illustrate the point I have just made. All the parties in the Senate, other than the government, have expressed serious reservations about the government’s CPRS. It has no supporters, apparently, in this chamber other than the members of the government, and one wonders what some of them privately think about the scheme. The chorus of critics outside the parliament, on the other hand, are legion. Bodies like Greenpeace, the Australian Coal Association, the Wilderness Society, Woodside, Tim Flannery, the Minerals Council and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry are all against the bill. Even the government’s own premier carbon scheme architect, Ross Garnaut, has stepped aside from the bill that has been presented in its current form.
What would you imagine that a government faced with such a difficult position in the Senate and with such opposition from other senators and outside the chamber might do to deal with this legislation, particularly given that it did not go to the last election with a particular form of legislation? It said it would develop its legislation and scheme after it got to government, so there is not even a mandate to rely on. It now has this opposition to its present scheme. You would imagine it would want to negotiate. But the Rudd Labor government is not interested in negotiating on this issue, even given that it has an opposition which is saying that it is willing to support an emissions trading scheme if it is properly designed, which indeed set in train an emissions trading policy when it was in government, which has even now offered to help the government double its emissions target from five per cent to 10 per cent unconditionally. You would think in those circumstances negotiation might be sensible, might be a rational move in favour of getting its legislation through. Yet it has eschewed negotiation as comprehensively as is possible. At every chance it has had the government has branded any mention of alternatives to its Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in its current form as the sabotage by climate change deniers. Instead of taking the extended hand that has been offered by the opposition, Senator Wong, the relevant minister, has said she is not interested in that. Indeed, she plays politics at every opportunity.
I also want senators to note the language that has been used in the course of this debate. I have sat either here or upstairs listening to the contributions of, I think, all of the government senators who have contributed so far to this debate. It is full of references to the blocking of this legislation by the coalition, to the coalition deniers, to the coalition sceptics, to how the coalition is short-sighted, to how the coalition are dinosaurs. Isn’t it interesting that there is no reference in these oft repeated remarks to the position or the bona fides of the crossbenchers, particularly of the Greens? I have heard not one reference in the course of this debate. The reason is very simple. The politics of this debate are not about attacking the Greens or Senators Fielding or Xenophon. The politics are about positioning the coalition for what the government anticipates and hopes, perhaps, is an election around climate change. Deliberately stepping away from constructive negotiations in these circumstances is more than a missed opportunity; it is a disgrace. A world at risk of serious change, I believe, deserves better than that.
I want Australia to take a strong position on climate change. I want us to be in the vanguard of action in this area of policy, and I think we can be. I want a partnership with the Australian people, who have shown such enormous commitment to action on climate change in recent years. And I oppose these bills before the Senate tonight not because they take us too quickly or too far down the path of climate action but because they simply do not do the right things; they simply do not do enough. They are ill-conceived. They are too damaging for the gains that they propose to make. They do not engage the Australian people, individuals and communities enough in the process of change. They are a lost opportunity. They are a political vehicle more than they are a vehicle for action on the environment.
The original listing—and this is a further point to illustrate how politically this government is driving this process—of these bills assumed an implementation date of 2010. We were told categorically that there was a timetable the government wanted to meet and that the timetable was inflexible—it had to be met. Senator Wong said in February this year, when opposing any changes to the government’s timetable for an ETS:
... the longer we delay, the higher the costs. The longer we delay in making this economic transformation, the higher the costs … the Government remains committed to the 2010 start date.
A great deal changed between February and May, when the Prime Minister announced:
... the start date of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will be delayed one year to commence from 1 July 2011.
But, as Senator Minchin has pointed out, there has been no change to the timetabling of this legislation. Despite a further year before it is due to commence, despite the fact that there are important meetings taking place in Europe at the end of this year on these very issues, the government has not budged at all on its original timetable. It still says it has to be passed as soon as possible.
The question is why. The reason is not the requirements of the scheme. It is not that there is some imperative to have the scheme in place by August or September or December of this year. It is that the politics of the electoral cycle make it imperative that the government has its position staked out on the ground as soon as possible.
We know that the government’s timetable is entirely false, based on what the United Nations itself—which is running the conference in Copenhagen—has said about what it is necessary for states taking part in that conference to do before the conference itself. The UN climate office head, Yvo De Boer, was asked recently if it mattered if Australia arrived at Copenhagen in December for the climate change talks without an ETS in place. He responded, ‘Quite honestly, no.’ He went on to say:
What people care about in the international negotiations is the commitment that a government makes to take on a certain target …
Again, in those circumstances, why does the legislation have to be passed right now? Why does a scheme which does not start for two years need to be passed by the Senate at this point in time? The answer is that it is not about climate change and it is not about protecting the environment. That is extremely sad.
The other point which I think is distressing to the point of being tragic is that the government’s approach with this legislation runs the very serious risk of draining the support and enthusiasm of Australians for positive, realistic, effective action on climate change, because it will be very clear to Australians that it is such a blatantly political instrument rather than an effective public policy tool. As Australians, we should have a plan that is based on action by industry, action by major polluters and also action on a community level that allows people to participate and be part of change. It should be a plan that rewards green choices, that provides incentives for research and development in green industries, that promotes green technologies and green jobs and that promises not just a top-layer tax but a shift in thought and action nationwide which results in a new generation of environmentally conscious Australians who are willing to act in an appropriate way. The Leader of the Opposition said this week that we as a nation can be world leaders in this field. I think that is absolutely true, but it does depend on engagement with the Australian people.
What could government do to stimulate that community involvement? It could, for example, offer rebates to Australians to install solar panels. It could fund research and development to improve existing land, water and vegetation management. It could invest in low emission technology. But, of course, we know that in all these areas the government has a track record already—a track record of failure. The solar panel rebate is the most visible example of that. Without ceremony, the $8,000 solar panel rebate was means tested, its effectiveness was reduced, thousands of people who had made plans to install solar panels withdrew those plans because of the new means test and the rebate itself was ultimately and prematurely axed.
In the case of the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program, Minister Peter Garrett emailed solar and wind companies on 22 June this year, three minutes after the program had actually been cut, to advise them of their fate. That program had provided rebates to more than 7,000 installations, with a further 1,100 in the pipeline. It had commenced in 2000 and a total of $300 million had already been invested. It had all made a difference to the environment, but the government decided to axe it. Why? Because its objectives are not about the environment.
We heard in Senate estimates this year about how the government had taken a very successful agency, Land and Water Australia—which had invested in the management of Australia’s land, water and vegetation resources in a way that had produced real dividends for the environment—and simply axed it, despite the very handsome return it had made on management of the environment and control of emissions. The Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund has not being left alone either by the Labor government. The program supported projects such as carbon sequestration into underground aquifers, drying and gasification of coal to reduce electricity generation costs by 30 per cent, carbon by 30 per cent and water consumption by 40 per cent and new solar electricity generation with panels 1,500 times more efficient than is currently the case. The program was cut in 2007, and I really wonder what those opposite hoped to achieve by way of action at the community level to take up those technologies and make a difference.
I think that what we will see with the passage of this legislation, if it becomes effective in Australia, is people seeing higher energy costs, lost jobs, a decline in the viability of many rural industries and a great deal happen that is not good in their communities; but they will not see a difference made to global emissions by virtue of those steps. If they were to see a great deal of pain for not much gain, it would be perfectly understandable for them to say that this was a plan that did not deliver what was promised. Climate change fatigue and cynicism will grow, and that would be, I think, a tragic consequence.
I believe that Australia can and ought to be in the vanguard of action on climate change. I do believe that we need to act and that Australia has a role to play in that. I believe that an effective, strong emissions trading scheme as part of a plan for emissions reduction in this country is possible and achievable on a bipartisan basis.
It is regrettable in the extreme that, because of this government’s determination to use the issue of the environment for other purposes, that is simply not possible. Nonetheless, the coalition is perfectly right in opposing this legislation—in sending a signal to the government that it will not accept its posturing and posing on the environment as a substitute for real policy. We owe Australians more than that. Indeed, that is the decision that we have taken and will carry through with the decision to oppose this legislation tonight in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2009-08-11,"—I also rise to speak tonight on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009 and the associated package of bills that the government has put before us to implement its plan for a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme, commonly referred to as the CPRS. As we are all aware, the end goal in implementing an ETS is to achieve a reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions. And why are we trying to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions? The answer is: because the ‘settled’—and I use that word in quotation marks—science is that anthropogenic, or man-made, CO2 and equivalent gases are increasing in the atmosphere to such an extent that it is affecting our climate and, further, that those effects will have a disastrous consequence for the planet and its future.
When concern about the issue first gained significant public traction some 10 or 15 years ago this phenomenon was called ‘global warming’, because it was argued that it would increase global temperatures. Since then, the label applied to the stated impact of man on the climate has been changed to ‘climate change’. This better allows proponents of the phenomenon to claim any extreme weather event—whether it be a heatwave, heavy snowfall, hurricane, cyclone, severe storm or flood caused by torrential rainfall—to be the direct result of anthropogenic impacts on climate.
As I understand it, the potential impact of man-made CO2 and equivalent gases on the climate was first seriously discussed in scientific circles—and here I admit to not having researched dates thoroughly—in the early 1970s, around the same time as the alternative theory that the gases and pollutants mankind was pumping into the atmosphere was going to form a barrier between the sun and the earth that would bring on the next ice age. And this latter theory is what my first recollection is of arguments about mankind’s impact on climate—having been taught of the ice age concerns by a teacher in around 1978.
Incidentally, I am acquainted with a retired American scientist, Mr Jim Pleasants, who worked at NASA in the US throughout a period including the early 1970s. He rose during his career to senior management level and was responsible for such relevant projects as sending an instrument that measured ozone and aerosols into earth’s orbit. He has told me that there was a heated debate going on at that time by leading scientists in America between those who argued mankind’s activities would heat the earth and those who argued it would cool it. Their main concern was that unless they took a united front they would look foolish and find it harder to attract research funding. As such—and, I am told that Mr Pleasants was present when this occurred—this group of leading international scientists flipped a coin to decide what impact they would pursue. And, of course, the coin came down on warming.
According to my acquaintance, that coin flip, which he says occurred in around 1972, was the start of the global warming movement. Since those days, that movement has very effectively developed from an issue debated and considered only by a small group of scientists to a much broader and wider issue that concerns many people worldwide. The public relations around the issue have been very effective. Claims of loss of natural features such as the Great Barrier Reef, sea-level rises of up to 100 metres, the timely coincidence of extreme weather occurrences such as hurricanes, droughts and heatwave-induced bushfires—despite the fact that all of these occurred regularly, and usually more severely, in the past—and of course the extinction of polar bears, have proven very effective in convincing well-meaning and caring people of the need for action.
And there is no doubt that millions of people around the world, despite having no actual knowledge or understanding of the science upon which the movement is based, now faithfully accept as fact that mankind’s activities are affecting the climate in a manner that will have disastrous consequences for the planet, its peoples and its environment. And my use of the word ‘faithfully’ was quite deliberate. The sad reality is that the movement has taken on what cannot be seen to be anything other than a religious quality—a status that categorises everyone as a ‘believer’, a ‘sceptic’ or, even worse, a ‘denier’.
Anyone who dares to question the assumptions upon which the phenomenon is based is immediately ridiculed and his or her academic credentials, intelligence, gullibility and motive are immediately called into question. Worse, such sceptics and deniers are also belittled and blamed for not accepting that we have to make huge changes—changes that will come at great human cost—for the common good of the planet. Effectively, they are accused of heresy. One only has to look at the behaviour of the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, in this place, when anyone dares question the assumptions upon which the need to implement these bills are based. There is no doubt that she approaches such heretical behaviour as if she were the high priestess of the religion, with a sworn duty to seek out and expose nonbelievers: those who would undermine the faith—those dastardly sceptics and deniers!
Even today she employed this tactic, naming Senator Bernardi at least four or five times. If she were allowed to, I suspect she would like to burn at the stake all who dare question the truth of the science behind climate change. However, despite the religious fervour demonstrated by many campaigners for climate change action, and the fact that most people who are concerned about climate change have that concern without the scientific expertise to fully analyse the facts—meaning that they essentially take it on faith—it is also apparent that there is a seemingly strong acceptance of this phenomenon by many, if not most, in the scientific community. These are people who one would expect might have the knowledge and understanding of the science to fully inform their decision to accept the phenomenon and its associated threats as real and imminent. But the fact remains that not everybody accepts this as fact. And the really interesting thing to me is the large number of prominent and impeccably credentialed scientists who have raised issues and concerns—very relevant and strong issues and concerns—about the science upon which most, if not all, of the assumptions about man-made climate change are based.
I am not a climate scientist. Despite completing first year physics and chemistry at uni I do not even claim to be a scientist. As such, I readily acknowledge that I do not have the expertise, knowledge and capacity to satisfy myself, through scientific inquiry and experimentation, that this science—the science upon which the assumptions of man-made climate change are based—is in any way proven in a scientific sense. As such, I have no choice but to rely on the recommendations and comments of those who do have that expertise, knowledge and capacity to make such inquiry.
As mentioned, the weight of scientific support seems to back the believers. Given the huge research industry that has developed around climate change, a cynic would suggest that this is not surprising. But, regardless of why it appears most scientists support the man-made climate change issue, I am greatly concerned by the large number of very prominent scientists who fall in the category of what many would call deniers—people like Emeritus Professor Garth Paltridge, an atmospheric physicist who was a chief research scientist with the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research before taking up positions in Tasmania as Director of the Institute of Antarctic and Southern Ocean Studies and CEO of the Antarctic Cooperative Research Centre. His specialty is fluid earth sciences, climate and Antarctica—a field highly relevant to the very issue underlying these bills. Yet, using this very expertise and the skills acquired over a lifetime of research and study in the fields of science so relevant to the issue, he queries the scientific evidence upon which claims of man-made climate change are based.
The science I did do at uni and before that taught me that all scientific theories are just that—theories. They stand to be proven or disproven on the basis of the evidence and stand on the basis of the evidence. I stand to be corrected, but belief in a concept did not come into any aspect of scientific research or theory. Given the fact that so many scientists, like Professor Paltridge, have concerns about the actual science behind climate change and raise real issues about the verifiable evidence that is used to back that science, I have no choice but to refuse to believe what I am told is truth and to declare myself a ‘sceptic’ when it comes to the issue of mankind’s impact on the climate. This does not mean that I am a denier, as such—again, I acknowledge that I do not have the skills to assess the issue myself at a scientific level. What it does mean is that I do not accept that the science is in on climate change. Although not commonly used as such these days, to be considered a sceptic was a compliment once, when people used it in the sense of the ancient Greek sceptics movement—one where people refused to merely accept what they were told and actively questioned, tested and sought evidence to prove or disprove statements and beliefs.
Madam Acting Deputy President, you might ask what this means about my thoughts on the need for action to address climate change, such as that major action included in these bills. You may be surprised to hear that I am accepting of the need for action. This is due to the advisability of prudent and sensible risk management. As mentioned, I do not know whether man-made climate change is real or not but, despite having real doubts, I think it is in everyone’s interest to take action that increases efficiency, reduces pollution and recognises the finite resources of the planet—particularly if, in doing so, any risk of real consequences of man-made climate change are minimised. However, I do not accept that we should as a nation take action that will undermine our national interests or those of Australians, particularly if that action is unlikely to deliver any actual benefits, whether to the environment in general or more specifically in reducing global emissions of CO2 and equivalent gases.
There are plenty of options open to the Australian government that will achieve positive environmental outcomes, regardless of the issue of climate change, without threatening the economic and social welfare of Australians. The coalition and Senator Xenophon’s release yesterday of research commissioned from Frontier Economics provides one such alternative emissions trading scheme. As noted by shadow minister Andrew Robb, this research proves the Rudd government’s scheme will unnecessarily drive up electricity prices, destroy jobs and expand the size of government in Australia, while doing little about actual emissions.
The modelling was conducted using the same model and basic parameters as the government’s own modelling. The results show that this alternative approach would provide for a greener, cheaper and smarter ETS—greener because of a doubling of the target; cheaper because it will be 40 per cent cheaper than the government’s scheme, a $49 billion saving to our economy over the next 20 years; and smarter because it will ensure that there are more jobs, more Australians in work, with higher wages, particularly in regional Australia. The Frontier research shows that, with the right model, a logical and well-planned ETS can deliver an unconditional 10 per cent reduction in Australia’s 2000 greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, compared to the Rudd government’s five per cent unconditional target; wind back average household electricity price rises from the $280 under the current legislation to just $44 in the near term; and have a net gain in employment in regional Australia of 70,000 jobs, compared to the government’s scheme.
Importantly, this research also gives certainty to Australia’s agricultural sector, by leaving it out of the cap while providing an opportunity for it to be rewarded by generating carbon offsets. Lower electricity prices will also greatly reduce the indirect costs of the government’s ETS that would be faced by hundreds of thousands of small businesses. For example, under the CPRS, a typical dairy farm would face extra costs of $8,000 to $10,000 per year. Under Frontier’s proposals, this would be reduced by 80 to 90 per cent. Separately, the coalition has also committed itself to a doubling of the compensation for loss of asset value proposed for the electricity generators, from $4 billion to $8 billion—and up to $10 billion. This will provide the capacity for this sector to invest in low-emissions technology and see a rapid reduction in their carbon footprint. The generator sector contributes 50 per cent of all emissions.
I have been a part of a number of inquiries looking into the proposed legislation as contained in these bills through my membership on the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy and the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, and I can tell you, on the basis of those inquiries, that the overwhelming body of evidence on the government’s CPRS shows that it will not effectively achieve its aim of reducing global greenhouse emissions, particularly when it is generally acknowledged that a global response would be required to achieve such a thing. In that regard, we have seen no evidence that an international agreement is imminent, nor is it at all likely that the great number of our main trade competitors will assume a price on carbon. And it is clear on any objective analysis that the CPRS, adopted without an international agreement to prevent carbon leakage, would have exactly the opposite impact of that intended and would simply shift emissions generation from those nations assuming a price on carbon to those without such a price—effectively adversely impacting upon the ultimate goal of reducing global greenhouse emissions.
Professor Warwick McKibbin, widely respected economist, academic and member of the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia, stated:
The problem is that the environmental effectiveness is not an Australian issue, it is a global issue, but the cost is an Australian issue … We need a system where the global outcome environmentally is beneficial, and us cutting with no one else cutting does not deliver anything.
There seems to be strong acceptance of the fact that the likely outcome of implementing the CPRS in its current form is that Australia would suffer severe economic consequences and job losses, without providing any notable reduction in global emissions.
Given the likely absence of a global consensus on reducing emissions, it becomes important to understand the effects on Australia of going it alone, as it were. Under questioning, the Department of Climate Change has admitted that the government has not clearly enunciated the degree to which, or method by which, the proposed CPRS will actually contribute to a global emissions reduction. This lack of global focus in the CPRS exposes Australia to some severe flow-on effects in terms of Australian jobs and the economy.
As mentioned, there is much evidence to suggest that it is almost certain that many of our employers and industries will move their operations offshore in the absence of comparative emissions abatement schemes in our competitor countries—not to maximise their profits, as some on the other side might say, but to remain competitive with their competitors in countries that are not saddled with crippling carbon costs as part of a flawed ETS, not to mention the restrictive and uncompetitive IR laws they are now again saddled with! And, in many cases, the option of shifting offshore will not be viable or attractive, and the comparative disadvantage that Australian businesses will be shackled with will mean that Australian businesses will simply have to shut their doors as they find they can no longer compete or downsize, or they will have to cancel future expansion plans.
In each of those scenarios, not only would there be a highly adverse effect on the Australian economy and on jobs but there would almost certainly be an increase in emissions offshore—carbon leakage. And, given that Australian industry is often world’s best practice in terms of emissions, the production of goods outside Australia will likely be at a higher emission cost per unit than the equivalent production in Australia—again, not a desirable outcome. Professor Anthony Owen, from Curtin University of Technology, clearly explains carbon leakage with respect to the Australian situation. He said:
I do not think Australia, with such a small percentage of the world’s emissions, can really dominate … It is really up to the international community and, in particular, the world’s large emitters to come forward with a policy which addresses that issue. It is a serious issue, of course, leakage. If Australia drives offshore some of its energy-intensive industries, they may well create more emissions offshore than they would have with the same output in Australia.
Under questioning by the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy, Mr Noel Cornish, chief executive of BlueScope Steel, stated that ‘we would see the loss of manufacturing industry and the loss of jobs in Australia for no global greenhouse gas improvement.’ The suggestion has even been made that it may actually be more efficient in a greenhouse-gas emission context for government to actively seek an expansion of emissions-intensive industries in Australia, as our industries and energy production operate at a generally more efficient level than many other countries, thereby reducing overall global emissions of CO2 and equivalent gases. The reality of this suggestion is pretty hard to argue against but totally contrary to the direction that the government is taking.
A key characteristic of our economy is that many of our businesses will face much difficulty passing on to their customers additional costs imposed by an ETS. This is due to the small size and degree of openness of our economy, which means many of our industries are price takers, both in terms of their inputs and their outputs, and cannot pass on the costs of the CPRS to their customers. We are price-takers in the steel, coal and aluminium industries. The CPRS in its current form would see significant reductions in competitiveness and threaten the viability of some operations. But it is not just our industries with import and export exposure that face considerable financial hardships under the proposed CPRS. Australia’s electricity generators will be significantly disadvantaged under the proposed scheme, and this is particularly so due to the lack of smooth transition arrangements provided for by the scheme.
A fact that can hardly be missed at present is that we are in the middle of a global financial crisis. Despite the significant effects of this global financial crisis it would seem that the government failed to take into account the changed global economic environment when designing its CPRS or modelling its economic impact. Treasury officials have confirmed time and again that no modelling was done on the impact of the global turmoil on the projections for the impacts of the CPRS. Given the current model’s inflexibility and design flaws that render it completely ineffective in adjusting to unexpected or abrupt changes in the economy, the government’s proposed CPRS will further exacerbate this trend. With our economy delicately poised and skating around recession, the timing could not be worse. Some of our major industries will face costs that they are unable to pass on at a time when we simply cannot afford it.
Before the election then opposition leader Kevin Rudd made several promises in respect of climate change and how he proposed to deal with it. He made a promise to establish an ETS. He promised that this ETS would generate deep cuts in global greenhouse emissions. He promised that this would occur in such a way that Australia’s export and import competing industries would not be disadvantaged. The promised scheme is now in a state of total and utter chaos. It constitutes an ill-considered attempt to meet a tokenistic deadline and fails miserably to provide measures that will actually achieve any of its hastily promised and politically motivated goals. The promise of making deep cuts in global greenhouse emissions will not be met by this CPRS. The promise of protecting our trade exposed industries will not be met by this CPRS. In fact, all that will be achieved by this CPRS are job losses, economic destruction and the exporting of our emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries overseas, most probably to countries with lower, if any, environmental standards—which will ultimately mean an increase in global greenhouse emissions. Australia deserves better.
As I noted when I started, I am not convinced that the sky is falling as a result of mankind’s impact on climate. But I also consider that there is a lot to be gained through adopting cleaner, more efficient and sustainable ways of generating electricity. But the CPRS will not achieve this outcome.

",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-08-11,"—A lot has been said about the government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—by the government, by the opposition, by the Greens, by the crossbenchers, by environment groups, by industry and by regular voters who just want Australia to play its part in finding a solution to this global crisis. The details can seem complex, but I think there are some simple truths that virtually all of us can agree on. Anthropogenic climate change presents us with the most pressing and complex policy problem that we have ever faced. I believe that the environmental debate is over. The time for action was some time ago. We need to act and we need to get this right. There is a great urgency in relation to this. For those who are climate change sceptics, who are doubters, who say the science does not stack up, I say: at least from a risk point of view, consider the evidence of literally thousands of climate change scientists who say we need to act on this. If we get this wrong, if the climate change sceptics are wrong, are they willing to literally bet the planet that they are right and thousands of climate change scientists are wrong? I think that is the key to this. My plea to Senator Joyce, whom I regard as a friend and colleague, is to look at the risk factors, look at this as an issue of managing risk. If you are doubtful about the science, at least look at the whole issue of managing this very significant risk, because there is no going back if we get this wrong.
I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Australian Greens. I know that I may not see eye to eye with them on the best way to address global warming, in all respect to the Greens. But one thing that needs to be acknowledged is that the Greens have led the way on this issue. They were the canaries in the coal mine, if you will, warning us that global warming will end up seeing us all fall off our perches unless we act. For many years, the Australian Greens and the environment movement have made a serious contribution to focusing all our attention on this looming crisis. This crisis is pressing because the window of opportunity we have in which to take the sort of abatement action needed to avoid irreversible dangerous and potentially catastrophic climate change is small. On the basis of the findings of the March 2009 conference in Copenhagen, the window of opportunity is getting even smaller.
This issue is complex, because it has all the features that policy, whether at a global or national level, usually struggles to deal with. According to Lord Anthony Giddens, the former Director of the London School of Economics and former adviser to President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair, there exists what is called the Giddens paradox, where we ought to act on an issue such as climate change but somehow we are paralysed because global warming is something that is not seen as tangible enough. Recently, Lord Giddens was interviewed on the BBC. What he said is pertinent to today’s debate. Lord Giddens said that climate change is a completely different political issue from any that we have ever had to face before, because it is about catastrophic risk. But most of that risk is in the future. It is not visible in people’s day-to-day lives. Hence, most ordinary citizens get on with their day-to-day lives and push it to the side as a potential threat. He said: ‘It’s a paradox, because if we wait until it does become visible, if we wait until there are enormous shifts in weather patterns which are really threatening, it is too late by then to do anything about it, because unlike other issues once the emissions are in the air we know of no way of getting them out of there and they are likely to be there for centuries.’
Abatement has large upfront costs with benefits that accrue in the relatively distant future and with some degree of uncertainty. A solution also requires attention to the development aspirations of poorer countries and the emission trajectories that will result. Recently, I spoke to my friend and mentor Tim Costello, the CEO of World Vision. He was recently in Africa and met with the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, who is very concerned about issues of abatement, which I will speak to later. But the fact is that developing countries are bearing the brunt of climate change. They are already seeing the effects of climate change. Developing countries need to be part of a global solution and Australia needs to play a leadership role in relation to that. There is a concern that those who do nothing will still benefit from the actions of those who do a lot. If we are not careful, we could end up creating an environment that favours what Professor Garnaut describes as ‘free riders’.
All these factors need to be considered as we choose the right design for an emissions trading scheme. In a country like Australia, which has a small, open economy, we cannot assume that what works in certain other parts of the world will work here. We need to have a scheme that works for our economy and our environment. It makes sense from a legislative and ethical point of view that Australia takes an early lead in emissions reduction in order to break the potential international deadlock and motivate other nations to also play their part. Australia has a real role to show leadership, particularly in our region.
In taking such action, Australia needs to adopt a scheme that is credible internationally and sustainable domestically. It is important to lead by example, but it is also important that we set a good example. If we choose the wrong scheme and irrevocably damage the economy or do not save the environment, or both, we will serve as an excuse for other nations not to act. That is why we must get this right. International credibility will be to a large extent a function of the abatement targets Australia sets for itself and the way we achieve those targets. Clearly, the overarching goal is environmental: the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Abatement is the significant key to this and will fundamentally be investment driven.
We also properly need to address adjustment or adaptation issues. In relation to that, it is fair to say that the green and white papers have neglected this issue. I do not believe that there is any mention in either the green or the white paper about the issue of adaptation. The adaptation story is vital for two reasons. Firstly, a lot of climate change is already locked in through the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The effects of it are real. One of the reasons why the Murray-Darling Basin is in crisis is climate change. That is real; we are seeing the effects of that now. Those communities are at the forefront of that. The Lower Lakes are seeing the effect of that; the Coorong is seeing the effect of that. We need to act.
Secondly, even assuming a global agreement on reduction that makes significant cuts to greenhouse gases, there will still be some residual climate change, given that it is almost inevitable that sea temperatures could rise by two degrees. That creates an adaptation in the longer run. I believe that much more attention needs to be given in any policy—if it is to be effective—to the issue of adaptation. It is simply not good enough for the states to have this responsibility. There is nothing wrong with the states dealing with adaptation issues, but we need to have a federal approach. An approach where adaptation is tackled federally is the right approach. Leaving it to the states would not provide an approach that is comprehensive or cohesive enough and would ignore the fact that climate change knows no state or indeed international borders. Water management is an obvious example of that. That is why, with respect to climate change, much more needs to be done in respect of adaptation. I look forward to the government’s response in relation to that. It is a real issue of concern that needs to be progressed in this debate.
In terms of the economy, we need to be able to afford this. We need to have a credible economic scheme to reduce greenhouse gases. If the government wants the economy to grow and grow green, it has to ensure that business is given certainty and is able to access the resources needed to change its ways. The government also has to take seriously the issue of carbon leakage. We need to ensure that Australian industry is not unfairly disadvantaged. As Senator Bushby mentioned in his contribution previously, we do not want to see carbon leakage to countries that just do not care and where there will be even more emissions for the same amount of output. What is wrong with the government’s CPRS and the broader government approach? I note that the Minister for Climate Change and Water referred to the Frontier scheme outlined yesterday as a ‘mongrel’. I think that this ‘mongrel’ has a lot of fight in it, and I have to say that, if the government’s CPRS were a dog, the only merciful thing to do would be to have it put down.
An unconditional cut of five per cent is ridiculously low. Given the punitive structure of the government’s scheme, aiming for five per cent will cause a lot of pain for no real environmental outcome. There are also real problems with many of the assumptions the government has made when modelling the scheme. For one thing, it assumes that job seekers are so mobile that retrenched workers in the Pilbara or in Newcastle will be able to become, for instance, insurance agents in Melbourne or Sydney overnight. It would be a nice world to live in but it is clearly not the world we live in. This is not a criticism as such of the government’s economic modelling. In fact the Frontier model used the same modellers as the government in relation to this. It is all about making the transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy, but you need to smooth it out and get it right otherwise you will cause short, sharp shocks to the economy. Also, there will be a huge dislocation in regional communities. That is what the Frontier modelling has shown.
The Frontier modelling has also shown that there is a better way forward in terms of getting more significant abatements. My concern is that the government has portrayed its CPRS almost as pure cap and trade. But it is not. You could say that there is a bit of mongrel in that scheme on the basis that there are gateways, concessions and compensation because of the huge increases in the price of electricity for consumers and significant revenue churn, and also because emissions-intensive export industries get compensation, which, in a way, goes against pure cap and trade. I believe that it is unnecessarily brutal on the economy with little to show for it in terms of the sorts of cuts that we need to aim for.
For these reasons I, along with the coalition, commissioned the leading economics firm, Frontier Economics, to test the government’s model and suggest alternative approaches. I note that Senator Feeney earlier today wondered whether I would become a Liberal because of my cooperation with the coalition. I can indicate that in my first speech I actually made reference to the fact that in my misspent youth I was a member of the Liberal Club at Adelaide University. I put my involvement with them down to a youthful indiscretion and I do not have any plans of rejoining the Liberal Party or indeed any political party; it was too traumatic an experience for me back then.
Frontier knows a lot about this kind of economic modelling. Danny Price, as managing director, and his team were responsible for creating the world’s first mandatory emissions trading scheme in the form of the GGAS scheme for the Carr Labor government in New South Wales in 1999. That was a scheme where their brief was quite limited; it was simply a baseline and credit scheme. It was all carrot and no stick, if you want to put it in those terms. The scheme was very effective in reducing emissions given, I think, a constrained brief in terms of what they had to work with, but it was an emissions trading scheme nonetheless. It worked and it was effective, and these people know what they are talking about. Frontier have worked for governments of both persuasions and for NGOs. They have worked internationally and they know their stuff, particularly in relation to electricity generation. That is why this scheme needs to be looked at seriously by the government. This scheme delivers unconditional carbon-emission cuts of 10 per cent on 2000 levels compared to the government’s unconditional five per cent cut, and there is plenty of scope for even deeper cuts, especially when effective global agreement is reached. The modelling also saves the economy $49 billion in gross domestic product over 20 years in real terms, and that is a significant amount. It also creates higher job growth, especially in regional areas, compared to the government’s scheme, where you would see that significant dislocation in regional communities. That is something that needs to be avoided at all costs, because for those regional communities, whether it is Geelong or Newcastle or South Australia’s iron triangle, it would be a regional disaster. If we are talking in the vicinity of 10,000 jobs, and that is one of the figures that the modelling has indicated, taking 10,000 jobs out of any of those regions would be a disaster. Even if it were one or two thousand jobs it would have a significant effect; it would dislocate so much.
The Frontier scheme also achieves low rises in retail electricity prices of five to 10 per cent compared to the 40 to 50 per cent expected under the government’s plan, so you will not need the compensation. You will have a situation where you do not have the revenue churn that you would have with the government’s scheme. By using a baseline of intensity you do not have that churn, you do not have the economic distortions and you do not have the economic inefficiencies that arise in terms of both the direct and the indirect costs.
Let us also look at the whole issue of electricity, which is responsible for over 40 per cent of emissions. If you consider the massive price increases we will get under the government’s CPRS, you will have a situation where households will be compensated, as the government indicates, despite how inefficient that could be. You will not need that level of compensation if you go down the Frontier path. If you have a situation where there will be literally tens or hundreds of thousands of small and medium businesses in this country facing massive increases in their electricity, it will affect production and it will affect job growth. It will be a kick in the guts to every small, medium and large business in this country. Also, under the Frontier scheme the agricultural sector is protected through exclusion, bringing it in line with the American and European schemes. There is also an opportunity for rural producers to make off-farm income through carbon offsets, and that is very important. Put simply, the scheme is greener, cheaper and smarter.
I am disappointed that the initial response from the government was to knock this on the head. The Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change, Greg Combet, attempted to mock the Frontier modelling yesterday without actually having seen it. The government—and in particular the minister, Senator Wong—was equally confused when it equated the plan with one proposed in Canada, when even a cursory reading of the modelling would have shown that it is not a replica of the Canadian scheme and has in fact moved way beyond that, because it actually has hard caps and it takes into account some of the concerns that were expressed earlier by the government in the discussions and commentary in relation to the Canadian scheme. Another member of the government described it as a magic pudding. How can you possibly say that it is a magic pudding when you won’t even look at the ingredients?
I do note that the Greens are concerned about this, but they have indicated that this scheme goes for a higher cap than the government’s scheme. I actually think we need to go for higher caps. We need to listen to the scientists and go to 450 parts per million, or even below, by 2050; 350 million parts per million seems to be the growing scientific consensus in order to mitigate or avoid the disastrous consequences of climate change.
My concern is that we need to have the transition. My plea to my colleagues on both sides of the chamber and to my cross-bench colleagues, the Greens, is that we need to have that transition. There will still be coal power for a number of years but let us have cogeneration with gas. Let us fast-track renewables. Let us have incentives in place, which I believe we can have with the Frontier scheme, for investment certainty. If you want the transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy, it will involve billions and billions of dollars worth of investment. I believe that unless there is consensus and bipartisan support in this parliament you will not get that investment certainty. This goes beyond one, two or even three election cycles because you need to lock in that degree of investment certainty for the massive transformation the economy will need. If we ignore that, then we face real problems with energy security. My fear is that if we ignore the risks involved, if we ignore the fact that we do need to have that energy security until we get the renewables on stream—the base load renewables such as geothermal—in the years to come, we will have a massive public backlash because people will not want their lights to go out, they will not want their refrigerators and air conditioners to stop working. These are the things we need to consider.
We need to reward good behaviour and punish bad behaviour and to create a change in behaviour. That is the beauty of the Frontier scheme. I think we all need to pull our heads in on this; we all need to start thinking about the world and stop thinking about the world of politics. We need consensus because if we do not get that consensus, we will all pay. If the economy is to grow, and grow green, it will need massive amounts of new investment in new technologies. This will not happen unless the economic environment is stable.
I cannot support this scheme in its current form. I will not be supporting the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009, but I think it is important that we continue to talk between now and when this bill comes back—presumably in November. I have confidence that Senator Wong is the best and most capable minister to shepherd this legislation through the parliament for the government. I also believe that we need to have that consensus bipartisan approach in order to deal with the most fundamental policy and economic issue this nation has ever faced.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2009-08-11,"—I stand tonight to place on record my opposition to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009 and related bills and to make a few brief comments about the reasons why.
Senator Xenophon has just noted that this is one of the most impacting pieces of legislation ever to come before the Australian parliament. The legislation is effectively a tax on good and services and it is to reflect the damage done from CO2 emissions and its effect on our environment. But the ETS and the legislation before us is poorly framed and it is too important to rush. The government is rushing this legislation for political purposes, and, I believe, inappropriate reasons are at the heart of the government’s objectives in regard to these bills. We must get this legislation right; it is too important not to. The timing is critical. Here we are, in August, debating this legislation and the government wants it passed and rushed through, yet the largest economy in the world, the United States, still has not passed its similar ETS legislation, and nor have we had the Copenhagen climate conference, which is scheduled for later this year. Why would we be leading the world in such a way with the fear that we might get it wrong? We must get it right.
I quote from the executive summary of the Frontier Economics report that was released just yesterday:
In terms of the breadth and magnitude of economic effects, the CPRS is arguably the most significant policy change in Australia’s history. As such there is a substantial onus on the Government to demonstrate that whatever policy is introduced it is the best that can be developed.
We know, not only from the Frontier Economics report but also from numerous other commentators and experts in the field, that the government has not got it right. Let me say at the outset that I am not an expert, I do not have the background or expertise in science, but I have read the various papers and reports about these matters and I base my views on those and on my own experiences as a Tasmanian senator. I also note that the opposition supports a properly framed and carefully put together emissions trading scheme and other measures to ensure that the consequences and damage to our environment of the CO2 emissions is taken into account. I will come to those shortly.
It should be noted that it was actually the Howard government that first introduced the emissions trading scheme—in fact, under the former minister, Malcolm Turnbull. Mr Turnbull should be commended for his foresight and vision, as he has been demonstrating in more recent times regarding this matter. In terms of renewable energy of course, we remember the initiative and the leadership of Dr David Kemp, the former minister for the environment, who together with the Howard cabinet, put together the mandatory renewable energy target, which was some 9,500 gigawatt hours by 2010, which essentially was an initiative to encourage renewable energy. It really kick-started the various renewable energy initiatives all around Australia.
As a Tasmanian senator, I know only too well the importance of hydropower and wind power and other senators know the importance of renewable energy more generally, whether it be solar or whatever. So why isn’t the government willing to sit down to negotiate, to consult and to discuss with the opposition and indeed others their contributions to get it right? Clearly, the government has not got it right and I think it demonstrates hubris and arrogance on the part of the government that it is willing to insist that this be an express effort that must be rushed through. It wants to ram this legislation through the Senate and through the parliament when it should really do the right thing: withdraw the legislation and work with the opposition and with experts in the field to ensure that we get it right and that the timing is correct so that the contributions of the Copenhagen climate change conference can be taken into account.
I also note that the government has floated the idea of a double dissolution, with threats as to the possibility of that. I am not afraid of that. I say to the government over this issue to bring it on, because we know that the government’s legislation will increase power costs for the average Australian family and for small businesses and large businesses alike. This will be a jobs destroyer for Australia. In fact, this will be less green and will provide fewer benefits as to the environment than other models that have been drafted and put forward. So the government has got to pull back and get this legislation right.
There are three parts to addressing the concerns. Obviously, there is the emissions trading scheme, the renewable energy measure—a 20 per cent measure by 2020—needs to come into place and there are energy efficiency measures. They are three key broad initiatives that need to be undertaken by any government and any community to ensure that we get this right. The Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Penny Wong, said the Frontier Economics report was a mongrel of a report. That is a shocking overreaction from a minister.
—She hadn’t even read it.
—I accept that, Senator Ronaldson. We know that her reaction was inappropriate. What sort of behaviour was that? Does she demonstrate any shred of credibility in her role as the relevant minister? That was a shocking overreaction, and I call her to account and to think again without being so abusive and without being on her political high horse in behaving in such a way. We know from the report that was tabled yesterday and that is now in the public arena that the ETS will add a cost to as many goods and services as possible to reflect the damage that greenhouse gases are doing to the environment. The report that Frontier Economics put out noted that the Rudd government’s ETS will unnecessarily drive up electricity prices, destroy jobs and expand the size of government. The report shows that the scheme can actually be made twice as green at a much lower cost to consumers and the broader economy with a net improvement of 68,000 in regional jobs. That is a fantastic outcome. In short, it is greener, cheaper and smarter.
So what else does it say? It treats the electricity generating sector in a less punitive manner, whereby household power bills need rise by only about five per cent in the near term, rather than by the immediate 25 per cent that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, put forward by the Rudd Labor government, would trigger. We know that households in Tasmania have recently, as of 1 July, been copped with a 15 per cent increase in power bills. This is exactly what they do not want at this time. Five years into the scheme average annual household power bills would only be $45 higher, rather $280 higher under the government’s CPRS. That needs to be taken into account. Rather than the loss of 26,000 regional jobs revealed by modelling of the CPRS, the changes proposed by Frontier Economics would lead to a net gain of 42,000 in regional Australian employment and overall the cost to the Australian economy over the next 20 years in net present value terms would be reduced by $49 billion, or about a third. That would certainly be a good outcome; that is for sure. As I have said, the power costs issue is very important in Tasmania. This is a very sensitive issue right now. Households are copping it in the neck as a result of Labor’s management—or mismanagement—of the economy in the state of Tasmania.
I have mentioned Mr Turnbull. I also want to commend Andrew Robb, our relevant shadow minister on this matter. He is quoted as saying that the lower electricity prices would also greatly reduce the indirect costs of the government’s ETS, which would be faced by hundreds of thousands of small and mid-sized businesses. We know how important that is for Tasmania, as we are a small business state with over 35,000 small businesses and with nearly 50 per cent of the private sector workforce being in the small business sector. We know that these businesses are copping it in the neck at the moment and are on struggle street. This is exactly the wrong time and this is the wrong type of policy being put forward by the Rudd Labor government, and it is going to hurt them. We do not want that to happen.
In terms of agriculture, I turn to a point that I know Senator Heffernan and Senator Cormann and others in this place who are concerned for rural and regional Australia and the agricultural community in general are very concerned about. It is that agriculture needs to be taken into account. For example, Mr Robb said in a contribution that under the CPRS a typical dairy farm would face an extra cost of $8,000 to $10,000 per year. That is a huge cost on a dairy farmer and his or her family. Under the proposals of Frontier Economics, this would be reduced by 90 per cent. The coalition policy supports a doubling of the compensation proposed for electricity generators from $4 billion to $8 billion to $10 billion in order to provide greater fairness and investment certainty for firms in this industry.
At this point I just want to say there are a number of major employer groups in Tasmania that are very important in my community. Rio Tinto, for example, is one of those. Under the CPRS in the first decade there would be an additional cost of $80 million, a permit decay of $60 million and, as a result of the renewable energy target, a $70 million cost. So $210 million would come off the aluminium smelter’s bottom line. It is very hard for an industry like that, like Rio Tinto, to pass that on to their customers. In fact, it is nigh on impossible. So what are they going to do? They will have to cut back in other areas, whether it be employment, social investment, capital investment or other operating expenditure.
But with any renewable energy target, which certainly I strongly support, a true 90 per cent exemption would enable the resource sector to sustain employment and wealth generation and the government to facilitate growth and development in that sector. In Tasmania, that is critical. The renewable energy sector is vitally important. Nearly 100 per cent of our energy comes from hydro, comes from wind. We are very proud of that in Tasmania and we want to ensure that it prospers and grows. I recently met with Alex Beckett of Hydro Tasmania and had an excellent briefing with him, and I appreciate that very much. What we do know is that under the government’s proposal, industries such as Rio Tinto, TEMCO and Nyrstar—which are export-oriented industries—will go offshore. They will set up and operate in China or India, and the consequences will be very serious.
I draw to the Senate’s attention A socioeconomic analysis of selected MEG industries’ contribution to the Tasmanian economy, a report written by Dr Bruce Felmingham, a well-regarded economist. If five of those Major Employers Group industries disappeared the economic impacts would be very serious indeed. The report says:
The withdrawal of the MEG 5 would reduce the output of Tasmanian industry by $3.638 billion annually.
Their withdrawal will reduce Tasmania’s GSP by $1.802 billion or 12% of its real income.
Withdrawal would lead to a fall in the annual wage income of $479.58 million.
The job loss amounts to 7,035 fte positions.
The cost to social wellbeing is astronomical. So there are consequences of this type of legislation, and we need to take those into account. The opposition’s policy, or at least the Frontier Economics report, has put forward some very sensible contributions and I hope those are taken into account. We need to support business, large and small, and investor confidence—and that needs to come back and fast.
In terms of renewable energy, yes, Tasmania does have it. Indeed, Hydro Tasmania are the largest generator of renewable energy in Australia. Hydro own and operate throughout Tasmania 29 hydro power stations worth $4.8 billion. They have a number of renewable energy projects through their wind development, the Roaring 40s. It is a joint venture company between Hydro Tasmania and China Light and Power. Tomorrow I will meet with Matthew Groom of Roaring 40s for a briefing with respect to some of their concerns and to provide encouragement to proceed with their renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. It is something that I support, and I know others do too. But we need to decouple that legislation from the package of legislation before us so that they can get on and invest, develop and prosper, whether it be through hydro upgrades and development or wind farms. In Musselroe Bay, in north-east Tasmania, in the electorate of Bass, what is the local member doing to support that development? I have not heard much, and the community has not heard much. We need a proactive representation on the part of the federal member for Bass and all members of parliament to support these types of development. They have developments at Woolnorth and Cathedral Rocks, with wind farms totalling 206 megawatts through the Roaring 40s. They have a lot of good things happening, and we need to make that 20 per cent target by 2020 and achieve that as soon as possible.
I have mentioned that the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target started under the Howard government, and that was an incentive for Hydro to invest in the way that it has. Since 2002 Hydro Tasmania has spent approximately $180 million on those various initiatives. With respect to new wind energy projects stemming from Hydro Tasmania’s 50 per cent owned Roaring 40s, that includes over 500 megawatts already in operation and under development and a total construction pipeline of 1,000 to 1,500 megawatts potentially worth over $1.5 billion. We have the Waterloo Wind Farm in South Australia and 140 megawatts from the Musselroe Bay wind farm in Tasmania. These are the opportunities. These are the things that can happen if we get this legislation right, if we frame it correctly, if we take into account the importance of agriculture and give them a fair go. One of the nine principles that were released a few weeks ago by the opposition leader referred to agriculture. He said the fifth principle was:
As in the Waxman Markey legislation—
in the USA—
agricultural emissions should be excluded from the scheme and agricultural offsets … biosequestration or green carbon) should be included.
Let us give them a fair crack of the whip and give them a fair go. Rudd has got it wrong on this count. I also note that amongst those principles the scheme design must ensure that general increases in electricity prices are no greater than comparable countries to minimise the impact on all trade exposed industries. That is exactly the point. You have to take into account those major employer groups that we rely on for fair power prices so that they can have a go and employ the people that they have and continue to grow, prosper and make a job of it. This is why we have to get all of these things right. I commend Greg Hunt for the work he has been doing in promoting the renewable energy target and promoting coalition policy. He said in a speech on 30 July, ‘A vision for a solar continent’, to the Appropriate Technology Retailers Association of Australia:
We want to do the right thing by renewable energy. But to link the RET with the ETS was a new low in political game-playing.
He is absolutely right. It should be decoupled and the government should come to the party and fix it pretty much straightaway.
It seems the Frontier Economics proposal is greener, cheaper and smarter. But, look, let’s put it all on the table. Let’s talk, discuss and see if we can work it out together. I call on the government to release their Treasury modelling. It has not been released with respect to the CPRS. That is a disgrace. They did this in the May budget when they forecast a 4.5 per cent GDP growth and everybody asked, ‘How is that possible?’ Independent experts said, ‘How is that possible?’ Nobody could work it out. They did not have the guts to release their Treasury modelling. They have to get it right for the sake of Australia and for the sake of Australian families.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1

Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2009-08-11,"—The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009 and associated bills house the detailed provisions on the emissions trading scheme. The CPRS Bill is the main bill in the CPRS package. The CPRS will make sure our nation invests in the industries of the future: renewable energies, including solar and wind power, and in employment utilising new technologies such as clean coal and geothermal energy. Such investments will create thousands of new, low-pollution-industry jobs. The CPRS will enable Australia to stand up and be counted in the fight against climate change. It will allow businesses and households to do their bit as well. The $75.8 billion Australian Carbon Trust to be established by the government is aimed at helping all Australians to make a contribution towards reducing our nation’s emissions. Its structures also will help to improve energy efficiency in businesses and commercial buildings. The government will take into consideration the effort made by householders who buy accredited green power when setting CPRS caps.
The scheme has been designed to give significant backing to jobs. Among measures to this end is the $2.75 billion Climate Change Action Fund, which will offer targeted assistance to businesses, community groups, workers, regions and communities. The government also has delayed the start of the scheme by one year to help Australian firms cope with the fallout of a global recession. There will be a fixed carbon price for one year of $10 per tonne, giving business certainty as the nation moves towards full market trading from 1 July 2012.
Votes for these bills are votes for Australia’s future—votes for our environment, for our economy, for our jobs, for our industries. They are votes for our children’s future prosperity and wellbeing. They are votes for our planet, our world, our humanity. Sure, we could sit on our hands and do nothing, just as those opposite did for almost 12 years while in government. Sure, we could also wait for the rest of the world to step out first before deciding whether to follow the lead of other nations. The opposition wants us to wait for Copenhagen and beyond. But we need to play a leading role in forging an international agreement and to arrive at the negotiating table with targets and a plan to get there in the form of a CPRS. Dangerous climate change will not wait. We cannot simply press the pause button on its progress, on extreme weather events, on the droughts and floods it fosters. It is currently, and will continue, placing our globe in peril.
Experts tell us that carbon pollution is causing the world’s climate to shift dangerously, resulting in extreme weather events, longer and more severe droughts, higher temperatures and rising sea levels. As one of the hottest, thirstiest continents on earth—led, I am sorry to say, by my home state of South Australia—Australia’s environment and economy will be one of the hardest and fastest hit by climate change. Had the former coalition government acted on climate change the transition to a low-pollution economy in the coming years would have been made much easier.
Of course, many opposite do not even accept the clear scientific evidence which mounts up day by day. Those among their number who do believe seem too timid and too weak to speak—to stare down the sceptics in their party room. The Rudd Labor government will not be scared off or intimidated by those who would rather wait and see what happens. We will act with the courage of our convictions, being emboldened by the knowledge that the right thing to do is to show the world leadership, which is crucial in the face of a heightening crisis. This government will not be responsible for the perpetuation of the philosophy that would let climate change rip unfettered. Does this ideology sound familiar: ‘Let the economy rip; let the environment rip’? This is far too serious an issue. It is far too urgent an issue.
Just as the global economic crisis has necessitated the strong leadership and the decisive action embodied in our jobs and nation-building economic stimulus packages, Australia needs to be proactive, even aggressive, on the issue of climate change. It never ceases to amaze that those opposite fail to learn from the ghosts of elections past. The Australian people were clear in their verdict in November 2007. Along with other things, such as workplace relations, they wanted the government to act, to show leadership, on climate change. They were fed up with deniers who would not even ratify the Kyoto protocol let alone take further concrete steps to address this blight. Still these deniers call the shots—incredible, in view of the fact that their leader is not among them. Mr Turnbull is unable or unwilling to unite the party room over this. However, by his own admission, he not only believes in climate change he also says an emissions trading scheme is inevitable for Australia. In the Hansard of 26 May 2008, we read Mr Turnbull saying:
The biggest element in the fight against climate change has to be the emissions-trading scheme …
And yet he would delay and defer, rout and refer, rather than bite the bullet on this crisis.
Of course, we know that climate change is not the only issue on which Liberal-National Party members are poster boys and girls for the ‘Do nothing’ campaign. Mr Turnbull and his colleagues would rather we did not invest in our nation’s infrastructure—our roads, our schools, broadband and industry. They do not want us to build the structures which will enhance the quality of our children’s education, our health care, our communications, our transport and the like, supporting and creating jobs at the same time. Yet they are happy to claim credit for such investment in their community newsletters and to attend openings of the very projects they voted against in this and the other place. They do not want us to invest in jobs—either those which exist today or future employment, including jobs in green industries. They have voted against a stronger future built on decisive action now. Their reason? It would be bad for our children.
Not only does that not make sense when it comes to nation building and jobs investment but it smacks of hypocrisy. How worried were the coalition for our children and for future generations when they, when in government, refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol or act on dangerous climate change? How concerned were they for future generations when they refused to say sorry to the stolen generations or to address Indigenous disadvantage? How bothered were they about the employment opportunities of future workers and their families when they disinvested in TAFE, turning tens of thousands of Australian students away from underfunded TAFE colleges, when they oversaw a ballooning skills shortfall or when they slammed through the draconian regime that was Work Choices? That legislation negatively impacted on thousands of Australian workers and their families. It is certainly difficult to take them seriously when they feign concern now.
We know that the opposition are horribly divided over climate change and are still debating whether it even exists. They will do everything they can to delay the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme’s introduction. What a disappointment. Australia should be part of the climate change solution, not just part of the problem as the sixth largest polluter in the world on a per capita basis. Passing these bills now will give business certainty into future years. Passing them now will be a crucial step towards the development of an international pact on tackling climate change at Copenhagen later this year.
Facing the ill winds of the global recession, our scheme will couch pollution reduction targets which are both responsible and appropriate given the need to shelter our economy and the jobs it sustains. For the first time, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will put a price on carbon pollution, therefore giving strong incentive to major polluters to cut their emissions. Taking such action on climate change will foster the growth of the renewable energy sector to 30 times its current size by 2050, according to Treasury modelling released in October 2008. The CPRS will, from its introduction in 2011, use the funds it raises to help households adjust to the scheme. This will ensure Australian families do not bear the burden of climate change. In addition, the government is working to encourage carbon pollution cuts before the scheme gets underway. Permits for carbon stored will be able to be generated by eligible reforestation projects from 1 July 2010. This will create economic opportunities in regional Australia.
The alternative to taking decisive action on climate change is unthinkable. If we do nothing, our economy will be left behind as we fail to take our place at a table full of low-pollution jobs. If we do nothing, future generations will be left to clean up a mess too awful to consider: global devastation on an unprecedented scale. As the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, said on 3 August:
We have long known that climate change threatens Australia’s economy, environment and way of life. We have long known that real action on climate change demands deep and fundamental economic reform. We have long known that central to this action is placing a limit and price on our carbon emissions.
In a country of over 21 million people, with 150 elected members of the House of Representatives and 76 senators, it is now up to one politician to determine whether Australia’s carbon emissions will continue to rise or whether we will start to reduce emissions for the first time ever.
That politician is, of course, Malcolm Turnbull.

… he must decide whether he wants to finish what he claims to have started—what he knows is right—and pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
For too long those opposite have turned their backs on action to address climate change. For too long they have argued amongst themselves about the existence and cause of climate change. For too long they have failed to confront the issue. The business community, environment groups and the Australian people expect the parliament to do the right thing and pass the CPRS this year. The Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, Shell Australia and a range of other businesses are calling for certainty on the CPRS so they can plan investments. Delaying passage of the legislation will directly undermine investment certainty at a time when business certainty is critical. It is time to act. I commend the bills before us to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2009-08-11,"—I rise this evening to speak to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009 and related bills. To start with, I would like to highlight the concerns relating to the Rudd government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme bills. It is very important to Australia’s economic survival that we look towards a global solution and not simply an Australian solution. We are producing only 1.4 per cent of the world’s CO2 emissions and yet we are trying to hold economic and carbon-emitting powerhouses such as China and India to ransom. Australia’s emissions trading scheme must be on par with the rest of the world and be part of a global agreement. Otherwise it will be a case of our country being at such disadvantage it could affect all of our exports and therefore in the long term our economic longevity. Our emissions trading scheme must take into account what is happening globally, or the competitive position of Australia could be severely damaged.
Do we want to see Australian jobs, investment and CO2 emissions being exported to countries that do not have a price imposed on carbon? Australian jobs are the most important aspect in all of this and should not be forgotten. In recent months companies have publicly indicated the cost of this proposed scheme in terms of jobs. The Minerals Council of Australia has found over 66,000 jobs will be lost. Rio Tinto has stated that, put simply, the CPRS as proposed will cost jobs. Xstrata predicts that between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs nationally may be lost. BlueScope and OneSteel say hundreds of jobs would be lost across the country and 12,000 jobs that the Port Kembla Steelworks supports would be under threat. Ford Australia believes the ETS will drive jobs overseas. Jobs will be lost throughout Australia, and this is a disaster. The government constantly dismisses any research relating to jobs, but this is no longer a credible response. States and territories have done their own research; businesses have done their research. It is time for the government to listen to this research and to look at the concerns from businesses across Australia.
The coalition have stated that we will offer bipartisan support to the government for the carbon abatement targets we take to Copenhagen in December. This would, therefore, allow Australia to attend a conference with a united Australian position for a global commitment to addressing climate change rather than to arrive with legislation that could conflict with everything other countries, including the United States, might suggest. The desire for Mr Rudd and Senator Wong to rush this legislation through prior to Copenhagen is deeply flawed and could greatly affect our country’s future economic reputation. It would be premature for Australia to be locked into an emissions trading scheme that is not in line with the rest of the world. It is important that Australia continues to have a global perspective and an external view rather than focuses internally. Although the safety of our economic future is imperative, this can only be ensured by going to Copenhagen with targets for discussion, not legislation.
I now would like to turn to the uncertainty around the 2015 deadline for the introduction of a CPRS for agriculture. As a former farmer of 38 years, like my colleague Senator Nash I believe agriculture should not be part of the CPRS. Instead, the government should allow agricultural offsets. Australian farmers will still feel the impact of the CPRS through the price rises in fuel and transport, chemicals, fertilisers, electricity, farm inputs and other goods and services. A large problem with including agriculture in the CPRS is the sheer number of businesses who individually produce only small amounts of carbon emissions. The greatest impact of the CPRS on agriculture would be in relation to livestock production. This would result in an increase in production costs, decreased demand and therefore decreased production.
The agricultural sector has reduced its emissions by 40 per cent since 1990 through various measures, some voluntary and some not. The involuntary measures have come at a significant cost to many sections of the industry. I know myself that with farm practices like no-till, reducing burning of stubbles, planting perennial grasses and planting many trees along creek lines we have done our part, as have all the farmers in my area. They certainly keep doing this. Younger farmers are taking up many different initiatives. They are really handling the agricultural sector’s emissions. I commend them for this. They are all looking for different ways to keep up this practice. Unfortunately, as Senator Wong cannot come clean on whether or not agriculture will be included in this 2015 deadline, it is having a huge effect on the stability of the farming communities and also regional employment. Buying another property or looking to invest in different aspects of farming is all on hold. I would implore her and her government to make a decision so that we all know just where it is going. If the CPRS is introduced for agriculture that sector will change dramatically. It could be the death of our regional towns.
Covering direct emissions from agriculture within the ETS is inappropriate. There is a potential for economic and social impacts leading to significant detrimental environmental outcomes in areas such as water run-off, biodiversity and Australia’s inability to continue to make a contribution to global food and fibre supplies. This is something that Australia excels in. If we have this penalty put upon us, we will not be able to continue to produce food and fibre as we have in the past. The international goalposts have been shifting, with the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and European countries having ruled out covering their direct agricultural emissions under a cap-and-trade scheme.
Two-thirds of Australian farm produce is exported, and this will mean that Australian farmers will be isolated if agriculture’s direct emissions are covered within the ETS. I have some data from the National Farmers Federation on the impact. The farm cash income for an average beef farm would fall by over 60 per cent if agriculture’s emissions were covered by the ETS cap with a carbon price of $25 per tonne of carbon dioxide. On an average beef-sheep farm, the income would fall by 47 per cent, and on an average sheep farm it would fall by 30 per cent. With wool prices as they are, I think this might be the end of the wool trade.
If agriculture is included and Australian and New Zealand agriculture is covered by an emissions trading scheme and other countries are not, it puts us at a disadvantage. As a gauge, with agriculture covered by the emissions trading scheme at $25 per tonne of carbon dioxide and not accessing free permits, a beef producer with a thousand head of cattle would be required to pay approximately $237,000 per annum for permits, a sheep producer with 3,000 sheep would be required to pay approximately $15,000 per annum for permits and a grain farmer producing a thousand tonnes of grain would be required to pay approximately $3,500 per annum for permits. Research undertaken by the Australian Meat Industry Council indicates that additional costs of the ETS for meat processors from 2011 will be of the order of $5.64 per beef animal and 78c per sheep. Similarly, dairy farmers estimate that their direct costs from ETS would be between $6,000 and $9,000 per farm in 2011, rising over time. So the impact on agriculture is not only economic; areas such as regional employment, trade, water and environment will also be affected. The agricultural sector needs assurance that its export competitiveness will not be placed at risk as a result of the ETS. Farmers are vulnerable to increasing costs that will result from the implementation of an ETS.
The Rudd government now has no alternative but to respond and eliminate all uncertainty around the 2015 deadline. This will enable Australian farmers to proceed on an equal footing with all trading partners. The world population is expected to increase 50 per cent by 2050. That will be nine billion people to feed. Therefore, as our international counterparts are excluding agriculture’s direct emissions from their schemes, it is vital that we do the same. Our farmers need to be provided with certainty. The Rudd government must commit to not covering agriculture now or in the future.
Australia confronts a food security responsibility. If we accept ETS coverage of Australia’s farm sector, 1.6 million Australian jobs and $32 billion a year in farm exports will be at risk. Agriculture requires an alternative approach which will provide them with an incentive based means of reducing emissions and best management practice where they can continue to make contributions. As I have said before, this is improving all the time. Growing vital food and fibre production will continue. Farms, as biological systems, emit carbon, but unlike other sectors they also absorb it back into soils, pastures, crops and trees. Australian farmers are already world leaders in low-emission farm systems, and I would encourage them all to continue in this way. Once again I say that it is very important that the Rudd government commit to not covering agriculture now or in the future as part of the emissions trading scheme.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2009-08-11,"—I begin by commending Senator Adams on her consideration of the potential impacts on the agricultural sector in this country by a scheme such as the one before the chamber tonight in the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009 and related suite of bills. The considerations that she raises are very important.
The CPRS legislation, in global terms, presents for the chamber and the parliament’s consideration the question of tackling climate change. I want to indicate that this is an issue that I take very seriously. I cannot be categorised in the disparaging way that those opposite have endeavoured to characterise others. That approach is perhaps not terribly constructive, but I guess that is their problem and not mine.
Climate change is best tackled from a position of economic strength. To effectively meet the huge cost of tackling greenhouse gas abatement requires a few fundamentals in place: people in jobs, businesses performing strongly and an economy in a state of growth. As a country that produces—as others among my colleagues have said—only 1.4 per cent of the world’s CO2 emissions, there is no Australian solution to climate change; there is, in reality, only a global solution. The design of any Australian emissions trading scheme must be responsive to the existence or absence of a global agreement. We see at the moment stark differences emerging between this government’s approach and the legislation endorsed by the President of the United States, Mr Barack Obama. Amendments that were made in May to the draft US emissions trading legislation include very specific provisions providing 100 per cent protection to US export and import competing industries in any future emissions trading scheme until 2025. What is more, that bill now says that a reduction in protection of these industries will only occur after 2025, when more than 70 per cent of global output from that sector is produced or manufactured in countries that have a scheme equivalent to that operating in the United States.
You would think that that would be a wake-up call for the Prime Minister and for Senator Wong. It is absolutely unclear to me why this government is so unwilling to acknowledge the importance of taking into account the United States scheme. A submission, for example, from BlueScope and OneSteel to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on 4 June this year made exactly that point:
Given the global significance of the US, we believe that it is important to obtain a clear understanding of the design of the United States’ emissions trading scheme ... and to fully consider the implications of the US approach for the design of Australia’s CPRS.
If an emissions trading scheme does not take account of what is or is not happening in other countries, it will, by definition, end up flawed. It will also seriously damage the competitive position of many of our own industries and ultimately see Australian jobs, investment and CO2 emissions being exported to countries when no price is going to be imposed on carbon. It seems to me that a badly designed scheme is worse than no scheme at all.
Now, we were promised by the now Prime Minister, before the election, that there would be an introduction of an emissions trading scheme which would produce deep cuts in CO2 emissions but would not disadvantage Australia’s export- and import-competing industries. The fact is, though, that that promise has not been fulfilled and the government’s scheme is in disarray. It is in disarray because it has been rushed to suit a cravenly political timetable. It is in disarray because the design is not flexible enough to cope with the global financial downturn and fails on all counts. It is in disarray because it will cost jobs, kill investment and do very little, if anything, to reduce CO2 emissions.
It is reckless in the extreme to rush the introduction of this scheme without knowing the outcome of the December global climate change summit in Copenhagen, without knowing what the United States will do and without knowing the full impact of the global financial crisis on our real economy. And when we do look at the international scenario we see that the government seems to be taking great pleasure in inferring that around the world a great deal of action is taking place on emissions trading schemes. But the evidence actually does not add up. Of course, I have already noted that the United States scheme is currently under development, and even individual states’ schemes in the United States have not advanced very far—mostly because community focus has shifted to the impact of the global financial crisis.
The Canadian scheme, for example, has been put on hold while they wait and see what the US does. And in Europe effectively it is little more than a pilot scheme so far. They require business to purchase from the government at auction just four per cent of permits. In contrast, what this government will require is for business to purchase 70 per cent of permits, while the United States administration is looking at a requirement that business purchase 15 per cent of permits. So in terms of setting the price on carbon there is very little in place, or even in advanced planning stages, as far as this issue is concerned, in the rest of the world.
So, under the design of the government’s proposed scheme we would be taking a major leap in comparison with the rest of the world. And our very great concern, which has been articulated so effectively by a number of my colleagues, is that the Rudd government has deliberately ignored the impact of this proposed scheme on Australia’s competitiveness and on jobs in the first years of transition if our major competitors do not reciprocate. The design of the scheme assumes that Australia’s major competitors will move to put in place a major new tax on carbon across their own economies, including their export- and import-competing industries, in the early years of the scheme. In fact, the government seems to have assumed that the United States would introduce an equivalent scheme by 2010, China by 2015 and India by 2020. But none of this is remotely possible. Let us suppose that China, India, Indonesia, the countries of the Middle East and South America and other competing developing countries do not apply a tax on carbon for 15 years or 20 years or even longer; we cannot even rely on Treasury for modelling of alternative scenarios or methods.
So all we have before us is a self-serving, misleading and irresponsible exercise, and that is before we even get to contemplate the costs of this proposed ETS. For most Australian families it seems that the annual tax that the government will impose, through this scheme, on electricity and other energy intensive companies, will result in a 30 per cent to 40 per cent rise in power bills, and, indirectly, in increases in the price of most services and items purchased. There will be significant added direct and indirect tax on agricultural and manufacturing businesses, which are competing against foreign products where no such tax now applies.
What is even more concerning is the potential for tens of thousands of jobs to be put at risk, the permanent and serious shrinkage of major regional centres—both Senator Adams and Senator Nash have referred to that this evening—and the loss of major investments. But this has been for what gain in terms of the impact on CO2 emissions? Possibly little or none. One $4 billion proposed investment in my own state of New South Wales to extend an aluminium smelter at Kurri Kurri in the Hunter Valley will be shelved. That decision alone will see the loss of 15,000 construction jobs and 3,000 permanent jobs.
I said earlier that on any reading this proposal before the Senate is in disarray. It does not even adequately encourage complementary measures. The way it is currently designed means that actions that individual Australians or families take to reduce emissions will not do anything to reduce the overall output of greenhouse gases—it will just allow more emissions by industry up to the cap. Areas such as agriculture and our huge commercial building sector are effectively ignored as sources of abatement.
The government has argued—I heard Senator Wortley doing this earlier—that pushing this legislation through the parliament will give business certainty. Well, it seems to me that what businesses want is a scheme which preserves their international competitive position, not the certainty of being fundamentally unable to compete. As Anglo Coal Australia Chief Executive Officer Seamus French has said, certainty is not preferable to getting the design right for business. He said:
We don’t want the certainty of a bullet.
The government’s claims that their flawed emissions trading legislation needs to be rushed through the parliament have also been undermined by the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Yvo de Boer, who revealed that the UN does not require countries to have legislation in place before the Copenhagen meeting. This view has received further support from Jonathan Pershing, US Deputy Special Envoy for Climate Change, who indicated that US legislation may not be passed by the time of the Copenhagen meeting. He said:
... it does not block a deal. You can have a deal without having the legislation.
As we have been saying repeatedly, Australia needs to go to the UN conference with a united position on targets, not a flawed scheme for the sake of some personal aggrandisement of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Water.
In the end, it seems to me that the only certainty that we have with regard to this scheme—the certainty that senators on the other side have spoken about—is that it will certainly produce job losses. Over recent months, corporation after corporation have publicly recorded the cost of this proposed scheme in terms of lost jobs. A number of those have been cited in the chamber again today. The Minerals Council has found that over 66,000 jobs will be lost or foregone. BlueScope and OneSteel say that hundreds of jobs would be lost across the country, and the 12,000 jobs that the Port Kembla steelworks supports in my own state would be under threat. And as was discussed in question time today, through my questions to the minister, even the Labor Treasurer of New South Wales, Mr Eric Roozendaal, is concerned about the effects of the scheme—the risk to jobs and the need to ameliorate risk, not to go headlong into the scheme that the government has before the parliament at the moment.
Let me be absolutely clear about one thing. I support and the coalition supports—and we supported it when in government—an environmentally-responsible ETS as part of a coordinated global response to climate change. It is our strong view that the design of the Australian ETS should be completed only after the passage of the US legislation through the congress and after the conclusion of the Copenhagen climate summit in December. Every other political party, conveniently ignored by speakers on the other side, and every other interested group with any credibility—except, apparently, the government—knows that this ETS legislation is flawed and it needs to be improved if we are to save jobs and protect small business and industry in Australia; prevent carbon leakage, which will only frustrate any net global CO2 abatement; and have a decent scheme in place.
The coalition has again and again endeavoured to find a better outcome on this legislation in the event that the Prime Minister remains determined to force through an early vote. Firstly, we set out nine principal issues that need to be addressed in Labor’s scheme for the coalition to support it, including, fundamentally, the principle that an Australian ETS should offer no less protection for jobs, small business and industry than an American ETS does for American jobs, small business and industry. The principles that the coalition has set out are practical and clear. They will ensure an effective Australian ETS scheme which protects jobs and industry and which could be converted, if there were a willingness to constructively engage on the other side, into appropriate amendments for legislation. But from the very start there has been an abject refusal to consider anything like that. They have adopted a take-it-or-leave-it approach, and that intransigence will ultimately cost this nation.
Faced with that and faced with the refusal to even discuss alternative views, the coalition together with Senator Xenophon—as he alluded to in his remarks this evening—commissioned independent economic research by Frontier Economics to measure the real impact of the scheme. The results, released yesterday, are compelling. They show that this emissions trading scheme will, effectively, unnecessarily drive up electricity prices, destroy jobs and expand the size of government. They make it clear that the government should recognise the flaws in this CPRS legislation and begin constructive engagement with the coalition, minor party senators and other stakeholders to design a more effective scheme.
In fact, with the changes that are proposed within the research to which I have referred, the CPRS could actually be made twice as green, with a much lower cost to consumers and the economy and a net improvement of 68,000 regional jobs. It could deliver an unconditional 10 per cent reduction in Australia’s 2000 greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, compared to the government’s five per cent unconditional target. By treating the electricity generation sector in a less punitive manner, household power bills would rise not by the extraordinary amount that the government’s scheme will produce but only by about five per cent in the near term. Five years into the scheme, average annual household power bills would only be around $44 higher, compared with the potential for $280 under the CPRS, based on this research. For regional Australia, the government’s scheme would cost 26,000 jobs; Frontier Economics’ proposed changes would lead to net gains of 42,000 regional jobs. Overall, the cost to the Australian economy over the next 20 years in net present value terms could be reduced by about a third. They are relatively modest proposed changes, and with them the ETS could be made far less harmful to jobs, to investment, to the regions and to the Australian economy and so, importantly, have a much more positive impact on the Australian environment.
On any assessment, the design of the Rudd scheme fails on all counts. It will cost jobs, kill investment and, frustratingly, do very little—this is such an important point—to reduce CO2 emissions. We believe that it would be premature to lock Australia into an emissions trading scheme that was out of step with the rest of the world, given that the next international climate change conference in Copenhagen is only a few short months away and given that the United States administration and the congress are well advanced in finalising US legislation for an ETS. Why wouldn’t we defer this consideration until after the Copenhagen meeting? But the government appears determined to push this through. If the government does not defer this, it will be choosing to create unemployment. It will be choosing to vote against Australian jobs, against the Australian economy and ultimately against the Australian environment.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2009-08-11,"—I am no expert on what, if anything, is happening with our climate—nor am I any expert on, if something is happening, what might be the cause of it. There are plenty of others who do profess to be so expert. But the particularly interesting thing is that those who do profess to be so expert are unable to agree on what, if anything, is happening in respect of our climate and unable to agree on, if something is happening to our climate, the causes thereof and, in particular, the extent to which man is contributing to those changes.
We have a Prime Minister who is a self-professed policy wonk, a self-professed expert at developing policy, and he promised to deliver the Australian electorate evidence based policy. In the context of the government’s CPRS, that means, pretty simply, identifying the problem that his policy will supposedly fix, proving the cause of the problem and proving how his policy solution will fix that problem. That means, if he wants to introduce his CPRS, the Prime Minister must prove what is causing the problem that he says exists and show that his CPRS will fix it. He is not doing that.
Instead, the Prime Minister is proposing a CPRS that will cost jobs. It will export carbon without making any meaningful contribution to a global solution  Through his CPRS the Prime Minister is asking the Australian people to choose between lower wages and higher unemployment. It has been a little-debated point that, in order to maintain constant employment—which the government says its CPRS will do; it is saying that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will not jeopardise jobs—the modelling underpinning constancy in employment will assume a reduction in real wages over time. It assumes that real wages would be less than they otherwise would be were it not for the CPRS. Has the government told Australian workers that they will essentially take a cut in real wages over time in order to maintain jobs constancy across the economy? I think not.
Under questioning in the Senate economics committee inquiry hearing into the CPRS bill on 29 May, respected economist Dr Brian Fisher, formerly of ABARE, now of Concept Economics, said:
… what the Treasury has done is to make an assumption that, if we take the full economy, for every job that is lost in one place there will be another job of some description elsewhere.
He went on to say:
… to make that work what both the Treasury and I have done in the national modelling is to allow the real wages of workers to fall. We have held total employment constant, but to allow that to occur we have allowed real wages to fall.
What is happening here is that real wages have to be lower than they otherwise would have been to maintain everybody in a job. Nobody is being very forthcoming about that particular assumption.
So, in response to my question, ‘Both you and Treasury are saying that in order to stop job losses you are going to have to incur pay loss?’, Dr Fisher responded, ‘Yes, reduce real wages.’ Under questioning in Senate estimates, Treasury officials essentially confirmed this. Ms Quinn from Treasury, in response to questions on Wednesday, 3 June about the effect on real wages of the CPRS, said that real wages would ‘grow slightly slower than they otherwise would’. She went on to say, ‘but in all scenarios real wages continue to grow’, but the point is that Treasury have confirmed that real wages will grow slower than they otherwise would under the government’s CPRS in order to maintain jobs. Hence the choice for Australian workers is between keeping their jobs and having lower real wages.
The indirect costs of the scheme on business, especially agriculture, are significant and have been commented upon by others in the chamber tonight. They include the impact on dairy farmers, who could see their incomes falling by 1.9 per cent as early as 2011. By 2015 the effects on Australian broadacre agriculture could see falls in income of between 9.1 and 14½ per cent. So why is the government rushing ahead of the United States? Why is the government intent on rushing ahead of the Copenhagen negotiations? We are not a big carbon emitter. We emit a total of 1.4 per cent of global emissions. Yet it would seem we are intent on risking our economy by rushing.
Even if we accept that there is a risk that we should manage—because it does make sense to do what we can to improve the environment and lessen what might be man’s negative impact on the environment—it does not make sense to manage that risk by creating a CPRS certainty, a certainty that will cost jobs and export carbon without making any meaningful contribution to a global solution. It just does not make sense for those like Australia, who contribute amongst the least to global emissions, to sally forth and sacrifice the most domestically for negligible gain globally. It does not make sense for a small global player to go big or to go early. Indeed, we would be going so early that we could almost be going it alone, because there is no guarantee that the big emitters would ever join us—and, certainly, there is no guarantee that they would join us in the short term. The Rudd government’s CPRS is all Australian pain for no significant global gain. I will be voting against the bills.
Debate (on motion by Senator Conroy) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2009-08-11,"—I want to discuss a matter that has been before the Senate committee of which I am a member, the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport. If I were to say that the Australian Football League did not give a damn about Tasmania, continually discriminates against the state and is a bureaucracy that puts its own interests above that code, some of those opposite might say that I was being outrageous. But, of course, I am actually quoting the president of the Hawthorn Football Club, who made just such a statement in Launceston during the half-time break of the Hawthorn-St Kilda game which was held at Aurora Stadium last Saturday.
That comment was made in the context of an announcement by Mr Kennett, the former Premier of Victoria, that the Hawthorn Football Club was prepared to commit $300,000 towards an improvement of the Aurora Stadium in the city of Launceston in northern Tasmania. The stadium proposal has received commitments of $6.5 million—$4 million from the federal government, $2 million from the Tasmanian state Labor government and half a million dollars from the Launceston City Council. There have been protracted discussions with the AFL about contributions to be made to that proposal, which is after all a proposal which enhances one of the important playing facilities that hosts games of the Australian Football League.
It is of course the case that the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs has conducted an inquiry into Tasmania’s case to host a team in the national competition. That inquiry, I might say, was opposed by Tasmanian Liberal senators. Nevertheless, the majority of the Senate supported its establishment and continuation and a report was made to the Senate.
It was interesting to note that Mr Demetriou responded to that report. The report is critical of the AFL’s assessment of its capacity to financially support a team in Western Sydney instead of a team in Tasmania in the sense that all of the evidence presented to the committee indicated that a great deal more money would be required to prop up such a team than the AFL was prepared to admit to. Mr Gillon McLachlan, the witness for the AFL, placed some figures before the committee which were almost immediately revealed as inadequate by Mr Brian Cook, the current Chief Executive of the Geelong Football Club, a very experienced administrator in the AFL who has experience in administration with the West Coast Eagles as well, among other things. He indicated that the budget that the AFL had put forward for the support of a Western Sydney team for a decade would in fact in all likelihood be exhausted within four years. That is the evidence that was presented to the committee.
Mr Demetriou sought to play to the crowd, in effect, with his rejection of the Senate committee’s findings, suggesting that we were somehow denigrating the people of Western Sydney because we found that the AFL’s case to establish a team there was weak and was unlikely to get the support of the people of Western Sydney to a sufficient extent to remove a very heavy financial obligation from the AFL in supporting such a team.
The committee, may I say, was also faced with the difficulty of getting the facts from the AFL about the real situation on the ground in Western Sydney for the AFL code. We placed some questions on notice. Among other things, we asked for a breakdown of the number of actual game participants, once Auskick participants were excluded, in the Western Sydney area. I will read from paragraphs 2.53 and 2.54 of the committee report:
The committee requested that the AFL provide statistics on participation levels in Western Sydney, the Gold Coast and Tasmania, including the proportion of participants made up of the Auskick program. Unfortunately, the AFL only provided the committee with figures for the entire NSW/ACT region, rather than Western Sydney alone. They are included in Appendix 3. These statistics are not helpful in assessing meaningful participation in the code in that area as they include far Western NSW, the Riverina, Canberra and the far South Coast of NSW, where Australian Rules football enjoys strong support and well established club competitions exist.
At paragraph 2.54, it goes on to say:
Information on the public record, attributed to the New South Wales Minister for Sport suggests that actual participation in Western Sydney is fewer than 3,000. In contrast Tasmanian participation is about 24,000 or nearly five per cent of the Tasmanian population. In the absence of more authoritative figures the committee is inclined to accept that participation in Western Sydney is, as a proportion of its population, relatively insignificant.
I find it difficult to line that passage up with the kinds of comments that Mr Demetriou made in attacking the committee’s findings, which were very well tempered by the evidence presented to it and the lack of credible evidence presented by the AFL on participation in the code. In fact, I invite anyone who is inclined to believe the AFL figures to go to the AFL New South Wales website to ascertain the number of teams that play in the general Western Sydney area in competitions from under-10s up, including right up to the seniors. Allocate an average of 40 players per team and you will not get to 3,000 players. That is using the resources of the AFL that are on the public record.
So the committee found that participation in Western Sydney is at a level consistent with the statement of the New South Wales minister for sport—who, I might add, declined to commit the New South Wales government to funding a playing facility in Western Sydney as requested by the AFL. Here we have a committee report which has been attacked by the Chief Executive of the Australian Football League, Mr Demetriou, who not only chose to not appear but, I suggest, did everything that he could to not appear—such was his lack of confidence in his ability to defend the AFL’s position on this matter.
The other matter that I wish to touch upon this evening, in the very brief time I have left, is the economic contribution that the establishment of an AFL team in Tasmania would have. Again, I want to refer to the evidence of Mr Brian Cook, the Chief Executive Officer of the Geelong Football Club. Given that Geelong is a regional area of Victoria—it is quite close to Melbourne but it is a regional economy—the committee thought that he would be able to present some cogent evidence on the matter. When he was asked about the number of seats allocated to a travelling team on an interstate trip, Mr Cook said:
The allocation between clubs is 500. On top of that, the opposition club can purchase through the ticketing agent of that particular club over and above the 500, of course. This is a real guess, but you would probably find, depending on the side going to Tasmania, anywhere between 1,000—possibly with the Kangaroos—and maybe close to 5,000 would travel over with Collingwood and the Hawthorns, perhaps more with Hawthorn now, given their presence. That would be my rough guess.
His experience indicates that that is an important contribution to our economy. (Time expired)
