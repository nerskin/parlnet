"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-22,"—This message on the Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1998  relates to the Patrick amendment which was inserted into the Corporations Law. It is a provision that would allow creditors of a company, including employees, to apply to the court for an order to recover for a parent company moneys that may have been stripped from that company in order to avoid paying that creditor—in this case obviously being the workers. The most notorious example of that has been where the Patrick group of companies systematically and wilfully stripped the labour hire companies in the group in order to avoid the obligations that companies owed to their respective work forces.
We in the ALP believe in the principle that this amendment embodies. We also have committed ourselves to the passage of the Wallis related legislation. It is our belief that insisting upon this amendment in this bill would only give the government the opportunity to misrepresent and to malign the Australian Labor Party regarding its position on the Wallis legislation. We will not give the government that type of opportunity. We, therefore, will not be insisting upon the Patrick amendment at this point in time.
The ALP believes that the change embodied in this amendment cannot be done in isolation. This is why we are reviewing the Patrick case in the light of the need to make substantive changes to the industrial relations law. We have also introduced a private member's bill, the employee security bill, into the House 
 to give workers greater ability to recover their entitlements when they have been unilaterally sacked by companies that then seek to deny paying them their legitimate entitlements through nothing short of a financial sham. Given the government's wholehearted and full endorsement of the action Patrick took to sack their work force, the opposition will use this bill to highlight the government's anti-worker, pro-sacking agenda.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-06-22,"—Before I speak to the substance of this motion on the Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1998  I wish to put a question to the parliamentary secretary. Parliamentary Secretary, in Northam on Friday Senator Ross Lightfoot informed the gathering that he would much rather work with the One Nation Party than with the Democrats.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-06-22,"—It is relevant to the debate. I record that Senator Ian Campbell has avoided the question. I, therefore, categorise him with those who would link themselves to race rather than reason and who are afraid to come out and say that they reject utterly the notion of preferring One Nation to the Democrats in terms of dealings in this place.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—Senator Murray can put on my response what he would like, but if he listened to my response he could not possibly put that interpretation upon it. I did suggest to Senator Murray that we are at the moment dealing with the Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1998 . I am not aware that the party that he referred to have a view about the bill or whether they would be capable of having a view about the bill, quite frankly. I certainly have not seen any pronouncements in relation to this bill.
The only economic pronouncement I have seen by that particular party, the One Nation Party, in relation to economics was that the way they would solve the economic dilemmas of Australia was basically to let us all use our photocopiers to print money. Their views on the economy are that you can fix Australia's economy by printing money or giving people two per cent loans. Our way of giving people two per cent loans is to work on inflation and work on the economy and get interest rates down to competitive levels. So I have very little in common with people who would put forward those sorts of things.
Senator Murray, I did say that I hope your question was entirely hypothetical. If you think carefully about what I said, you will know exactly what I meant.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-06-22,"—I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer for his full response. He has, in fact, picked up the relevance of my question. Senator Lightfoot inferred that, whatever bill is before this place, he would prefer to be working with One Nation. I merely want to know whether the parliamentary secretary would prefer to work with One Nation with respect to this bill, as Senator Lightfoot would.
—You stopped the Native Title Amendment Bill from getting through and that is why One Nation is where it is!
—Why don't you put them last! Why don't you have some guts and put them last?
—Order! Senator Cook. Order! Senator Lightfoot. We are debating the Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1998 . Senator Murray has the call.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order!
—This amendment is a material amendment to the Corporations Law and deals with issues were a company to restructure its affairs through its subsidiary to 
 avoid its liabilities to either creditors or employees.
I appreciate, Senator Cook, your remarks concerning your continued support for the principle of the amendment. I would advise you that, accordingly, I will again move that amendment to the  Company Law Review Bill 1997  which is due for debate later this week. Therefore, I will accept the intention that is here before us: that, in terms of numbers, this amendment will now not go through. I advise the Senate that, although I will not be insisting on a division, the Australian Democrats would have insisted on this amendment because we think it is critical.
I would ask the parliamentary secretary to consider the terms of any future rejection which the government may be considering if this same amendment, now to be put to the Company Law Review Bill, is passed. I consider that some of the reasons that have been provided are both inadequate and possibly misleading. I do not mean intentionally misleading; I mean possibly misleading in terms of a number of matters referred to in the reasons.
The matters refer to the possibility of the amendment proving a problem in that the terms and the nature of the provision give little guidance to parties and their advisers as to permitted and non-permitted conduct. Specifically the first area with which I would take issue is that the Law Reform Commission—which principally drafted that amendment way back in 1988, except for two changes made by me and by Senator Cook—deliberately wanted the courts to be the arbiter of these issues because it was not intended to be prescriptive or difficult in relation to how companies structure themselves but merely to guide how they should behave. If they do not go insolvent as a result of manipulating or deliberately structuring their affairs in such a way that they do go insolvent, then they have little to fear. I remind the government that the way in which that amendment was structured was the specific consequence of a view and a recommendation by the Law Reform Commission in 1988.
The second area with which I take issue relates to conglomerates. Once again, conglomerates have nothing to fear unless either they or their subsidiaries are likely to go insolvent. Fortunately in Australia that very seldom happens. I do not mean it will not ever happen, but it very seldom happens, and I do not think that is a weighty enough reason to reject the amendment. Frankly, if it did happen to some of their subsidiaries—as is the case with Patrick at present or in the Cobar instance—then it is the court which would determine whether there had been any malpractice which would result in those matters then coming to the consideration of the court.
The third area relates to the issue of Minco. For the record, I remind the Senate that not only did a number of parties, including me, take issue with the Patrick arrangements and how they were restructuring their subsidiaries—and, indeed, there are the Cobar and Woodlawn examples—but also the government was advised by press release on 3 May of the exact nature of the amendment which was proposed to be moved. I am aware, as is the parliamentary secretary, that if the government finds it necessary it is able to move very rapidly indeed with Minco. Somebody put the view to me—and I cannot recall who it was—that arrangements with Minco could take up to 18 months to resolve. That might be true, but, with this very bill before us, for instance, the package of 39 pages of amendments was realised far quicker than that following the Wallis recommendations and following the government's views as to how to do things. Since this is only one page of amendment, certainly it is within the ability and the very strong lobbying power of the parliamentary secretary, to which I have at times been victim, to get on his bike and get the appropriate authority and support from the necessary states. So, once again, I regard that as an inadequate approach.
My view, Parliamentary Secretary—as you know, I have expressed it to you privately—for the record is that the government take a different approach. I am open to view that approach, providing the consequence of what you do is to outlaw activity which immorally 
 and unjustly strips assets from subsidiaries so that creditors or employees do not receive their entitlements. Knowing your personal morality, I know you would not approve of that. I know you do not regard it as something which is desirable that people artificially or immorally avoid their obligations. I would ask you to take note of my remarks in any consideration of any future amendments in this regard.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—I am just standing to indicate that the Greens (WA) feel there is nothing that has significantly changed between now and when the vote was taken to change our view in relation to the amendments. The majority of the Senate has passed amendments to this bill and it is quite fair and reasonable for the Senate to amend legislation by representing the community. If the government do not accept this they obviously have a problem with democracy. Therefore I will be voting in the same way that the Greens (WA) did on the previous occasion.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-06-22,"—I am speaking in continuation on the Managed Investments Bill 1997 , Madam Acting Deputy President, and I will pick up from where I left off, with your permission. My fourth test is competition. Australia has 22 statutory trustee companies. There are an estimated 500 scheme managers operating some 2,000 schemes in Australia. It is expected the bill will result in market rationalisation. IFSA, described by Chanticleer in the Australian Financial Review  on 19 March 1998 as representing the big fund managers, believes that there will be `fewer schemes, fewer trusts, fewer managers'. This certainly means fewer competitors.
Given the apparent diversity of the industry at present, rationalisation does not yet repre 
 sent the danger of an unacceptable level of industry concentration. Nevertheless, that danger, so real in much of Australian business life, may well become greater under the bill. Rationalisation does not necessarily mean better competition. Economist Dr Dwyer is of the opinion that the bill runs the risk of forcing prudent Australian investors to invest offshore in better protected funds in the better regulated markets. This would advantage foreign competitors.
Will the bill significantly affect the ability of Australian funds to market their products overseas? Under existing law we have no access to American markets but the United States funds do have access to our markets. As a large capital importer, our government obviously believes that it has to put up with this lack of reciprocity, which also extends to other industries such as agriculture and manufacturing. The Australian Securities Commission currently approves schemes from Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, New Zealand, Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man to operate in Australia. Australian schemes are known by the ASC to operate in New Zealand but access to other countries, if any, would be negotiated directly between the fund and the foreign regulator. The ASC states:
. . . does not expect that the passage of the Managed Investments Bill will alter the existing or potential access of Australian funds to foreign jurisdictions, or the access of foreign funds to Australia.
So there we have it: one side says it will be bad while the other side says it does not really know but it is not going to change things much. Will the bill significantly affect the willingness of foreigners to invest in Australian funds? Will they see investor protection reduced by the bill? With regard to international competitiveness, Dr Dwyer again is of the opinion that we are on dangerous ground with the bill. He says:
Here we are in Australia signing treaties, such as the World Trade Organisation, committing ourselves to free trade and financial services, while potentially implementing a regulatory regime that the Americans will be extremely fast to point out is substandard and below theirs . . . 

once you suffer from a lack of confidence in your regulatory arrangements, then you are in trouble.
The area of choice is one in which the case is clear. It seems obvious that informed, self-sufficient and innovative risk takers should be able to opt for alternative products. It is ironic that a coalition government which makes much of the philosophy of choice wishes to move from one mandatory trustee single choice system to another mandatory single responsible entity, single choice system.
Both the present mandatory system and the bill's mandatory system can be rightly criticised for interfering with the freedom of investors collectively to determine their own prudential requirements. That is regarded as the price one pays for having secure investment systems which enjoy international and domestic approval. But limiting freedom should not mean no freedom or choice at all and it should certainly not mean no consultation with investors, who surely have the right to make the choice. There is no provision in this bill to oblige fund managers or the government to ask the investors in the funds their opinion.
Single responsible entities are already a feature of Australian financial life through banks, life insurance companies and superannuation funds, for instance, although each has different fiduciary regulatory constraints. The government has determined that all new future collective management schemes be single responsible entities. The Australian Democrats do not propose to oppose that intention although, as is evident, we are fearful that it may expose some classes of investor to greater risk.
The government has also determined that all existing investment schemes will be single responsible entities subject to a transitional period of two years. The Australian Democrats do oppose that intention unless the investors in those funds themselves want to change. We believe that investors in existing schemes should have a say in whether they move to an single responsible entity environment or not.
There are also fund managers who oppose single responsible entities, as in the submission to the committee from Fidelity Invest 
 ments, an American subsidiary, which finds trustees to be a cheaper and better option than having to go in-house with all the compliance and custodial duties. A number of smaller and medium sized Australian fund managers hold the same view and presented evidence at the hearings. Indeed, this bill is characterised by its opponents as being designed for, and strongly favouring, the big end of town.
The Australian Democrats believe that the existing system can and should run parallel to the single responsible entity system, if investors in existing funds wish that it do so. This means that in existing funds, where investors so choose, the use of a trustee will continue.
The bill provides for a two-year transitional period for existing schemes. The transitional arrangements allow either the existing management company or trustee to become the responsible entity. The government intends investors will move from one mandatory scheme to another mandatory scheme. For us, there is an amazing presumption here—that the government can simply alter the security enjoyed by an investor without consulting them, or without requiring the funds themselves to consult them. It has not been established that the investors in each existing scheme want to change. Whether there is a majority or a minority in each existing scheme is unknown. Investors were largely unrepresented at the hearing that the committee held. Small investors in particular were not represented. I have seen, for example, that an organisation such as the Australian Consumers Association, which supports this bill, has not even asked the question of its own members.
The bill permits the ASC to appoint a custodian, or the fund manager may voluntarily appoint one. There is, however, no provision for investors to make the appointment. There will undoubtedly be investors who prefer the approach taken in the bill. There will also undoubtedly be investors who are more comfortable with the existing system. In a democracy, both should have a choice. Our quarrel with this bill is not that the government should take a view but that the government has failed to allow investors to take a view. 
There are major problems with this bill. In our view, it does not provide choice and it does lessen security. That view is shared by a number of very senior and very capable persons in the community and it is opposed by other senior and capable persons. The Australian Democrats will be moving amendments to this bill in the committee stage to address the problems I have outlined.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—The  Managed Investments Bill 1997  is a curious bill in many respects. It is especially curious as it positively works against some of the government's favourite catchcries, particularly its favoured stance of promoting domestic and international competitiveness and flexibility in contractual arrangements. It is absolutely the opposite of the theme that the government was trying to push during the last sitting fortnight in relation to choice in superannuation funds—whether that choice was real or not.
This bill will leave investors with no choice between different structures. This bill will rob investors of the choice of having the protection of a trustee. This bill will diminish investors' rights of redress against negligent directors. The bill will leave Australia with an investor protection regime that is one of the weakest and least proactive regimes in the world. The bill will leave Australia with a regime that will favour large fund managers over small fund managers and that will make it very difficult for small funds to even enter the market.
The  Managed Investments Bill 1997 , along with the related  Company Law Review Bill 1997 , will bring about significant changes to the way in which business operates. The  Managed Investments Bill 1997  radically changes the structure of managed investment schemes in Australia. It alters the schemes from being two-tiered schemes, which include a funds manager and a trustee in a supervisory and watchdog capacity, to single-tier schemes comprising a single responsible entity. The  Managed Investments Bill 1997  relates to non-superannuation collective investment schemes. I will come back to the government's inconsistent dealing with super 
 annuation investment schemes and non-superannuation investment schemes later.
This bill raises serious questions on a number of fronts. First of all, on the investor front, this bill undermines the protection that investors currently enjoy and limits the choices available. On the competition front, in absolute contrast to the usual song sung by the government the bill actually undermines competition, especially for smaller funds, as a result of the costs involved in the new scheme.
On the international front, this bill undermines the pursuit of international best practice—another favourite tune that the government normally prefers to whistle. On a democratic front, this bill undermines the parliamentary process by leaving the details of this new scheme to be determined by the Australian Securities Commission at its leisure—outside the scrutiny and view of citizens and their representatives in parliament.
Investors are the losers in this bill. This bill not only weakens the protection for investors but removes any choice for investors as to the level of protection they would prefer. It is a bizarre situation that the government has been blowing the horn of flexibility in contractual arrangements in the area of workplace relations and superannuation investment yet is proposing to limit the freedom to contract in the important area of investor protection and consumer choice in managed investment funds. I wonder who is pushing this line?
While it seems rational that professional or informed investors should have the option to invest in a scheme without the prudential protections of a trustee, it is hard to think why the government wants to prohibit two-tiered investment schemes. The bill forces investors to accept a lower level of protection whether they like it or not. What is wrong with the so called mum and dad investors actually being able to have custodians or trustees to make sure the whiz-kids and screen jockeys don't blow the life savings of small investors?
In the lower house, Mr Rocher, the honourable member for Curtin, quoted from the Australian Law Reform Commission's summary to its report, Collective investments: 
 other people's money. I think the quotations are worth putting on record in the Senate as well. The ALRC noted:
Many investors decide to invest in these schemes—
collective investment schemes—
because they do not want the worry and responsibility of day to day management of their money.
The ALC also noted:
They rely on the law, rather than on their own expertise, to give them appropriate protection.
Considering such comments, clearly the issue of consumer investor protection is a crucial one. The Greens (WA) are not convinced—indeed, far from it—that this bill provides anything close to adequate investor protection. The idea which a `single responsible entity' is built on is that there is legal confusion as to who is answerable to investors. This is itself a questionable argument in light of joinder rules. It has been argued that the confusion is not such a calamity in reality. Nevertheless, the axing of the independent trustee is not a logical response to this problem. Clarification of the roles was what was clearly required. Indeed, Standard and Poor's, the international rating agency, has noted that the current structure provides greater investment protection as the trustee and the custodian are clearly independent. They also recognise that an independent custodian is the minimum standard adopted by foreign financial centres.
The bill provides significant scope for the responsible entity to engage in fraud and abuse their position. The safeguard under the bill is that the manager must have the support of either the majority of independent directors or a compliance committee. But the bill specifically stops the trustee from filling either of these positions. Pierpont, writing in the Australian Financial Review, elucidates the problem with this so-called `safeguard' through the example of Trustee Executor and Agency, which collapsed in 1983. In that case all of the directors were independent but had no idea about the rorting and speculation that the managing director was engaging in with the company's money. Moreover, the government is yet to outline the qualifications required for members of the compliance 
 committee or how often they are to scrutinise the fund.
Under this bill, there is not a stringent set of obligations on prospective fund managers and on day-to-day operations. Additionally, the constitution of a scheme may be modified or replaced with a new constitution by the responsible entity as long as it considers the change will not adversely affect the members' rights. This weak regime is in stark contrast to the highly regulated superannuation industry. Even though there is stringent regulation in the superannuation industry, it seems that there is still room for improvement. Thinking of cases such as EC Consolidated Capital and Sentinel, where `rogue fund managers' managed to decimate the life savings of investors, it seems that superannuation regulation has not gone far enough, especially when it might be compulsory.
How can the government possibly consider that the guidelines in the Managed Investments Bill are even close to adequate? Why is the government wanting to resile from commitments to more stringent corporate governance regimes? The Managed Investments Bill is handing over the means to pursue fraud on a golden platter. I can imagine a future Alan Bond or Christopher Skase in the making if this legislation is enacted and then someone will say, `We didn't know.' A similar prediction has been made by the investment managers Maple, Brown, Abbott Ltd in their submission to the committee reviewing this bill. They noted:
Unhappily, we predict that if the bill stays in the present form there will one day be substantial losses to investors which external custody may have avoided.
Let us look at the issue of redress. The bill leaves aggrieved investors to rely entirely on the Australian Securities Commission to take legal action on their behalf. They will no longer have a trustee legally charged with the duty of protecting their interests and supervising the fund manager to protect against fraud and unauthorised dealings. It diminishes the likelihood of private actions by investors, as most cannot afford the time or money to commence an action in the Supreme Court.
The Australian Securities Commission has had no guarantee that its funding will be increased to account for its new role—and perhaps these questions can be answered in the committee stage—and would be required to take an action at public expense to enforce private rights and interests. Mr Cameron of the Australian Securities Commission forewarned the committee by telling them that the ASC did not necessarily see itself being involved in handling complaints by investors against fund managers. So who is going to do it? Or is the answer `nobody'?
Adequate access to mechanisms for redress after the event is an important issue. However, perhaps in this instance it is more important to have preventive measures than remedial ones. It is all a bit too late to recover your life savings when the fund assets have been stripped and divested overseas. The ASC has no standing to pursue a claim for anticipated fraud. However, where a trustee holds the asset it may simply decline to draw the cheque until it is satisfied that everything is above board.
Let us look at some international comparisons. The coalition, as an enthusiast on global competitiveness and world's best practice, has taken a strange and inconsistent line to put Australia wildly out of step with the rest of the world. In 1995, KPMG conducted a survey of 43 developed countries where public offer investment funds were marketed. In all but the British Virgin Islands and the Netherlands Antilles custodians were mandated. After pursuing that road, now even the British Virgin Islands are making independent custodians or trustees mandatory for managed funds. What does that say about Australia?
At a time when the government is continually calling for investment and claiming to be implementing measures to attract investment, this bill seems to work against such aims. It is questionable whether the UK, US or European pension funds will be able to invest in SRE schemes. The bill may also encourage Australian investors to move their money offshore in order to receive higher protection. How does this subvert the parliamentary process?
The bill contains little substance on how the legislation will operate in practice. Mr Cameron of the ASC describes the legislation as `outcomes based', which is a nice way of saying that a hell of a lot of meat in the legislation cannot be scrutinised before the bill is passed. That seems to be a growing theme with this government at the moment. Important elements of investor protection have been left to the Australian Securities Commission to determine—for example, how separation of trust property is to be achieved. Neither draft regulations or ASC policy guidelines exist in relation to this bill.
This makes it difficult to know how the law will operate. This bill makes rights unduly dependent on ill-defined administrative powers and usurps the parliamentary process. Moreover, the government has lumped the ASC with the onus of monitoring and regulating funds. This huge increase in responsibility has not had a commensurate increase in funding. Indeed, the ASC has this extra burden in the face of a huge slash in its compliance and regulation budget.
Why is this scheme anti-competitive? The Managed Investments Bill positively operates in an inequitable manner that disadvantages small fund managers. The effect is the creation of an anti-competitive environment; something I think the government would be horrified by, at least in practice.
The bill operates to the advantage of large fund managers for two reasons. Firstly, the increased compliance cost under the new arrangements will be proportionately higher for small fund managers. Large institutions may already have the accounting and legal resources to provide safeguards for investors, but small funds would have to set them up from scratch. On top of that, they would have to hire expensive outside directors and compliance committee members. Secondly, small fund managers have a high level of credibility with investors where there is an independent trustee.
Consequently, with lower confidence levels coupled with increased costs, it would be very difficult for a small fund to enter or survive in the current market. These arrangements severely drag on the profitability and flexibili 
 ty of small fund managers. As some of the small fund managers have noted in their submissions to the committee of review of the Managed Investments Bill, the solution seems obvious; let the fund managers who wish to retain trustees keep them, with the proviso that the fund manager is responsible. That would clear up the buck passing worries, while making it commercially viable for smaller fund managers to have a presence in the market.
At a time when the crisis in Asia's financial markets is being blamed on cronyism and the lack of investment transparency, why would the government think it prudent to weaken investor protection in a manner out of step with international practice and put many aspects of investment regulation in the unguided ASC regulations?
I listened to the remaining contribution of Senator Murray and he mentioned that amendments will be put to this bill. The Greens would like to see changes to this bill as well and would like to see the government responding in a responsible way to the legitimate concerns of not only the wider community—those who know about what they are doing—but also those people who are working on a day-to-day basis with this kind of fund management and who are issuing the strongest possible warning signs that the government is going in the wrong direction in this particular bill.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I rise to speak briefly on the Managed Investments Bill. I have enjoyed being a part of the discussions in the committee stage of this bill. We have been swamped by information, material, newspaper comment and representations. It is clearly a bill about which there is much interest in the community, although possibly it is limited to the financial parts of the community. Certainly, the financial journalists have been writing at length on it.
Like the previous speakers, Senator Margetts and Senator Murray, one of the major concerns that the Labor Party has on this bill is the question of investor protection and whether or not investors—small investors in particular—will be better off under the 
 single responsible entity regime or better of by maintaining some form of trustee or custodian.
The Labor Party has looked at this bill, which commenced under our previous government when it was referred to as collective investment reform. We made a number of recommendations that were put into a bill which never made it into the parliament. The government picked up the ball and has moved pretty much with the same bill, although with a couple of important differences.
What has been the history of collective investments, or managed investments as they are now called? When you look at what happened to AustWide and Estate Mortgage and the difficulties encountered under the existing regime, you can understand the calls over many years about the need for greater reform. Many investors lost substantial amounts. There was argument about who was responsible and whether it was the fund manager or the trustee. Those are the sorts of issues that this bill is attempting to address.
Through the committee process we have also been made aware of the shenanigans that can go on even if you have a single responsible entity. I would like to quote one example, without naming any names or the institution involved. It was given in evidence to us in a confidential sense, so I need to restrict that, unfortunately. It is to do with one of the major banks.
Senator Sherry interjecting—
—No, it is confidential, Senator Sherry. One of the major banks had an unsuccessful share issue that was underwritten by many investment bankers in Australia. About the time that this underwriting was coming to a close, it was clear to the market that there would be a significant shortfall, that the shares were overpriced, and that the market was not going to take up the underwriting.
At the time, not only the trustees but other interest groups noticed that something unusual was happening. Without any previous strategies being announced, a number of the managed funds decided to direct their funds 
 to start buying this particular bank's shares in large numbers and out of sequence and context.
It is too easy in those circumstances for people not to realise. It is too easy for members' funds to be put into these sorts of investments with these sorts of problems. The outcome of the intervention of the trustees in this case was that the shares in the particular bank were not bought; they were held off. So the price of the shares fell dramatically the day after the close of the underwriting and it was announced that there was a large shortfall. By waiting until after the underwriting closed, and if the decision had then been made to pursue the bank's shares, they would have been purchased at a much cheaper price than they could have been a few days before.
This is the sort of problem which I have concerns about. I am concerned that, by moving without question towards a single responsible entity, the bill as it stands does not have enough investor protection. There are significant investor protections. There are attempts to address these sorts of issues but, if you have a situation where Chinese walls are set up within companies and the fund manager also has pressures from above in relation to investments, you can see that investors will be much worse off. There are other examples regarding properties being bought and sold and revalued at different rates than they otherwise would have been from an independent commercial valuer which can be rushed through the system. We were assured by those who were supporting this bill that that would not happen; that it could not happen. I would like to be 100 per cent comfortable that that would be the case. I am probably not at this stage.
I am looking forward to the parliamentary secretary's contribution to these issues during the committee stage and the debate that will surround Senator Murray's amendments and some of our own amendments, but I would have to say at this stage that I am not completely convinced that those sorts of examples which were brought to the committee's attention can be addressed adequately in the investor protection rules that we are going to be debating. Like Senator Margetts, I am a bit 
 perplexed that, on the one hand, we have a situation where the government is demanding choice of fund for superannuation investors. As the chamber has already heard on the choice of fund legislation, it is not a real choice; it is a choice for employers rather than employees. But it is at least a choice of sorts. So we have the government, on the one hand, trumpeting that they are about the `democratic right to choose' choice of superannuation fund but, on the other hand, introducing a piece of legislation that specifically mandates against choice.
—Choice when it suits them.
—That is exactly right, Senator Sherry; choice when it suits them. This should take away a large degree of the high moral ground that the government claim they have, though any reading of the choice of fund bill shows they do not. They claim that they have a mandate. I understand that they are reintroducing the choice of fund bill for superannuation into the House of Representatives and into the Senate. In the same week they are introducing a bill that says, `You can't have the choice of a custodian or a trustee if you want to pay for one.' A lot has been made in our own report about this issue. One of the opening sentences in the committee's report in relation to this bill states:
More recently, the need for reform has been supported by the final report of the financial system inquiry released on 9 April.
That was very compelling evidence and, as you can see, by leading up the committee's report the committee felt very strongly that that was something that needed to be pointed out. Yet, unfortunately, we have seen a number of members of that committee go public. They have written to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and pointed out that their recommendation was based on the original Labor bill that, in actual fact, is a bit different.
I would like to quote from Mrs Nicholls, who is one of the members of the committee that initially supported the original bill before the government's bill had come to complete fruition. She states:
I support the concerns expressed that the bill in its current form—
that is, the form that we have before us today—
removes sound prudential requirements. I also support the view that the bill inappropriately limits investor choice. I believe investors should be free to choose and pay for the extra protection afforded by an independent trustee.
These are very strong words from somebody who has been championed by one side of the debate, saying this very important, eminent group of people strongly support the bill. The committee was swayed by that, and it is disappointing to see before the end of the debate such a substantial change. Perhaps it was not a change; perhaps not enough information was made available before people started quoting out of context the committee's support for different sections of the bill.
This is a letter to Mr Costello, the Treasurer. I am sure Senator Campbell has seen it and has possibly had some discussions about it. Perhaps in his speech we may be able to hear a little of his discussions—the toned down version—with any of the members of the committee. Professor Ian Harper, who was one of the main people involved with the report and who is to be the chair of APRA—one of the two key bodies that will be administering the financial sector after 1 July—is another person who has written to the government expressing his concern. If the head of APRA is concerned about the bill, that is reason enough for this chamber to have a good hard think about where it is going with this bill and not just glibly brush it off. It is not the trustees, it is not one of the two sets of vested interests that have been so heavily involved in this debate; these are the government's hand-picked members of their committee. More importantly, the head of one of the regulatory authorities is expressing concern about sound prudential requirements being removed.
Notwithstanding the debate which has raged on both sides, where we have seen substantial amounts of time and effort go into this bill, there are genuine concerns which through the course of the debate I am hoping we get a chance to air. I think Senator Murray is moving a string of amendments about which 
 we will have a chance to hear the government's position, to hear more from the government than we have heard previously, to hear responses to Mrs Nicholls, Professor Carmichael and Professor Harper. Because these are opinions of people that the government weighs very heavily.
We have a whole set of legislation—legislation which I think the Senate may have been dealing with just before this—which was recommended by these individuals; their views carried the day on a whole string of reforms to the financial sector. It just perplexes me as to why, when they write to the government and say, `Look, we're a little concerned that you're going in this direction on this particular financial reform,' all of a sudden their views are to be ignored. So I hope that the government and Senator Campbell are in a position to enlighten us on these things.
The other issue that has been taken up strongly by the Labor Party—and I know that Senator Campbell at various stages has made a number of interjections during debates on this issue—is the resourcing of the ASC. Again, we are looking with some interest for Senator Campbell's reassurances on this. I have to say that, following the budget—
—Is it in the legislation?
—No. Following the budget—
—L-a-w.
—Very good, ten out of ten.
—Never, ever.
—He can spell `law'. He cannot spell `never ever', but he can spell `law'.
—Order! Senator Conroy, get on with your speech and do not respond to interjections from either side. That would be helpful.
—Thank you. The ASC resources that were delivered in the federal budget are not sufficient—they are not sufficient as they stand at the moment. I know that 
 Senator Campbell will have a bit to say on that, so I am looking forward to that.
—You won't put a figure on it then?
—A 10 per cent increase; there you are; 10 per cent more.
—Can we put that in your budget figures before the election?
—Why don't you who are in charge of the area put up some money?
—Order! Senator Conroy, address your comments through the chair, and refrain from responding to interjections.
—It would be nice if they were not coming.
—Just refrain and continue, Senator Conroy.
—The issue of the resourcing of the ASC is critical. It would be interesting to know the views of Professor Harper, Professor Carmichael and Mrs Nicholls on whether or not there is sufficient funding for the ASC. Professor Harper, in particular, is heading up one of these two financial regulators. He will have a very keen interest in the level of support that the government is prepared to put into these regulators.
The Labor Party is disappointed—and we stress this in the report—about the level of funding in the ASC. I would like to make the point that this is not to be seen as a criticism of the ASC. The ASC is underfunded now; it has been underfunded in the past. I am not trying to apportion partisan blame on this. We have seen what has happened through the 1980s and 1990s. Things are a lot cleaner now than they used to be. But there are still a lot of shonky operators, and there is still a great need for the ASC to maintain its activities in a number of areas.
At estimates I have raised the question of the checking of prospectuses and company reports. This is an area where the ASC, because of funding constraints, has decided to reallocate its priorities and cut an entire program of auditing of company reports. It has taken that decision—and this is the ASC 
 speaking—`on the basis that we believe it can be better done in a different way.' It is disappointing to see the ASC doing that. It is disappointing to see the ASC walking away from creating the corporate culture. But these are the sorts of responses it has to make when it keeps getting more and more responsibility and less and less funds.
So, as I have said, this is not an attack on the ASC. The ASC is heavily worked but, unfortunately, underfunded. That is a criticism that could probably apply fairly across the governments of both parties in the last few years. We have a situation where there is not less corporate fraud than there was before the last election or in the 12 months before the last election; there is more corporate fraud. There is more need for regulators to chase up what has been going on in the corporate sector. We have seen the Crown Casino under the constant attention of the ASC—that is right, Senator Murray, this is one of my favourite topics. We have seen a whole range of companies that have got away with some fairly shonky practices.
I would like to finish up by talking about one of the strongest arguments that seems to have been put forward by one of the trustees, and that is this: there are few countries around the world with just the single responsible entity in this particular area. We have seen Australia, if you like, take the leading edge with this particular debate; we are moving to single responsible entities before others. The government is saying, `Well, it doesn't matter what the rest of the world has done; it doesn't matter that no-one else in the world has been prepared to take this jump that we are taking'.
But to the contrary, the government keeps putting forward as one of its strongest arguments for tax reform that, `We've got to have a GST because everyone else has got a GST.' Well, everyone else also has custodians and trustees—but that does not seem to be a convenient argument at the moment. Many other countries have death duties; but Australia is not saying that, on the basis of our being one of the few countries in the world without death duties, we should reintroduce death duties. This just seems selective to me. At one point it suits the government to say, `We've 
 got to have all these reforms, we've got to be moving in this direction because the rest of the world has it and we are lagging behind.' Then all of a sudden, when it conveniently suits the government, we are going in the other direction.
Those are the sorts of issues on which I am looking forward to hearing a response from the government. I am looking forward to the committee stage with this legislation. We are not looking to unduly slow down the processes of the Senate with what will be a very busy agenda in the next couple of weeks. But we certainly will be raising these questions in the committee stage. We will be looking forward to the answers, and we hope that some of those answers come through and allow themselves to clarify.
We also have a number of amendments that perhaps do not go as far as Senator Murray's amendments. But it will be interesting to listen to the debate on those issues. I will finish there and just reiterate that we are looking forward to the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-06-22,"—I acknowledge what Senator Conroy has just said; I think it is a very important point that the government should consider very carefully. As Senator Conroy has said, Australia should be at the leading edge of measures to protect investors. We seem to be at that leading edge all right. But the question we have to ask ourselves of these measures that are currently before us is whether we, as a parliament, are being asked to pass laws which reduce and in some cases deny investors the right to protect themselves, which make illegal forms of business organisations which were not only formerly legal, but compulsory measures to protect investors.
I think it is even more disconcerting for the chamber to reflect on the fact that the  Managed Investments Bill 1997  may be described as `creating new engines of fraud'. That is my opinion, but, before I am accused of not understanding the intricate, complex and sophisticated financial matters that relate to this question, I would like to say that that is the expressed opinion of Mr Trevor Sykes, a pre-eminent Australian financial journalist, who has written two histories of Australian 
 financial crashes entitled Two Centuries of Panic and The Bold Riders, the latter dealing with the excesses of the 1980s. I realise that the 1980s are ancient history to some people, and I realise that it is even more ancient history to point out that in the United Kingdom, unit trusts were first regulated under the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1939.
But the prevention of fraud is of great interest to some 2.5 million investors in unit trusts—many of whom are independent retirees. The test to be applied to this bill is whether or not it helps prevent fraud or facilitates it. It is the opinion of many witnesses from the Corporations and Securities Commission as well as Mr Sykes and other reputable journalists that this bill will leave investors less protected—that, in fact, is my opinion, but it is not original. I am therefore disappointed that the majority report of the committee has not reflected the weight of evidence presented to it in that regard.
In the brief time available to me, I will point out some points of deficiency in the bill. The bill reduces investor protection and investor choice. The Managed Investments Bill proposes radical changes to the laws that have, for the past 45 years, protected investors in unit trusts, share trusts, property trusts and other forms of collective investment from misleading, maladministration and self-dealing by the promoters and managers of such schemes. The Corporations Law currently requires all such schemes to have an independent trustee—that is, a public corporation approved by the Australian Securities Commission to act as trustee—or, in limited cases, a related party trustee to hold the assets of the scheme in safe custody and to monitor the management, investments and operation of the scheme to ensure compliance with the Corporations Law, the general law and the trust deed which established the scheme.
The stated aim of this bill is to create a new single responsible entity structure that is intended to strengthen the protections for investors whilst increasing efficiency and reducing the cost of operating collective investment schemes. The bill also aims to harmonise the regulation of collective investment schemes with that of public offer super 
 annuation schemes operated under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1994, the SIS. That has been alluded to during previous speeches in the second reading debate. I believe the bill fails to achieve these stated objectives in material respects and that a number of substantive amendments are required so that the proposed responsible entity structure will not seriously weaken investor protection and will not deny Australian investors the right to contract for the extra protection of their savings.
The bill does not create a system like either the SIS or the Corporations Law. The bill does not give the same protection as required for superannuation funds. Investors will have neither the rights of beneficiaries of existing unit trusts nor the rights of company shareholders. Most superannuation funds have independent trustees. It is only public offer superannuation funds—currently a very small proportion of total super funds—which do not, and they are closely regulated and required to have either minimum capital or an independent custodian. In the case of corporations, directors are elected directly by and are liable directly to investors. As Alan Cameron, the current chair of the ASC said to the joint parliamentary committee, `managed funds are quite different'.
It should be noted, however, that in relation to corporations there are now proposals to further water down the liability of directors and shareholders. These proposals were recently announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), and, in relation to them, Chanticleer commented in the Australian Financial Review of 18 March, as follows:
By comparison with the past, the new order will also make life a paradise for company directors. The risk of directors being sued by regulators and shareholders has been severely curtailed, with directors' liability now limited to cases involving evidence of criminality or gross and wilful negligence.
Will the bill improve investor protection? Let me quote again from the evidence of Mr Alan Cameron the chairman of the ASC to the joint parliamentary committee. He stated:
Whether [the Bill] ultimately brings about an improvement in investor protection, or the same level, or a reduction, will depend . . . on a whole 
 lot of measures that I am not quite sure how you will actually construct, but, more importantly, upon what actually happens—what people do in response to all of these provisions.
The committee heard no evidence that can assure the parliament that fewer investors will lose money under the proposed regime. Indeed, in her submission to the committee, the Victorian Attorney-General Wade stated:
There can be no doubt that under the proposed regime there will be greater likelihood of loss to investors and less likelihood that they will recover their losses.
Mrs Wade is a former Commissioner for Corporate Affairs in Victoria, the predecessor to the ASC with responsibility for this area of regulation. Mr Alan Cameron also stated:
I do not see this legislation as fundamentally transferring the obligation to monitor investment and so on to the individual investors. . . . I see this as a whole collection of remedies which, taken together and working effectively, should look after the interests of investors at least as well as, if not better than, they are presently looked after.
He said further:
The intention of the Bill . . . is to be preventative: to ensure as far as one can that these problems do not arise in the first place. It is a matter of judgment as to whether this, on the whole, produces this result.
That is very tentative. This is a faint assurance for the parliament that the bill will not diminish investor protection. Honourable senators will recall the failure of the ASC to act in the NRMA demutualisation case to protect members from a misleading and deceptive prospectus. We all recall that, when the profit results shortly after the prospectus differed by many millions of dollars from the prospectus forecast, the ASC did nothing. At the time I asked questions concerning this, and I must say I certainly was not very satisfied with the answers. I am still awaiting answers to questions that I put forward at the committee dealing with the Treasury estimates in respect of this area as well.
At the end of the day, the ASC can only act after the event at best and may be subject to attempts at improper influence at worst. Unless the Senate can be assured that the bill is clearly and demonstrably better than the current arrangements, the legislation should be 
 rejected as costly, unnecessary and achieving no material improvement. Again, I quote Attorney-General Wade. She says:
I have argued . . . that the changes to the regulation . . . adopted in the bill are both deficient and unnecessary. I am not confident that the structure proposed will enhance investor protection.
Who can doubt that investor security is of paramount importance? As Mr Kell from the Australian Consumer Association said in evidence to the joint committee:
[Investors] think security is important, that is a very important issue for consumers. . . . They do not have any particular concern, in our experience, as to how that security is delivered at the end of the day as long as it is there. . . . They do not have the financial sophistication or interest to go any steps beyond that level of knowledge.
I entirely agree that it is very difficult for ordinary investors to fully understand how their security is delivered, but this is precisely what they will need to do if the trustee role is abolished. Under current law, investors who invest in managed funds write their cheques to trustee companies and they have the comfort of knowing that there is a creditworthy and responsible independent party supervising their fund and ensuring safe custody of its assets. Why should they be made to worry about the details of security? By contrast, under this bill they will be completely reliant upon financial planners and others to advise them on the relative risks and security issues associated with different classes of managed funds, depending upon the array of flexible ASC policies that will be put into place.
That raises a further issue: the extraordinarily wide delegation of legislative power in this bill to the ASC to modify the bill by regulation, in effect. We do not know really what we are voting for. The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances should be appalled by the sloppiness of the drafting style which has been put before the Senate here. How can a self-respecting legislative body pass a law abdicating parliamentary rights and duties to frame legislation? The bill is full of vague waffle words which are undefined and will end up meaning whatever the ASC wants them to mean. If that is the case, this is not law. This does not define rights and duties; this is confusion of concepts 
 and confusion of legislative and executive roles.
The next point is that the bill should be amended to strengthen accountability to investors. The bill should make the directors and officers of a responsible entity directly liable to investors if they fail to ensure the proper operation of the scheme. Under current law, both scheme managers and independent trustees are directly liable to investors if they breach their duty of care or trust. Directors and officers of responsible entities of public offer superannuation schemes are directly accountable to investors under the SIS Act. This outcome is not, however, achieved under this bill, despite it being a fundamental rationale of the bill that the protections currently provided to investors will not be weakened but strengthened.
Under the bill, only the responsible entity or the ASC—but not the investor who suffers loss—may sue the directors and officers of the responsible entity for compensation if loss is suffered due to failure to exercise proper care and diligence in meeting all requirements of the law, the scheme constitution and the compliance plan. This outcome diminishes the effectiveness of investor protection compared to the current law.
Empowering the responsible entity to sue its own directors and officers, as the bill does, provides little comfort to investors, as the wrongdoers are in a position to influence or determine the responsible entity's decision whether to take action.
—They will suit themselves; of course they will.
—Yes, Senator Margetts. The bill leaves aggrieved investors to rely entirely on the ASC to take legal action on their behalf. This outcome is undesirable from a public policy point of view and disadvantages the investors. It diminishes the likelihood of private enforcement action by investors and requires the ASC to take action at public expense to enforce private rights and interests.
Next, the bill should be amended to preserve investor choice to engage an independent trustee. Now, at the very minimum, 
 parliament should not deny people the right to take what steps they think necessary to protect their money from sophisticated white-collar crime, especially when Internet money transfers are opening up new opportunities for sophisticated crime. People have a right to contract for the protection of their money as they think best. The bill should be amended so as to permit investors in both existing schemes and new schemes to choose either to retain an independent trustee or to register under the single responsible entity structure created by the bill. The bill should require a resolution of the investors in existing schemes as a precondition to conversion to the new law.
The bill affects a very large number of Australian investors. As many as 2.5 million Australians now hold investments, directly or indirectly, in non-superannuation collective investment schemes. A large number of investors and fund managers wish to continue to invest in and operate schemes with an independent trustee assuming fiduciary responsibility to them for the proper administration of the scheme. The merits of the new, untried, single responsible entity arrangements created under the bill are not so powerful as to deny investors and fund managers wishing to do so the option of operating managed funds with an independent trustee structure. Such a structure is not only permitted but mandated in most major overseas jurisdictions. The reasons put forward for abandoning that structure in Australia and, what is more, prohibiting such a structure are neither supported by the evidence nor compelling, as clearly demonstrated by the evidence submitted to the joint committee.
Next, the bill trespasses unduly on personal rights and liberties—and I note the Scrutiny of Bills Committee did not invite the minister to address some fundamental issues on people's rights. The bill denies the beneficial owners of some $85 billion of assets in collective investments the right to continue to have those assets held for them on the same terms and conditions, and with the same level of protection that they currently enjoy. It is clearly retrospective in that the bill seeks to overturn established contractual and equitable 
 rights and obligations without the consent of those affected.
Retrospective abrogation of legal contractual rights has always been repugnant to this parliament, as it is in other countries which adhere to this rule of law. I would like to see some detailed legal advice on the constitutional aspects of this bill in relation to heads of legislative power and limits on legislative power. The constitution of the United States of America, for example, expressly forbids any state from passing laws which impair the obligation of contracts and generally forbids ex post facto laws. The Commonwealth parliament is being asked to pass a bill which no American state would regard as a proper exercise of legislative power.
I will be very interested to hear discussion during the committee stage. I have been looking at and considering Senator Murray's proposal, Senator Conroy's proposal and Senator Margetts's proposal, but I do urge the Senate not to be rushed into passing a bill which may come back to haunt its promoters and, by implication, ourselves.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—I would like to start where Senator Harradine concluded, in terms of rushing this legislation. Before I do so I would thank all honourable senators who have contributed to the second reading debate, particularly Senator Murray and Senator Conroy who have taken a very close interest in this debate over many months. I would also recognise the cooperation that we have had from the Australian Labor Party and former Senator Gareth Evans, now the shadow Treasurer, and the advisers in his and Senator Cook's office in coming to a sensible understanding of how the arrangements will work.
In response to the allegation of rushing the legislation through that has been made by others, I developed a time line of the law reform process in this case—and I will seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard at the conclusion of my speech—which outlines the reform process and which shows it beginning in 1989 with the Estate Mortgage collapse. Many of the people who were investors in Estate Mortgage relied on the existence of a 
 trustee to save them from losing money. Those investors, regardless of the money recovered from the trustees, lost millions upon millions of dollars. Former Attorney-General Duffy referred it to CASAC and ALRC for report.
While ALRC and CASAC were reporting into that, Australia was to witness the Aust-Wide collapse. This was yet another investment scheme where the investors, the mums and dads, had relied on the trustee being in place to secure their assets. Those who defend the existing two-tiered system would say that with the trustee in place that makes it safe. But millions upon millions of small investors' money was lost. Some of the funds were recovered seven years down the track. The schedule, which I will incorporate, shows that even though the collapse took place at the beginning of the 1990s, after ASC action against the trustees, some of the funds were recovered from the trustee, its insurers and its lawyers in September 1997. Certainly the investors would have been pleased to recover some, but I reiterate, at the risk of boring honourable senators, that millions upon millions of dollars of investors's money was lost.
That is the reason why the previous government, in the early 1990s, asked CASAC and the Law Reform Commission to look into this. That is why CASAC, the Law Reform Commission and, later, the Wallis committee, recommended a single line of responsibility for those people who get the investment dollars from the investors—that they be responsible to those investors for the investment, for complying with the investment scheme and for the custody of those assets. It was not for them to be able to say, `Sorry, the trustee is supposed to do that and if the trustee fails, bad luck' but for that single entity to be responsible for those funds.
In June 1998 the legislation is finally being debated in the parliament. There has been integrated and full consultation throughout the proposal, starting off with the release of draft legislation by Attorney-General Lavarch in December 1995, followed by consultations with me and the Treasurer throughout 1996 and 1997. There was then the release of draft 
 legislation, reference to the committee and further consultation and discussion over a period. This process will conclude, if this legislation gets through after a two-year transition period, some 11 or 12 years after the Estate Mortgage collapse.
I want to conclude this debate prior to question time, and I will try to cover the key elements raised by honourable senators. All of the investor representatives who appeared before the committee, and who have publicly commented on this legislation, have supported it almost without reservation. The Australian Shareholders Association and the Australian Consumer Association have been very vocal supporters of this legislation. If you read Peter Kell's evidence to the committee and if you look at subsequent press releases and letters written by the Australian Consumers Association—certainly not always supporters of what this government does in the financial area—you will see that they are vigorous supporters, on behalf of the shareholders and the consumers, of this legislation being passed. They believe, as the government does, that this legislation will enhance investor protection. That is why we have spent this time developing the law. That is why we have put in place the law and the structure of the single responsible entity. We have done so to protect investors. There is no other reason for it.
Senator Conroy raised the point about funding for the ASC. He has committed the opposition to a further increase in funding to the ASC, which Mr Evans will have to now put into his costings for the election campaign. He has said that we keep giving the ASC—soon to be called the ASIC—more and more responsibilities but less and less funding. The reality is that we have given the ASC more and more funding and more and more responsibility. In my contribution to the Wallis debate on the last sitting day, I went into some detail as to what that funding was, and I will not repeat it in this debate.
To say that this scheme does not offer investors choice is baloney. This scheme—the single responsible entity scheme—will offer investors far more choice than they have ever had before. At the moment, they have to have a two-tiered scheme. Under this, they can 
 have a scheme that has an independent custodian. They can have a scheme that has internal arrangements for custody. I predict that, under this scheme, the trustee organisations themselves will act as the custodian in many schemes in Australia for many years to come.
Senator Margetts, who comes from the state of Western Australia, said that this legislation was designed by the big end of town for the big end of town. I think Senator Murray may have made this point as well. The reality is that the small funds—with one or two exceptions that I know well—in Western Australia all want this legislation. I believe that Precedent Financial Services in Western Australia will have written to Senator Margetts saying, `We need this legislation.' In relation to the investor protection regime and the custody regime, the ASC has already published a detailed policy statement. They have been consulting with the trustee industry and the managed funds industry over the past six to eight weeks, and any honourable senator who wanted this could have received it from my office. I understand that I had offered full copies of this to every senator in this place.
In response to some points raised by Senator Conroy, I understand from reading the Age article from, I think, last week that Professor Carmichael, who had written a letter to the Treasurer in relation to this legislation, made it quite clear that, having read the Australian Securities Commission's policy guidelines on this legislation, he had withdrawn his opposition. I have not spoken to Professor Carmichael about this but, according to the Age article, he was comfortable with the bill and he did not see it as being inconsistent with Wallis.
This morning's Financial Review makes the point that the other person who wrote a letter, Ms Linda Nicholls, was indeed a member of the board of Perpetual Trustees. The Chairman of Perpetual Trustees has made it very clear that this bill, if it passes, will reduce the income to Perpetual Trustees. For Ms Nicholls to oppose the bill is not that confusing when you see that her shareholders may reduce the income to that company if the trustee's role is reduced.
The government believes that this proposal will increase investor protection. We have been discussing a couple of amendments with the Australian Labor Party. I indicate that we regard them as acceptable to the government, and we have been working on a set of words in this regard. I think with those amendments to the bill, which has a start up date of 1 July, will see a new and much brighter era for managed investments in Australia. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.
Ordered that consideration of the bill in the Committee of the Whole be made an order of the day for a later hour this day.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given today by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), to questions without notice asked by Senators Neal and West today, relating to Centrelink and the youth allowance.
This largely relates to the recent changes occurring in the youth allowance area. I suppose what always astonishes me so much about this particular government, and to some extent Senator Newman's views of those policies as they relate to youth allowance, is that they constantly state that they support families and they support battling families but this is not in accordance with what they are actually doing. On every occasion when they have an opportunity, this government and this Minister for Social Security in fact reduce the amount of money that is in families' pockets, and they often take the money out of the pockets of the families who are worst off.
It was interesting that the minister noted that the issue of battling families was one that was raised on a number of occasions in debate in this chamber on the youth allowance, where we discovered, much to our concern, that almost 48,000 families who are not very well-off—families earning just over $23,000—would be worse off as a result of the youth allowance bill introduced by this minister. It is interesting to me that, despite the questions that have been raised today and despite numerous matters that have been raised in this chamber before, this government seems to be unable to see that a family on $23,400 is not a family that is well-off.
I found it quite extraordinary that Senator Newman, during the debate on the youth allowance bill, told this chamber and the people of Australia that such families that had at least one adult child over the age of 18 
 years were well-off. Let me tell Senator Hill, Senator Newman and all the other senators on the other side that most people in Australia do not think that a family that earns $23,000 is well-off. In fact, most people would think that families that were earning that sort of money were really struggling. It is quite extraordinary that this government, which said during the election that they intended to look after battling families, families that were really having a hard time of it, are making it even more difficult for those families by taking away $87 per week when there is an adult child who is unemployed. That is what this youth allowance legislation does.
It seems that the rush to get this legislation through and the rush to get the information technology up might all be for nothing, because it appears, from Senator West's question and the response that was received, that there are so many problems in the computer system and in the new newstart computer platform that it seems unlikely to me that within such a short time before 1 July they will really have it operating properly. The question that was put to Senator Newman was whether the youth allowance computer system had crashed after just 90 minutes of running. I thought it was quite extraordinary that Senator Newman was unwilling or unable to answer that question. She managed to avoid it and to talk about the difficulties of the year 2000 in relation to computer programs. I am sure it is very interesting for people to discuss the issues of the millennium bug, but that was not the question that was directed to her by Senator West. What we are trying to discover is whether this government, which says it is going to introduce this new youth allowance package on 1 July, is really in a position to do so and whether the computer system that has been set up, at major cost to the government and to taxpayers, is in fact in a position to operate effectively as of 1 July.
Despite all these difficulties and the fact that the government are spending $3.8 million on telling the Australian community what a brilliant policy response they have made, they have failed to tell those families who are struggling, those earning $23,400, that many 
 of them—almost 50,000 of them—are in fact going to be worse off as a result of the youth allowance package. It seems quite extraordinary that you can expend that much money over a very short period; we were told at estimates that that $3.8 million would be spent in just one month. I think the vast majority of Australians would believe that spending that sort of money while taking $87 out of poor families' pockets is very much a waste. It appears to me that the government are spending $3.8 million on promoting themselves in order to put themselves in a better position for the election. They are spending $3.8 million of taxpayers' money to try and convince those battling families whose pockets they are grabbing money out of that, even though they are losing money, the Howard government is in fact helping them by doing so.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1998-06-22,"—The extraordinary thing about Labor's sustained attack on the youth allowance is that it is an attack on an initiative which is actually designed to assist young people. What never fails to amaze me is why it would be suggested that we as the party in government would set out to deliberately make things more difficult for young people. It is pretty obvious that the youth allowance is actually assisting young people or else we would not have this sustained, ongoing and unjustifiable attack.
The salient and the very good features of the youth allowance, which it is necessary to repeat once again, include the most attractive feature of it, which is that it simplifies income support arrangements for young people by combining five payments types and by reducing 13 different rates to just five. The complicated previous system that Labor had pursued left so many people falling between stools and not getting any assistance at all that it was necessary to actually look at how this youth allowance could be streamlined. It will now align both rates and qualifications for all young people up to the age of 21 and remove that incentive for young people to leave education early or to choose unemployment over education or training. It is blindingly obvious that those young people who get 
 education and training will have better opportunities to get jobs.
Parental means testing of students and unemployed people aged up to 21 will also be aligned. You have heard the minister say today that young people with the lowest income families will continue to qualify for maximum rates of assistance under the parental means test. There is nothing unfair about that. Access to rent assistance for students and for unemployed 16- to 17-year-olds who live away from home for education or employment reasons is also a significant advance under this policy. Rent assistance is also available to independent young people who live away from home. What a relief it must be for young people who are not living at home and who need rent assistance to actually have that assistance available to them. A flexible activity test allows young people to undertake a variety of activities without having to change payment type.
The abolition of the education leavers deferment period will ensure continuity of income support between leaving school and commencing full-time employment. Students will have access to a higher fortnightly income free income and an income bank of $6,000 designed to accommodate student work patterns for full-time casual employment over vacation periods. That is a significant advance compared to the old policy, under which casual employment actually disqualified people from their benefits; they went on, they went off and they did not know where they were with 13 different rates. The changed independence criteria are, of course, more lenient for students and tighter for some unemployed young people. All youth allowees will have access to the $500 loan advance currently made available under Newstart. That is a great benefit for young people.
There are many winners from the youth allowance. Of the 560,000 young people who will be covered by youth allowance, 416,000 are students and 144,000 are unemployed. Payment for 358,600 will remain unchanged and payment for 153,750 young people will increase. All young people will benefit from the simplified income support system, which provides incentives to remain in education 
 and training and which has the flexibility to cater for a variety of activities undertaken by young people in their transition from school to employment. Students not only gain from the availability of rent assistance but all under 18-year-olds who have to live away from home gain from the increased rates. This is a significant advance and a superior initiative to assist young people into employment.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Youth Allowance</title>,Miscellaneous,7,1
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1998-06-22,"—Senator Coonan has just told us about the wonderful things that her government is doing for people who have dealings with Centrelink. Senator Neal covered quite a lot of her question in that regard in question time. I would like to take this a little bit further with regard to Centrelink. I have had quite a lot of complaints to my office in Ipswich regarding this area. I would like the Senate to know of a couple in particular. The first is from a young man who lives in Caboolture and I would urge the minister to look at the Centrelink in Caboolture to see what can be done.
This man had been to Centrelink at Caboolture and had seen a job on the screen that he felt he was well qualified for. First of all, he rang the number and was told to go all the way to Chermside for an interview. When he said that he lived in Caboolture and the job was also in Caboolture, he was referred to the BAVE Caboolture office. He took his qualifications and one written reference. All of his past employers had advised him that they were willing to provide verbal references whenever they were called for. He took all of his documents, about 10 pages in all, which would have gained him jobs through the CES in the past—he had used these in the past with the CES—and went along to this BAV office in Caboolture. When he presented his resume, apparently the staff member there looked down his nose at him and advised him that his resume was not good enough and that was that. I cannot believe that public servants supposedly there to help people find employment are looking down their noses and saying, `Your resume is not good enough.'
I have here another letter from a pensioner. This man also lives in Caboolture. He phoned the 132300 phone number and told them that his 1998 pensioner concession card and his 
 1998 Queensland travel vouchers were lost. He had not received them. He says:
In mid January I phoned the Centrelink customer service office in Caloundra and told them my pensioner card had not been received. I was told they would look into the matter and send the card with the concessions to me in two weeks.
Two weeks later I received the concession card but the Queensland travel vouchers were also stamped void. When I enquired about the vouchers they said I must have lost my card and received a second issue.
He explained that this was his first pensioner card and travel vouchers. He continued:
Centrelink then told me to fill out a Statutory Declaration then send it with my documents to Queensland Rail as they cannot send any replacements. 29 April I phoned Centrelink 132300 number to make an appointment to see one of their officers for help in filling out the Statutory Declaration and what it was for. Centrelink said that would not be necessary they would send me out a letter that day. Thinking I was talking to some person at the Caloundra office, the letter should be in the mail the next day. 6th May the letter arrived one week later, with Caloundra Post Box number and Caloundra Centrelink address. The letter stating I may not have received by W.A. free rail passes and to send all my documents on to West-Rail to receive new rail passes. The letter was posted from Bunbury W.A.
To cut it short, he phoned Bunbury, Western Australia and said, `Well, I am sorry, that is very nice of you, but I do live in Queensland. I need Queensland Rail passes.' This poor man then rang Centrelink again and he said, `I live in Caboolture. Am I speaking to Caboolture or Brisbane or somewhere in Queensland?' `No,' they said. `This is the Adelaide office, but we will put you through to the Brisbane office.'
This is not funny. I am laughing, but I am laughing because it is the most disgraceful thing I have ever seen. This poor man finally got it all sorted out. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Youth Allowance</title>,Miscellaneous,7,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,1998-06-22,"—The opposition, in taking note of Senator Newman's answer to a question on the youth allowance, criticised the government in a number of areas. The first that I would address is their criticism of the government educating members of the community and explaining the new system. Senator Neal has addressed this issue, in particular criticising 
 the government for placing some money into the budget expenditure on this very issue.
It seems to me and to many others that it is the opposition who would be the first to criticise and the first to complain if a new system were introduced without an effort being made to explain its new aspects to the users of that system. It seems to me that they would be the first to complain if it were not appropriately tested. Senator Neal took issue with that today.
Senator Coonan addressed some of the changes which will be introduced. The most important of the changes is a simplification of income support arrangements for young Australians that combines five payment types and reduces 13 different rates to just five—that is, it simplifies the entire system for the users and the operators and enables young Australians to access the system more effectively.
As I think Senator Coonan noted, this is an initiative designed to assist young people—and let us begin there. For years and years there were complaints about the inequities in the system and the lack of incentive for young people to take up further education and training. I well remember, even in 1987, the much vaunted Priority One program of the previous government—a program that was said to be the answer to the problems of all young Australians. It was certainly decided some years later that it was not any sort of an answer—more like Priority None than Priority One.
In addressing the question of youth allowance, the government has introduced positive initiatives to assist young Australians. The Labor Party, over the 13 years it was in government in this country, had every chance to increase the standard of living of Australian students, and it simply did not do so. This is a social policy reform which is intended to make sure that young people do not see unemployment benefits as the only acceptable alternative to study. It is intended to make sure that those aged under 18 do not just go on the dole but that there is some opportunity for skills acquisition and further training. It is all about incentive. No matter which way you look at it, for years and years the inequity 
 between payments for Austudy and for unemployment benefits simply resulted in young people making the easier decision and choosing unemployment benefits rather than pursuing further education and training. It is this issue which the government has addressed with the changes to the youth allowance system.
Let us look at issues like rent assistance. Young students from country areas in particular were not able to pursue an education because their low to even middle income parents could not afford to send them away. As the minister said in her second reading speech, there is now an opportunity for families, especially those with several children, to be able to afford to send their young people away for further education largely because of the availability of rent assistance which makes a real difference. They have a chance of getting skills; they have a chance of getting an education.
This is merely one aspect of the government's initiatives in this area. I have spent months and months in various regional parts of New South Wales looking at government initiatives in relation to young people, particularly work for the dole, where young people have finally found some incentive and some initiative to participate in schemes and programs such as this. These are not programs that just shift numbers around as they were under the previous government—statistically convenient, yes, but in reality doing nothing for the young Australians they were supposed to benefit.
What we are doing in the initiatives under the youth allowance changes is making it clear that those young people, particularly under the age of 18, should focus—and so should their families—on what is valuable from training and education. Academic education, yes; vocational training, as the minister has previously said, yes. It is all about leading to jobs and to greater opportunities for people to participate in the work force. It is all about assisting young people and providing a focus for their activities when there are difficulties in other areas.

"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I also want to address the issue of 
 Centrelink. To start with, I want to quote from an article in the Tasmanian Mercury  last Wednesday, the 17th, headed `Rush to recover payouts in dole bungle'. It reads:
Social Security officials are scrambling to recover unemployment benefits which may have been paid accidentally to hundreds of Tasmanians.
A glitch in Centrelink's new computer system caused former social security recipients to be put back on the payment list.
The programming bug has also resulted in some unemployed Tasmanians missing out on benefits and others receiving double payments.
I want to address briefly the issue of some people missing out on their unemployment benefits. I have had a lass in my Ulverstone office over the last few weeks—actually a longer period than that—who has had her last four cheques not go into her account on time. The last cheque was paid in the following day. My officers work on this each time her payments have not come in. They have phoned Centrelink and we have been assured that the problem has been fixed. We will be interested to see the next time the payment is due whether it goes in on time, but it certainly has not been going on in time.
This lass is a young woman living in Ulverstone. She has no family support. She has done some casual work here and there, but she relies on that payment. She has absolutely no other means of support at this stage. It is frightening for her to go to her bank and find nothing has been paid in.
Another case has come to my office of a woman who was caring for her pensioner husband. She lived out in the country, outside Devonport. Her husband was taken ill and hospitalised. She moved into town at the time of his hospitalisation and he passed on. She is a woman of 60 or 61. She stayed in town to make his funeral arrangements and those sorts of things. She went to Centrelink to tell them of the change in her circumstances. She was told to fill in documents, which she did. She was told to wait in a queue. She waited two hours under very stressful circumstances, because her husband had just died. Six weeks later she has had no acknowledgment of her application for assistance. She is still waiting to hear what Centrelink are going to do to try to resolve her situation.
Those sorts of cases are very difficult. They should not be happening. They are happening to people—and particularly in this woman's case—who are stressed and are not thinking clearly. She needs assistance, but it is not forthcoming. She has had a very difficult time.
The article in the Mercury also states, `As far as customers are concerned, the problem is totally ironed out.' As I have explained, in two of the cases that have come to me—there have been others, but these are two very diverse cases—the problem has not been ironed out. Certainly in the area where I live it has not been ironed out. Hopefully, it will be addressed and addressed soon.
The CPSU put out a media release in March warning that this new computer system would fail and that staffing levels should be maintained. I think they have proven their point. This new computer system has failed. They go on to say that the warning was ignored, experienced IT staff left, 1,300 jobs were cut and now there is a major problem. Information I have today, which is contrary to what Senator Newman has said, tells me that, as from lunch time today, there are still 827 faults in the system. Somewhere someone needs to check these facts because that was what came to me today—827 faults still in the system.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Youth Allowance</title>,Miscellaneous,7,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1998-06-22,"—We just heard Senator Denman and the previous Labor speaker, Senator Gibbs, take their five minutes to relate a very personal story directly related to their electorates. Not doubting that those stories have substance, though they may have embellished them somewhat as they came into the parliament, the truth of the matter is—and every parliamentarian know this; members of the House of Representatives and senators from both sides of the house—when there is a genuine social security problem, a constituent comes to your office, inevitably that can be fixed up by the office of the minister—from either side of the parliament and in the previous government. When there are personal problems, the staff of the ministers will attend to those directly. So to come in here and use that as an example of the utter failure of the 
 new system this government is trying to introduce is wrong and adds no substance to the argument at all.
When the coalition first came into government it was met with a social welfare system that was riddled with fraud, that was complex, that was totally overloaded and that was simply out of date. Quite frankly, in many parts of the community it was quite resented. That is what was allowed to be built up over the last 13 years of the previous government.
—Jeff Kennett was right.
—That was the system we came into.
—He was right, wasn't he?
—Order! Senator Carr!
—Madam Deputy President, allow me not to be baited by Senator Carr with that tiresome interjection that he uses against me on each and every occasion. On our coming into government we were met with that sort of system and no other minister in the last 13 years or since Dame Margaret Guilfoyle was the Minister for Social Security has brought such reform to the system. She has brought a discipline to the department not previously seen and a responsibility to the department not previously seen.
Quite frankly, as Senator Payne pointed out in her address, there have been years of concern and complaint and the minister has acted quite responsibly and aggressively to clean up those complaints within the system.	First of all, she has clamped down on social security fraud. That is exactly what the community asked for. The community had a pent-up resentment against the system. We have clamped down on fraud and we are saving some $28 million a week—a phenomenal amount. But our reforms do not take benefits away from people who qualify for them; we have just clamped down on fraud.
It is important to note that the youth allowance is an important reform. People should have the facts before them. First and foremost, all the research shows that young people have a much better chance of getting a job if they have at least completed year 12. 
 I am saying this for the benefit of those gigglers up in there in the gallery. Youth allowance provides the right incentives by making sure young people are not better off on the dole but are able to complete their education or training. This measure targets students, that is, around 70 per cent of the total youth allowance population of around 560,000.
Access to the youth allowance will mean that, for the first time, young people will have access to the same benefits available to young unemployed people: rent assistance, pharmaceutical assistance, a $500 interest free advance on their payment and more lenient, independent criteria.
Senator Margetts interjecting—
Senator Stott Despoja interjecting—
—You doubt that there will be more lenient, independent criteria?
—Order! Senator Margetts and Senator Stott Despoja! Senator McGauran, would you please address the chair and ignore the interjections coming from down there?
Senator Faulkner interjecting—
—Order! Senator Faulkner! Senator McGauran, please continue.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy President. If students have to leave home to study or to train—namely, students from rural and regional areas of Australia—the youth allowance gives them extra help. (Time expired)

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-06-22,"—I move:
That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on Friday, 5 June 1998, of Donald Newton Cameron, a senator for the State of South Australia from 1969 to 1978, places on record its appreciation of his public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Don Cameron was born at Murray Bridge, South Australia on 13 January 1914. He was educated at Gawler High School and, after leaving school, worked as a shearer. Before entering federal politics, Don was an organiser with the Australian Workers Union. He was Secretary of the South Australian Branch of the AWU from 1965 to 1969. He was also President of the South Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party from 1967 to 1968.
Don was elected to the Senate in 1969 to fill a casual vacancy and remained in the Senate until his retirement in 1978. During his time in the Senate Don was a member of various committees, including the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Committee on Health and Welfare and the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Committee on Trade and Commerce.
In June 1978, valedictory speeches were made in the Senate noting the retirement of several senators. In these remarks, Don was characterised as being a quiet senator who was an ardent worker, often adding wisdom in contributions to debate. This was considered to distinguish his speeches from the ordinary party arguments in the parliament at the time. Don Cameron was, indeed, a tireless worker during his time in the Senate and will be remembered kindly and with the same respect which he earned while serving in this place.
Madam President, on behalf of the government, l extend to his wife, Colleen, and his family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Former Senator Donald Newton Cameron</title>,Condolences,8,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I rise on behalf of the opposition to support this condolence motion that has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate on the death of Don Cameron, who 
 was, of course, a very well known former South Australian Labor senator. I say on behalf of the opposition that Labor senators do express our deep regret over his death and we offer our most sincere condolences to his wife, Colleen, and his family.
As Senator Hill has indicated, Don Cameron was first elected to the Senate in 1969 to fill a casual vacancy. He retired in 1978 after serving the people of the state of South Australia with great dedication and distinction for those nine years in the parliament. He was a man of honour and character, and I know he really will be missed very much by his colleagues, particularly his friends in South Australia.
While I did not know Don Cameron personally, I certainly know members of his family. His brother, Clyde Cameron, is of course well known to many of us on this side of the chamber and is very well known in Australian politics. His son, Terry Cameron, is someone with whom I have had an association in the Labor Party. He is currently a member of the Legislative Council in the state of South Australia. He has been very active in the Labor Party at an organisational level, including serving in a senior role as vice-president of the party nationally and as a member of our party's national executive.
I do think it is proper to say that, as we remember the contribution that Don Cameron has made, it will be in that area of his commitment to the trade union movement over a very long period of time. He was the secretary of the South Australian branch of the Australian Workers Union and had a lifelong commitment to that trade union. Also, he had been a very important figure in the Labor Party organisationally in South Australia, including serving as the South Australian President of our party. I noted that on his retirement from the Senate one of his friends and colleagues, former Senator Reg Bishop, another Labor Senator from South Australia, said about him:
Senator Don Cameron has been a person who has often added wisdom in contributions to debates which has distinguished his speeches from the ordinary party arguments in the parliament. He has been able to contribute some gem of wisdom to debates on many causes which have had to be 
 propounded. He has been a most distinguished member of the parliament.
I am sure that is a very accurate reflection of the contribution that Don Cameron made. We, in the Labor Party particularly, will remember the contribution and commitment that Don Cameron has made to the labour movement. That is what we will never forget. We will of course remember his dedication to our party as well as his distinguished parliamentary career. On behalf of the opposition, can I say to his family—his wife of over 50 years, Colleen, who survives him; his sons, Terry and Barry; Clyde and other members of his family—and all his friends in South Australia: we offer our most sincere condolences.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Former Senator Donald Newton Cameron</title>,Condolences,8,1
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I want to make a few remarks in respect of the condolence motion that has been moved in the Senate this afternoon. I think many people know that Don Cameron and the Cameron family have been very close friends of mine. I had a lot to do with Don Cameron in particular over a number of years. It is with sadness today that I note his passing, not because he has not had a long life—84 years is a very long, and in Don's case, a very productive life in a whole range of different ways—but because I guess the moment has come now when we here in this chamber remember someone who once served in here and indeed went on for another 20 years of life and service to the community and the Labor Party. Particularly in the last 10 years or so, I think the advice he gave to many new members both in state and federal politics was very useful.
Don Cameron did not have the flamboyance of Clyde. Clyde, whom we all know, has featured both in television programs of the era and in many publications. But make no bones about the fact that Clyde would be the first person to say that much of what he did was possible only because his brother played a significant and key role in the trade union movement in South Australia.
Indeed, Don was a very selfless man. Don did not seek high office. Don did not seek anything for himself. What Don sought was the betterment of his members, firstly, and, secondly, to look after the underdog, whoever 
 that may be. He did that in his union service, he did that in his parliamentary service, he did that in every part of his life.
Don was instrumental not only in Clyde's career but in the careers of a few others as well. I well remember the late Mick Young telling me a story that he turned up in Broken Hill when Don Cameron was a shearer at that time—and he spent quite a lot of his life as a shearer. Mick, at the age of 18, had just shown the older hands how to shear a sheep and Don Cameron immediately recognised Mick's greatness—but not for shearing a sheep. He said, `Mick, I think you ought to be going into the union office. It is probably not a good idea for you to stay a shearer here much longer.' The tally was getting too low. In many respects Don started Mick's career in the union movement and eventually in politics.
Don was elected as the Secretary of the AWU in 1964. It was an election that was fraught with controversy. In fact, there was eastern states intervention in the union. Don found himself literally out of work in November 1964, with two young kids to feed. Indeed, it was a long legal battle before the democratic right and the democratic tradition of the AWU was upheld in the courts some nine months later. I draw this to the attention of the Senate here today because Don Cameron, at that time, had to literally go out and get whatever work he could get. He was out on a broom for something like nine months to feed his wife and kids while the court case was going on—and Don never wavered. Don was there and his friends, Mick Young and Jack Wright—who were other officials in this union—and many of the other people who had been very important in the Labor Party in the 1970s and the 1980s, were at Don's side.
The advocate for Don's cause, Dame Roma Mitchell, who also went on to other things, took a very close interest. Eventually the case was won and Don was reinstated as the divisional secretary in South Australia. Dame Roma never lost interest in these fellows. When Keith Plunkett died some two years or so ago now—he was another one of Don's contemporaries—Dame Roma went to the 
 funeral and said she wanted to mark the passing of one of her boys.
When Don Cameron came into this place I think he was one of the last senators to face a state wide by-election, which is the way replacements were found. He served here until 1978. He never sought for himself high office because he did not have the ego that demanded that particular thing. Don wanted to serve his constituents as best he could. Don did serve his constituents the best way he knew how.
Don was an intensely private man who had party contacts right up until the very end. Sadly, in the last two years his health declined to such a point that he could not go outside his own house. Every couple of weeks he would roll up on a Friday to a restaurant in Adelaide's Chinatown that many in Labor politics in South Australia go to, but for the last two years he has been unable to do that. There were many times when we hoped that his health would improve, but unfortunately it went down further and further and it became impossible for him to have any quality of life. I hosted a dinner for him in that same restaurant on the occasion of his 80th birthday four years ago—it seems that time has flown.
There are many people in South Australia—many members of the Labor Party—who have a great deal of respect for Don and would like those remarks put on the public record here today. Indeed, Don Cameron was a person who quite openly would give advice to people. In fact I noticed, in looking through his parliamentary records, that when he was retiring a number of senators made note of the fact that Don Cameron was more of a friend to them than anything else. One of those, of course, was ex-Senator Neville Bonner, who made the comment about Don Cameron that had it not been for him he would have found the transition into the Senate very difficult indeed. Don went out of his way, in the words of ex-Senator Bonner, to make sure that he felt at home here and showed him the ropes in the first critical few months of his service to the Senate.
Don Cameron is survived by his wife of over 50 years, Colleen, his son Terry Cameron, who is a Legislative Councillor, 
 and his other son Barry. They and Clyde and Doris and other close members of the family all said goodbye to Don at a private ceremony the other week. Don left instructions that he was to be privately cremated with only close family at that particular service because it was not in Don's nature that he would want it otherwise.
 I am sad at the loss of a friend and confidant. I would be remiss in not saying here that the last time this man took part in any Labor Party activity was to come to the preselection convention—he was very ill at the time—on 8 May last year and cast his vote for me.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Former Senator Donald Newton Cameron</title>,Condolences,8,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I rise to speak on the condolence motion for the passing of Don Cameron. I suspect I may be one of the few senators who were aware of Don when he was secretary of the AWU in South Australia in the mid to late 1960s when I was first active in the Labor Party and certainly when I became an organiser in the party in 1969.
As Senator Quirke has mentioned, Don Cameron was elected to a casual vacancy in the Senate created by the passing of a senator. In those days, at the first opportunity for a statewide election—if the House of Representatives election was out of sync with the Senate election—an election would take place. At the 1969 federal election, which was a House of Representatives election with no Senate election, the vacancy could be voted on and Don Cameron had already been selected as the Labor Party half-Senate candidate. As a non-sitting candidate, he was our candidate for that by-election, if you could call it that, and he beat another Cameron—Martin Cameron—in that ballot. Martin Cameron is the present president of the Liberal Party in South Australia who, after being defeated by Don because he had been appointed to the vacancy, went on to become a Legislative Councillor, a founding member of the Liberal movement in South Australia,  and is now president of the South Australian Liberal Party. Don beat him in that 1969 election.
I remember it well. It was the first election I was involved in as a party official when the 
 Labor Party two-party preferred vote in South Australia at a federal election reached something like 54 per cent and we won five seats from the Liberal Party. Don came into the Senate at that time and, to my surprise I must say—and many of us tried to talk him out of it—he decided to retire in 1978 after barely nine years in the Senate. Many of us were quite surprised that he chose to retire after what was a relatively short period in the Senate. He certainly had the support of the party to continue for a longer period, if he had so chosen. But that, as Senator Quirke has said, was typical of Don Cameron; he did not seek the limelight for himself, though all of us who knew him realised he was a figure of considerable substance and calibre within the Labor movement in South Australia, both as a trade unionist and as a member of the Labor Party.
Don Cameron provided quiet advice to many of us who were much younger than him in those days. That advice would always be about the morality, the ethics and the consistency of what one should believe in. That was certainly Don's role and he had an influence much greater than most would believe. It is true that in a most celebrated case in AWU history Don won election as secretary, then was sacked by the then federal secretary of the Labor Party, Tom Dougherty. That was taken to the court. Roma Mitchell was the defender, as Senator Quirke said, of Don Cameron and the others who were sacked at that time. The court upheld the case that they should be reinstated.
In the group that Senator Quirk has mentioned there was Reg Groth, who went on to become state member for Salisbury for a decade in the Dunstan years; Jimmy Dunford, who went on to become secretary of the AWU and ultimately a member of the Legislative Council in South Australia and who, sadly, died in office in the early 1980s; Alan Beggs, who went on to become secretary of the AWU in South Australia; Jack Wright, who was Don Cameron's successor as state secretary of the AWU and who then became a member of the parliament in South Australia; and, ultimately, Deputy Prime Minister in the Bannon Labor government. There were a 
 number of others, such as Keith Plunkett. I do not think Keith was actually sacked by Tom Dougherty in those days because I do not think he had been appointed or elected as an official, but he certainly was an activist.	I may have missed some other names in that celebrated group—
—Mick Young.
—Mick Young wasn't actually sacked. Mick had already just been elected before the sacking to be the state organiser of the Labor Party in South Australia. Though socially and politically he was very close to them, he had already just moved on from being the AWU organiser at Port Pirie to be the ALP organiser, and we know of Mick's celebrated career in the Labor Party since that time.
One cannot underestimate the success that Don Cameron and that team of people had in the AWU in South Australia in creating a climate for the Dunstan decade of the 1970s. Don Cameron was a very strong supporter of Don Dunstan and the many radical reforms that Don Dunstan introduced and put into place in the Labor Party in the famous Dunstan decade. Though Don Cameron had in every way a classic working class background, he certainly supported Don on many of the wider social and reform issues that he introduced in South Australia. That was a very important base for the success of the Labor Party in that period. Though Don Cameron is not given much credit, he should be given a lot of credit for it. As one who was an official in the Labor Party in the Dunstan decade, I know the role that Don played in the late 1960s and then in the early 1970s as one of those influential figures.
When I worked for the Whitlam government for a period of time with Senator Bishop, who was a close colleague of Don Cameron's, I had plenty of opportunity to see the work that Don did in the Senate during that period. Don's advice, balance and comment were always sound at a time when, to the say the least, the Whitlam government was providing some pretty exciting times and opportunities. Again, Don Cameron always supported those who were in favour of reform, whether it was economic or social. 
 Though he might not get the credit that he should have got for the Dunstan decade, he was an important figure behind the scenes in the Whitlam period.
As I said earlier in my remarks, many of us were very surprised that Don chose to retire from the Senate in 1978. I agree with Senator Quirk that Don Cameron continued to have an intense interest in the Labor Party and the labour movement. If one had to say about Don what would he like to be remembered for, there is no doubt that he would like to be remembered as an outstanding trade union official and secretary of the AWU, representing the workers and their interests, particularly low paid and semi-skilled workers, which overwhelmingly AWU members were in those days and still are.
I remember being a very green 22-year-old state organiser for the Labor Party in the 1969 federal campaign and then in the 1970s state campaign that began the Dunstan decade and being taken by Don to the Riverland of South Australia to speak at factory gate meetings, if you could call them that, that in fact were under an orange tree outside a packing shed or a cannery, and to talk to workers about those issues that we were promoting at the election. The way Don handled himself in talking—using simple but effective language—to ordinary people about the issues of the day was a real lesson to me about how to communicate. I have to say, he did it better than most. His record in the Labor Party in South Australia, in the Trades and Labour Council in South Australia and in the trade union movement is very significant.
It was with considerable sorrow that I heard of his passing. I pass on to his wife and family, Terry and Barry, my sincere condolences and also the fact that in my very young days in the Labor Party Don Cameron had an influence on my involvement in the labour movement beyond most others. For that I am eternally grateful.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Former Senator Donald Newton Cameron</title>,Condolences,8,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I too wish to pay tribute to Don Cameron in speaking to this condolence motion. I did not know Don Cameron very much as a senator, I have to say. I did 
 know him as a union official. He was one of the first union officials I encountered when I started work as an industrial officer for the Clerks Union in South Australia in 1967. He was then President of the Australian Labor Party and continued as President of the ALP for at least another year.
Don Cameron was an outstanding figure, as we have heard from my colleagues Senator Quirk, Senator Schacht and Senator Faulkner, in the South Australian union movement. He was, as the record shows, a long time secretary of the AWU. What the record does not show is that he held that position with considerable distinction and great admiration and respect were accorded to him by the rank and file members of that organisation. He was in many respects a union official of the old school, who held the rank and file point of view on all points in an argument and who saw it as his role to represent that point of view as fully, as frankly and as openly as he could. He did that to considerable effect.
I know that he was associated with the people in South Australia who were the luminaries of the AWU at the time—people such as Mick Young. A number of the names have been mentioned here today. There was Jack Wright, Jimmy Dunford and Alan Beggs. I remember particularly the industrial officers of the AWU at the time, such as Ernie Grimes. For a time John Bannon was an industrial officer of the AWU and Barry Kavanagh was also an industrial officer of the AWU at the time.
The AWU and the clerks union did have one thing in common. In the late 1960s South Australia was a state with more federal awards than state awards. The industrial organisations that had state awards were in fact the AWU, which was the biggest union as far as the state Industrial Relations Commission was concerned, the shop assistants' union and the clerks union. So often I found myself in consultation with their industrial officers on how matters could best be dealt with by the state industrial commission.
It was in this time that four weeks annual leave came in and when annual leave loading was deliberated upon and awarded by the commission. It was in this time, too, that 
 equal pay for work of equal value was first awarded by the federal industrial commission and these standards had to be converted into standards within the state jurisdictions as well. The AWU was a leading union in ensuring that no worker in South Australia was left behind and, in fact if at all possible, led the field this these matters nationally.
During all of that the eminence of Don Cameron permeated the scene. I have not had as close a relationship with him politically as my colleagues who have spoken in this debate, but I value what I thought was a generous and open friendship that he offered to me as a young industrial officer. He did so with a degree of decency and, I might say, sincerity that I have not really encountered very much in my political and industrial life. They were the hallmarks of Don Cameron. He was basically a very decent person and a very genuine Australian.
He was someone who always expressed, in whatever discussion he was involved in, true working class values. In the period of time in which he was an eminent figure in the labour movement he was a person best classed as a true progressive; someone interested in progressive reform at all times.
He was the president of the party at the time when the long run of the Playford government in South Australia came to an end and Frank Walsh became the first Labor Premier after Playford, followed by Don Dunstan. He presided as a strong figure in making sure that the ALP and the union movement was steered along sensible courses at a time in which massive change was occurring and a huge alteration in social values was occurring, too.
That was the role he played in my experience during the period of Whitlam government when his elder brother, Clyde Cameron, was a distinguished minister. Don would sometimes worry too much about issues. He always struck me as someone who was concerned to come to grips with what was really happening, get through all of the screen of the language, come to the kernel of the matter and see how it related to the working class values that he held. He would worry away at a problem until he got to that under 
 standing. Then, when he got there, he would be a very eloquent spokesman for the interests of the people he represented, and usually that was the rank and file members of the AWU. I feel frankly that I am a bit privileged to be able to convey my condolences to such a great Australian.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Former Senator Donald Newton Cameron</title>,Condolences,8,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-06-22,"—Senator Bolkus did wish to be associated with this condolence motion. He is not able to be here. He was very keen that his association with this motion be made clear to the Senate.
Can I indicate that he also had a very long relationship with Don Cameron. In the mid-1970s Senator Bolkus was at that time a non-senator and a young staffer employed by the then Senator Don Cameron. I would like to make it clear to the Senate that the same sentiments that my colleagues and I expressed when speaking to this condolence motion also go to Senator Bolkus.

That the Senate take note of the report.
It is a very thin document that has been presented. It has been mentioned that, up to the date of printing, there had been 792 submissions, making it an inquiry that has had more immediate submissions than many others, considering the time that was available. There are obviously some very strong statements that are coming out in relation to this report, but there are probably many more questions that are raised in the statements. It states: 
Finally we note the assurance given by the Senate on 31 March 1998 by the Assistant Treasurer, Senator the Hon. Rod Kemp, that the government will not sign the agreement unless it is satisfied that it is in the national interest to do so.
It says:
In summary, there are both misconceptions and misleading material circulating about the nature and the effect of the MAI, some of which is reflected in the submissions received to date.
I guess that statement in section 1.65 reflects the press release that the chair put out before hearing evidence from the inquiry.
Not a lot will happen as a result of this report unless there is some means by which the government can change its own negotiating stance, and is prepared to change its negotiating stance and listen to what the public is saying about public interest. If there is no means for or no intention of the government to change its negotiating stance in relation to the multilateral agreement on investment then this report, thin as it is, will not be worth the paper it is written on.
Generally governments are required to look for a response within, say, three months of a report like this being written. That would put us just prior to the next time Australia will be asked to sign the agreement. I would obviously be looking for a quick response, if possible, from the government to the concerns that have been handled here. But, as I said, this may not be worth the paper it is written on; it may simply be a pre-election exercise by both major parties if there is no actual means, ability or political will to change anything in Australia's negotiating stance on the multilateral agreement on investment.
Many of the concerns expressed were that Australia's stated position was not in the national interest, that what was left out of the multilateral agreement on investment in terms of exemptions left very large gaps, including environmental standards, wages and conditions, and human rights objectives.
If nothing changes in Australia's negotiating position, all the nice words in the world from this committee or any other committee will not change that situation which is causing a great deal of concern throughout local governments and many regional and rural communi 
 ties in Australia. The question that needs to be answered, and answered as quickly as possible, is: has the government actually heard the concerns? If it has actually heard, is there any willingness whatsoever to change Australia's negotiating stance? If the answer is yes, let us hear that answer quickly. Let us find out what role Australia might play in the future. If the answer is no, then the honest thing for the government to do before the election is to say so, and the rest of the community can act accordingly.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-06-22,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
With some notable exceptions, the reports of joint house committees, as is the case with Senate committee reports, do not usually attract a high level of controversy. However, this particular report and the hearings which preceded it attracted a great deal of controversy.
I rise today to disassociate the Australian Democrats with this report, except in so far as our dissent is represented in the minority view. Although there presently exists only one member of the parliament who belongs to that organisation—I think an organisation which all Australians ought to despise—known as One Nation, the average Australian punter 
 could be forgiven for thinking that this report is indeed a One Nation policy document. Let me put it on the record that One Nation policy as it stands would abolish ATSIC and force indigenous communities to use mainstream services. It would extinguish native title and reinvigorate those policies that led to the near complete genocide of one of the most ancient civilisations on this planet.
Let there be no mistake: one of the tools of genocide is the destruction of elements of culturally significant places and artefacts so that people are isolated and alienated from those places. Surely after 210 years, and the decimation that has been visited upon Aboriginal and Torres Strait Australians, it is time now to say `enough'—enough of the destruction of rock paintings, enough of the forced removal of children from their families, enough of the paternalistic values and policies which choose not to see the pain of others and enough of the racially based arrogance that says white people simply know best. If history has shown us anything, it is that indigenous people and their cultures have suffered as a consequence of disrespect and ignorance. Surely it is time—in 1998—to say enough.
The reason why this is such a bad report is because the government members are in the majority. The report merely reflects their continuing contempt towards the indigenous people of this land and, I might say, to 99 per cent of the evidence presented to them in the two very quick hearings which were held in Melbourne and Canberra. The refusal of the government to hold hearings anywhere else except in Melbourne and Canberra once again says something about those two particular places and one other capital in Australia. Those of us who live outside of that particular triangle often have to make this complaint.
No-one in this parliament says that heritage protection legislation is not in need of reform, and the government certainly admits that. The 1984 act has, at almost every turn, been shown to be inadequate. However, I believe that most Australians would be aghast to know that no effective Commonwealth legislation is in existence to protect the culturally important and significant sites of indigenous 
 people. It is very difficult to fathom that almost no act of the Commonwealth parliament has been effective in protecting the ancient and precious heritage of Torres Strait Islanders and Aborigines. What is even more difficult to fathom is that the present government, by the presentation of the bill—the basis of which forms the substance of the report—fails to protect heritage.
The states and territories of this land have not covered themselves in glory in their dealings with indigenous people. In fact, not to understate the matter, they have been directly responsible for implementing many atrocities in the past. During the Wik debate, I put on the record many of those incidents. They are not something that happened 200 years ago or 210 years ago as people like to say; they are incidents which have occurred right up to the present day. The incompetence of the states and territories was tacitly recognised in 1967 when, in the most successful referendum in the history of this nation, the people of Australia voted to give power to the Commonwealth in the area of indigenous affairs. It is lamentable that that power has insufficiently been utilised to improve the lot of our most impoverished people.
Despite this momentous change in the constitution, the coalition government has argued in this parliament and the courts that, if it chooses, it should be able to make laws to the detriment of Australia's indigenous people. Government members actually argued it during the committee hearings into the native title Wik bill. They argued it in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, and the government argued it before the High Court during the Hindmarsh Island bridge case. Who will ever forget the anti-contribution made by Senator Lightfoot in his first speech in this place? He said:
I, in effect, said that Aboriginal people in their native state were the lowest colour on the civilised spectrum.
At the beginning of this contribution I made specific reference to the policies of the Liberal and National parties and how, in effect, they derive from the same philosophical position as One Nation. Let me underline that this is a sad falling away from a party which, 
 under Malcolm Fraser, moved the Northern Territory land rights legislation and had it passed into law. How far that coalition has come from those days. As we heard today in question time, some coalition senators have expressed that they would prefer to work with One Nation in the Senate than either the Greens or the Australian Democrats. Well, that speaks volumes.
Despite our proud 21-year history of defending the rights of ordinary Australians, despite the fact that since the Democrats first took their seats in this place in 1977 supply has been guaranteed to both Liberal and Labor governments, and despite the fact that it was the Australian Democrats which moved the first legislation to save the Franklin Dam and that it was the Australian Democrats that helped to stymie the introduction of the Australia Card, some Liberal senators would prefer to work with Australia's first experience of a fascist political party. I say that not in a pejorative way but in an absolutely technical description. That does speak volumes.
In closing, in dissociating ourselves from this report the Australian Democrats do not divest themselves of what we consider to be the national responsibility to protect all Australian heritage, but particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We will work with the non-racist parties in this Senate to make that possibility a reality and to fulfil the report that Justice Evatt did for the government, on their behalf, on this very matter and which the government then ignored in its bill and in this report. I am ashamed that a federal government in this country should bring down such a discriminatory report and a bill which is so inadequate.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER HERITAGE PROTECTION BILL 1998</title>,<title>Report of Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee</title>,Bills,23,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—I will speak briefly in relation to the Native Title and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee's report on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998 . I was able to sit in on one hearing. Not being a member of the committee, I could not be a participating member of this committee. However, I was greatly concerned about the way the committee was going about its business in as much 
 as, as Senator Woodley has indicated, the kinds of recommendations that have been put forward by Justice Evatt were not really on the agenda.
Ironically, I recall that, during discussions on the Hindmarsh Island bill, I put to the Senate that those recommendations should be looked into and at the time Senator Collins also agreed that that should be done. At the time the government said it was all too difficult because they would have to go to the states, it would take a long time, they would have to talk about it, they would have to think about it and they really could not decide on it in advance of doing that, but funnily enough they had enough time to put through their own recommendations to their own amendments, which are going in the other direction.
I have not had a chance to have a look at this full report, but I would like to express, along with Senator Woodley, my concern about the way this took place and about the way that the government's agenda of reducing rights can be done really quickly, but in terms of any decent objectives for the protection of rights it is all too difficult. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

2A  Review of operation of Act
	 (1)	 The Minister must cause a review of the operation of this Act to be undertaken as soon as possible after the third anniversary of the commencement of this Act.
	 (2)	 A person who undertakes such a review must give the Minister a written report of the review, including any recommendations for changes to the regulation of managed investments.
	 (3)	 The Minister must cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 6 months after the third anniversary of the commencement of this Act.
I note that the running sheet makes the observation that our amendment is similar to the Democrats' amendment No. 1 which is on sheet 943 revised 2. Let me speak for a moment to my amendment. This goes to the review of the operation of the act, and the explanatory memorandum of the government's bill states that the government intends to review the new arrangements applying to managed investments after two years. We are 
 proposing that this be done by the ASC and the Treasury, and will examine in particular the resource allocations of the new SRE regime—that is, single responsible entity—for the ASC and for the Treasury.
Labor hopes that this review will still occur as the resource implications for the ASC is a critical issue for the successful operation of the new scheme. What is unusual about the review, mentioned in the explanatory memorandum, is that the government does not anticipate changing the regulation of managed investments at the time of the review. If that is indeed the case, why have the review at all? What is its purpose? What if the review finds that the regulation of managed investment trusts is flawed and should be changed? Would the government ignore the results of such a review?
Labor's amendment will require a review to take place before three years and that the review is to be tabled by the minister in the parliament within six months of completion. The review should be conducted by someone with enough experience in the industry to have a good grasp of the operation of managed investments and an understanding of how the new regime will operate. It would be preferable that the person be external to the government.
Labor's amendment is designed to ensure that there is greater transparency in the operation of the new scheme and that any problems which are identified can be scrutinised by the public. The onus will be on the government of the day to respond to these problems with the appropriate legislative or other changes that are necessary.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—It is very important, obviously, that we have parliamentary scrutiny in relation to the important issues that have been mentioned in the second reading debate on the Managed Investments Bill. I would like to take this opportunity, having picked up on what Senator Cook says about accountability and open processes, to return briefly to my speech during the second reading debate. In 
 that speech I mentioned that the draft regulations had not been made available. During that speech the minister, by means of interjection, called out, `Rubbish, you have had them for six weeks.' I would like to clarify the situation, having checked in the meantime exactly what had been around for six weeks.
The policy document was around for six weeks. It is not unreasonable to put on the record that there has been no briefing offered to the Greens (WA) in relation to the draft regulations of the Managed Investments Bill. For all the guffawing, that is the reality. There has not been, to our knowledge, any sight of the draft regulations. So it is not unreasonable for people to assume, if in a speech during the second reading debate a senator says, `I haven't seen any draft regulations', and if you have the minister yelling out `Rubbish!' from the other side of the room, that that should be based on something related to the truth. But that is not what happened.
I have still not seen draft regulations. A policy document was available. It was my staff who were being contacted about the group of bills from which the managed investments bills were separated. Therefore, I would be happy to receive an apology from the minister in relation to the impression that he may have left the Senate with by making that interjection.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1

We would insert after section 601FB a new section, that `Nothing in this act prevents a majority of members of a scheme from deciding that the proposed responsible entity must engage an independent agent to hold scheme property', that `A resolution passed at a meeting of the scheme members may direct the proposed responsible entity to lodge with the registration application a compliance plan that provides for scheme property to be held by a person other than the responsible entity' and that `A person appointed as an agent must not be related to the responsible entity.'
Amendment 9 adds after section 601HA, that `If a registration application is accompanied by a copy of a resolution passed under subsection 601FBA(2), the compliance plan lodged with the application must provide for 
 scheme property to be held by an independent person as the responsible entity's agent.'
This relates back to the issues that were mentioned during my second reading contribution. The government seems to be reducing the choice, rather than increasing the choice. That certainly seems to be going in the wrong direction. I find it difficult to believe that there could be credible reasons for wanting to reduce the real choice and stop people from going to the stage of deciding as an entity that they would like to do that. I am keen to hear the government's and the opposition's response to that.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—The government will not be supporting these amendments, as I indicated at the conclusion of my second reading speech. We will be supporting opposition amendment No. 2. As I understand it, that amendment will have the effect that, where either the manager or the trustee fails to retire, under the existing scheme which the government's legislation already has in it, a meeting of investors will be required and the opportunity will arise at that meeting for a vote of the investors on whether there would be an independent, unrelated party which would hold custody of the assets.
The government will be supporting that amendment, which we believe will not impact upon the crucial policy of a single entity having responsibility for the management and custody of the funds. We believe that these other amendments would do that by impairing the single responsible entity concept which is pivotal to this scheme.
I indicate to Senator Margetts through you, Mr Chairman, that we will not be supporting her amendments. As I foreshadowed, we will be supporting opposition amendment No. 2, which would conflict with these amendments.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-22,"—The parliamentary secretary has accurately described the amendment that we have foreshadowed as our second amendment. I think our amendment is more flexible than what the Greens (WA) have proposed. My understanding of their 
 amendment is that the person appointed cannot be related to the responsible entity.
—And there's a problem with that?
—No. All I am saying is that ours provides greater flexibility. Your amendment says, `A person appointed as an agent must not be related to the responsible entity.' Ours enables the person appointed to be related; therefore there is a greater scope of option available under our scheme than under the scheme moved by the Greens (WA).",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—I would just like to make the point that there were some strongish statements made before this legislation was dealt with—certainly at the end of the last sitting fortnight—and the Labor Party made some strongish statements in relation to their contribution on the second reading. It does seem that somehow a deal has been done and that they may well have gone to water on a number of these issues, and that is very unfortunate.

	 (5)	 A provision in a scheme's constitution is void to the extent to which it would have the effect of excluding or modifying any of the duties of a responsible entity, or of any officer or employee of a responsible entity, under this Law or the general law.
These are amendments to section 601FC and they ensure the standard of care required for a director of a responsible entity—that it not be reduced. They clarify that the standard of care owed by directors of the entity is that required by the general law of trusts and not 
 some lower standard. Why should this be necessary? The standard is unclear. It may be lower than currently required under the general law of trust. The test under the Managed Investments Bill roughly equates to that under the Corporations Law. It is arguably less rigorous than the SIS Act test. However, there is a degree of uncertainty because the courts, in AWA Limited v. Daniels, have shown a willingness to expand the scope of the duty depending, amongst other things, on the nature of the enterprise in question.
The standard of care required of a trustee under the general law of trusts is that of an ordinary prudent man of business. That comes from Charitable Corporation v. Sutton. There is little doubt that this test is higher than the test proposed by the Managed Investments Bill. For the purpose of clarifying the standard of care required of a responsible entity, it is reasonable to suggest amending the provision to reflect that the standard required is that of a trustee under the general law of trusts. This basically reflects the theme of my contribution on second reading—that we should not, under the Managed Investments Bill, have a standard less than other laws.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—I cannot so quickly ascertain whether or not the amendments add to the bill, add to the responsibilities placed on directors or diminish them. My most recent experience in relation to these directors' duties matters is debating the fine detail of the words of the proposed amendments to the company laws under the corporate law economic reform program. When you start fiddling with the words of how a person under the companies law should be responsible as a director by adding words such as `a person in business', you start sending signals to the judges who have to ultimately determine these things.
We are going through a debate at the moment in which this parliament will take part in the near future in relation to directors' duties as to whether or not to put some very similar words into the companies law, which all management investment schemes will be subject to anyway. All directors will be subject to the duties as prescribed in the Corporations Law. I was given these amendments this morning. They have not received any consideration by experts in this field. All of the Corporations Law proposals that this government has dealt with—and, to the credit of the previous government, that the previous government dealt with—were put through an extraordinary, excruciating but very worthwhile process of public consultation so that experts in the field of companies law, accounting and other areas were able to analyse the detail of the effect of these changes to the law.
I cannot be assured that the proposals put forward by the Greens in these amendments increase the responsibilities of directors or decrease the liability by potentially constraining the weight that a court would put on the responsibility of that person. I put forward as an example of that argument—and it is a very vital one—that a court might look at the care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise under 1(b) of the bill. If you were to add, for example, the words `in business'—and this argument has been  put to me by top company lawyers in relation to a similar exercise which we are going through on the company law economic reform program—it diminishes the responsibility of people who are not in business.
That is the argument we have had put to us in relation to a proposal to amend the directors' duties provisions of the companies law where we were proposing to put in some words to make it clear that the director would be required to have to act as a director would who had had the experience based on that director's experience. We thought that would be a sensible reform because the court could look at the experience of that person who was exercising that judgment or making that decision in business. It was put to us by directors and by company lawyers of long experience that, by trying to make a practical 
 interpretation of what a director's duty should be and how the court should look at how a reasonable person might be judged as to whether it was a reasonable decision to make based on their experience, by putting in the words with that person's experience these directors argue that it would increase the requirement for experienced directors but significantly diminish it for inexperienced directors.
I would argue, with my very limited knowledge of these matters, that to put in the words `in business' you would increase the requirements on a director who was in business. But, if you had a director of a managed investment scheme who was a trade union representative for trade union interests, that person may not have experience in business, and therefore the courts would read down that person's responsibility. I do not give that as an example of why those particular words may or may not improve the scheme; I give them to the Senate as an example of how I cannot be convinced that these amendments increase the responsibility of directors. I cannot be convinced that these are amendments that will make the single responsible entity more responsible. I would not like to make any amendments to this bill that were so uncertain.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—Is it not amazing that the only people who seem to be able to demand certainty in Australia under legislation these days are large corporations? They seem to get it whenever they ask for it. What we are asking for is a greater deal of certainty and clarity for ordinary people in Australia. The minister has just given us a quite lengthy critique of my use of the insertion `in business' but it does not actually say that. It says `of business'. Experience of business is actually different from experience in business. If you have been a union official and you have been involved with superannuation funds for the last X number of years, I guess that would be experience of business. It does not reduce it. We are talking about the duty of people working within the industry. The fact that the minister has just rebuffed something that does not exist in my amendments is a 
 pretty good indication of what is happening here. I think it is a bit of a snow job. The reality is that we are asking for some clarity for those people who do not normally get clarity. At the moment the only people getting certainty are the people who have the power and influence to demand it. They are the ones who are getting it.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I would like to make a couple of points on the Managed Investments Bill 1997 . First of all, in the earlier matter Senator Margetts said that she feared that the Labor Party had spoken boldly in its contribution to the second reading debate, that a deal had now been done and that our position had been watered down or words to that effect. This is a terrible, disgusting reflection upon such a noble party as the Labor Party and, by inference, upon me. I can assure the Senate that no deal has been done. Our view of the amendments that we have foreshadowed and intend to move to this bill have been consistent throughout its whole consideration.
Having disposed of that, let me now go to the issue that is before the chair. I find myself in a similar position to that of the parliamentary secretary: that, considering the full import of what are, on the face of it, simple amendments but which plumb very deeply in terms of their complexity and inferences of law, this is not a matter that I feel confident to take on foot, as it were. Also, this is not a matter upon which I have obtained any learned or considered advice in the time available to me since receiving these amendments.
I am disposed though to say that the amendments ought to be kept in mind and, when the review in three years time comes back, the amendments could perhaps be reconsidered against the light of the experience of that review to see whether or not there is a call to make them. That was my first reaction. My second reaction is to say, `Well, one ought to be a little more considered than that perhaps,' and I could support a proposition which would mean that these amendments are not proceeded with at the moment. We could take advice over dinner, 
 come back and then put a definitive position down on the record, having given these amendments more thought. I am torn between both those options, none of which satisfactorily meet the desires of the mover. But I must say that, given the notice that I have before me of these amendments, I do not think my duty requires me to do anything more than I have said—prudence certainly does not.
So I do foreshadow to the mover, to the parliamentary secretary and to Senator Murray that, while I am disposed to vote against these amendments and consider them again in the light of that three-year review, I am open to any suggestion, should it be taken up by the Greens, to defer this matter until after I have had some more advice over dinner, since I think we will still be going by the time the dinner break comes around and could deal with it straight after.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—I am happy to take up Senator Cook's suggestion. I just remind him that that wording comes directly from the trust law. So it is nothing new to law. It is nothing that to dated has caused the world as we know it to end. The wording is considered to bestow a reasonable amount of clarity within law for courts to make decisions. Senator Campbell indicated that it might influence the court, and certainly that is what we are hoping to do. We are concerned that, if we leave legislation in such a form as to leave that degree of lack of clarity, it will make it more and more difficult for the average punter, if things go badly wrong, to get some form of justice. Whatever is possible at this particular time is worthy of consideration over dinner.
I would like to point out that my office has not been slack on this issue; as everybody else has, we have used the time which has been available to us as well as we could. It is just one of those things that, in relation to the balance of power, one does as one can. You either stand back and look at a bill and say, `Okay, this has some real problems but, hey, potentially I'm in the balance of power so I haven't got time to deal with it,' or you could look carefully at it and produce amendments that try to improve the bill. That is what we have sought to do. I suppose there will always 
 be a problem when you have senators in this situation of trying to review legislation when there are entire parties looking at it from their own viewpoint which might be different in terms of the accountability that you require.
—Senator Margetts, could I suggest, therefore, that you move the deferral of the consideration of Greens (WA) amendments 3 to 6 on sheet 1023 revised?

Senator Margetts, I would not claim it as a virtue every time, but this time I can be a little bit virtuous in that these amendments have been previously circulated to all members of the Senate. Therefore, I hope that the government will not only have had time to look at them but also be thoroughly supportive of them as a result.
Parliamentary Secretary, in my speech during the second reading debate I did outline the problems, as we saw them, with the Managed Investments Bill. These related to two critical deficiencies. Firstly, the bill, in our view, does not provide millions of Australians with adequate choice about the management of their savings—and that is not only our view, of course, but the view of a number of the critics of elements of the bill. Secondly, the bill does not improve the security of those 
 investments. In our view—and Senator Harradine quoted some very good other authorities—it generally reduces that security. So we have tried to redress those problems to the extent that we can within the current bill.
Both your government and the Labor government prior have made a laudable virtue of international benchmarking and striving for commercial best practice. But in its pursuit of the single responsible entity model the government directly contradicts international practice. The SRE is believed by some to be inconsistent with principles 2.1 and 2.3 of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions regulation of liquid collective investments document. Also, out of 42 countries surveyed by KPMG in 1995 only two, the British Virgin Islands—and I do not know if that is part of Richard Branson's outfit—and the Netherlands Antilles operated without the combination of manager and trustee custodian.
As Senator Harradine said in his speech during the second reading debate, Australia clearly intends to go out on its own—and we have some concerns about that. While we accept that to run against international opinion is not necessarily always wrong, we are concerned that in the process Australians' money could be put at greater risk, without them being asked whether it should be put at greater risk. The amendments I am speaking of here deal with the issue of the independent custodian and really are an attempt to reduce the risk in that area.
In an article in the Australian Financial Review, Simon Hoyle reported that international ratings agency Standard and Poor's raised concerns that the bill would severely undermine the security of investors' money. The article cited Standard and Poor's as advocating in an SRE system at the very least the presence of an independent custodian to hold the funds' assets separately. An independent custodian was a feature of Labor's proposed bill, as you would recall, Senator Cook, and was one of the key provisions excised by the coalition when they produced their own bill.
The amendments I have put together require scheme funds to be held by an independent custodian where a trustee does not exist, and 
 they define the role of the custodian. But, because the parliamentary secretary has in the past made the good point that you need to retain flexibility whenever you can, amendment No. 11 of the group we are debating here together allows for the ASIC—as it will be—to exempt a scheme from having a custodian in circumstances where the ASIC considers that the need for an independent custodian is negligible. In other words, a custodian would be mandatory unless the regulator says it does not need to be.
We think that those particular provisions that we have laid out in our amendments, in fact advance the security of assets considerably. They do not detract from the bill; they do not detract from the intention of the bill. They do, however, firm up the security element. In particular, you will see that amendment No. 5, which is under discussion here, covers the appointment of the custodian, ASIC's approval of the appointment—which is critical—the functions of a custodian and the duties of a custodian. Those are spelt out in some detail, and all of those are taken from experience, both in law and in practice.
Parliamentary secretary, as I said earlier, in our view this strengthens your bill; it does not take away anything from it. We are hopeful that the opposition will heed these arguments since they are the ones the opposition put in their earlier versions of the bill. Accordingly, I commend to the Senate Democrats' amendments 3-7 and 11.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—The coalition government will not be supporting these amendments to the Managed Investments Bill 1997 . I do, however, thank Senator Murray for providing the amendments to the government some many weeks ago and for accepting our offers of briefings and discussions on a number of occasions so that we could seek to work through where the Democrats were coming from and try to explain in more detail the government's proposals. I think Senator Murray also took up the government's offer of briefings by people such as the chairman of the ASC.
We are not of a view to support these amendments because they fundamentally attack the single responsible entity concept. The government is very keen to avoid rebuilding the two-tiered structure by another name. If you are to bring into the law the concept of an independent, unrelated party custodian, you then start building in the potential for a fiduciary relationship between investors and the custodian.
The investor protection that is built into the regime, that has been recommended by CASAC and the ALRC, is that the responsible entity will be responsible to the investor and that the courts cannot try to lay off the blame to some other party. So it is crucial to ensure that that fiduciary relationship only exists between the responsible entity and the investor. The great investor protection regime that is built by this bill—and we strongly argue that it is a better scheme than the one that Australia has at the moment—is the strength of that fiduciary relationship, but it also is built on the flexibility that can apply.
Mr Temporary Chairman, as you know better than most, this legislative scheme is built to cover every investment scheme from a small agricultural scheme which may be worth only a couple of million dollars, right up to the huge funds managers such as BT and AMP and everyone in between. This includes the small funds that are emerging in Australia where some very successful funds managers are moving away from ANZ or Westpac or wherever and setting up their own niche market investment funds with $100 million, $150 million, $200 million under management, and competing against the big funds.
That range of entities, structures, schemes, will be covered by the Managed Investments Bill. This includes everything from a $500,000 to a $1 million vineyard, plantation, ostrich farm—though that is probably not a good example—all those agricultural type schemes, blueberries—for Mr Hartnell's benefit—property syndication type projects, small and middle sized funds managers right up to the hundreds of millions of dollars schemes.
You need a flexible scheme. No doubt—and we have given the ASIC the power to do 
 this—at the very small end it will be very much in the interests of the scheme manager to have an organisation, an agent, controlling the custody of the assets that is independent. There will be organisations that fulfil that role, and they will have to comply with the ASIC, the licensing requirements and the law. You may find that very large organisations will be able to do the custodial work by a related party, in-house, using the requirements under the law. Under that, they are going to need independent directors, they are going to need a compliance committee, they are going to need a compliance plan, and that is all going to have to be registered with ASIC.
This scheme is flexible; it does allow an independent custodian, so it does give people choice. They can choose to go to an existing trustee organisation and say, `We would like to create a compliance plan, set up a scheme, and we would like to use a trustee organisation as a custodian of the scheme assets.' They can go to some other organisation that offers itself out for custodial services and they have to comply with the law and they will have to comply with ASIC's policy statements, which—as Senator Margetts has pointed out—have been published in draft form by ASIC, have been consulted on with the industry and will be finalised prior to 1 July.
That is the benefit of this scheme. When you by law require an independent custodian for all schemes, you undermine the basis of the entire single responsible entity concept. There is a difference between the so-called bare custodian that was put into the collective investments bill that was released by former Attorney-General Michael Lavarch in December 1995 and the proposal that the Democrats put up here today. The so-called bare custodian that was put into the Labor bill could indeed have been an internal related party custodian. It did not need to be independent and it did not need to be at arm's length from the manager; that bare custodian, as it became known, could have been a related party.
The government looked at that concept and we thought that giving it a minimum assets requirement may well cost the small fund managers out of the business. If you put in a 
 minimum capital adequacy requirement for a bare custodian of $5 million, someone who had funds under management of less than $100 million would get priced out of the market and you would not have any small fund managers anymore. Of course, for a big organisation like AMP or BT the bare custodian would have been a joke anyway because $5 million capital adequacy would have meant nothing in terms of investor protection, nor would it have made much of a dint in their accounts. That is why the government opted for a flexible scheme. It will see many funds, I am sure, opting to have an independent custodian, for a whole range of reasons, but it will not restrict schemes to using that form.
The government's strong policy commitment in this is to bring in a single responsible entity and not to allow the law to be amended in a way that would diminish the fiduciary relationship between the investor and the single responsible entity by mandating independent custodians. That is when you start watering it down, building up a separate fiduciary relationship which we believe will get built up by the courts, and destroy the clarity of that relationship between the investor and the manager. We will be opposing these amendments and hope that the Senate will do so.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—There is one major thing wrong with the parliamentary secretary's contribution, and that is that he has not actually explained adequately to the Senate why the government is not prepared to look at whether a single fiduciary entity is such a good thing. Various examples were given earlier that under the current system there have been rip-offs and there has been money lost, but there has been nothing proved in any way, shape or form by the parliamentary secretary that under the proposed scheme we are not going to see more. I just wonder whether, if we ever come to the point of reviewing this legislation, we are going to be under huge pressure not to change it if it actually lets people off the hook and provides an out for various fund managers. 
The reality is that giving examples of where the current system may be at fault is not 
 sufficient argument to say that you therefore make it a single entity and the single entity is therefore going to make it more accountable. Concern is clearly expressed by several senators here, including Senator Harradine, that this will be less accountable and, instead of actually fixing the problem, you actually create a huge problem and perhaps in a couple of years time we are going to have urgent legislation to address this. Someone will say, `Shock, horror! We did not know this was going to happen. We must do something.' We have the ability to look into the future to some extent and have some caution here, and I do not think the government is doing that in this regard. We will be supporting the Democrats' amendments.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-22,"—We, like the government, have had these amendments for some time and have had a chance to deliberate on them. In saying that, I do not imply any criticism of the Western Australian Greens. It was a sensitive matter a moment ago but it ought not be. We have all been in this chamber long enough to know that the vicissitudes of parliamentary life are that sometimes you cannot get your amendments in on time.
Turning to this matter, the parliamentary secretary has provided, I think, a long and useful analysis—
—Long and inconclusive.
—That is your description. Perhaps I should apply my own to complete my own sentence. It is a long and interesting analysis of the reasons why the government rejects this amendment. We share many of the views expressed by the government, I must say.
The question has been raised—fairly, perhaps rightly even—that, since an amendment such as this was contemplated in earlier Labor Party legislation when we were in government, why is it that we are now departing from what appeared to be the position then. I think that is the thrust of the criticism of the likelihood of Labor Party support for the government's amendments by the Democrats, by Senator Andrew Murray. I think that is a reasonable proposition to raise and I do 
 not criticise Senator Murray for doing so. Can I say that in my speech on the second reading I made it clear where we were coming from and that this would be our preferred approach. I mentioned two things to justify a change in our position. When you mandate an independent custodian, we believe you raise real doubts as to whether that will undermine the role of the single responsible entity. In the previous legislation, we did not have the same doubts at all that that would be the case. We do now have considerable doubts that you in fact undermine the role of the SRE.
However, one of the overriding concerns we have always had is that the funding and resources for the Australian Securities Commission be adequate to meet the task that commission will have in fulfilling its role with respect to this legislation. I note on that front that the government in this budget has provided $7.1 million over three years for the ASC. That would seem to meet the concerns that we have, although I would seek, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, of the parliamentary secretary an assurance that government funding of the ASC will be at appropriate levels to meet the needs of this legislation and to ensure that the role is properly policed. If such an undertaking were not forthcoming, it would be of considerable concern to the opposition and in fact would cause us to reconsider our vote for the amendment.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—That makes it hard to answer. I note in the gallery the chairman of what will be the ASIC, Mr Alan Cameron. I welcome him to the Senate. I am sure he would like me to say that I would like to give him a blank cheque. That is right—he is nodding.
—But he is not holding his breath.
—He is not holding his breath. We made it quite clear on this, particularly during the Wallis legislation debate, which I think that Senator Cook carried as well, that we will be monitoring closely the performance of ASIC in its new duties under the Wallis reforms, which have now been passed in this place. I put on record 
 the government's thanks to the opposition parties for their support of those measures in making sure they are through this place so that scheme can be up and running, as planned, on 1 July.
I also made it quite clear in that debate, but I reiterate for the record here, that the government will keep under close scrutiny the implementation of the managed investment scheme as well. It is in the government's interests and in Australia's interests to ensure that the implementation of the scheme is a great success for the people of Australia and for the investors of Australia. Indeed, if it is not a success there will be a political price to be paid—my head may be part of that. So we will be closely examining the implementation of this scheme and I give an unequivocal commitment that the ASIC will be appropriately resourced to ensure that the implementation of this scheme is successful and that it is able to implement an investor protection regime, which we think is an improvement for Australia.
Amendments not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—I move:
(7)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 21 (lines 18 to 23), omit subsection (1), substitute:
	 (1)	 The constitution of a registered scheme may be modified, or repealed and replaced with a new constitution, only by special resolution of the members of the scheme.
This amendment relates to the constitutional changes and the impact that members might have on constitutional changes. This is important. What we are asking is to ensure that the constitution can only be changed with the approval of members. This is an amendment to 601GC(1)(a) and (b). Why is this important? We believe that, otherwise, we reduce the current protections. That is because, under the bill, responsible entities are permitted, under section 601GC, to modify, repeal or replace a scheme constitution without reference to or approval by investors in certain circumstances, depending on the sole judgment of the responsible entity. Nor does the bill require the ASC to approve changes to scheme constitutions.
By contrast, the current law requires the independent judgment of the trustee as to whether proposed changes to trust deeds are prejudicial to investors. If the trustee believes that a proposed change is prejudicial, it can only be made with investor approval. That, I believe, is a safeguard that should be there.
We are looking at the danger of erosion of rights. The constitution is the scheme's most important governing document. Can you imagine being in a club or an organisation or even a country when somebody could actually change the ground rules that you have been operating on, making laws and by-laws without your knowledge? You are going along believing the by-law is read in a certain way and they can change that whole set of rules.
Here we have the most important governing document specifying provisions for the managed investment scheme's most important aspects, such as the responsible entity's powers of investment, powers to raise and borrow money, members' rights to withdraw from the scheme, responsible entities' rights to be paid fees, members' complaint mechanisms and winding up of the scheme, and fund managers can make changes to scheme constitutions that in subtle and apparently innocuous ways can reduce the rights of ordinary investors. There is a real danger this will happen in some cases. Why should we let it happen? In a democracy, investors should have the right to have all amendments to the scheme constitution referred to them for approval. This amendment can be supported in the interests of giving investors some say over their investments.
The bill creates the power, on the part of the responsible entity, to change trust deeds unless it takes the view itself that the matter is prejudicial. This means that there is no independent party, such as the trustee or the ASC, so who is going to say that? Who is going to point that out? It is going to be able to approve the changes which a responsible entity makes to the rights of investors, as set out in the scheme trust deed or constitution. This is an extraordinary amount of power to vest in a responsible entity that is supposed to look after other people's money in accordance 
 with a set of rules under which those people invest in the first place. In any event, such absolute power is repugnant to sound business management principles.
The safest course of action under this bill is to require a scheme constitution to be referred to the investors for a vote. Otherwise, the responsible entity will have to be judge and jury as we no longer have this independent party. It will have to recommend and, in itself, approve changes without reference to a third party. There is no notice required.
It should be noted that there is nothing in this bill that requires any of the amendments made by the responsible entity to be notified to the investors before the changes take place. So not only do they not get to vote on them and not only is there not an independent entity that is necessarily going to judge whether they ought to have a say but they also do not have to have any notice. It is a bit like people getting a bit hot under the collar here if they are asked to vote on something that they have only just seen.
Again, this seems unnecessary erosion of the rights of investors to have a say as to how their legal rights are to be changed. If you were to look at each of these elements logically, you would have to say that the logic should be that, if the government is absolutely determined to have a single entity, there has to be protection in relation to changes in the constitution. I would urge support from the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—The government will not be agreeing to this amendment. We believe that the constitution should be able to be changed, particularly where there is no adverse effect on members' rights. I refer Senator Margetts to page 21 of the bill, with which I am sure she will be familiar. Section 601GC looks at how a constitution can be changed. Paragraph (a) provides that major changes would have to be made `by special resolution of the members of the scheme'. In many examples, schemes should be able to be, and can be, changed where the changes are minor and do not affect members' rights.
If some nasty scheme manager or single responsible entity does seek to change a scheme and that affects members' rights, then the members of the scheme have a recourse and may recover from the manager under 601MA, which you will find at page 44. 601MA (1) states:
A member of a registered scheme who suffers loss or damage because of conduct of the scheme's responsible entity that contravenes a provision of this Chapter may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against the responsible entity whether or not the responsible entity has been convicted of an offence, or has had a civil penalty order made against it, in respect of the contravention.
So there is a remedy there if the responsible entity acts against the interest of members' rights. It is very much in line with putting more power in the hands of shareholders and members of schemes in this circumstance. It allows them to take action and gives them a statutory right to take action in the case of that breach.
If you were to require a managed investment scheme to hold a meeting of scheme members for every change to the scheme, you would put massive costs—and totally unnecessary costs—on members of the schemes. If you are looking at shareholders' rights, you have to look at why they invest in schemes in the first place. An important reason is to get a return on their investment. If a managed investment scheme is to be successful, one of the things you have to do is ensure that the cost of managing the scheme—the administrative costs—is kept to a minimum. If you go around forcing schemes to have meetings of members every time they need to make any change—as I think your amendment would force them to do; and I am not being frivolous here—it would certainly be good to be in the business of renting out large function centres, if not the MCG. If this amendment were to go through, you would actually be required to send out notices of meetings to possibly hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of investors on a regular basis. It would be very expensive and unwieldy.
We think the structure in the bill actually strikes a neat balance. It ensures that, if you do have a big change to the constitution, you 
 will have to go to a meeting, but if it is an administrative change that cannot affect, and does not affect, the rights of members, then you will be able to make it. This is set out on page 21 of the bill. You will have to lodge it with the ASC. Any of the modifications will have to be lodged with the ASC—or the ASIC as it will become known shortly. There must be a consolidated copy of the constitution lodged with the ASC. So there is a requirement. You cannot do it in secret—it has to be lodged. There are protections there for all scheme members. We think the balance is right. We think that your amendment would upset that balance.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—I am sure most people are actually members of incorporated bodies. I think it is reasonable that members of incorporated bodies should get a say in respect of constitutional changes—even in the case of teeny-weeny changes where there might be no money involved.
I believe there is a problem in that there is nobody to independently judge whether this will have adverse effects on members' rights. What happens when people do not find out until it is too late? Are we really saying that there is recourse if that recourse relies on action by the managers themselves—the managers who may, in fact, be bringing about the changes? In reality, you cannot say that that will be the case. You have already given us examples of legal recourse resulting in only a certain proportion of every dollar. We are saying that, as a government and as a parliament, we cannot deliberately put in legislation something that is going to leave people in the position of having to take legal recourse if we have the power to actually do something about it.
Constitutional changes have to be done in this way because there is no independent person who is legally required to advise members on adverse effects. If you have not given people the ability to have a say in any constitutional changes and you do not have an independent adviser, the reality is that you have left those people in double jeopardy. That is why this amendment is necessary. I am sure that, in most people's minds, it does 
 not come down to simply management costs. As a responsible parliament, there are more important things for us to be looking at. We are looking at certainty for investors. Individual mums and dads, the people who have put their money into such funds, do not know how to fight this when they do not know what is going on. That is a reality. There is nothing to ensure that they will know that these changes are going on. Are we going to rely on the managers to tell their members that they might be doing something against their interests? Surely we should be dealing with this with our eyes open and surely we need to take some action. Recourse may take a long time. Recourse may not bring any great benefits in the end if the changes that have taken place mean that people have already been damaged because they have not found out until it was too late.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I think Senator Campbell is correct in striking the balance between practicality and the need to have some check in the interests of members. I do not think the situation is that—
—You don't really believe that, do you?
—No, Senator Margetts. I do not think the analogy, for example, with trustee law in respect of superannuation is a good example of striking a balance between practicality on the one hand and sufficient supervision on the other—in the case of superannuation trusts, the ISC and members.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
—Prior to the dinner adjournment I was commenting that Labor will not be supporting Greens amendment No. 7 and that, on balance, Senator Ian Campbell's argument should be supported and the Greens amendment should be opposed. I was commenting briefly from my experience in trust law relating to superannuation, which is not dissimilar in principle to the issue we are dealing with here with the Greens amendment. Certainly, in trust law in regard to superannuation if the trustees had to convene a meeting and consult with the members of a superannuation trust each and every time the 
 trust deed was to be amended, it would simply be administratively impossible and it would be highly costly.
I think we have to balance the practicality of the Greens amendment—and I think I would be impractical; it would be extremely costly in its implementation—with the checks against capricious action in respect of amendments of the constitution of a registered scheme. As Senator Ian Campbell has said, there are two checks. One is that the responsible entity must lodge with the ASC a copy of the modification or the new constitution. Then he referred us to page 44 of the bill where there is a second check, if we like—civil liability of responsible entity to members. Labor believes that, on balance, the government's approach is correct on this matter.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-06-22,"—I have just two points. Parliamentary Secretary, I appreciate your remarks that a remedy is there within the bill whereby those who are defrauded or who have a problem can take action to recover their moneys. But as far as possible this Senate should avoid circumstances where people have to pursue the remedy, because preventive action is far cheaper, far quicker and far less damaging to the financial or physical health of investors than having to pursue the remedy at law. I make that as a general point.
My second point really refers to your remarks about Senator Margetts's amendment forcing compliance with a particular course of action. I would have been prepared to accept your view if within that approach you had mandated that the funds were required to have got approval from their investors for a constitutional provision which allowed the fund manager to change the rules even if those rules were, as you pointed out, not serious or material. If somebody or an investor knowingly agrees to a constitution which delegates their rights to the responsible entity in whose interest it may be appropriate to conceal their motives or the reasons for their actions, if somebody in full knowledge makes that decision, then let the buyer beware. That is their problem. But clause 601GC of your bill actually says:
(1)	 The constitution of a registered scheme may be modified
. . .       . . .      . . .
	 (b)	 by the responsible entity if the responsible entity reasonably considers the change will not adversely affect members' rights.
The investor can have nothing to say about it. Whether the investor likes it or not, you are telling them they have to lump it or like it. I think that is the reverse end of the stick. You were criticising Senator Margetts's amendment for trying to improve investor security by requiring that constitutional changes be mandated by special resolution and yet at the same time you are supporting a mandated position whereby the responsible entity can disregard members' interests or views even where those members themselves may not like it and may not want to accept that approach.
I would have thought from your point of view that the appropriate approach if you did not want to mandate would be just to mandate that any constitution that had such a provision would in the first place have to be approved by the members. That is how constitutions are approved, aren't they? They are approved originally by members of the scheme. That is at the heart of the flawed thinking about this bill because you have here a situation where you are giving constitutional carte blanche to people in whose interest it may sometimes be to defraud, mislead or interfere with members' rights and interests in a manner which will result in loss.
Yes, there is a remedy, but then people have to go through the agonies of the courts. Then again there is the problem that the definition here in the bill is, shall we say, incomplete because it says:
(1)	 The constitution of a registered scheme may be modified, or repealed and replaced with a new constitution:
. . .       . . .      . . .
	 (b)	 by the responsible entity if the responsible entity reasonably considers the change will not adversely affect members' rights.
The entity may reasonably consider a change of the registered office from Sydney to Honduras entirely appropriate. It does not really 
 affect much, but it might allow the moneys to be moved around in a totally different manner from which they were moved before.
Whilst I understand your criticisms of Senator Margetts's approach, I am not sure at all that your alternative is better. If I had to toss up between the two, I know which one I would choose—and that is Senator Margetts's amendment because it guarantees that the members themselves have the say over what happens to the constitution, which is the instrument which governs the way in which their moneys shall be dealt with. On that basis, I would be inclined to support Senator Margetts's amendment.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-06-22,"—There is one issue I want to raise, and that is the provision that the Parliamentary Secretary referred us to on page 44: the ability of a person affected by a responsible entity going amiss to take legal action. That leaves it open to the person who holds an interest in the fund to take legal action. This has been raised on a couple of occasions.
Why that should be of some interest to you, Mr Temporary Chairman, is that it raises the issue of what legal funds are available for a person to take action. He or she would be taking action against a responsible entity which would be able to use the funds of the responsible entity to pay the legal expenses against the member who is taking the action. The member might be refused legal aid because he or she holds interests in the fund which take he or she above the level that would entitle him or her to legal aid, even if legal aid was available for a civil action.
It seems a most awkward thing that the way we are going to give sanctions to members of these funds is by allowing them to sue, at their own cost, their fund, which is able to use their money which is put in the fund to defend their action and to pay for any damages out of the funds to which the person suing them has contributed. It just seems to be a very awkward way—one could almost say it is an unfair way—of allowing the members to try to force the fund to work as it should.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—I could not have said it better. I only wish Senator Cook had been in here to 
 hear that very interesting question: is it really recourse if there are not necessarily funds for people to access justice or even for them to have any guarantee that they will be able to get their funds back if something of that nature has happened?
I have something that I want to add while the minister is thinking of an answer to that very good question. I know of organisations which literally cannot afford stamps. But we are not talking about organisations which theoretically cannot afford stamps; we are talking about multihundreds of millions of dollar organisations which presumably can afford the stamps. We are talking about organisations which, if there were teeny changes to their constitutions, might do as other small organisations do: put the changes together when they are having an annual meeting. I would think that there would have to be some regular communication with members. I would think that the organisations could probably even save stamps if they advised their multiple members at the same time they were doing other mail-outs of the constitutional changes that were being proposed.
I do not believe we are talking about a ridiculous situation. If a fund changed its constitution willy-nilly every five minutes, I would think that would be a very poorly managed fund. I would think that the directors would find themselves in legal hot water because they themselves would not know where they were at, let alone their members. Are you suggesting that funds will and should change their constitutions every five minutes or every few days or every two weeks because they do not know how to manage themselves better than that?
I would suggest that, throughout history, organisations have worked out how to amend their constitutions in ways that meet their time deadlines and financial and other restrictions. Quite frankly, even small organisations which need to change their constitution for some reason between annual general meetings could organise a special general meeting or something—a mail-out or some other kind of communication with their members. I cannot believe that we are dealing with such very 
 large amounts of money and such very large bodies and that we are suggesting that it is beyond the realms of possibility that they can organise to change their constitution in any sort of order that enables their members to be advised.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I just want to explain to Senator Margetts, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that this is not an easy process. I think the analogy that I used of a superannuation trust is a good one. Firstly, I know about this, having sat as a trustee on a superannuation fund and been faced with having to change trustees quite frequently. I am not saying weekly or every second day or anything like that, but maybe three or four times a year. Three or four times a year you say, `Well, 45c a throw. Maybe 100,000 members.' You are looking at a significant cost.
Secondly, in respect of this legislation it is not necessarily the fault of the custodian or, in the case of superannuation, the trustee. Unfortunately, government legislation changes very frequently, and that is not a criticism of this government or our government. The fact of life is that I know that in respect of superannuation—having sat as a trustee when there was a Labor government—there were frequent changes every year. It has been the same under this government: frequent changes every year. Trustees do require alteration, and often, to make matters worse, retrospectively. Often you wait months for the legislation. That is not a criticism of this place; it is just a recognition of the facts of life in dealing with legislation. Often these changes are retrospective. It is annoying for the people who manage and are custodians of people's funds.
I have listened closely to the comments you made, Senator Margetts. I can say that, from the experience I have had, the practical concerns reinforce my conviction that it is extremely difficult to agree to your amendment. If there were no other balances in the legislation we would have to do something, but there are other balances in the legislation and I have commented on those. I just think we have to balance practicality against the checks and balances that are proposed—the 
 level of legal scrutiny. I do not think it is perfect, but I think it is the only practical way through.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—Senator Cooney asked me a question, and the core of it was about who pays if the responsible entity does act in a way that is deemed to be against the interests, in changing the constitution. The responsible entity would pay, and the person would not be able to be indemnified out of scheme property. If you go to 601GA(2)(b) at page 20, you will see that the entity can only be indemnified if it is `in relation to the proper performance of those duties'. If it is not in the proper performance of the duties, which would obviously be the case there, the scheme property would not be available.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I notice that 601GA(2) says:
If the responsible entity is to have any rights to be paid fees out of the scheme property, or to be indemnified out of scheme property for liabilities or expenses incurred in relation to the performance of its duties, those rights:
(a) must be specified . . .—
and so on. I take it that that would normally be done.	 What I am saying is that you do not know whether the person running the scheme has acted in the performance of his or her duties until after the case is over. In any event, the court might well say, `It was a responsibility of yours, as the manager of the scheme; as the responsible entity, the person in charge, it was your duty to fight that action. Even though you have lost, it was your duty to do it and therefore you get your funds out of the scheme.'
I understand what you are saying, but you have to look at it at the time the issue arises, when the costs have been incurred. What is going to happen is that, if a person is faced with the possibility—as anybody is who goes into a court case—that they might lose the issue, they are not going to go ahead: first of all, they cannot afford the expense of the case, whereas the responsible entity can—because, at that point, the responsible entity is performing its duty. It must be, because 
 you do not know it is not performing its duty until after the case is over. That is quite clear.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—I will respond to that, but I am not going to take any more time on this. We have spent nearly one hour on one line of the bill, but that is not to say that this is not an active, positive and constructive review of a complex piece of legislation. It makes it quite clear at (2)(b) under 601GA that the funds are only available in relation to the proper performance of those duties. If the manager has not properly performed those duties and he is found to be in breach of 601MA, then the money is going to have to come out of the manager's pocket.
Senator Cooney, this reinforces something I read from an independent commentator on the bill. I gave a speech recently in Sydney at a law firm called Freehill Hollingdale and Page, who have written an independent analysis of the director's duties changes that we are bringing in under the corporate law economic reform program. They are warning their clients that they need to look at these directors' duties—particularly for directors of managed investment schemes—under the government's proposed Managed Investments Bill.
I cannot quote them, because I do not have their newsletter in front of me, but I paraphrase them as saying, `the onerous new responsibilities placed on directors under this bill.' In other words, they are saying, `If you are a director of a managed scheme, beware, because you have onerous new responsibilities over and above what you would have if you managed an existing scheme.' That is from an independent commentator who has looked at the director's duties under this bill, looked at it under the corporate law economic reform program and said, `If you are a director and you are a client of Freehill Hollingdale and Page, beware, because you have onerous new responsibilities placed on you by the government in Canberra.'",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I say this in the kindest way: it would be very helpful if advisers and lawyers actually ran a few cases and understood what it was like to 
 litigate from the start. What he has put in the act does not necessarily convey what it is like in the conference room and what it is like when you are trying to run cases in the court. It would be helpful if, at times, those that advise us had some practical experience of what it is like to run a court case.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—Perhaps what the minister was describing, in relation to the law firm that he was talking about, might be a law firm which actually takes its responsibility seriously. To make themselves feel that they have done everything they are supposed to under law, there may well be things that directors have to do under this legislation that they would consider onerous. However, the argument that we are making is that human nature, experience, the law courts and the media all say that there are people who will use other people's funds unscrupulously. Those people are not potentially going to have seminars with the minister to find out exactly what they should be doing: they may well find out what they can get away with. That is the reality of life. I wonder: if there were an expose in a couple of years time, with very large amounts of money and very large numbers of ordinary mums and dads in Australia affected, would we come back and say that we did not know?
Senator Sherry said that, under superannuation funds, there can be a situation where trustees turn over up to four times per year. That may well be the case, but there is a difference under managed investment funds. I understand that, whereas under super funds you may have a say in who your trustees are by electing your trustees, managed investment funds have people appointed without your say-so. Once again, you have something that super funds do not have. We are suggesting that, if there is that hands-off situation in relation to managed investment funds, there needs to be some kind of quid pro quo. That is not being given, we believe, in terms of this legislation.
I can read the numbers. I also see that Senator Cook is back. I hope he has had a really nice dinner and has had time to consider my previous amendments. From what Senator Sherry said, it looks as though I am 
 not going to be particularly successful with the Greens WA amendment No. 7. More is the pity, but I think we are going to be back in this chamber in a couple of years time—providing we are all still here and are not dealing perhaps with parties who do not put in this kind of work—to check legislation and deal with it again, to try to clear up the mess.
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—I move:
(8)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 22 (lines 1 to 6), omit subsection (4), substitute:
	 (4)	 The responsible entity must send a copy of the scheme's constitution to a member of the scheme within 7 days if the member asks the responsible entity, in writing, for the copy, and must not charge the member any fee for the copy.
We are now dealing with the next stage. Having clearly found what the majority in the Senate were saying in relation to Greens (WA) amendment No. 7, this gives another opportunity for some level of notice in relation to members. This ensures that members have access to the constitution of the fund—it only requires a request in writing. It deletes the previous requirement in the bill that allowed access to the constitution only if the member paid for it. We are saying that people will know and people will be able to get funds back—or may be able to get funds back. Senator Cooney has clearly indicated that if you cannot prove in advance that a manager has broken the law then you have got to take the risk of taking them all the way down the line—if you can afford the risk—to try to get your funds back or try to get recourse.
We are asking that members have guaranteed access to the constitution of their funds by putting it in writing. Why do we need this? Members should not have financial limitations on access to such important information that outlines important features such as voting rights. Knowledge of the constitution and people's rights under it are important to investor protection. As there is no trustee, members will have to take more initiative to ensure their rights are not abrogated. They 
 should not have impediments to having access to their rights.
If, as the government and the opposition have indicated, and the opposition has indicated, this recourse is fair and available, then surely people need to have some information upon which they can judge whether or not the action taken by their managers has been according to the fund's constitution. We know this is going to be more difficult if the constitution can be changed without their knowledge, but at least there should be some basis by which members can be guaranteed access, if they require it.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—I was going to suggest to the Greens (WA) a couple of courses of action. I do have concerns—having spent the last 18 or 19 months of my life consulting with industry, investors, shareholders, people who manage funds and people who act as trustees for funds, on the fine detail of this legislation—that to make decisions not just on foot, as I think Senator Cook said earlier, but on the run, is not a sensible way. This bill was referred to a committee. Quite frankly, these amendments, at least for the government, appeared today.
I was going to suggest that perhaps a constructive process—if we want to proceed down a constructive path—may well be to refer these amendments for consideration by the joint parliamentary committee. If the government and the parliament find merit in them through an inquiry, they can be incorporated. The government would have to give consideration to their incorporation, but certainly it would be open to the Greens or any other senator to move them as amendments to the Corporate Law Economic Reform Bill which we expect will be introduced into the parliament next week and debated in the next sittings of parliament. That bill contains a significant number of amendments to the Corporations Law. It certainly would be an available vehicle to the Senate within a matter of days in terms of its introduction, and a matter of only weeks in terms of its debate in this chamber. 
If you would like the industry that will be affected by these changes to be able to look at them—and they go into a whole range of areas to do with managed investments—I suggest that it would certainly be a more normal process to allow industry to have a view and a say on all of these amendments rather than us having to second-guess the impact they might have on managed investment schemes which, as has been pointed out by all honourable senators who have contributed to the debate, affect the lives of millions of investors across Australia. I ask Senator Margetts to give consideration to referring these amendments to the Corporations and Securities Joint Committee. I would undertake that when they are referred, as part of the committee's current reference in relation to the CLER legislation, that the government would look at the report of that committee and it would remain open to any senator to move amendments to that bill.
I really have trouble with legislating company law reform and managed investment reform when I do not know whether the industry has even seen these. Surely someone has, but today is the first time that the government has seen these amendments. I reiterate that, after 18 or 19 months or longer, in discussing the fine detail of this legislation, I find it a little bit of an insult to the industry and the investing public to be trying to redesign a piece of legislation with about six hours notice.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—I find it a bit of an insult having to deal with legislation that has been so firmly criticised by those who know during the inquiry and the government did not take any notice themselves, quite frankly. We are responding to the kind of information that was thrown up in that inquiry and through people who we know who are experts in that field as well. I do not think simply going to the industry now and saying, `What do you think? How about you do this review on Senator Margetts's amendments?', is necessarily what is required. Maybe what there will need to be, and if I take some of the comments that Senator Cook made earlier, is a firm commitment from both sides of the 
 Senate that there will be a set time by which these arrangements under which the legislation is dealt with are reviewed.
I can take advice and I can get give you some ideas by the end of this debate as to when, I might suggest, that review could take place, but I do not think simply giving it to industry and saying, `Can you tell us what you like and what you do not like?' gives the potential problems with investors time to emerge. We are being asked to take a lot of what the government is saying here on trust. During the speeches in the second reading debate three senators here said that the practice the government is talking about is not carried out in just about any country with these kinds of investments. So it is not we who are suggesting something that is unknown; the unknown is coming from the government side. What we are trying to direct you to is some certainty for investors amongst structures that are known, that do have some track record, rather than what the government is proposing. 	The cautious ones here are the Greens and the Democrats, and some within the opposition who probably are not in the chamber at the moment. It is not we who are leaping; it is you who are leaping. The cost will be to those people who are being put at risk. I can see what your intention is. I will still be arguing my amendments as they come. I will count the numbers as I go and if it is obvious that it is not going through, at least those arguments are on the record. When the expose is done eventually on Four Corners or on the Sunday program or whatever, at least I will be on the record as saying that you could have done it another way.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-22,"—My riding instructions are that we do not support this amendment. I might say, though, that I am inclined to take a view that the constitution of an entity ought to be available to the members of the entity. The provisions of the bill do make it available upon the payment of a fee up to the prescribed amount required by the responsible entity. When we are talking about the constitution of some body we are talking about the rules and procedures of that body that cover 
 and bind its members. In order to discharge one's responsibility as a member, one ought to be well advised about the rules. Not knowing ought not to be an excuse. Knowing should be within the reach of everyone. So I take a plain man's view of this amendment.
I would be grateful if there were some guidance from the Parliamentary Secretary. When we say that `a responsible entity must send a copy of the scheme's constitution to a member of the scheme within seven days if the member asks the responsible entity in writing for the copy and pay any fee up to the prescribed amount required by the responsible entity', one presumes that the member will be made aware of this entitlement at the relevant point and can therefore exercise their right and that the fee they would be required to pay is not a userious fee; it is a fee that simply covers the cost of the transmission and printing of the document.
Could the Parliamentary Secretary confirm with me that that would be the intention of how this provision would operate and indicate whether he has anything to say on what the level of fee might be or on how one ought to regard what is a fair charge—whether the fee just pays the cost of printing and postage or whatever. `Up to a prescribed amount' means, I think, that in the regulations an amount will appear. If there is any advice you can provide to the chamber as to what that might be at this stage, I would appreciate it.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—The government's view is that it would be a cost recovery operation. If people do want to know their rights and obligations they would want to get a copy of the relevant legislation. If they want to do that, they will have to buy it either from a Commonwealth government bookshop or from CCH or some other supplier of the legislation. If they want a copy of the constitution of a scheme, that will be available on the ASIC database. They are required to pay a fee for accessing it there. Furthermore, if they want a copy of a company's constitution, it is open for companies to pay for that.
Finally, I do not know what current practice is. I have not inquired into this. It is the sort 
 of thing that could be inquired into if you allowed it. And I did not say, Senator Margetts, `industry'. I said industry might like to comment on all these amendments. I said that a joint parliamentary inquiry into the effect of these amendments would certainly give the government more information on their effect. I do not know whether it is done at the moment, but certainly in the current legislation there is no requirement that members of a scheme be provided with a copy of the constitution for free. So to that extent it would be a departure from the existing legislation, I am informed.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—Basically what we are saying is that members will have to pay to access knowledge of their rights. Those are the rules that they are supposed to abide by and that other people are supposed to abide by in relation to them. If it is cost recovery, I guess we are back to the position of who is going to determine what the cost of putting together those changes are. It could be that one of their managers decided that they would have to have a conference in Europe in order to change some particular elements. This is a far-flung example, but who is going to change that? You were invited to give an idea of whether or not in these unseen regulations there would be some kind of ceiling limit and cost recovery. It could mean almost anything, depending on where the managers might have gone to have their conference in order to decide what the changes to the constitution might be. So we are still left none the wiser on the basis that you have user-pays. The people whose money is being used in order for the managed funds to make their money are going to have to pay for their rights as members. Terrific.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—by leave—I move:
(10)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 24 (line 21), after ""may"", insert "", with the approval of the ASC,"".
(11)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 25 (after line 8), at the end of section 601HE, add:
	 (3)	 The responsible entity must give notice in writing to members of any modification 
 to the compliance plan, or of a new compliance plan, 21 days before lodging the proposed changes with the ASC under subsection (1).
	 (4)	 The responsible entity must send a copy of the scheme's compliance plan to a member of the scheme within 7 days if the member asks the responsible entity, in writing, for the copy, and must not charge the member any fee for the copy.
	 (5)	 A summary of the compliance plan of a managed investment scheme:
		 (a)	 must be contained in every prospectus issued in respect of the managed investment scheme; and
		 (b)	 must set out the main provisions of the compliance plan.
What we are looking at here is access to the compliance plan. Greens (WA) amendment No. 10 relates to approval—that approval by the ASC is required for all changes to the compliance plan. Amendment No. 11 requires that members must be given notice of changes to the compliance plan, that they will have access to the compliance plan and that new members should be able to inspect the compliance plan. I find it amazing to think that there should be some concept that this should not happen.
Why do we think this should happen? It is a document of fundamental importance for investor protection. The bill replaces compliance supervision by an independent trustee with supervision by either a majority of independent directors—that means a minority could object—or by a compliance committee. In either case, the compliance plan is the blueprint for compliance with the Corporations Law and the scheme's constitution. Like the scheme's constitution, the compliance plan is a document of fundamental importance for the scheme, including provisions for the manner in which scheme property is to be identified and held, when assets are to be valued, ensuring adequate record keeping and so on. It also provides notice of information of investors.
Under the bill, changes to this document may be made without notice to investors, like the constitution. Investors should have notice of changes to the compliance plan to be able to assess any potential implications of the 
 change. This amendment requires 21 days notice to members of any changes. It requires access and members should be able to receive a copy of the compliance plan free of charge, similar to what we said under the constitution. The scheme exists for the benefit of members, and members should face no impediments in receiving information about their investment scheme. It should provide access for new investors to free and informed choice. Why not? Because the compliance plan is of fundamental importance to the running of the scheme and to investor protection. A summary of the plan should be attached to the prospectus so that investors may judge for themselves whether or not the scheme is something they would wish to invest in. Such a requirement promotes free and informed choice. I commend this amendment to the Senate.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—It is hard to understand that we have no response at all from either side.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—I made it quite clear earlier on that I believe it is entirely inappropriate to make these sorts of changes to legislation on the run. The compliance plan provisions were drafted by Attorney-General Lavarch and his team. They have been the subject of consultation and discussion since December 1995, and they are designed to perform a key role in the investor protection regime. I have made it clear that the government—unless, on the absolute face of it, there is some overwhelmingly meritorious provision that cannot in any way undermine the provisions of the bill—will not be supporting these amendments. I have suggested a positive and constructive route and that is to refer them to 
 the corporate law standing committee and have them dealt with by that committee, have them report back to the parliament and the government and to make decisions on these matters in six or seven weeks time when that bill comes back before this Senate.
I cannot see merit in changing the compliance plan in this way.

(12)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 26 (line 4), after ""scheme,"", insert ""and every 3 months thereafter,"".
This amendment requires the auditor of the compliance plan to audit quarterly. The reasons are to facilitate early detection of any problems, inconsistencies or fraudulent practices. Once per year, in our opinion, is insufficient. It gives the auditor the ability to monitor on an ongoing basis, and perhaps that makes the annual audit a lot quicker. Even 
 minor breaches may be an early warning sign of more serious non-compliance in the future or serious but latent problems within the scheme. It also gives the SRE regular feedback on the compliance plan and allows the SRE to make the necessary changes. It is an incentive to be vigilant because regular audits give the SRE incentives to maintain their compliance with the plan.
It is possible, under the bill as it exists now, for there to be no external audit or compliance for up to 15 months after the commencement of a scheme, given that the audit would only need to take place within three months after the end of the financial year of the scheme. So basically people would not know for some time that something had gone very wrong.
Serious operational and compliance problems frequently show up in the early stages when a new scheme is developed. It is extremely important that there be frequent third party reviews of compliance in the absence of an independent trustee. These reviews should be carried out quarterly. An example of a problem that could arise with the inadequacy of the annual audit as opposed to quarterly audits is that of the payment of fees or reimbursement of expenses to the responsible entity.
Under section 601GA of the bill, a scheme's constitution must provide that a responsible entity is entitled to be paid fees or be reimbursed for expenses only in relation to the proper performance of its duties. Once again, like the managers who potentially put their constitutional changes together on some overseas posh holiday—that was just an example—no independent party signs off on the fees or expenses claimed by the responsible entity. It effectively pays itself. A dishonest responsible entity could easily abuse this power unless truly independent compliance audits are carried out fairly frequently. In the absence of the independent trustee, surely this would be something that could make people feel more at ease with the scheme that the government has set up.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1

 books  includes financial records.
This amendment clears up any potential confusion as to what constitutes books, given that the government, the opposition and, in this case, the Democrats believe that once a year will be enough, and sometimes up to once in 15 months, for a scheme. This allows the auditor of the compliance plan access to original financial records as opposed to the mere recording of financial information on the books of the scheme. Why is this necessary? The auditor needs access to the original financial records in order to be thorough.

The answer to the amendment is that under section 9 of the Corporations Law as it exists there is a definition of books which includes `a register; any other record of information; accounts or accounting records, however compiled, recorded or stored; and a document.' So there is an all-inclusive definition of books which I think you are seeking to put in which is already in the Corporations Law under managed investments legislation.

(15)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 29 (after line 7), at the end of Part 5C.4, add:
		 601HJ  Members' right to information on scheme held by ASC
	 (1)	 A member of a registered scheme is entitled, during normal business hours of the ASC, to inspect and take copies of any document that relates to the affairs of the scheme.
	 (2)	 Subsection (1) applies to any document lodged with the ASC by:
		 (a)	 that scheme;
		 (b)	 that scheme's compliance committee;
		 (c)	 that scheme's supervising trustee;
		 (d)	 that scheme's responsible entity; or
		 (e)	 another person.
	 (3)	 The right under subsection (1) to inspect and take copies of documents is an additional right and does not limit subsection 601FC(2).  

	 (4)	 The Freedom of Information Act 1982  does not limit a member's right to gain access to information under this section.
	 (5)	 An action for defamation does not lie against any person in respect of the publication by any person of a document to which a member has been granted access under subsection (1).
This amendment provides investors with access at a reasonable price to documents lodged with the Australian Securities Commission or its new form. It protects them from defamation proceedings if it makes these documents public. It ensures that the Freedom of Information Act exemptions do not limit this right of access.
Why is this necessary? This is necessary in terms of access because access to information is a key aspect of enforcing compliance. Remember, the parliamentary secretary said that people will have recourse if they can take their managers to court. Of course, to be able to take their managers to court, they would have to have some idea about what has gone wrong in relation to documents lodged with the ASC.
It is a basic principle of trust law that beneficiaries are entitled to information about the management of their property and to inspect trust documents—and for that, I refer to re Londonderry settlement. The right of beneficiaries to inspect trust documents flows logically from their ownership of what they have paid for. It ensures that the right of access cannot be modified or abolished.
However, this right can be modified or cut down by the trust instrument, or it may be adversely affected by contracts binding the responsible entity to commercial secrecy. Thus, the responsible entity could limit investors' normal rights to inspect trust documents by entering into a commercial agreement with confidentiality clauses. For instance, a responsible entity may sign such contracts with its parent company to shield documents from investors.
As the bill stands, there is also nothing to stop a scheme's constitution prohibiting—I repeat, prohibiting—a member's access to any information. For instance, the constitution could say that members may be entitled to 
 inspect documents after giving one month's notice in writing of their wish to do so. Inspection shall be subject to the absolute discretion of the single responsible entity, and the single responsibility entity shall be under no obligation to give reasons for the exercise of this discretion.
Obviously, in terms of accountability, the threat of publicity is all very important. The most potent inducement to compliance is to ensure that investors in managed funds have a clear and unqualified statutory right to any information held by the ASC—and, remember, the parliamentary secretary has just said that documents lodged by the ASC could be accessed. In relation to the fund, financial transparency is assured, and the markets are better insulated from potential abuses of trust or conflicts of interest—for instance, responsible entities using investor funds to bolster the profits of an associated underwriter facing a shortfall.
Potential publicity is a powerful inducement for responsible entities to avoid such conflicts of interest. Since defamation law is frequently used to suppress reporting of financial irregularities, it is desirable that publication of documents be privileged and that the law not be allowed to be used to draw an opaque screen over questionable actions of fund managers.
It should be noted that defamation law is never available to hinder free press reporting in the financial markets of the United States. Overseas analysts have commented unfavourably on how, in some countries in the region, such as Malaysia, legal threats have been used to suppress adverse economic or investment commentary. Are we going to have that in here to be competitive with the region?
In terms of transparency, much has been made recently of how the Asian financial crisis owes much to lack of financial transparency—and haven't we said a lot to the region about how this should be avoided—and how crony capitalism has masked underlying weaknesses in investment. It could be most unfortunate if the bill were to proceed without measures to ensure full transparency to investors on how their funds are managed. It is hardly necessary to state how such an omis 
 sion would damage Australia's financial reputation.
One expects this amendment to have the support of the government, which is at pains to differentiate Australia's financial system from some of those in Asia and to dispel overseas ideas that our markets are rigged by insiders, like some Asian financial markets. This amendment should provide early warning, because investors raising queries on documents with the ASC may well act as an early warning system for spotting potential problems of fund mismanagement, and it does not affect strategic decision making.
This right of investors to know does not cut across fund managers' strategic decision making or prejudice beneficial investment opportunities for investors since the documents and reports would normally go to the ASC after investment decisions have been made and implemented. It would only be in a rare case of dispute over legality or propriety of disposed investment that reports might become public in advance. But that is proper and appropriate, as investors ought to know if there are serious questions over proposed investments.
In relation to avoiding exemption in the freedom of information, as the Freedom of Information Act applies to the Australian Securities Commission, it is necessary to ensure that the intention of this section is not thwarted by claims of exemption under the act, such as client privilege or commercial in confidence. It is simply not appropriate that an investor seeking information as to what has been done with his or her money be met with any ground of refusal by an administrative body charged with a duty of monitoring the investment scheme.
There should be a cap on price. Investors are free to take copies of documents with their own equipment, such as portable scanners, without being charged, or to have the ASC provide copies for them at not more than 20c per page. This figure is reasonable in light of the fees and taxes paid by investors towards the ASC's running costs—otherwise, the government would be getting us to pay twice.   
What we are saying is more than reasonable. Basically, we are saying that we should have some transparency with people's money. Honourable senators may remember that, when the Greens (WA) asked that people have access to information about their superannuation funds originally—that is, where their money was going—shock, horror, the world was going to fall apart. Now we are proudly told by the insurance industry that this is part of normal practice; all good insurance companies do it—and, of course, there are legal requirements in there. We were part of the process which required that to happen—and the world did not end. In fact, it is considered to be quite good commercial practice for people to be able to tell others where their choices are within superannuation.
So I do not believe that the world will end here either. We are talking about people's basic right to know what is being done with their money—not anybody else's money. We are not protecting some commercial in confidence relating to otherwise unknown entities; we are talking about people being able to access what is happening to their own money. Hence, I would commend this amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—A few points that Senator Margetts makes demand a response. Firstly, the information must be lodged with the ASC, will be entered on the database and will be accessible by the public. Secondly, the ASC is entirely funded by levies on corporations. Even though corporations are taxpayers, it is not funded from the consolidated revenue in the normal way; it is actually entirely funded by fees charged to companies and it is entirely self-funded. 
Finally, even if you were overseas on a junket fiddling with your constitution, you could not put in your constitution that members had to give three months notice or whatever in writing and charge them an exorbitant fee, because 601GC(4) requires that the constitution be provided to a member within seven days for a fee which is limited by regulation.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1

Quite clearly, the reason why certain materials have to be made available to the ASC—or the ASIC, as it will now become—is that they are matters that ought to be available to the public and on the public record, and they are lodged there for that purpose. I think to pretend there is some sort of veil of prevention to access those documents, as this seems to suggest, is wrong. In fact, it is quite counter to the purposes of the provisions within the ASIC itself. For those reasons, I do not support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—I remind the Senate that basically the problem occurs when those documents are withheld, and there might potentially be some reason for the ASC to withhold them which might not be fair on the actual investor, the holder of money. The concern was not that it was not lodged with the ASC—we know it is—but there are a number of reasons why information about a person's own investments are, in fact, withheld by the ASC. We are saying there should be a right of access, and there is no good reason I can think of why a person does not have a right of access to their own documentation lodged with the ASC.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—I do not want to be rude and interrupt—genuinely; I try not to be rude—but can I suggest that Senator Margetts might give some consideration to moving amendments Nos 21, 22 and 23 while she is moving amendments Nos 16 to 20. They all deal with the functions of the compliance committee, and it might be natural to cognate debate on those. I understand that we are now moving to amendments Nos 16 to 20.

Amendments Nos 16 to 20 ensure that the compliance committee reports any breaches to the Australian Securities Commission as well as to the SRE. They also require the compliance committee to report its assessment of the adequacy of the compliance plan to the ASC as well as to the SRE. Currently, this bill only requires the compliance committee to report to the Australian Securities Commission if it is satisfied the SRE has not taken or will not take appropriate action. Currently, the Australian Securities Commission is not privy at all to the comments on the adequacy of the compliance plan.
Why is it necessary? It increases the independent watchdog role. It is not enough to tell the responsible entity what it, itself, has done and only report to the Australian Securities Commission if the responsible entity has taken no action to remedy those breaches. If the compliance committee has to wait until the responsible entity takes action—if it takes action—before informing the regulator, the compliance committee's role as independent watchdog is severely weakened.
In terms of timing, significant damage may occur to members' investments in the meantime through improper dealings and possibly fraud. It facilitates early detection of problems. Although it seems a routine matter, a report on these matters to the ASC will serve as an early warning mechanism that there may be problems with the quality or level of compliance required of the responsible entity and, thus, larger, more serious problems can be averted. If the SRE knows that all breaches will be reported to the Australian Securities Commission, they have an incentive to ensure that they are following the compliance plan to the letter. It is not an onerous requirement; this extra requirement will require no more than a postage stamp or the electricity required for a fax or an e-mail.
Greens (WA) amendment No. 21 relates to independent advice available to the compliance committee. It allows the compliance committee to have independent legal, accounting, computing or other specialist professional advice to assist it in making assessments. 
 Why is it necessary? In carrying out its functions in an independent fashion, the compliance committee may need this advice. It should have the right to acquire such advice independently and at the expense of the responsible entity so that it can perform its functions thoroughly. One wonders what they might be forced to do if they did not have that right.
Amendment No. 22 increases duties on compliance committee members. Compliance committee members are required to act solely in the interests of members. Why? Because under the bill the duties of compliance committee members are significantly less strict than those of the board of directors. Because the compliance committee members stand in the place of independent directors and have the role of scheme watchdog in the absence of an independent trustee, the members of the compliance committee should have at least the same scope of responsibility as the directors of the responsible entity. Compliance committee members should act as fiduciaries solely in the interest of investors; they should not be the servants of two masters.
Amendment No. 23 relates to new section 601JD(3). This requires that each member report any compliance breaches to the ASC. Why not? It requires that compliance committee members are given qualified privilege regarding notification of breaches to the Australian Securities Commission so that they have some protection and thus will not be reluctant to perform their duty to notify the Australian Securities Commission. It is necessary to create a positive duty. Although it is stated to be a function of the compliance committee itself, placing a positive duty on each member of the committee ensures that breaches must be reported.
Arguably, a statement of function is not the same as a positive duty to do something, nor is it as strong an indication of the importance of the requirement. Thus the committee members should have a positive duty to report breaches of the constitution, of the compliance plan and of the Corporations Law of which they become aware as soon as possible to the ASC. Remember that we have heard that there is no guarantee that the members 
 are going to know that these things are happening. These are the same requirements as those placed on the auditor of the compliance plan.
Amendment No. 23 also has a new subsection 601JD(4), which gives compliance committee members access to documents. For compliance committee members to be effective, they must have access as of right to the records, documents and offices of the responsible entity. How would they report otherwise? This amendment gives them the same rights of access to information enjoyed by the compliance plan auditor under section 601HG(5) and 601HG(6).
Amendment No. 23 also inserts a new subsection 601JD(5). This makes compliance committee members directly liable to investors for failure to perform their statutory duties. It enables greater accountability, and a high level of responsibility and accountability such as this strengthens investor protection and, should I say, investor confidence. Compliance committee members will take their responsibilities seriously and remain vigilant regarding compliance by the responsible entity if this is the case.
Considering that I have put all my arguments together, I will be very pleased to hear the details of why the government this time does not like them. Of course, I am still happy to see that there will be some review of this later if all of them are knocked back.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—I can assure Senator Margetts that this scheme will be kept under review by the parliament and also by the government, and most definitely on a day-to-day basis by the ASIC.
I will respond specifically to the amendments moved by the Greens (WA), firstly Nos 16 to 20. These amendments attack, not in an aggressive way but in a philosophical way, the concept of the responsible entity. We are trying to build here a culture of compliance within managed investment schemes, where the responsibility is placed on the directors. That is different to the concept of having an outside trustee looking over the shoulders of the directors and other third parties all trying 
 to have their say. We are trying to build structures within managed investment organisations that create a culture of compliance, and the compliance committee is part of that. It has functions as defined in the law, and in many respects the Greens' amendments say that they have quite specific duties and try to set out those duties in a check list sort of approach. I guess members of compliance committees could, if they had ticked the boxes, say, `I have been a good compliance committee member,' just by ticking that box that the law places in front of them, and then forget the other duties and responsibilities they might owe.
The bill seeks to adopt what we consider the more correct position, the one that will maximise investor protection. Under this position, the compliance committee must report any breaches to the responsible entity and it also must report the breaches to the ASC if it believes that the responsible entity is failing to act. In other words, if the responsible entity has had a report made by the compliance committee and the responsible entity fails to act on that report, the ASC must be advised. We think that seeks the right balance. It is encouraging internal redress before you run off to the ASC. The ASC certainly does not need to be made aware of each and every breach, no matter how minor or inadvertent. But, if there is failure to act, certainly it becomes a responsibility of the compliance committee to inform the ASC.
We also note that under section 601FC(1)(l) the responsible entity is under a duty to report to the ASC any breach of the law that has had or is likely to have a materially adverse effect on members' interests as soon as practical after it becomes aware of the breach.
Greens' amendment No. 21, together with Greens' amendments Nos 22 and 23—these comments relate equally to those now cognated amendments—would probably create a situation where the members of the compliance committee owed fiduciary duties directly to investors in the scheme. As I have said a couple of times, this begins to undermine the foundations of the single responsible entity concept, and once you do that you then undermine the move that the Managed Invest 
 ments Bill sets up—that is, creating a direct fiduciary responsibility, uninterrupted, between the responsible entity and the investors.
Once again, the amendment—I do not think it is doing so intentionally—seeks to undermine this concept. It seeks to set up an array of fiduciary obligations to members which may well conflict with those of the responsible entity or confuse members as to the responsible entity's duties. This is the problem. If you are all of a sudden whittling away at the responsible entity concept by setting up fiduciary responsibilities around that entity to the extent that those bodies, compliance committees and other parts of the structure, owe fiduciary responsibilities directly to investors, you reduce the responsibility of the directors of the responsible entity.
That is what is at the core of the concept. You want to keep the directors of the responsible entity wholly and fully responsible to the investors. Sure, you can contract out managerial type responsibilities within the scheme, but they cannot, and cannot be allowed to by the law, contract out their fiduciary responsibility to the investors, which is paramount in this scheme.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—If we get a situation where perhaps the whole of the committee knows that a director is doing the wrong thing and they are not required by law to say anything, what will be the legal comeback after that?",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—They are required to. If the responsible entity has been informed of that breach and they have not taken action on it, they are required to report it. Furthermore, there is another internal redress, which we have already covered, and that is the independent third party audit of compliance with the compliance plan. So, even if the compliance committee are not fulfilling their duties, the auditors will pick up on that. We believe it is an integrated structure that offers the best protection for investors and protection of the investors' funds. It is also a different approach to that which is built into the existing scheme, where you are relying on a number of different organisations, primarily the trustee 
 and the manager, owing separate fiduciary responsibilities to investors. This one tries to build a different culture; it tries to build a culture of compliance within the organisations.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—The parliamentary secretary says that we should be able to trust those people who have the role of carrying out those responsibilities. The simple question here is: if what we are trying to do in our amendments is to make sure that culture is an automatic one—that people know there are a number of people who also have a statutory obligation to advise if they are doing the wrong thing—does not what we are doing ensure a greater level of compliance? Are your actions and your changes going to, or are they designed to, increase the level of compliance or maintain the level of compliance, or is it crossing your fingers and hoping for the best?",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—I guess that is more of a second reading, philosophical type question, but it is an important one. The government is setting up this scheme, which puts in place onerous responsibilities on directors and members of compliance committees, because we believe very strongly, as the former Attorney-General Mr Lavarch did, that you cannot stand by and allow a legislative and regulatory structure to remain in place that allows investors to be so destroyed as they were in the Aust-Wide and Estate Mortgage collapses. That is what caused the CASAC and ALRC review to take place.
Multimillions of dollars worth of investors' money went straight down the tube because there was this false sense of protection under the existing legislation. That is why Mr Duffy appointed the review, that is why Mr Lavarch brought the legislation in and that is why this government took its responsibility very seriously and spent the last 18 months looking at the failure of the existing legislative regime. We made a decision, as a government, as the previous government did, that we could not stand by—and that we would be negligent to stand by—and allow this legislative scheme 
 to stay in place and not proceed down this path. We take that responsibility extremely seriously and that is why we are here tonight.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I can agree with the government on the first tranche of what we are dealing with cognately—amendments 16 to 20—and on amendments 22 and 23. However, I have a question about amendment 21. Amendment 21 relates to the function of the compliance committee. It is proposed that there be an extra clause added to the provisions in the bill which would say:
In carrying out its functions, the compliance committee may commission independent legal, accounting or other professional advice or assistance, at the reasonable expense of the responsible entity.
Prima facie, there is a point here which goes to what qualifications and background might the compliance committee have. Can the parliamentary secretary enlighten me on that and foreshadow where this question heads? If they do not have available to them, within their committee, the necessary professional qualifications, what is to prevent them from accessing this type of advice anyway within the bill as it stands without this amendment?",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—The compliance committee is a creature of the responsible entity and it is very much in the interests of the responsible entity to ensure that the compliance committee fulfils its roles and functions under the compliance plan. If it fails to do so then it is going to be in breach not only of its own plan but also of the law. It is a function of the responsible entity. The entity is required by the law to ensure the compliance committee works properly and complies with the law. So it is in the interests of the scheme, in the interests of the responsible entity and in the interests of the investors to ensure the compliance committee is given the resources and information it requires. There is nothing to prevent that happening; in fact, it is all designed to encourage that to happen.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-22,"—Do I understand that answer to mean that, if this amendment were not carried, nonetheless, the compliance committee could, if it felt the need, commission independent legal, accounting or other professional advice or assistance at a reasonable expense of the responsible entity in order that it discharge its obligations under the provisions of this bill?
—That assumption is quite correct.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-06-22,"—The parliamentary secretary is quite right. What he is experiencing here is indeed a philosophical clash, and the clash is between those who think that the bill has inadequate investor protection and the government which thinks that their bill improves investor protection. What Senator Margetts has been seeking to do is assist elements of the bill to help protect investors to a greater degree.
That same clash is evident in the parliamentary secretary's interpretation—and, indeed, the government's interpretation—of the collapse of Aust-wide and other funds some years ago. Those on the side of the trustees having a role to play in fund management were acquainted at the hearings by extensive evidence, including in camera, that the presence of trustees enabled greater recovery of moneys to occur than if the trustees had not been there.
What we are talking about here, parliamentary secretary, is not a perfect system as it exists, and I would doubt that you would claim that your proposed system would be perfect. You are merely, I hope, proposing that it would be better. Nevertheless, since it is a clash of views, I think you should accept that the evidence is there to support both sides of the argument. You obviously put your side and Senator Margetts and others will put theirs.
I, as you know, have long campaigned on this bill to enhance investor security. I believe that these particular sets of amendments do not take away from the bill but that they add to the protections that investors might look for. In particular, if Senator Cook, on behalf of the ALP, is inclined to separate out item 
 21 and support it, I would support that course of action as well.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,—I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary a question in relation to the investigation by the ASC into the Crown Casino. What was the basis upon which the Crown Casino's management was actually investigated?,SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—That question is entirely irrelevant to this area because that happened under the continuous disclosure regime, under ASX listing rules and under the corporations law. Managed investment schemes are quite different creatures from that. That is why we have this piece of legislation. They are very different creatures.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—The parliamentary secretary has chosen not to answer. A board member actually had to resign in this particular case in order to pass on to the Australian Securities Commission information which would not have reached them otherwise. That is the kind of message that I am trying to give. In the case of Crown Casino, just requiring the management to do the right thing obviously did not work by itself, and there needed to be that backup to make sure that the ASC actually did take action and investigate.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I am sure the parliamentary secretary has answered this fully, but I am struggling to keep up. If I may indulge the Senate for a moment, I would like to go back over it. When I talked about amendment 21 of the Greens, I asked whether it was possible for the compliance committee to do these things without there being this amendment carried, and I understood the answer to be yes. In that case, it would seem to me that the need to carry this amendment is removed. Obviously if it is within the competence of the committee to do so and they do not breach any law or other provision, then they can have access to outside professional accounting, legal or other advice.
Since I raised that matter, I note that the Australian Democrats have also expressed an interest in this. Whilst accepting your advice, parliamentary secretary, would you mind pointing to the section of the bill which states how they may exercise that responsibility?",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—I would point out two things. Firstly, there is nowhere in the bill that says that they are allowed to do that, but certainly they are not prohibited from doing it. Paragraph (b) of section 601JD(1), which deals with duties of members, states that a member of a scheme's compliance committee must:
. . . exercise the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise if they were in the member's position; and
Paragraph (c) states:
not make use of information acquired through being a member of the committee in order to . . .
To not seek that advice, to not get that professional assistance, could in fact be contrary to their duties. I do not think any reasonable person could say, `Sorry, that wasn't available. I am going to lock myself in a glass cage and I cannot get the information.' That is unreasonable, and I am sure any court would find that.
In terms of members of the compliance committee giving information to ASIC—or ASC as it is at the moment and, I think, will be until 1 July—there are two matters that the Senate should be aware of. I am sure Senator Cook, Senator Margetts and all senators would be interested in this. A member of the compliance committee under subsection 601JD(2) is required to take all reasonable steps to assist the ASC—so it is quite a positive duty there—in carrying out a check under subsection 601FF(1).
In terms of providing information to the ASC, which is a matter Senator Margetts has just raised in relation to the Crown matter, 601JE states:
A member of a scheme's compliance committee has qualified privilege in respect of a statement concerning the operation of the scheme made by or on behalf of the committee, or a member of the committee, to the responsible entity or to the ASC. 

So they have quite significant protection there in making reports. I think that covers one of the issues that you raised earlier.
My attention has just been drawn to page 23 of the bill. Paragraph (b) of section 601HA, the contents of compliance plan requirements, states:
(b)	 if the scheme is required to have a compliance committee . . . ensuring that the compliance committee functions properly, including adequate arrangements relating to:
(i)		 the membership of the committee; and
(ii)		 how often the committee meetings are to be held; and
(iii)		 the committee's reports . . .
Subparagraph (v) states:
the committee's access to information that is relevant to the responsible entity's compliance with this Law . . . 
So I think it is making it quite clear that they have access to that and resourcing to that extent. It would be obviously unreasonable for that not to occur.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I am grateful for that explanation. Would I be right in assuming that, if a compliance committee wanted to commission some outside advice and were advised, for example, by the single responsible entity, then under section 601JD, duties of members, they could then rely on the points you have referred to as being their responsibility in seeking that advice and, if there were still some obstruction, the logical course of action for them then to take would be to go to the ASC or the ASIC?",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—Committee members, I believe, have qualified privilege so that allows them to speak only between themselves and the ASC. The parliamentary secretary mentioned that the committee members had a requirement to assist the ASC in an investigation. I do not think anyone is disputing that that could be the case. I am suggesting that there needs to be some point by which that information is naturally put to the ASC if there is a compliance fault. It is all very well people virtually waiting, feeling they need to wait or waiting for some reason until the ASC asks 
 them and then assisting but perhaps not saying anything or lying doggo until they are asked and maybe then and only then telling the truth. We are suggesting that that may well be too late.
If you are suggesting that a member of a committee could have given information without being sued earlier, I do not know if that is correct because it depends whom they were giving it to. In relation to the committee members, it is a qualified privilege between committee members and the ASC. So, basically, they are not entirely covered to make that information public.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—I am informed by greater legal minds than mine that it is qualified to the extent that, firstly, it must be provided to the ASC; it cannot be provided to other people. Secondly, it is qualified to the extent that, if the information that was being provided was malicious or not in good faith, then the privilege would not apply in that respect.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,—I was just asking the parliamentary secretary what the ASC can do with that information. Do they themselves have privilege to be able to provide that to the wider public arena or do they themselves not have privilege?,SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—The ASC does indeed have a qualified privilege to do that.
—To do what?
—To provide that information to the public if it so chooses. That was the question, was it not? If the ASC received this information to say that the Margetts trust funds management is stuffing up and not complying with their plan and that is provided by Andrew Murray, who is on the compliance committee who gets his qualified privilege, then Mr Cameron can say, `This is information that is in the public interest,' and they have privilege in relation to that information. That is something the ASC does fairly 
 regularly in relation to breaches of the Corporations Law now.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—The compliance committee `may commission independent advice'. Is that basically a right that they have? There is nothing in the legislation which says they may not or cannot do that. But basically it says, if it is in legislation, somebody will assist them, I guess. If someone went to a tax adviser or a financial lawyer and said, `What can I do here?', then at least there would be something that said, `You have the right to commission other professional advice.' That may well be of assistance.
If it is not said that it cannot be done, I am not sure that that means necessarily that they will have access to that or that information that is provided to them will actually be able to be used in the way they would like it to be. So I do agree with Senator Cook—at least that is what I think Senator Cook was saying. If we were to vote on that, then perhaps we might get a reasonable outcome. It is a highly reasonable that people should be able to access that kind of advice in order to benefit from reasonable outcomes. That advice should be there potentially as a right and should be considered to be part of the proper process.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-22,"—Just for the record, I think the parliamentary secretary said yes in answer to my earlier question. I see him nodding in the affirmative and I take that to be affirmation that my statement is now true.
—What—that they can do it?
—No, earlier I asked: if the compliance committee wanted to exercise their rights under duties of members and somehow or other they were told by the single responsible entity that that person would not pay for the outside consultations of professionals, then could they exercise their rights under section 601JD, duties of members? And if there were still some obstruction, could they then go and approach the ASC or the ASIC? They were my questions and I think for the Hansard  record they were overtaken by a subsequent question without 
 the reply being included in the Hansard . The reason why I have just sought affirmation is to get the reply in Hansard .

—You have got a nod in the Hansard .
—I have got a nod in the Hansard . But I think the Hansard  would show that you have said yes.
—I understand someone gave a wink last night and it is not good enough for me to give a nod tonight, so I will say yes.
—A wink and a nod together might be a more compelling affirmation. This is a problem that I am trying to wrestle with. I think the functions of the compliance committee are quite important. I do not gainsay for one moment any of the explanations made by the parliamentary secretary, and I think all of them are true. Therefore, if one took a rigid reading of legislation—the reading I am prone to always take, I must say—then there is no need to unnecessarily clutter the bill with explanatory amendments which are not needed when one can read into this the normal rights and responsibilities of a body such as a compliance committee or the rights, responsibilities and duties of members.
The question now, though, however sums down in my mind to whether I ought to vote for amendment 21 on the grounds that it provides a signpost in the legislation which may direct people in doubt as to what their rights are to, in fact, what their rights might be. So that we are not taking things as understood or read within the legislation; it is clearly stated in there. As I say, my normal approach to this is not to clutter legislation unnecessarily. From time to time I have voted against amendments which simply restate provisions that are written in the law everywhere in the bill and make it a cluttered and unreadable document. I often vote against amendments which set out general statements. This is an amendment which sets out a general statement.
I am tempted to vote for it, but I must say that I think I am talking myself into not doing so on the basis that, to anyone who is in any 
 doubt about this debate, the Hansard must surely be a fairly clear guide as to what the rights and obligations are and what the parliament thinks is the appropriate way of handling them. While it is appealing to put a signpost amendment in, I think it is better to keep the legislation as clean and as uncluttered as possible.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-06-22,"—I was hoping to be able to help Senator Cook, but I think he has persuaded himself otherwise. I would say this to you about amendment 21, Senator Cook: we all in this room have probably sat on committees. Some of us have sat on boards. A few of the lucky ones have been ministers or parliamentary secretaries. We are aware that, if there is doubt, generally speaking you look for black letter. You either go to your constitution—or  your memorandum and articles, as they used to be—or you go to the act. This specific area is an area in which, in my view, a compliance committee may be populated by people who may not be aware of the forceful approach that they might be entitled to take. Let us assume that they have some fund managers who are in turn rather forceful. Those fund managers may persuade them that to go in this direction would exceed their brief or what they are allowed to do. I think it highly unlikely that, in those circumstances, they are going to refer to the Hansard  record. I think it highly likely that they will refer either to the act or to the constitution.
If there had been a note in the act that would, I think, have met your hope, Senator Cook. Senator Margetts has not designed it as a note. I think its explicitness does not take away from the intention of the bill. I think it adds to the independent powers of the compliance committee. It is, I think, Parliamentary Secretary, your intention that the members of the compliance committee exhibit both independence and determination to ensure that investors' funds are appropriately protected. I may have been too late to intervene, but that is my view, for what it is worth, Senator Cook.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-22,"—Mr Temporary Chair 
 man, I have been cogitating on the remarks of the Australian Democrats. I must say that the remark that does persuade me in this case is that the type of people concerned here may not be the type of people who are familiar with reading the Hansard  record. I am inclined, therefore, to reverse my earlier expression of opposition to this amendment.
—I can give you some other reasons, if you like.
—Nothing is worse than a procrastinator. I disdain procrastination—I prefer to be decisive. If there are other reasons, Parliamentary Secretary, I do not want to delay the debate unnecessarily, but I would be silly not to listen to them. I will not insult you by not doing so.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—I appreciate that. It was a point that I made when I was putting it all together. It is very much making it clear that creating a special right in the law that these members can go out and do this—as opposed to leaving it as something that they would do in the normal course of their business—does create the potential and the perception that members of the compliance committee, or the compliance committee as a whole, owe a separate and different fiduciary responsibility to the investors. That is what the government is trying to avoid.
As a government, in considering any amendments made by the Senate, we will look very closely at anything that impinges upon the fiduciary relationship or that even alludes to a separate relationship between a particular part of the responsible entity and the investors. Our legal advice is that there is a risk in making this explicit in the bill when you are not making a whole lot of other things explicit.
Even though I have made it quite clear that there is no reason that a member of the committee could not, in reasonably carrying out their duties, go out and get that advice—and we have gone through all of the areas that make it clear that they can do so, and no-one can point to where they cannot get that advice—the risk that the government sees in this is that, by putting such a signpost in the 
 legislation, you are creating a signpost that the parliament is saying that there is owed by these people a special fiduciary duty that is not in place for other members of the responsible entity. That is why we are concerned about that.
I have just been handed another note, which reinforces the fact that they may be forced to go out and get some independent advice. If they do not have legal, accounting, investment management or whatever other advice, you may actually require them to go out and get this sort of advice. It is not simply a matter of `Let's put this in the law and make a little note': it creates a serious concern for the government, and I would ask Senator Cook to think seriously about it. I alert you to the fact that the government does take this amendment quite seriously and that we will look at it in terms of the impact it has on the single responsible entity concept, because that is where the government sees the main risk.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—I guess the inevitable question to the parliamentary secretary is: what on earth is the point of having this committee? What on earth do they do, if they do not have guaranteed access to original data and they do not have any guaranteed requirement that they must actually report if something is going wrong? I can imagine there must be dozens of ex-parliamentarians who would be putting their hand up gleefully to be members of these committees, because they will be paid a nice little sum of money and they will not have any responsibility. What you have done is create a nonsense of a committee that does not have any real role to play. Mr Temporary Chairman, I would like you to put amendment No. 21 first.

(24)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 36 (after line 3), at the end of Part 5C.5, add:
		 601JK  Members to approve removal of external directors and compliance committee members
	 (1)	 Subject to subsection (2), the responsible entity may, with the ASC's consent, remove an external director or member of the compliance committee of the responsible entity.
	 (2)	 An external director of a responsible entity or a member of the compliance committee may not be removed before the expiry of his or her term of office without a special resolution of members of each scheme registered by the responsible entity approving the removal of the external director or compliance committee member at a meeting called by the responsible entity under Division 1 of Part 2G.4.
Amendment No. 24 requires members to approve removal of external directors and compliance committee members. It requires a special resolution before external directors and members of the compliance committee can be removed. Currently, there is nothing to stop directors from removing these independent watchdogs at will. It is necessary because there is no security of tenure.
The bill does not prevent the arbitrary removal of external directors from the board of the responsible entity, nor of compliance committee members from the compliance committee. In other words, if they give out information that some members of the board do not want known, they can be removed. There is no security of tenure, and no notice of removal is required to be given to investors of the removal of an external director or of a compliance committee member. That does compromise the independence of these people, and the performance of their functions and duties is thus severely compromised.
Under the bill, these people are appointed by the responsible entity, are paid by it and can be dismissed by it without cause or due process. There is nothing in the bill to prevent a responsible entity from dismissing a truly independent external director or compliance committee member who may be asking too many probing questions and replacing them with somebody more compliant, nor perhaps 
 from continuing to replace them until they get the right answers.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—We will be opposing this amendment because, already under the law, the responsible entity is under an obligation to have either a board with a majority of independent directors or a compliance committee with a majority of independent members. As long as the responsible entity complies with that requirement, the law should not be overly prescriptive about the mechanisms followed to achieve that result. There can be no doubt, certainly in the government's mind, that these amendments could result in extremely long delays in changing the composition of boards or compliance committees, where that is required, or even where the relevant board member or committee member wishes to resign.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1

(11)	 An action under subsection (10) must be begun within 6 years after the cause of action arises.
Parliamentary Secretary, you would probably have guessed that, of all our amendments, this is the most important for us, because I know you read our minority report with great care. The essence of our argument has been that we accept that the government has the right to pursue a different direction with this bill. We accept that the government may have the right to determine that future schemes should be shaped in a manner which is determined by the government, and which all investors would know is the law, because that would be the basis on which they first enter those schemes.
Our problem has consistently been with investors who are in existing schemes, who are going to find their funds changed as a result of this law, without them having any say in that whatsoever. We have consistently argued that it is contrary to the coalition's own belief in choice, and it is contrary to good and ethical practice, for that to occur. So Democrat amendment 15 goes to the heart 
 of choice: that where investors' own money is at stake, they should have the right to determine in existing schemes whether the existing format continues or whether they move to the government's new format. We are not talking about future schemes, we are talking about existing schemes.
This amendment refers to the situation where the two bodies presently existing have the opportunity to give a retirement notice. It refers to what happens if neither of the bodies gives a retirement notice. What the Democrats have recommended here is that after the first year, if neither the manager nor the trustee has retired, transitional period fund managers—and the transitional period, as you know, is two years—and trustees must separately devise the for and against cases for their scheme, have their cases approved in a form acceptable to the ASC which would ensure therefore that they are objectively and truthfully put, and put them to the vote of investors in that existing fund. We have proposed that a simple majority should determine the outcome.
If, as the proponents and the supporters of the bill argue, and as the government argues, the case for single responsible entities is so overwhelming, then investors will surely plump for them. We are suggesting to you, Parliamentary Secretary, and to the government, that if this is your belief you should have faith in it and not be afraid to offer the investors choice in case they do not go with your model.
Especially when you have majors such as the AMP, recently launched on the Stock Exchange with an immense thump, when you have the Bankers Trust, when you have these huge corporations like Lend Lease or very smart market operators like Macquarie, they should be able to show investors that their capital, legal and accounting resources make it possible for them to do without a trustee. But not giving investors a choice implies a fear by the government and the proponents and the supporters of this bill that investors in existing funds—not in future funds—may in fact disagree. I say to you, if they do disagree, that is their right; it is their money. It 
 is their right to disagree. It is their right to choose to retain the existing set-up.
The trustees are independent from the managers of the funds, are presently licensed by the ASC and are paid from trust assets. They are in a fiduciary relationship with members of the fund scheme. They hold the legal title to trust assets as custodian. They monitor compliance with the manager's obligations under the trust deed and they take enforcement action on behalf of fund members where the manager is in breach of the trust deed.
I have had enough conversations with you, Parliamentary Secretary Campbell, and I have heard enough from you in the hearings and on the Senate floor to know that you can point to deficiencies in that relationship. I accept that there are deficiencies. What I do not accept is that investors should not be able to choose whether they stay with a system that they are familiar with even if it does have deficiencies and warts. That is my problem. My problem is not that we disagree philosophically; my problem is that existing investors are going to be compelled to change from a set-up where they may indeed find themselves more secure.
Much better informed people than any of us senators in this place have said there is greater risk from this scheme. I am quite aware, too, that much better informed people have said there is less risk in the scheme. There are two sides to the coin. But why take the risk? Why not allow investors to make the choice? If we are to allow trustees a role in these cases in which they are desired by investors, desired by people—it is their money—then we felt that in this amendment that role needs to be spelt out. If you go through the amendment—it is a fairly lengthy one but it does have the virtue of having been pre-circulated—you will see that we have spelt out, both in common law and in statutory law, the understood functions of a trustee.
I am pretty certain, because I have had long conversations with the Parliamentary Secretary, that he will stand up and say no to my amendment. But my plea is to the remainder of the Senate to pay attention to the needs of 
 investors in existing schemes because the alternative—to paraphrase or to badly quote somebody else—is too ghastly to contemplate. If as a result of the choice here you end up in a situation where investors are not given that choice, and if by some chance that none us can foresee, particularly the government, whose heart is wholly behind this, some major fund goes belly-up and one of the problems is that people lose their money because a scheme is changed without regard to their own interests and their own wishes and their own needs as to how they deal with their money, I am not sure how we in this place would feel, but the government may find itself in serious legal trouble.
I would certainly institute a class action if I were such an investor, or I would get other people to institute one with me, because I do not think the government should take unto itself the legislative right to change the existing ways people are investing their money without their having the opportunity to say yes or no as to whether they agree. So that is the purpose of this amendment. I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-22,"—I do not know if we will be raining writs of mandamus. I guess we have to look in the future to see if that is going to be the case and whether the government has left it open, if losses do result from that, for people to be able to take action by way of class action on them for having helped to cause that situation. The embarrassment may be fairly severe, but I guess I would need further legal advice to find out whether or not there will be any recourse to government in terms of their responsibility and others who voted for it.
Honourable senators would realise that I have been desperately trying to insert precautions, desperately trying to put in some fallbacks, desperately trying to provide that which was not provided in the first concept the government has come up with in relation to the single entity. Senator Murray from the Democrats has indicated that he would like to provide that choice for the investors themselves to make.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-22,"—The government will not be supporting it, so I will not disappoint Senator Murray there. I regard it as being fundamentally in conflict with opposition amendment 2, which we have indicated we will support. Can I say for the record that CASC and the Law Reform Commission did look at this concept of grandfathering existing schemes. I looked at it as well, when I was doing my consultations. It would have been a very neat way for me to have assuaged the concerns of my friends in the trustee industry. It would have been very easy for me and very personally pleasant for me to say, `It is okay; we are going to grandfather you all and we can all be friends.' That would have been a very easy policy decision to make. But CASC and the Law Reform Commission looked at it. I didn't know until today that they had, quite frankly. They looked at the concept of grandfathering and said that it was the wrong thing to do because you would end up with two different regulatory regimes for two different sorts of schemes.
I came to that decision. The Treasurer and the government came to the decision that to effectively end up with two different forms of collective investment in Australia, a dual legal system, additional regulatory costs and the ASC having to administer two sets of laws would be a great risk. We can debate forever whether we are better to have one system, the old system or the new system. Can I suggest to honourable senators that to have both would be a severe risk.

(2)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 23 (after line 32), at the end of section 601HA, add:
	 (2)	 If:
		 (a)	 a registration application is made as a result of a resolution passed under subparagraph 1457(1)(a)(i); and
		 (b)	 the resolution included a direction under subsection 1457(1A);
		 the compliance plan lodged with the application must provide for scheme property to be held by a person other than the responsible entity, or a person that is not related to 
 the responsible entity, as the responsible entity's agent.
(3)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 58 (after line 18), after subsection 1457(1), insert:
	 (1A)	 A resolution passed under subparagraph (1)(a)(i) may direct the proposed responsible entity to lodge with the registration application a compliance plan that provides for scheme property to be held by a person other than the responsible entity, or a person that is not related to the responsible entity, as the responsible entity's agent.
These amendments refer to allowing members of existing managed investment schemes to choose preferred custodial arrangements in certain circumstances. Together, these Labor amendments will allow investors in existing managed investment schemes the opportunity to exercise a choice in the way that the assets of their scheme will be held in the event that the scheme becomes a single responsible entity.
After the new SRE regulatory scheme comes into effect, investors in new managed investment schemes will be able to exercise a choice by voting with their wallets and choosing a managed investment scheme which best suits their individual investment preferences. For example, an investor may wish to invest in a scheme which will be using the services of a custodial agent which is not related to the SRE. To other investors the way the scheme assets are held may not be a deciding factor in which scheme they invest in.
The custody of a scheme's assets may not be a big issue for some investors. Other futures of the scheme may be more important, such as returns and fees and charges, but for others the custody may be the crucial issue, and it is for these investors that Labor is moving its amendment, particularly investors in existing schemes. Existing investors in managed investment schemes can, under Labor's amendments, have a choice in the way that that scheme's assets are held. The way that the government's bill is currently framed, the investors in existing schemes have only one option in this area, and that is to withdraw from the scheme, which will involve transaction costs.
Under the government's bill, if after 12 months neither the fund manager nor the trustee of a scheme have left the field and allowed the other party to become the SRE, there must be a meeting of scheme members to determine what is to be done with the scheme. At the meeting of members, the members can choose to either wind up the scheme or they can choose which entity—the funds manager or the trustee—they would like to become the SRE. However, under Labor's amendment, scheme members will be able to direct not only which entity they would like to become the SRE but also how they would like the SRE to hold the scheme assets. That is, investors will be able to determine whether they wish the SRE to engage the services of a third party to hold the scheme's assets. The third party may or may not be related to the SRE.
Labor's two amendments intend to provide that, if neither the manager nor the trustee of an existing scheme retires in the first year of transition, then at the subsequent meeting of investors they may decide whether or not custody shall be undertaken by a third party. The provision is not, however, intended to restrict investors' choice in this regard to a party unrelated to the SRE, nor is it intended to require a  resolution appointing a specific party to hold scheme assets. The third party agent employed by the SRE will still have to be approved by the ASC as part of the licensing arrangements. SREs will have the right to appoint any custodial agent they see fit as long as it is in the boundaries of the direction provided by investors at the meeting of members. However, the agent must still be approved by the ASC. Labor's amendment gives investors in existing schemes a choice of custodial arrangement. Given that much of the debate on managed investments has been about custodial arrangements, these are important amendments.",SENATE,<title>MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I rise tonight to speak on a matter which is of great importance to young people in Australia: the abolition of funding for the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, AYPAC. This organisation has effectively represented the views of young people for many years, and it has received government funding since 1991, enabling it to provide a voice for young people throughout Australia. Unfortunately, this voice is now telling the Howard government what it does not want to hear. This is a diverse group and they speak as they find the issue. Recently they have found that their members were concerned about issues such as work for the dole and the youth allowance. It is unfortunate that the reaction of the Howard government has not been to heed these views; it has been to attempt to silence them.
The Howard government apparently cannot take constructive criticism on these issues. It is apparent that the government is not prepared to listen to the views of the people most affected by its policies or those that represent them. So the decision to cut funding to this key body reflects poorly on the government but particularly on Minister Kemp. It seems that this is a spiteful decision by the government. AYPAC is—perhaps soon I will be saying was—a diverse coalition of youth organisations and networks. Their members include such radical bodies as rural youth, the scouts, the guides, YMCA, Fusion, the youth affairs council and networks in each state and territory.
Senator Chris Evans interjecting—
—Terrible, Senator Evans! These are hardly radical organisations. AYPAC represents some 750,000 young Australians through over 400 organisational and individual members. Full membership was open to non-government national youth organisations and to state youth affairs councils from each state or territory. These groups combined to make up a national representative board of 19 members.
With such a membership base, AYPAC truly represented the views and interests of 
 young people from all walks of life and from all over Australia. AYPAC's role was as an umbrella group, and that allowed a coordinated response from youth and youth organisations to government on government initiatives. It has been a mechanism to encourage greater coordination and cooperation among youth groups by bringing together diverse organisations to identify problems and discuss solutions.
AYPAC has also participated in a wide range of policy and program advisory committees, including the national youth affairs research scheme; the youth task force of the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs; the partnership subcommittee of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation; and various telecommunications forums. When the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, sought young Australians to travel to Rome to represent Australia at the International Food Summit and Youth Forum, AYPAC provided them.
It is not surprising, however, that the government has sought to silence this group. We are on the eve, I must say, of the introduction of the youth allowance. This policy has been met with great concern from young people all over this country. No slick advertising campaign will change the fact that it discriminates against young Australians. In a climate of rising youth unemployment, apparently the best that this government can come up with is a youth round table that will meet twice a year with 50 participants who have been hand-picked by the minister. While this discussion group will be dealing with issues such as youth suicide, employment and training, there is unfortunately no follow-up mechanism.
Minister Kemp apparently is bent on setting up a committee that will tell him only what he wants to hear. Unfortunately, he ignores the views of young Australians at his peril—and, of course, at the peril of this government. It gives the appearance that this government does not really want to listen to young people, to young Australians; it gives the impression that this government does not want to hear their views. This is a decision which will be 
 seen as a slap in the face for all young Australians.
If Minister Kemp and Mr Howard are serious about understanding the issues affecting young people, then they will reconsider their decision, they will reinstate funding for AYPAC and they will allow that organisation to continue on with the good work that it has been carrying out. It is AYPAC that will provide, that can provide and that would, given the opportunity, provide an impartial voice for young Australians.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition</title>,Adjournment,37,1
