"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-10-04,"—The Greens will give leave for that motion and will agree to it. However, it is our position that, following the condolence motion—which should have priority today—the business of the Senate ought to have proceeded to question time and to government business, as previously listed. We do, however, recognise that the timetable for today has been altered by agreement between the two major parties, and we will not be debating that. We just have a different point of view about the procedure following the condolence motion.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-10-04,"—I think this is the third occasion on which I have tried to finish this speech on this bill but, due to various timetabling issues, this is the first opportunity to do so since the break. We are discussing the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Bill 2005 to establish and operate Australian technical colleges. I have outlined previously in this speech our concerns with this approach. I have also stated that Labor are going to support the legislation but that our support should not be mistaken for uncritical or unquestioning support of this proposal. We have many unanswered questions about the implementation of this proposal and, further, we question the government’s motivation in establishing these colleges.
I turn now to the issue of secondary schooling. I want to emphasise that, unlike this government, Labor is committed to reforming secondary schooling to provide more vocational options as part of school, in cooperation with the states and territories. During the period of non-sitting, Labor leader Kim Beazley outlined our plan and various policy proposals to enhance the capacity of schools to offer ‘trades in schools’ education, to expand the range of vocational education opportunities that Australian students will have. This is a critical area for government attention, particularly given the crisis we have in the shortage of traditional trades in this country.
We believe the key to encouraging young people to study in a traditional trade is to support schools to expand their vocational training opportunities and also to target training where it is needed most. Labor’s proposals and perspective stand in stark contrast to the Howard government’s technical college plan, which will duplicate infrastructure and restrict access by hiving off traditional trades into an alternative stream. We believe the most effective way of encouraging young people to study a traditional trade is not through duplication, as the government is undertaking in these technical colleges, but through cooperation and collaboration. Labor believes we should make the trades attractive by closing the door on the dusty, Dickensian workshops that, for too many young students, are their first introduction to subjects like woodwork or metalwork. Schools must be able to take pride in their trade facilities as they do, for example, in relation to their computer facilities.
There are fabulous VET—vocational education and training—in-school programs that are full to capacity. These programs could start training more students right now, if only the Howard government was willing to provide adequate federal support. That is why Labor has proposed our new trades in schools scheme, to double the number of school based apprenticeships and to give schools extra funding to support them in taking up the places. Measures such as our proposal for a trade completion bonus would get additional qualified tradespeople into the Australian work force sooner. They would do this by cutting the attrition rates by giving traditional apprentices more incentive to complete their training. These technical colleges that the Howard government is proposing will not produce a single qualified tradesperson until at least 2010. Australia’s skills crisis demands attention now.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-10-04,"—The Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Bill 2005 is one of the poorest pieces of public policy that I have had to deal with over the three years that I have been in the Senate. It is policy on the run. It is ideologically driven and it completely fails to address the problem that it was advertised as solving. It also actively undermines current initiatives in the same sector. This bill has been set up to expend hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ dollars which should be going to existing vocational education and training programs. The bill is putting that money into setting up private technical colleges, giving the government some photo opportunities and the Minister for Education, Science and Training some buildings to open—that is, $350 million of taxpayers’ money as a price tag for a government election brochure.
This is what the Prime Minister said when he announced this idea during the election campaign:
We now must reinvest in the future of the 70% of young Australians who do not go directly to university when they leave school. I want an Australian nation in which a high quality technical education is as prized as a university degree. And what is more—so do millions of Australians.
That is good, and it sounds great. But the problem is that the Australian technical colleges will not do either of these things. This bill provides for the establishment of 25 vocational education schools for year 11 and 12 students, with a maximum of 7,200 students. This cannot be portrayed as investing in the future of 70 per cent of young Australians who do not go directly to university.
The government often complains that a technical education is not as prized as a university education. I believe that high-quality technical education is already as prized as a university degree, and I am aware of many people who have chosen technical education over a university education and who prize it more. Even if you do not hold that particular view, providing 7,200 vocational education and training school places over the whole country is not going to change attitudes to vocational education. There is a massive mismatch between the government rhetoric on vocational education and training and the reality of its policy.
The Prime Minister also claimed that this initiative was about addressing the skills shortage in Australia, saying before the election that Australia was experiencing ‘significant skill shortages in key trades, including the building and construction, metals, manufacturing and automotive sectors’. Again, the public would have heard this rhetoric at election time and thought that something significant would happen—something that might address the 130,000-place shortage that is forecast over the next five years. What most will have missed is that it is actually about setting up a handful of year 11 and year 12 training schools which will take some years to get up and running. At maximum output, they will produce only 7,200 graduates, most of whom will require additional training at TAFEs or in apprenticeships to start making a dent in that massive skills shortage problem.
This bill is not about addressing the skills shortage in any meaningful way; it is more about addressing the perception of a lack of action by this government on the skills shortage. It is about convincing the electorate that the Prime Minister is doing something about training. The truth is that he is not doing enough. In fact, the truth is that this government has created the skills shortage and undermined the means by which it could be meaningfully addressed—that is, our TAFE system. But more of that later.
I want to focus just for a minute on what this bill is about, beyond an election-time con job. This bill, like every other education bill I have spoken about in this place, is about enacting the ideological objectives of the coalition government. These ideological objectives are about undermining the possibility of collective action by workers and their trade unions. They are about trusting competition to deliver the best results, rather than cooperation and collegiality. They are about allowing business to drive agendas, even educational agendas, presuming that this will bring the best public benefits.
These Australian technical colleges will for the first time provide for direct Commonwealth involvement in secondary schooling. These so-called colleges are of course schools and they will be registered in the states as schools, but they will be schools like no others in the government system. They will be run by principals who will hire and fire all the staff. The staff will be employed on individual contracts. Union access or involvement will be discouraged. Staff will be managed according to performance, introducing a competitive process when cooperation is so important for success. Many of these colleges will be charging fees and some may also be making a profit.
The important thing to note about these colleges is not their impact on skills shortages but rather the clue they give us as to how this government would like to see schooling in Australia run. These colleges may well be the first in a series of direct incursions by the Commonwealth government into schooling. Judging by this first effort and the government’s aggressive push for increased funding for private schools, they will be a disaster for the provision of universal, high-quality, accessible schooling across the nation.
This is the price that we pay for these ideologically based, election driven policies, and it is a high price indeed. The first obvious impact is the opportunity cost and indeed financial cost to the existing vocational education and training programs in schools and TAFEs. Every dollar of the $350 million being poured into this policy through this piece of legislation could—and the Greens say ‘should’—be spent on boosting existing vocational education and training programs.
TAFE is the major provider of vocational education and training in Australia, and an extra $350 million for TAFE would be welcome, given that the Commonwealth government has presided over a massive loss of funding to the TAFE sector since 1996. This $350 million would of course go further if it were spent in this way, adding to the already existing programs. There would be no waste in setting up parallel processes, no need to build new premises and no need to create new bureaucracies. If all of the effort that has been expended on developing, legislating, advertising, tendering and funding these Australian technical colleges had been put into Australia’s existing system of vocational education and training, then we would be seeing an impact on the skills shortage today, not in five years time.
Students are also set to lose out, particularly those in areas where their option will be a technical college that charges fees. Students will lose out by having their classmates poached by a new technical college down the road. They will lose out if, because of the pressure from a new technical college, their public-school based vocational education and training course becomes unviable. Those who do attend a technical college may well lose out as a result of receiving a narrow education that may actually leave them less well equipped for the modern workplace. What will be the capacity for students who change their mind about their career choices and who find themselves in colleges—some having paid fees—that cannot cater for alternatives? Indeed, this was the reason that the old technical colleges were initially phased out. Why should taxpayers be paying for massive subsidies for private providers to set up education systems that run parallel to the existing public systems in order for those private providers to make a profit?
There is so much important work to be done in the vocational education and training sector, but this bill does not do any of it; it actually makes things worse. Business should be doing more, such as contributing to the cost of training. Instead, via its mates in the Liberal Party, they are getting narrow training objectives paid for by the public purse. The government has presided over the decimation of a public sector which used to be the driver of trade skills development. In their submission to the Senate inquiry into this legislation, the Australian Education Union noted:
It is generally acknowledged that there is a poor culture of training amongst many Australian industries, which prefer to rely on labour hire agencies, sub-contracting, contracting out, casual employment and skills based immigration as substitutes for training and retraining their workforces. ATCs are to be situated in regions with skills shortages and high youth unemployment, but where there is a significant industry base. The only conclusion is, that where these three conditions co-exist, local industry has to date taken no responsibility for training the next generation of skilled workers. Yet this very local industry is now to be charged with governing not merely some areas of training, but a school teaching academic subjects. The AEU believes that local industry does not have the expertise to carry out such a role.
This highlights the inadequacy of this bill in addressing the major structural problems within the economy that are generating the skills shortage and also its threat to disrupt and undermine the vocational education of future students.
The Greens have called, and will continue to call, for recognition by the Commonwealth of the excellence of our public vocational education and training system and the boost in funding that it deserves. The funds needed are in the billions if they are to even replace the funds that have been lost through the cuts that the Howard government has inflicted on the sector. This is necessary. It is about investing in the prosperity of our nation. As a party that likes to drape itself in the robes of economic responsibility, you would think that this basic concept of investing in training in order to maintain prosperity would be well understood, but it is not. This government acts like the get-rich-quick capitalists it honours by robbing our future to pay for their luxurious present.
The Greens reject this bill because it enacts a system that will damage our vocational education training system in this country. We reject this bill because it is wasteful of government money and human resources that should be spent elsewhere. We reject this bill because it represents a failure to take seriously the skills shortage we face. We reject this bill because it is part of a roll-out of industrial conditions that turn back the clock, are antifamily, and are anticommunity. We reject this bill because it introduces a competitive element to the education of our children which will make them into winners and losers, and we reject this bill because it is an insult to the hard work, dedication and excellence of all those who make our public schools and our TAFE colleges such great places for Aussie children to learn together.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2005-10-04,"—I also rise to speak on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Bill 2005. This bill honours a commitment made by the coalition at the 2004 election to establish 24 Australian technical colleges operating as year 11 and year 12 secondary colleges. The original plan was for 24 colleges in 24 regions, but there were two outstanding bids in Adelaide—your home state, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson—so there will now be 25 colleges in 24 regions.
The government makes no bones about the skills shortage. We need more tradesmen and tradeswomen. We need more skilled workers. We need more hairdressers, administrative workers, plumbers, mechanics, bricklayers and carpenters. To some extent, an economy with strong employment is going to have a skills shortage. It is certainly better than the alternative. The alternative was experienced while Kim Beazley was employment minister. We know Labor’s plan for a skills shortage: to kill the economy and to drive up unemployment. In that environment, you have no skills shortage. You have plenty of workers, just not many jobs. That is the Labor plan.
As a community, we also have to accept that we have the university-trades balance wrong. We have put too much emphasis on university degrees. Australian technical colleges will help to restore that balance. They will provide choice and excellence for students who do not want to pursue a conventional, solely academic education. They will provide variety, difference and excellence in their chosen fields. They will be another option for secondary students who want a vocational education, not a university degree. The opposition would prefer to prescribe what is best for school leavers. This government wants to offer them a choice. Make no mistake: ambition is a good thing. We all want Australian children and Australian students to achieve their potential and be the best they can be, but we also want them to do what they love, what they enjoy and what they are good at—and that is not always to become a doctor, a lawyer or a school teacher.
There are generations of tech school graduates prospering in Australia. Senator Heffernan from this chamber is but one of those. Once upon a time, it was the trades that provided the great figures in the Australian Labor Party. Labor could do worse than to engage the trades. They may find a pool of talent that they desperately need. The holder of a trade should be as highly valued as the holder of a degree. As someone who works at a trades hall, having the word ‘trade’ in front of your title does not necessarily do the job; it is actually good to have a trade in some circumstances.
These colleges will complement the TAFE system—they will not duplicate it; they will not replace it—and as many as 300 students will attend each school completing their secondary education and commencing a school based new apprenticeship in a trade. There are currently not enough school based trade apprenticeships to properly address the demands of industry and business. These colleges will target that demand with input from local business. Each college will be overseen by a governing council and chaired by a local industry representative. The colleges will draw on existing secondary school and industry infrastructure, including TAFEs, local businesses and government.
Funding for these colleges will follow the same guidelines as schools funding. Colleges operated by and using the resources of non-government schools will receive funding that reflects this but will be able to charge students fees. Colleges using government school facilities and resources will be entitled to more government funding but will not be able to charge fees. The opposition is already trying to scare potential students by claiming that colleges will be able to charge compulsory fees. We will not let that happen, just as we do not let government schools charge compulsory fees today.
The member for Jagajaga and Senator Wong have promised opposition support for this bill because, in their words: ‘It’s better than nothing.’ Of the nine points in the opposition’s amendments moved in the House, not one contained a positive idea. Ms Macklin, in the other place, has also accused the government of attempting to reinvent the wheel with this legislation. We are not reinventing the wheel with this legislation; we are reintroducing a successful institution that was dismantled by a series of short-sighted state Labor premiers. Joan Kirner in Victoria comes to mind. When she was Premier, she called for reform to state education. She said:
... so that it is part of the socialist struggle for equality, participation and social change, rather than an instrument of the capitalist system.
They are not words from the 1930s, 1940s or 1950s but from a state Labor Premier from a little over 10 years ago. Current Victorian education minister Lynne Kosky still echoes Kirner’s sentiments, declaring that ‘education should be the great leveller’. Education will always be an area where the differences between Labor and the coalition will play out most clearly.
Take the words of Australian Education Union president Pat Byrne, who told the Queensland Teachers Union:
Right wing commentators ... rail against us with such vitriol because we have succeeded in influencing curriculum development in schools, education departments and universities.
I have to say that the opposition, Ms Kirner, Ms Kosky and Pat Byrne are simply wrong. Education should be about bringing out the best in each student. Like it or not, each student’s best will be different; not each student’s outcome will be the same. Students need to have an environment where they can achieve their best, achieve what they want to achieve, and it will not be the same for each individual.
The shadow education minister has also denounced Australian technical colleges as nothing more than a vehicle for the government’s workplace relations reforms. She has accused the government of:
... using vocational education and training as a vehicle through which to drive their ideological industrial relations agenda which bears no relation to successful student outcomes.
The facts are that, yes, a technical college governing body will be able to offer teaching staff Australian workplace agreements, but no-one is going to be compelled to accept an Australian workplace agreement. No-one can be compelled to sign anything against their will. All this government is doing is ensuring that there is choice and that Australian workplace agreements are at least offered to staff. No-one is going to be compelled to take them up. No-one is going to be compelled to sign. The only compulsion will be that there is a choice given to the staff, which is as it should be. If the employee does not think that an Australian workplace agreement is right for their situation, then, like every other member of the Australian work force, they will have the right to collectively negotiate and the right to enter some other form of individual contract. There is going to be no compulsion on staff at these institutions to sign something against their will.
AWAs are only one part of the changes that we will make to our outdated and shambolic workplace relations system. Some commentators—some on the other side—point to the prosperous economy and high employment and pose the question: if things are going so well, why do we need to change? It is true we have enjoyed nine years of strong economic growth, low inflation, low interest rates and low unemployment. The unemployment rate is steady at five per cent. The government has created 1.7 million jobs since 1996, but we need to lay the foundations of future prosperity today. The good economic conditions we are enjoying today are as a result of good policy pursued in the past. Good policy does matter, and to ensure prosperity in the future we need to pursue good policy today. We need to do whatever we can to get unemployment even lower, whether that is by reforming workplace relations or by establishing tech colleges. We need to do whatever we can.
The money for Australian technical colleges is new money. This year the Commonwealth in total will spend a record $2.5 billion on vocational education and training. In my state of Victoria, technical colleges will be established in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs, Bendigo, the Bairnsdale-Sale area, Sunshine and Warrnambool. Students in these 24 regions serviced by Australian technical colleges can look forward to graduating with practical and well regarded qualifications.
Reintroducing technical colleges was an idea I advocated in my first speech in this chamber, along with academically selective high schools and secondary centres of excellence. It is something that I hold quite dear. The state Labor governments around Australia should follow the Commonwealth’s lead and reintroduce in their own jurisdictions their own technical colleges, just as they should introduce secondary colleges of excellence and academically selective high schools—with the possible exception of New South Wales, which already has a well established system of academically selective high schools and centres of excellence.
It was interesting, as Senator Wong mentioned earlier, to note Mr Beazley’s belated discovery the other week of selective schools, centres of excellence and trade schools. He will have a battle on his hands. I find it difficult to imagine Mr Beazley fighting and winning against the teachers’ unions, his own caucus and state Labor premiers to introduce not only trade schools but also academically selective high schools and centres of excellence. I would encourage him to talk to his state Labor counterparts, particularly Victorian education minister Lynne Kosky who, after my first speech in this chamber putting forward the idea of selective schools, described my plan as ‘narrow and elitist’. So there is certainly one state Labor Premier at least that he is going to have a battle on his hands with.
Parents and students not only need and want choice between public and private school sectors but also want choice within school sectors. In New South Wales, parents can choose between 17 academically selective high schools and centres of excellence, like Cherrybrook Technology High School, James Ruse Agricultural High School and Newtown High School of the Performing Arts. There should also be technical colleges in New South Wales. We should say goodbye to the monochromatic, comprehensive, one-size-fits-all secondary school model that we see around Australia. Why not have some secondary schools that are coeducational, some that are single sex, some that are academically selective and some that are not, some that are academically selective centres of excellence and some that are just centres of excellence? Why not let every secondary school in Australia have its own character, have its own specialty, have something that marks it as different so that we can provide parents and students with the choices that they want and deserve?
It is the responsibility of state governments to provide this sort of choice within their own education sector, but there is also a duty to provide more choice between the independent school sector and the government school sector. The Commonwealth does its part by strongly supporting independent schools. If we did not, independent schools would not be affordable for many Australians. In particular, under this government we have seen a flourishing of low-fee independent schools. If the Commonwealth withdrew from this area of activity, independent schools would be out of reach for many Australians. But there is more that can be done.
There is an idea whose time has come, which will allow parents to decide where their own taxpayer dollars should go in support of their own child’s education—the idea of education vouchers that parents can present to the public or private school of their choice. The idea of school vouchers is something of a policy taboo. We have had these taboos since the foundation of Australia. ATSIC used to be a policy taboo. The suggestion a few years back that ATSIC would be abolished would have been dismissed out of hand. That policy taboo has now passed. Vouchers is another policy taboo but I think it is one that will not remain in that camp for long. It is an idea whose time has come.
Why should means be a barrier to entry for a parent choosing a school for their child? Why should a lack of means stop someone sending their child to the school that they want to send them to? Let us let good schools, public or private, be rewarded by parents taking their voucher to those schools and let poorly performing schools improve or close. Let us put the power in the hands of the parents to choose what is best for their children. Let us embrace variety, let us embrace choice, let us give students the opportunities they deserve. Australian technical colleges are an important instalment in providing that choice and opportunity to Australian parents. This bill deserves support and I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2005-10-04,"—I rise today to contribute to the debate on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Bill 2005. This bill gives effect to the government’s election promise of providing 24 new Australian technical colleges, as this government would call them, which will provide places for around, they say, 7,000 year 11 and 12 students to do both school studies and school based new apprenticeship work. Of course, since the government made this promise, the numbers have risen to 25 colleges and around 7,500 students, but we notice that the bucket of money allocated to this election promise has not increased to accommodate the additional college that has been announced. So we now have 25 colleges having to be funded by the original amount that was announced with this initiative.
The bill also sets out the broad framework for the operation of these technical colleges, with funding of $343.6 million between 2005 and 2009. These are the colleges that represent this government’s answer to the growing skills shortage, which they have been told about for years. In fact, they have known about it for years and have ignored it. They have done nothing for nine years to address the skills shortage in this country and have neither increased TAFE funding nor increased TAFE places.
Having grossly underfunded TAFE for years, allowed for no growth money and seen thousands of young Australians turned away from TAFE due to the lack of places each year, this is now the best the government can come up with. It amounts to 25 private Australian technical colleges based in 24 selected regions to enable up to 7,500 students to study jointly for years 11 and 12 while supposedly starting a new apprenticeship—just 7,500, and then none of these students will actually finish college or graduate until 2008 at the earliest. Even then, they will only be halfway through an apprenticeship. They will only have got to a certificate II level. So it will be 2010 before any of these students will be qualified tradespeople and be able to take their place in the workplace and play any part in reducing the ever-growing national skills shortage.
In the meantime, since our TAFE system has been starved of resources, what does the Howard government propose to do but to increase the intake of skilled migrants to fill the skills gap. Having let tens of thousands of Aussies miss out over the years that they have been in government, they now have to bring in people from overseas to fill the vast array of skills gaps left by their policies. Wendy Currie, writing in Education in March 2005, summed it up succinctly by saying:
There have been federal funding cuts to public education and even greater cuts to TAFE funding. There has been a long term failure to invest in skill development, and to develop appropriate policy that will take Australia into the future.
She went on to say:
... there is a skill shortage that the Federal Government, having made no provision for it during its time in office, now proposes to address via huge increases in skilled migration and the Australian Technical Colleges.
Let us look more closely at what is proposed for these colleges. As I said, there will be 25 of them in selected regions, catering for up to 300 students each—a total of 7½ thousand students. These regions in which the colleges are to be based have been selected because they have skill shortages and high youth unemployment as well as a significant industry base. If they have a significant industry base, one might wonder just why they also have high youth unemployment. From what we can gather from ministerial statements, they will be for ‘capable and committed’ students. We presume that they are going to be highly selective.
I think they may find it hard to get that number of students. In some areas, 300 students are proposed for each college. Darwin, for instance, my home town, has a relatively small base of potential students. Many students are already able to do excellent courses provided for under the Northern Territory Department of Employment, Education and Training at Casuarina Secondary School through the VET in Schools program. At a meeting I had with the successful tenderer for Darwin, the Territory Construction Association, I was told that they anticipate that only 150 students, if that, may commence whenever this college gets up and running. So that is already 150 short of the projected outcome for the seat of Solomon.
Each college will specialise to a certain degree in a limited number of industry areas rather than to a broad spectrum of areas. Again, this may add to the problem of finding 300 suitable, willing and able students. For example, how many more students in Darwin want to do boilermaking or metal trades or in fact commercial cooking, which is the third targeted trade area for the region? Furthermore, numbers may be hard to make up since these students will study for both the higher school certificate and a new apprenticeship at the same time. I know with my own children how hard it is to do the HSC let alone an apprenticeship as well, and one can only wonder where these super students will be found. But then the government does not really think practicalities; it just makes up ideas and policies on the run. Nearly half of the present apprentice intake fails to complete the course, so we can but wonder what the dropout rate will be for those trying to do both courses simultaneously.
For the record, I understand that the tender process in Darwin through the Territory Construction Association allows for a student to do years 11 and 12 two days a week, to be picked up by a registered training provider to do the apprenticeship of their choice two days a week and to be out at work for the fifth day. I do not understand, and I do not think this government fully appreciates the sort of workload that would place on a student in year 11 or 12. They would be expected to have a mix of modes of study and employment in a five-day working week without the necessary support base to assist them.
Local industry will have a major role, this government says. This is really a continuation of what we all know has been happening for some time under the Howard government. They are more and more tending not to listen to educators or to ordinary workers and are paying great attention to business and industry organisations like ACCI or the AiG, whose influence over this government is clearly increasing, not only in training but in industrial relations as well.
These technical colleges will be linked to various workplace requirements, like funding to many other areas where the Howard government is bullying universities, states and territories to sign on to their antiunion and antiworker legislation or threatening to withhold federal funds. They will be run autonomously by selected principals who can hire their own staff on performance pay and will certainly offer only AWAs—another move this government is forcing onto the nation by every means it can; a move that the Labor Party will not support. Senator Fifield says, ‘If you get offered an AWA, you will have a choice. You will not be compelled to sign AWAs.’ I heard about the non-compulsion clause over and over again last Friday week at a hearing into the higher education bill. This is another sector of education that is being forced—in fact, they are having their arm twisted up their back—to accept and offer AWAs to their employees or else they will not get access to funding. The reality is that there is no choice. You either sign on the dotted line or you do not get a job. That has been the case time and time again with the TCA in Darwin when it comes to hiring apprentices through the group training organisation. We know that apprentices up there have to sign an AWA or they do not get a job. They have no power or industrial muscle to refuse to sign the AWA. They have no recourse and nowhere to go other than to accept what is put before them.
I cannot imagine any young person signing up to an apprenticeship who would have enough industrial muscle to say to the TCA, ‘I want to take up your apprenticeship at an Australian technical college, but I am not signing an AWA and I would like the union to come in.’ I cannot imagine that there would be many staff employed in these colleges able to knock back an AWA and still keep their job. As the years go by, I think the facts will show that those people who kick and scream and refuse to sign an AWA will be quickly shown the door and marched out. We also assume that if these colleges have less than 100 employees, as it seems that they will, the principal will be able to hire and fire at will without fear of unfair dismissal claims. I was told that the Darwin technical college will only have about eight staff of its own and others will come from existing TAFE or private provider resources, probably on some contractual basis.
These Australian technical colleges represent yet another step in the government’s move to deregulate the national training system, together with micromanagement of both school and post school education and training. And—surprise, surprise!—these changes further weaken the influence and input of unions in the training system. This is probably really what this agenda is all about. Since these colleges will operate largely in regions already having both senior school and TAFE facilities, they will also duplicate existing facilities and provisions.
That is the classic case in Darwin, where the Australian technical college will be a virtual college. It will not be a new building of bricks and mortar. The TCA will either operate this college out of their existing offices or hire office space, no doubt somewhere in the CBD. It will be a virtual college, where students will be expected to dual enrol in places like Palmerston High School or the Casuarina Secondary College. The plan is that they might attend Casuarina Secondary College for two days a week, then go off to an RTO for their course and, on the fifth day, get shunted off and spend the day in the workplace. So it will be a virtual college, not a college that people can drive past and identify as an Australian technical college. There is an expectation that they will share resources, staff and curriculum with the Northern Territory Department of Education, who are as yet unwilling to sign up to this, simply because it is a duplication of existing facilities and resources and is seen as an absolute misuse of money in terms of addressing the skills shortage.
Let me turn to the issue of the skills shortage. According to the DEWR Skilled vacancies index, skilled vacancies increased by 1.5 per cent in March and have increased by 23 per cent since April 2003. They have risen by over 70 per cent since the Howard government first came to power. But that is not all—the overall increase in skilled vacancies may have been just over 70 per cent, but in some trades areas it has been far worse. In construction trades, it is 160 per cent since June 1997 and it is 81 per cent in the metal trades area. So this government have had nine long years of knowing what was developing and have done nothing about it. Even their friends in ACCI and AiG have been telling them what has been happening, but nothing has been done.
The Howard government has turned away an estimated 270,000 young Australians from TAFE since 1998 and, during the government’s nine long years in office, Australia has been one of the very few OECD countries to have a decline in public investment in universities and TAFE. This government has refused to provide any growth funding for six of the past nine years when it comes to the states and territories ANTA agreement. If more is not offered now, there will be three more years of underfunding. The government claims it has had some great achievements and increases in traineeships and apprenticeships. The Skills at work report released in March 2005 showed that the numbers starting a trade apprenticeship declined between 2000 and 2003. The government spent $1.8 billion on new apprentice employer subsidies, but traineeships in retail—burger flippers—were the main beneficiaries rather than traditional trades.
Skill shortages suddenly became a major issue for this government in the 2004 election campaign. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry was arguing that skill shortages had replaced tax complaints as its biggest concern, and that fact is well worth noting in the light of other legislation soon to come before this chamber. Skill shortages and tax were major concerns of business—not unfair dismissals, right of entry or the industrial relations system. Each and every time I have met with any business organisation in the Northern Territory, be it the chamber of commerce or the business council, the single biggest issue they have raised with me has been the skills shortage and the lack of the way in which the government addresses skill shortages in their area. I do not think I have ever had the Northern Territory Chamber of Commerce and Industry raise with me problems related to the industrial relations system in the times I have met with them.
The government response was to say that it would fund apprentice tool boxes and set up an institute of trade skills excellence and the Australian technical colleges—all pretty much bandaid solutions. Then it announced, with no consultation, the abolition of ANTA and the aim of getting TAFE and VET under the control of DEST and out of the national training body. The National Centre for Vocational Education Research—NCVER—survey, Australian apprentice and trainee statistics, for the December 2004 quarter shows the number of apprentices at its lowest since December 2002. Furthermore, in the 12 months to December 2004, there were 133,000 withdrawals and cancellations compared to 139,000 completions over the same period. So about 48 per cent of apprentices and trainees are not completing their courses. The NCVER report also showed that the top three areas for apprentice commencements in that December quarter were retail, business services and hospitality—not traditional trades. When will this government learn?
The 2005 budget was a continuing disappointment, with no new initiatives in education and training. Just about everything had been previously announced. Nothing was done to increase TAFE places or to encourage apprentices to complete their training. It is not just the opposition saying this. TAFE Directors Australia have said the government continue to ignore TAFE and the training needs of the work force. In the May 2005 edition of Campus Review, their chair, Barry Peddle, said that TAFE, the nation’s major training provider, continues to be starved of funds and that funding for TAFE is now significantly less in real terms than it was in 1997, despite large increases in demand and in student numbers. The Australian Council of Deans of Education criticised the budget, saying it had largely sidelined education. More specifically, from the point of view of this bill, they said that the international evidence is that the funds put towards these new colleges would have been better spent reinforcing the established TAFE system.
So what can we say about the Australian technical colleges? They are too little and they are too late. They are certainly not a serious attempt to address skill shortages or lift the status of traditional blue-collar work. They will achieve nothing in the short run and little numerically at all. In reality it is far more likely, given the blind ideology of this government, that these colleges are seen as another ideal way to promote the government agenda of privatisation in education, to undermine state and territory education departments and to remove the influence of trade unions both in education and, preferably, in society as a whole. These technical colleges will encourage competition for already scarce resources, and we do not have to look too hard to see where this government will pour in the funds—they will give them to the private sector every time.
Industry input is clearly needed, but if college curricula are to be balanced then more than industry input and control is needed. It is ironic that, as pointed out by Pat Forward in the Autumn 2005 issue of the Australian TAFE Teacher, the Howard government’s emphasis on making training and the technical colleges industry focused and industry led comes after a period of around a decade of industry dominance in VET, which has seen great growth in skill shortages. To be fair, industry did let the government know that a skills shortage was looming—it was this government that chose to ignore the warnings.
Despite all these failings and problems caused by the Howard government’s policy on TAFE, this bill does at least allocate more funds to TAFE and trade training. While it may be too little and too late, Labor will support this bill, but it condemns the government for its industrial agenda, its misplaced priorities, its wasteful duplication of TAFE funds and its failure to address the growing skills shortage at the appropriate time.

",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-10-04,"—Senator Crossin has just talked about why Australia has a critical skills shortage. I am going to come back to that point in great detail when I go through some prepared notes and will then address the question that Senator Crossin has not addressed—that is, that an overwhelming proportion of the Australian training system is run by the states, and all the states are run by state Labor governments. Those state Labor governments are utterly dominated by the trade union movement, and the union movement is the single most repressive influence on the ability of TAFE systems to turn out apprentices and trainees. And they do not like to hear it.
—What role did ANTA play?
—Why are you underfunding them?
—You do not like to hear it from me because I ran the Queensland system for three years and I know—
—That’s why you’re in here!
—What role did ANTA play, Senator?
 (Senator Ferguson)—Senator Crossin, you were heard in silence and I ask you to extend the same courtesy to Senator Santoro. Senator George Campbell, I ask you to cease interjecting.
—Unlike Senator Crossin and Senator George Campbell, I have actually run a TAFE system in Australia and, unfortunately for them, I can spill the beans day after day as to why the TAFE system is failing. But it is with great pleasure that I note that, after originally indicating their very strong intention to oppose the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Bill 2005, the Labor Party, under pressure from public opinion, from industry and from every smart-thinking Australian—and you certainly cannot include most of the senators sitting opposite in that group—have decided to support it.
It is also my pleasure to say that I support the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Bill 2005. This bill implements a key election promise of the Howard government—namely, the establishment of 24 Australian technical colleges, including four in my own state of Queensland. This welcome and necessary initiative is an integral part of a broad range of measures that the federal government has undertaken in order to reverse the skill shortages in critical sectors of the Australian economy.
There can be little doubt that for the last decade this country has enjoyed record economic growth and stability, which has brought new challenges for government and private enterprise to tackle together. Whether these challenges come in the form of export infrastructure bottlenecks or heavy-handed economic regulation by the states or the archaic state industrial relations system, they are significant roadblocks that impede full realisation of our economic potential. These challenges would never have arisen had our economy been stagnant for the last 10 years. If that had been the case, we would still be talking about double-digit inflation, double-digit interest rates and more than a million unemployed Australians. Thankfully, we are instead dealing with a skills shortage driven by the economic boom that Australia continues to enjoy. We are, in that way, the victims of our own success.
We now face a problem where demand for skilled workers is simply outstripping supply. Nobody denies that. The reasons for this shortfall in supply are multiple and complex, and senators opposite understand that. I want to address two of these reasons in particular, even if those opposite do not. The first is an ingrained cultural attitude that I believe is unhealthy and unsustainable. The second is the failure of the states to foster flexible and quality vocational education. I wish to dwell on the cultural issues for a moment.
The Australian Education Union, in its overly alarmist briefing paper on this bill, showed an unusual moment of clarity when it asked the following question: ‘Why is it that vocational options are not held in high regard by many students, and how is it that contemporary schooling tends to marginalise those students with an interest and talent in applied skills long before they reach years 11 and 12?’ The AEU goes on to discuss ‘the low regard with which trades are held in the community’. Aside from the rest of the document, which is wall to wall full of the AEU’s typical alarmist rhetoric, these comments form a welcome contribution to the vocational education debate. They suggest that an attitude has developed within Australian society where a person holding a job requiring vocational qualifications is seen as less worthy than someone with academic qualifications. Some have dubbed this fixation as ‘the PhD syndrome’, a mindset where educators, parents and society generally have pushed young people towards a university education whether or not they have showed the aptitude or even the inclination for academic pursuits.
The Howard government identified this alarming cultural change when it came into government, and it created highly successful and focused policies to encourage the take-up of new apprenticeships and vocational training and skills programs. This government has worked hard to put balance and real choice back into the reach of young people, their families and employers. I would like to state for the record that I am a strong supporter of our universities—but we still have too many children and young adults being told: ‘If you don’t study hard then you won’t go to university, and if you don’t go to university you won’t get a decent job.’ I would rather that children were told: ‘If you don’t work hard at school then you won’t get a qualification, and if you don’t get a qualification you won’t get a decent job.’ That is what I think we need to be driving toward. We need to encourage young people to focus on working hard, achieving a qualification and then building on that as a path towards achieving their goals, rather than unthinkingly pushing everyone down a singular academic pathway.
This government is tackling the problem, with real results. It is delivering on providing balanced and practical careers advice through investing in the professional development of career advisers and the network of industry and regional career advisers. We want to make sure that all Australians value vocational pathways as well as academic pathways and that they have a choice. I think that all senators would agree that this should become the Australian way.
For this reason, among others, I support the establishment of Australian technical colleges. By offering performance based remuneration, workplace flexibility and competitive wages, the colleges will attract the best and the brightest teachers. The curriculum offered by the colleges will be tailored to meet industry and business requirements as well as provide young people with the skills important for employment and in the running of a successful small business. At the same time, the federal government remains mindful that in a modern society flexibility is always a plus. Therefore the curriculum will incorporate a number of academic elements that will enable students to go on to university at some later stage should they wish to.
The government also acknowledges that it is industry and employers who are best placed to identify which skills are the most desirable in a graduating student. That is why the framework being established closely engages with industry, local businesses and community representatives. This framework will align students to school based new apprenticeships that offer real work and on-the-job learning experiences. What better pathway to future learning and a career is there?
It is unfortunate, however, that the Leader of the Opposition, together with his education spokesperson, initially rejected the proposal to establish Australian technical colleges. I again go on the record to congratulate and commend the Labor Party for a turnaround, a turnaround that in this particular case is a smart one. I can only surmise that their original opposition went back to the second issue that is behind our skills shortages, and that is the lack of flexibility in vocational education created by—I stress again, as I did at the beginning of this contribution—the policies of the state Labor Party governments, which are dominated by strong trade unions. These are the very same policies of the Leader of the Opposition. Australian technical colleges will help correct those restrictive policies and the archaic industrial arrangements within the public sector institutes—the TAFE colleges—that are responsible for most apprentice training in the skills shortage areas. State TAFE systems are responsible for most of the training in trades and apprenticeships in this country.
I would ask that senators opposite disregard what is still obviously to me an unconstructive approach and work with the government to address the important issues that we are all raising in our contributions today. The colleges will provide an important catalyst to improve the community’s respect for vocational education. They will help future proof the skills base of our country and they will be a shining light of best practice within the education sector. I would strongly suggest that now is not the time to engage in short-sighted politicking. Now is the time to help get on with the job and support this bill.
I listened very carefully to the contributions that were made by senators opposite, in particular that of Senator Crossin. For the benefit of senators opposite, people listening to this debate and people in the public gallery, I want to remind Senator Crossin of a few things. She obviously has not read the bill very closely and obviously did not acquaint herself with the enormous volume of practical and statistically unassailable information available to her prior to delivering her speech.
For the information of Senator Crossin: Australian technical colleges will offer school based new apprenticeships in a trade. Students will graduate with their high school certificates and will be well on the way to a trade qualification. Trade qualifications will generally be at certificate III level. Some students in fact may complete a certificate II qualification while at school and this will articulate into a certificate III full-time apprenticeship. That is what is going to happen, not what Senator Crossin talked about, I respectfully suggest.
Senator Crossin also castigated the government for not creating apprenticeships in sufficient numbers, for failing the system and for going backwards. I remind Senator Crossin that the Commonwealth government is not involved in the creation of the vast majority of apprenticeships and traineeships. Let me quote the statistics. I will not go on for too long, because there are other things that I want to talk about, particularly Mr Beazley’s recently announced vision for training. But let me talk about growth in new apprenticeship completion, because Senator Crossin talked about failure to complete.
In 1996—you can see by looking at the graph I have here—there was growth of just over 25½ thousand in new apprenticeship completions. By 2005 that was up to 140,000. If anybody wants to blame this government, let them also give it the credit for having economic policies driving the demand for apprenticeships and traineeships that led to that result. I cannot reconcile the statistics of Senator Crossin with those published statistics.
In 1996, when the Howard government took over the running of the economy and the country, there were 154,800 new apprentices in training. By 2004 there were 403,600. I cannot reconcile that with what I heard from Senator Crossin. I do not say that to her disrespectfully, because she is not the only one. Others on that side of the chamber have similarly said that we are failing in terms of new apprenticeships and training. It does not compute. Either these figures—that have been provided by the department, that have been open to public scrutiny year after year—are fraudulent or wrong or the opposition has got the story wrong. I do not know. I know which side of the equation I fall towards.
On the subject of new apprentices in training, trade and related workers, I heard Senator Crossin have a bit of a go at trainees and apprentices in places like McDonald’s—‘burger flippers’, I think she called them. Let us put aside that slight on the great number of young people who use that very progressive company called McDonald’s to skill themselves up, to put themselves through schooling, further education, training or university, and to develop their managerial skills in a way that very few other organisations encourage young people to do. Let us look at new apprenticeships in training trade and related workers, for 1996 to 2005. Apprentices are the people that Senator Crossin and others on the other side of the Senate say are so essential. She says, ‘We don’t just want burger flippers.’ She is right. We do not want people who only know how to flip burgers—as valuable as burger flipping is to those people, to McDonald’s, to the economy and to all the people, including my kids, who enjoy visiting McDonald’s.
In 1996, there were 127,300 new apprenticeships in training in the trade and related workers area. In 2005 there were 161,400. Again, if that is an indication of failure in that all-important area of training performance and achievement then show me success, because it would be stellar, it would be stupendous. That is success, I suggest.
I could continue to comment on the contributions of senators opposite, but I want to get back to Labor’s recently released ‘Blueprint for skills and schools’. I have reviewed carefully Labor’s skills and schools document. It is an area that, as I indicated at the beginning of this contribution, I have had a longstanding interest and involvement in. I find it unfortunate, however, that opposition understanding of the issues we are facing in this area and their proposed policy solutions are at a basic level. They rest on a foundation of, as I have suggested in this debate, slurs and mistruths. Mr Beazley says that John Howard believes apprentices are cheap labour. The sort of unfounded, insulting rhetoric the Labor Party fabricates never ceases to amaze me.
Let me deal with this issue and totally dispel this erroneous and misleading statement once and for all. Apprentice award wages have been set through the centralised system of industrial relations that Labor so strongly advocates, whereby individual rights are compromised for the benefit of the unions. The wages for apprentices that Senator Crossin criticised are set through state industrial relations tribunals overseen by state Labor governments. Beazley’s state mates still frustrate the ability of employers to take on school based new apprentices and to offer thousands more young people a career start. And state Labor industrial relations have held back the capacity and productivity of our TAFE system to train apprentices. Notwithstanding all of that, the facts are that the Howard government’s apprentice commencements, apprentice completions and apprentice wages are at record levels, as I have just indicated.
Compare this with the famous—or, should I say, infamous—contributions to its national education and training system from 1991 to 1993 by the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training—I am talking about Mr Beazley. Let us see how he viewed one of the most critical economic contributions to the future of Australian citizens through his own reflections, and I quote from his biography. He said:
I had sort of finally got to accept that I would never be Defence Minister again, so I lost a lot of ambition and I stopped straining ... I thought that here was less capacity to achieve in that [education] portfolio than just about any I have had.
Let me repeat that he said: ‘here was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio than just about any I have had’. They are telling words from the man who is now promoting a blueprint for skills and schools and against whose performance we are comparing the performance I have just outlined. It is a performance that saw Labor slash apprentice commencements from 150,000 in 1991 to 120,000 in 1993—and that is where they would have been kept if Labor had stayed in government. That is, in fact, where the rot set in. Perhaps we should rename the policy ‘Blueprint for skills and schools of a failing politician’ or perhaps ‘Blueprint for skills and schools for Australia 1993’. I think either title would fit admirably because it is so clear to the Australian public that what the Labor Party is now advocating demonstrates their total lack of understanding about how this country has progressed in education and training. It is also clear that Labor’s blueprint is far behind the innovative, future-orientated and effective policies of this government.
Before my time runs out, let me talk about wages. I want to quote the ACCI and address the charges that apprentices are seen as cheap labour. The ACCI survey of apprentice wages shows that 52 per cent of employers pay apprentices above award wages by an average of 18 per cent and that the majority of employers voluntarily provide apprentices with benefits in addition to their wages, to reward and to retain them. That is the record that has been outlined by the ACCI, which senators opposite quoted so convincingly as an authority for some of their argument. They cannot accuse senators on this side of trotting out the research of a biased organisation—they used the statistics and research of the ACCI during this debate.
So there you have it: the contributions by Labor members who seek to criticise the performance of the Howard government in a key area of policy management and implementation essential to Australia’s economic progress and economic future. It is the defence of a union dominated, state-run TAFE system, which is the drag, which Australian technical colleges will address and reverse. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-10-04,"—What gall: the Liberal Party making out that they somehow have a monopoly on support for trade training. In the same breath, they disparage and damn with faint praise the prospects and aspiration of university study. The reality is that for the last nine long years the Howard government have been the government that has systematically undermined the TAFE and trade-training system. They have continued to attack the trade unions, which have always been an integral part of promoting the needs and the forecasts for apprenticeship training. The unions have been completely disenfranchised under this Howard Liberal government. The Howard government have also ignored the pleas of business on the looming skills crisis. Why is that? Why is this government being so irresponsible?
Today we are considering the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Bill 2005. And what a corker it is! To fully understand the nature of this ham-fisted legislation, we need to go back to the genesis of this policy. Where did this idea of the Howard government taking a direct role in the provision of vocational training to schoolchildren begin? Was it after a long and considered analysis by eminently qualified people with extended knowledge and experience in this field? Was it after extensive consultation with the states and territories? Was it after the federal Department of Education, Science and Training had identified a gap in the provision of training across the nation? After having identified this need, did the department perhaps undertake some analysis before formulating some solutions and presenting a number of options? Did they reflect on the impact of the chronic underfunding of TAFEs? Of these options, did the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education decide the technical colleges option would be the best method of serving the training needs of school students? And was the technical colleges option then fully costed, in consultation with the Department of Finance and Administration, and provision made for those colleges in the next budget?
The answer to all of those questions is no. None of this happened in the preparation of this policy. The whole concept was cooked up during the election campaign. The sole aim of the policy was as a sop to critics of the government’s failure to train skilled workers to address the skills crisis. There was no consultation, no analysis, no eminent people consulted, no departmental study, no options paper, no consideration—nothing at all. It just seemed like an expedient idea on the campaign trail to fill up a gap that they saw emerging in their polling. Problem: skill shortages. Solution: secondary technical colleges. They thought: ‘Will it work? Who cares!’ Imagine the dialogue between government and their advisers. ‘What about the states and territories?’ ‘Oh, don’t worry about them; forget them.’ ‘How much will it cost?’ ‘We’ll work that out after the election.’ ‘How many do we need?’ ‘We’ve got to look serious: 20 or so.’ It was completely pulled out of the air.
Once the so-called geniuses in the Liberal campaign headquarters came up with the concept, the next step was to work out where to put them. One can imagine Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, and his chief of staff cooking up the list on the back of an envelope while in the VIP jet. Even a cursory look at the list of regions earmarked for technical colleges reveals that they are in large proportion situated in seats that the government hoped to win or retain in the 2004 election. Let us review the list that was announced in the campaign. Queanbeyan is in the seat of Eden-Monaro—a bellwether marginal seat in recent times that has always gone to the party that forms government. The college announcement was there to help shore it up. The Bairnsdale-Sale area is in the seat of Gippsland, where the sitting member, Mr McGauran, was reputed to be under pressure due to a redistribution. It was notionally Labor. A new college was mooted to help Mr McGauran get across the line. Lismore-Ballina is in the seat of Page, one of those troublesome New South Wales North Coast sea-changer seats that The Nationals needed to hang on to. But this announcement did not save poor Mr Anthony in nearby Richmond, I am pleased to say.
Townsville is in the seat of Herbert, one of those must-retain sugar seats in Queensland, which was on a 1.5 per cent margin. They had another one of those troublesome redistributions—surprise, surprise! Mr Lindsay obviously needed help so they gave him a college too! Gladstone is in the seat of Hinkler, a marginal National seat, and Mr Neville was screaming out for help. Port Macquarie is in the seat of Lyne. Mr Vaile was rumoured to be threatened by a high-profile Independent, Mr Oakeshott. A college announcement showed who could deliver the pork. In the Pilbara, in the seat of Kalgoorlie, Mr Haase was in trouble after a couple of indiscretions, and a strong Labor candidate was making him worried. Mr Graeme Campbell had thrown his hat into the ring as an Independent. The result? Mr Haase got a college announcement. In northern Tasmania, there was no specific location but it was no secret that the government was targeting the seats of Braddon and Bass.
—And who won? We did.
—Despite the result of the election—and Senator Macdonald correctly points out that in fact the Liberal government did win the election—what we saw here occurred prior to the election when the government did not know what the result was going to be. So they were using these technical colleges as pork in the 2004 election, as they used many other policies, like regional rorts—which I am sure Senator Macdonald knows all about.
Do my colleagues notice a trend emerging? Amazingly, most of these technical colleges are slated for politically sensitive seats. The coalition’s election announcement was nothing short of an outrageous bribe to the voters in those seats. How true to the form of the Howard government! They are masters of the art of providing the pork and worrying about the detail later. My understanding is that the original list stood at 20 proposed colleges until there was a change of mind and four more were added, which I assume to be the non politically sensitive seats, as a bit of a smokescreen, because even the coalition government, masters of pork that they are, baulked at the outrageousness of the original list.
Do senators notice something missing in the policy formulation of the government’s election commitment so far? No analysis had been done as to the real skills training needs of the students or industries in the targeted regions. The regions were given a college—because it was about pork—whether they needed one or not. The real training needs were the furthest thing from the minds of the Howard government in election mode. The general mood would have been to say, ‘We’ll work that out later; we’ll worry about the details later,’ because who sorts out all the details when pork-barrelling before an election?
So, lo and behold, after the election win by the Howard government we had the appointment of a new minister, Mr Hardgrave, to oversee the implementation of this policy-on-the-run, back-of-the-envelope election commitment. One would expect that Mr Hardgrave’s first inquiry or request to the Department of Education, Science and Training would have been: ‘Quick! Get me some fast facts to help me justify where these colleges are going to go.’ So began the great propaganda campaign to say that these colleges were situated in the top 24 regions in Australia for skills shortages and youth unemployment. The government tried to pretend that the technical colleges have been located in the announced 24 regions using a number of youth and training criteria, not the actual ‘seats we want to win or retain’ criterion. Admittedly, there may be a happy coincidence and some of the 24 regions may need institutions of this kind, but I put it to the Senate that this is dumb luck on the government’s part, not design. It was never part of their design.
The announced locations were said to represent the top 24 regions for skills shortages and youth unemployment. I would be very interested in finding out the 25th and 26th regions on the list—the ones that just missed out; the regions that were a couple of statistical percentage points out in sharing in this $343 million government windfall. I am guessing that we will never know, because we have seen the way this policy was formulated on the run—there was simply no analysis of regions other than those that were announced by the coalition during the election campaign. My bet is that the sole aim of the department’s post-election analysis was to justify the regions that had already been announced in politically sensitive seats during an election campaign, and not to find deserving regions of Australia that had missed out. We may very well have a number of other more deserving regions, but we will never know because the government does not want us to know.
Armed with a quickly cobbled together justification for the selection of the locations of the colleges, Minister Hardgrave travelled the country to sell the idea to hostile state and territory governments and to a wary business and industry sector—and a hard sell it has been. Someone must have come up with some rough costings for the proposal. It was deemed that $343 million would be enough to get the whole show up and running. This must be a ballpark figure because it was announced before the closing date for proposals was reached. Before the scantest detail of the individual needs of any of the 24 proposed colleges was known, $343 million was deemed to be an adequate amount to establish and run 24 colleges over five years. At best, this figure must have been an educated guess, and it will be very interesting to see in future budgets just how accurate this guess was. I wonder if we will see a ‘Technical colleges cost blow-out’ headline somewhere in the near future.
One reason for a potential cost blow-out is the haste with which this initiative has been implemented. The government has stated right from the word go that the first colleges will be up and running at the start of 2006. It seems a very quick implementation for a whole new concept in secondary education, but I have to say that I have never founded and run a brand-new education institution in under six months—maybe people are doing it all the time! Was this start date proposed after careful consideration of the logistics necessary for the founding of 24 new training and education institutions, or was it more to do with the fact that the government had an eye on the electoral cycle? Maybe it wants to have the first technical college graduates appearing around the time of the expected federal election at the end of 2007. Think of all those graduation ceremonies the minister will be able to appear at just before or during an election campaign. A cynic might suggest that the Howard government was trying to impact on two elections with the same policy initiative.
If that 2006 start date seems a bit ambitious, it begins to look foolhardy when you learn that, of the 24 proposed regions, successful consortia have been announced so far in only 13 regions, and it is nearly 2006. There are only a few months to go—it is already October. The minister’s web site airily refers to further announcements later in the year. They had better get a wriggle on, because most students have already made plans for next year, and that will delay it all by another year.
The minister has been challenged on a number of occasions on why the ACT has not been selected for a technical college. Initially the minister brushed the question aside, saying that the ACT does not have the same needs as other areas of Australia. However, when pressed, the minister’s invariable answer was that ACT students can go over the border to the proposed Queanbeyan college. Leaving aside the fact that no agreement has yet been reached for a college in Queanbeyan, I would be very interested to know how this arrangement would work. How would ACT residents be able to study interstate? How would training at a New South Wales technical college be integrated with the rest of a student’s ACT curriculum? Like so much of this proposal, this detail will be worked out later. Thus we see that the whole technical colleges charade is yet another example of coalition policy on the run—it is not in the least bit considered, it is not in the least bit thorough and it is not able to solve the main problems it purports to solve.
Skills shortages in Australian industry have been consistently growing under the Howard government and will continue to grow if the technical colleges initiative is an example of this government’s so-called innovative solutions. Recent media reports quote a senior CEO in the Australian building and construction industry predicting that 100,000 skilled workers will leave the industry in the next five years. The CEO estimated that in that time 40,000 skilled workers would become available to fill the void. That would be a shortfall of 60,000 workers in the building and construction industry alone.
Here we have one of the major industry sectors with an expected shortfall of 60,000 skilled workers. What is the Howard government’s answer to this crisis? What we have seen is the founding of 24 technical colleges that at any time will have no more than 7,200 students. These students will be undertaking training across a broad range of trades, from bricklaying to commercial cookery. Assuming that at some stage in the future all 24 technical colleges are up and running—I know with the current pace of implementation of this it seems hard to foresee, but we need to at least anticipate that at some point they will be up and running—with 7,200 students spread across years 11 and 12, and thus only half that number graduating each year, a grand total of 3,600 technical college graduates per annum will be entering the work force.
Let us go back to the building and construction industry. Remember that they need 100,000 skilled workers over the next five years to replace the departures in that industry. The assumption is that all 24 of the technical colleges will start operating at the beginning of 2006, when in reality they will not. The assumption is that all students who begin their training will complete the course, when in reality they will not. The assumption is that all the students who complete their training will go on to work in that field, when in reality they will not. And the assumption is that students will undertake training relevant to the building industry, when in reality they will not. So, making all of those very generous assumptions that will not be reflected in reality, the maximum number of new skilled workers that will be produced over the next five years is 18,000. In reality, I suggest that a figure well under half of that is more likely.
The building and construction industry alone requires 100,000 new skilled workers. Even in the best possible scenario, these calculations show that the overall contribution of technical colleges to solve this crisis will be pathetic. It will not be enough. The entire technical colleges initiative reflects the Howard government’s pinprick response to skills shortages across the board. The government’s overall response has been ill-conceived, developed without any consultation or analysis, inadequately costed, developed on the run and in the end is nowhere near enough. In the end, Labor will support this proposal because the skills crisis is so serious that even eating half-baked pork is better than starving. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

Some veterans have travelled in more than one month. 31 veterans travelled to the mainland in 2004, 21 to seek specialist medical treatment, 5 to seek treatment in a hospital and 5 to seek both specialist medical and hospital treatment.  6 veterans travelled to the mainland to seek neurosurgical treatment which was available in Tasmania.  No neurosurgeons in Tasmania are willing to accept the Gold Card as payment for their services, therefore these veterans needed to travel to the mainland. All other visits made by veterans during 2004 were to seek treatment which is not available in Tasmania even to private patients.
The Department is aware of in the past 12 months up to 31 December 2004 the following numbers of war widows transported from Tasmania to the mainland to access either medical specialist treatment or hospital treatment.

† These entries show higher transport costs than the treatment costs.  These visits took place in order to receive treatment that was not available in Tasmania to the general public (eg for retinal detachment surgery and cochlear assessments).  Regardless of veteran status, any Tasmanian who required these medical services would have to travel interstate to receive them.
‡ These entries also show high transport costs and low treatment expenses.  These visits related to neurosurgical consultations either following surgery or to assess suitability for surgery.  Such assessments should be conducted by the treating surgeon to ensure continuity of care.  No neurosurgeons in Tasmania are currently willing to treat veterans under the Department’s arrangements.

From 1 January 2005, specialists receive 115 per cent of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee for consultations and 120 per cent of the MBS fee for procedures provided to eligible veterans. 
Releasing the daily rate agreed to under the Gold Card scheme would provide commercially sensitive information and would give a competitive advantage to other hospitals.  The following information is sourced from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs Annual Report 2003–04.
The estimated average cost per public and private hospital separation combined for 2003-04 was $4 096 a rise of 5.2% on the average in 2002-03 of $3 892.
Telephone calls to the Department’s State Offices from veterans and widows involve inquiries on many matters.  The Department does not keep records on the number of telephone calls received on this particular matter and therefore the answer to this question cannot be provided.

# This figure is due to the fact that accounts for ambulance services do not get presented to DVA in a regular and constant way, ie inconsistent bulk billing patterns.

NB: As Tasmania did not start using DVA Transport System (DVATS) until October 2003 there are no figures available prior to that for BCWD.  The effort required to extract ad hoc data for the 2004/05 year does not make it cost effective to provide this information outside normal processes.  However, the value of BCWD for this period is obtainable from a different source and has been provided in the answer to question 10(c).

During the period 1/7/01 to 31/12/04, the Department referred compensation claimants under the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Scheme (MCRS) and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA) to specialists for medical assessment.  The information is provided below:
Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Scheme
During the period 1/7/01 to 31/12/04 MCRS Offices paid for the following number of medical assessments by medical specialists or medico legal groups. (Note these figures include reimbursement to claimants’ treating specialists where reports from these specialists were used for compensation claims.  In these instances claimants were not referred to the specialist):
