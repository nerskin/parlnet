Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (09:31):  When the committee adjourned consideration and reported to the chamber just prior to question time yesterday, I was in the midst of making some comments regarding the amendment before the chamber, which is the Australian Greens amendment to extend and dramatically change the way in which ownership of minerals is recognised, by doing it with a backdoor method by essentially giving carte blanche power to landowners to be able to block any type of mineral exploration or development on their properties.


I gave the chamber some background on the very extensive history of state laws in this area, as did Senator Joyce, at length. We recognised in those contributions the genuine concerns of landowners and adjourning landowners, which need to be managed carefully. But I think it is important we recognise that laws as they exist at a state level at present do provide levels of process to ensure consent is ideally given and, if not, that mediation processes are undertaken. Not always do these processes provide the perfect outcome, but this Greens amendment would be a complete and utter over-reaction to the lack of perfection in some of those state processes.


To understand exactly where the states are in terms of their assessment of applications, and the processes they go through, I thought it would be useful for the chamber if in a reasonable quick way we went through step by step what some of those processes are. Importantly, there are distinctions between exploration activities and production activities in terms of the rights of landowners and the way in which consent is given or allowed.


For landowners in New South Wales, under the Petroleum (Onshore) Act 1991 as it currently stands, if a petroleum licence holder seeking to undertake exploration seeks to enter a property, a written notice detailing the licence holder's intention to obtain an access agreement must be served on the landowner. The licence holder and landholder must then reach an access agreement in order for such exploration activity to be undertaken. If that access agreement cannot be reached within 20 days of the serving of the notice of intention then an arbiter may be appointed whose role is to facilitate a conciliated agreement. If an agreement still cannot be reached, the arbiter is then bound to make a decision on access arrangements. This initial decision is known as an interim determination to allow for it to be varied either by the landholder or by the petroleum exploration licence holder subject to the agreement of both parties. If within 14 days no agreement variation is made to the interim determination, the determination becomes the arbiter's final determination. However, as a further right of recourse either party may apply for a review of the arbiter's final determination through appeal to the Land and Environment Court.


An access agreement may include arrangements for the time period for which access is permitted. It may identify the parts of the land that may be explored. It may identify the kinds of activities that can take place. It may identify the conditions that must be observed during the activities that are being undertaken. It may identify measures surrounding the protection of the environment. Importantly, it may identify the relevant compensation to be provided to the landholder. A licence holder cannot carry out any activity on the landholder's land other than which is prescribed in the access agreement.


Compensation, which as I indicated is a very, very important part of the agreement process, can be agreed to under the access agreement or determined separately. The licence holder is liable to compensate the landholder or every person having an estate or interest for any loss or interference as a result of any operations conducted by the licence holder. That is an important point and one that should be emphasised in this debate: the licence holder, the party planning to undertake exploration, is liable to compensate the landholder for any loss or interference as a result of any operations conducted by the licence holder. A licence holder cannot undertake any exploration activity on any land within 200 metres of a dwelling house, within 50 metres of a garden, vineyard or orchard or over any improvements or valuable work structure except with the written consent of the landholder. Those are the features in relation to exploration activities.


There are other features in relation to production and others in terms of how the Petroleum (Onshore) Act 1991 works in New South Wales. It is also relevant to note that there must also be appropriate development consent given under the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. So there are several hurdles that must be cleared. Under the Petroleum (Onshore) Act 1991, New South Wales must grant an approval. Under the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979, New South Wales must grant an approval. And, as we know—and are debating extending this—at the federal level there is the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and approval must be granted there.


In relation to production activities in New South Wales, a licence holder cannot carry out any mining operations or erect any works on the surface of any land that is under cultivation except with the consent of the landholder. Cultivation for the growth and spread of pasture grasses is not considered cultivation within the meaning of the act, though. The minister may, however, permit mining operations on land under cultivation if the minister considers that the circumstances warrant it.


There is no requirement in relation to production to enter into an access agreement. However, provisions relating to compensation—which I outlined before—and to the protection of homes and gardens and other areas that are applicable to exploration licences also apply to production leases. Once again, the compensation provisions state that any landholder must be compensated for any loss or interference as a result of any operations conducted by a licence holder.


I understand that there are legislative changes before the New South Wales parliament at present that again are responding to the types of concerns that have driven the debate on this measure by the Greens in this place. But it comes back to the fundamental point that these decisions—the management of legislation regarding land access undertakings—rightly belong at the state level. They are rightly decisions for state governments, as has been the case for more than 100 years. Constitutionally, as the government has indicated, it is likely that they must be decisions for state governments. So this chamber would find itself, and this parliament would find itself, exposing the Commonwealth government to a High Court battle in which the states, wanting to protect their rights in relation to land access and mining arrangements, would be taking on the Commonwealth should we pass this bill in an amended form as proposed by the Greens. For these reasons, and because of the many concerns we have about how significant this would be in overturning the longstanding practice of Australian law in relation to land management, the coalition again emphasises that it cannot possibly support the Greens amendment.



The CHAIRMAN:  Before I call Senator Waters I will just remind the chamber that the question that is before the chair at the moment is that amendment 1 on 7375, moved by Senator Waters, be agreed to. It was remiss of me to not indicate that up-front.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (09:41):  Thank you, Chair. We have debated this amendment for one hour now. This is the Greens amendment to give landholders the right to lock the gate against coal seam gas and coal. We will not stand for the opposition filibustering on my amendment any longer. I move:


That the question now be put.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that Greens amendment (1) on sheet 7375 be agreed to.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (09:52):  by leave—I move opposition amendments (3) and (4) on sheet 7397 concurrently:


 (3) Schedule 1, page 9 (after line 31), after item 18, insert:




18A


Section 528 (at the end of the definition of 
coal seam gas development
)



   Add "", but does not include exploration, assessment or appraisal pursuant to a petroleum title granted under a law of a State or Territory."".


(4) Schedule 1, page 9 (after line 31), after item 18, insert:




18B


Section 528 (at the end of the definition of 
large coal mining development
)



   Add "", but does not include exploration, assessment or appraisal pursuant to a minerals exploration licence or permit granted under a law of a State or Territory."".


I thank you, Chair, and I thank the chamber for leave. These amendments are important amendments. Before I get to these amendments, I will reflect for a moment on what transpired in the chamber. We just saw the Australian Greens moving to gag debate on their own amendment. The Greens moved to gag debate on their own significant amendment to environmental laws. It is the most remarkable thing I have seen in this place. The sanctimonious Greens come in here on a regular basis and preach transparency and accountability and have told us countless times how paramount the importance of this chamber is and how significant it is, and railed during the Howard years against any attempt to gag debate by the Howard government. On countless occasions, far more than ever occurred in the Howard years, the Greens have supported the Labor Party to gag debate. But now we see the remarkable situation of the Greens themselves moving the gag motion. And they are not just moving the gag motion on, say, the opposition's consideration or on the legislation as a whole; they start moving the gag motion on their very own amendments.


Senator Waters stood up and noted that we had been debating the amendment for an hour, 60 minutes—wow, whoop-de-do, what a big deal, a whole hour of consideration to something that would overturn a century-plus of state environmental laws and state land planning laws. Well, why on earth would you want to spend more than an hour considering overturning something that has been enshrined in the way this country has operated for more than a century? Why on earth would you need more than 60 minutes to contemplate such a vast and significant change to the way land management laws work in Australia!


Really, the hypocrisy that comes from the Australian Greens on so many levels is quite astounding, but perhaps none more so than such a contemptuous act as this, in terms of the way this chamber operates and the way the Australian people should be treated, and in terms of the significance of the law-making changes that they have proposed in this country. I really do question the sincerity of the Greens when it comes to their sanctimonious comments about having proper debate in this place, and I really do question their sincerity when it comes to their approach to facilitating transparency and openness in government and law-making, if they just want to come in here and simply shut down debate, even on their own substantial amendments.


It is worth noting that the amendments proposed add little, if any, relevance to the bill before the chair. The amendments the Greens have proposed are amendments to introduce a whole new area of responsibility to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, an area of responsibility where the federal minister for the environment would become the gatekeeper and the checker on whether or not agreements had been reached between landowners and mining companies. There is not anything about whether environmental standards are met or whether the water trigger that has been put into this act is being appropriately applied, but a whole different scenario in terms of actual land use agreements.


I am pleased to say that, in speaking to the amendments moved by the opposition—the amendments that relate in particular to definitional issues surrounding coal seam gas development and large coalmining developments—we are going to come back to the legislation before the chamber and actually deal with the specific proposal in the bill before the chamber.


The Senate inquiry into this bill heard numerous concerns about definitional issues in relation to this legislation on a range of fronts. We heard concerns about how it is that a 'significant impact' is defined in the legislation. We know that regulations are being drawn up by the government, and we had some answers to questions about those earlier in the debate. I foreshadow to the government that I will have further questions for them about the significant impact provisions and how it is that they operate. Equally, the committee heard questions and concerns about how it is that a 'water resource' is defined in this legislation or how it will be treated in terms of its definition in this legislation. Of course, there was the not unreasonable question of what a 'large coalmining development' is. How big is big enough to be a large coalmining development? Obviously, that is a particularly vague term in that sense. 


In particular, the amendments that I have moved deal with the difference and distinction between exploration or appraisal activities and actual production and development activities. In the previous debate on the Greens' amendment, I highlighted what happens at a state law level in terms of the granting of approvals and the different tests that are applied to exploration and appraisal activities versus those applied to production and development activities. It is quite reasonable that they are distinct. On the one hand, companies go in and assess whether there is a decent deposit there worth looking at in the first place—a decent deposit of coal or a decent amount of gas that can be extracted. What does the ground below the surface actually contain? You do not know that until you do the assessment, appraisal and exploration work. That is such a critical component of what occurs right across Australia to try to ascertain what our minerals and resources potential is under the soil, state by state. It is very important that there be proper processes in place to facilitate that as easily as possible.


In many, many instances—probably in the vast majority of instances—when that work is done, when a hole is drilled to test what the content of the ground beneath the soil is, the company will find that it is not satisfactory and moves on elsewhere. The intrusion—the access to the land—is therefore short term and minimal. The environmental impact on the land is also relatively short term and minimal. But sometimes, of course, deposits are found and it is then worthwhile proceeding to the next stage, the stage of production.


Rightly, state laws recognise that these are two distinct areas. Separate licences are granted for exploration activities and production activities. Different processes for approvals occur for exploration activities and production activities. But a major flaw in the legislation before the Senate today is that in relation to this expansion of powers at the federal level no such distinction has been factored in. A company will face exactly the same federal environmental hurdles to clear in relation to exploration or appraisal activities as they would face in relation to production and development activities. That is a significant flaw in this legislation and has the real capacity to hold up some of the most important work done in Australia, which is that exploration work to identify what and where the resources are.


As I said, the Senate committee took evidence in regard to this matter and heard a number of concerns. Santos submitted to the committee as follows:


Most concerning to Santos is a seemingly unintended consequence of the amendments that 'exploration' and 'appraisal' activities will be captured. …Traditionally the Act has been interpreted to regard a 'development' as referring to a defined project already committed to by the proponent.


Obviously, there is a vast difference between simply exploring whether something is there and actually committing as a company to extract those resources from the ground. The company argued that of course development can only follow after they have a sound understanding of the resource that is there. That is simply logic. If you do not facilitate the exploration, companies will never know what is in the ground and indeed governments and regulators will not know what is in the ground. It is to the benefit not just of industry but also of government and regulators to have a very clear understanding and knowledge of what is contained within the ground when making assessments as to whether or not full production activities should be undertaken.


The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association submitted to the Senate inquiry and said:


The proposed amendment bill utilises the definition of coal seam gas development activity used by the existing Independent Expert Scientific Committee gateway. Coal seam gas development means any activity involving coal seam gas extraction that has, or is likely to have, a significant impact on water resources (including any impacts of associated salt production and/or salinity). This is a broad definition that is likely to extend to petroleum exploration activities, which involve small amounts of coal seam gas extraction. The inclusion of exploration activities in the scope of activities covered by the amendment will result in situations where exploration cannot proceed. This is despite the fact that it is the act of exploration that informs the assessment of a water resource. This paradox is particularly concerning in remote areas where little or no information already exists.


APPEA submitted that the bill should expressly exclude exploration activities from the definition of coal seam gas development. So we see very clearly there in the submission of APPEA that the bill, as drafted at present, would result in situations in which exploration could not proceed, thereby undermining the capacity of regulators to be informed when assessing what the water resource is that they are seeking to assess. So there is an internal failure in this bill: the government will be less informed because such exploration may not be undertaken.


Dr Dripps, the deputy secretary of the relevant department, informed the committee that:


The way the EPBC Act operates is that it is based on a 'significant impact' on one of the listed matters. So the stage of the activity, whether it is an early exploratory stage or an actual production stage, is not relevant in considering whether or not there is a significant impact.


Well, the opposition believes it is relevant, and we believe it is relevant because it does not just facilitate potential development; it facilitates better understanding and knowledge of the very water resources that the government seeks to be able to assess. By undertaking the exploration activities, we gain, especially in remote areas where there is little existing knowledge of some of those underground water resources, a far better appreciation, as a whole, of what is out there and how the connectedness operates and how it may indeed impact in terms of any future production that is to be undertaken.


That is why the coalition is moving this amendment. We would hope that the government—who, I know, want to see this industry grow but want to see it grow in a safe and sensible way—will recognise that this is a safe and sensible and largely technical amendment. So I would urge the government to support it.


As I flagged, I would also ask the government if, in relation to the 'significant impact' definitions, they can outline just what minimum level of consultation with industry they are committed to, and how those significant impact criteria in particular deal with the issues of exploration. Do those significant impact criteria make it clear that exploration activities are not considered to be of significant impact? If they do, that will be some level of comfort—although, obviously, it would be preferable if the legislation itself made clear, as the coalition moves and proposes, that exploration activities are expressly excluded.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (10:07):  I would just like to put on record the Greens' opposition to this amendment moved by the opposition to exclude anything but the production stages of coal seam gas and coalmining. Clearly, as we have heard at length from the experts, the very punching of a hole through aquifers to get to a coal seam is what potentially causes the connectivity which can lead to dropping of the groundwater table or contamination of the groundwater. So I am afraid that, in terms of water, there is little difference between exploration and production in terms of the possible damage to aquifers, and on that basis we will be opposing this amendment.

It is my great pleasure to move these final amendments to try to strengthen these new water protections against coal seam gas and coalmining. The first amendment goes to the application of these new protections.


Whilst the Greens are thrilled that almost two years after we moved similar legislation to protect aquifers the government finally has done so themselves, we are concerned that in the interim all the big projects have already been approved. Sadly we know that Minister Burke has not rejected a single coal seam gas or coalmine application that has crossed his desk. I was particularly disappointed that, only several days after approving Gloucester coal seam gas and three big coalmines in New South Wales—Maules Creek, Boggabri and Tarawonga—suddenly the minister announced that he would belatedly move to protect aquifers with this new water trigger bill.


This first amendment goes to the fact that those four projects should be subject to these new water powers and those big companies should now have to look at the impact of water. The federal environment minister should be obliged to ensure that water impacts are able to be managed and, if there is any uncertainty, the minister should have the ability to reject those projects. As I say, given that work has not already commenced, we think this is a safe and sensible approach.


The other effect of this retrospectivity amendment goes to those earlier approved Queensland coal seam gas projects. Within several months of becoming the environment minister, Minister Burke ticked off on the first two big coal seam projects and, several months thereafter, the third big coal seam gas project. Given that the fourth one is yet to be approved, we need the benefit of information about the water impacts of those first big three before the decision on the final fourth one gets made. This amendment would not change the approval status of those big three—given that, unfortunately, it was granted many years ago and work has commenced—but it would ensure that water studies have to be done so that we know what damage is already being done and how much risk those aquifers are already facing before the minister decides whether or not to approve the fourth project, that being Arrow coal seam gas. So that is the genesis of those amendments.


The second tranche of amendments goes to the protections that the Greens think the federal government should keep for nationally important environmental assets. We have seen that this bill was amended in the House to make sure that this new water power cannot be given away to state governments. We absolutely support that; in fact, we were behind that amendment getting up. But what we have now seen is an admittance, a concession, that the state governments do not always do the best job in looking the after the environment. If there is acknowledgement that water is too precious to be trusted solely to the states and that we need federal oversight, then we think it is only fair that World Heritage sites of international significance receive the same attention.


Likewise, all those other elements that are currently protected by the EPBC Act—threatened species, Ramsar wetlands, migratory species, the Great Barrier Reef, and national heritage areas—are of national importance. It is a craven shame that, while we originally saw a Labor government protecting these areas 30 years ago through intervening in the Franklin Dam, we now see a Labor government proposing to give away those federal veto powers to state governments.


I want to set the record straight, because there has been a lot of confusion and rhetoric promulgated by the Business Council and its ilk. We have two stages of environmental approvals—assessment and approval. The Commonwealth has already accredited the state assessment processes, so any duplication that might have existed has already been dealt with and put to bed. There is now no duplication; there is simply no need for the Commonwealth to also issue an approval or a refusal decision. As we know, generally an approval decision gets made. Nonetheless, we still need that important veto power. So it is simply ridiculous to contend that there is duplication going on, which is why it is so crucial that the Commonwealth retain that final power to say no to things like mines in World Heritage areas or to clearing the last vestige of a threatened species habitat that would send a threatened species to extinction.


People need to know that the national environment deserves national protection, and that is certainly what all the polls on these issues are telling us. People want the federal government to be able to protect the environment; it is not a bizarre concept, and it has majority support. So this amendment would delete those parts of the act that allow those final protection approval powers to be simply given away to state governments. This amendment would stop Mr Tony Abbott's coalition, who have committed to using these powers to hand off federal environment approval powers, from doing so—unless, of course, they get control of both houses of parliament and change the laws again, and that is in the hands of the people. The point of this amendment is to make sure that Campbell Newman is not solely in control of Queensland's environment, nor Barry O'Farrell solely in control of New South Wales's environment, nor any of the other state premiers solely in control of national parts of our environment that are often internationally significant. We need that final veto power of the federal government against state governments, who have a history of approving development even though it would damage the environment.


The final amendment goes to protecting our national parks. It is along a similar theme. Unfortunately, we have seen state governments in recent months approving shooting in national parks. Never mind the safety concerns of families wanting to walk in those parks who might actually not want to be shot. Who would have thought they would rather have a picnic than be dodging bullets! We have also seen grazing approved, originally in the alpine region of Victoria, which was then overturned, and now in Queensland. We have had shooting and we have had grazing—and logging has now been approved by the Queensland government, and of course prospecting has just been approved by the Victorian state government, and there are plans to sell off Victoria's national parks.


So I am afraid national parks are under threat from the reckless actions of state governments. When we have less than four per cent of the country covered by national parks, why on earth can't they be off limits to logging, mining, grazing and shooting? Why can't we just protect those areas and properly manage them? It does not seem unreasonable to me.


This amendment would deliver on Minister Burke's commitment of almost two years ago that, sadly, has gone nowhere. Minister Burke originally said he would step in and protect national parks if state governments continued on their destructive agenda. They have done so. They have gotten worse and still the federal government has not acted. So this amendment clearly says: national parks should be given national protection. We urge both sides of the chamber to support it.


The federal environment minister has missed the deadline to act to protect national parks by regulation. If he does so move, we would encourage him to do so, but we would rather he support this amendment here and now, which will deliver lasting protection for national parks. If the minister simply moves to add national parks as a trigger to these laws by regulation, we know those regulations are susceptible to disallowance and we can expect that the opposition, in government, if they gain that honour, will in fact disallow them. The only way to guarantee protection for national parks is to support this amendment. So it is with great pleasure that I commend these amendments to the chamber.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,0,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:27):  So eager are the Greens to collapse debate on this that they are now moving all of their remaining amendments in one fell swoop, despite the fact that, of course, there is absolutely no linkage between any of these amendments. They cover three completely different issues and areas and, indeed, two of them are completely unrelated to the bill before the chamber. Two of them are using the fact that we have a bill that seeks to amend the EPBC Act to amend it in completely different ways that have nothing to do with water or coal seam gas or large coalmines whatsoever. It is a remarkable approach by the Greens, who are coming in here and wanting to simply push through as much change to Australia's environmental laws as possible, without any assessment or consideration of the impact of those changes but the shortest of possible Senate debates.


After I finish speaking, the government will probably try to gag debate again, because the last two debates on amendments have been gagged—and gagged, indeed, after only the most fleeting of consideration. Most remarkably, the last time around, Senator Conroy stood up, having been asked some specific questions, and completely ignored those questions in gagging the debate.


So I again emphasise to Senator Conroy the specific questions. He could at least, before he gags the debate, do the industry and those interested in these matters the courtesy of answering the questions. The questions were in relation to the significant-impact criteria being developed. Will he outline what the minimum level of consultation on the drafting of those significant impact criteria will be? Exactly what opportunity does he expect industry, stakeholders, landowners, environmental groups and others to have to comment on those significant impact criteria? Exactly how long will they have and when will they have that opportunity? Secondly, having informed the Senate earlier in the debate that, yes, there is a draft and, importantly, that until those criteria are finalised all assessments under the amendments to the EPBC Act will be considered against those draft criteria, will he also inform the Senate how those draft criteria deal with matters of exploration and appraisal? I really hope that Senator Conroy might do the Senate and stakeholders the courtesy of at least answering those two questions; just answer those two questions, at least, when you stand up and before you decide to gag debate yet again on the legislation.


Now, to the three Greens amendments that we have before us: firstly, the amendment regarding the timing of assessment of applications. The Greens essentially are seeking to make this legislation have a greater retrospective effect than it already does. The Greens basically want to ensure that projects that are already well advanced in the assessment phase suddenly find that the parliament has changed the rules on them—that, having already spent time and money and effort in going through and complying with existing laws, proponents and applicants will suddenly have to comply with different laws. Now, the coalition stands resolutely against retrospectivity. And we note that there are already concerns that the bill, even in its existing form, has an unfair and unacceptable level of retrospectivity to it. The Senate inquiry heard evidence from those concerned about the retrospective application of aspects of the existing bill. Mr Hooke from the Minerals Council urged the Senate committee to:


… remove the retrospective application, the trigger for projects not undergoing EPBC Act referral. This is not a good point of law, to have retrospectivity applying in a situation where it creates great uncertainty for projects which may be currently undertaking activities, including ancillary activities. The legislation should clarify the grandfathering exemptions provided in 22(3) and 22(4) to expressly acknowledge that changes to grandfathered projects do not impact on the status of prior environmental authorisations of unchanged components or where changes are immaterial to the significance of or impact on a water resource.


Mr Hooke was not the only one to identify concerns. The Australian Coal Association equally had concerns about the retrospective application of the bill that is before us in its existing form. They submitted:


Industry is also concerned with the retrospective application of the new trigger to projects that are already well advanced in the approvals process. These projects now face further uncertainty and potential delays. There is also the potential for the water trigger to capture established coal developments even where there are no significant changes to their operations. The exemptions should clarify that new provisions apply only to existing projects where there is a major new development proposal.


They are concerned about the level of retrospectivity that exists in the bill as it currently stands. Yet the Greens have identified that they want to increase that level of retrospectivity, that they basically want to take it back and be able to cover pretty much anything that may not already be well and truly under operation. The Greens obviously want to do everything within their power to hold up and stall the types of developments that are being considered. The opposition emphatically rejects those moves by the Greens and emphatically rejects their attempts to increase the retrospective elements of this legislation, whilst expressing our concern at the level of retrospectivity that exists already within the bill before the chamber.


The second of the amendments that the Greens seek to apply is completely unrelated to coal seam gas, completely unrelated to large coal developments and completely unrelated to water resources. It is an amendment that is basically yet another attempt by the Greens, because they have done this on multiple occasions, to try to ensure that we lock into law forever in this country a dual system of state and federal environmental law that maximises the expense, that maximises the duplication, that maximises the bureaucracy, that simply would create an unacceptable situation wherein, now and into the future, no government of any persuasion could ever try to sit down with the states and say, 'Let's actually harmonise the assessments and approvals processes and get a one-stop shop in place.'


Everybody knows it is the coalition's clear policy that has long been stated. It is our policy to have a one-stop shop for environmental assessments and approvals. Much as the government and the Greens and others may accuse the coalition of not having policies, this is a substantial policy and a policy that we have had announced for a long period of time. It is something that we are determined to implement in government. What the Greens' amendment seeks to do is simply stymie, block and make it as hard as possible for the coalition, should we win the election later this year, to implement that policy. As I said, it is amendment that has nothing to do with what the bill before the chamber is about. It is an amendment that is a sheer act of bastardry from the Australian Greens to try to block and stop the coalition from being able to implement our policies should we win a mandate from the Australian people later this year.


Such is the contempt of the Greens for the views of the majority of Australians that they are not willing to let the coalition go to the election with our policies and see whether the people endorse us, elect us to government and endorse our policies in that process. They want to take pre-emptive action before the election to close the door on the coalition's ability to implement those policies. This is obviously a taste and a sign, should we succeed later this year, for just how obstructionist the Greens will be, for just how destructive the Greens will be, for just what lengths the Greens will go to to try to block and harass the coalition in the application of our policies.


We have grave concerns at the approach of the Greens in introducing these amendments. They would lock into law existing duplication, which I assessed and commented on earlier in this debate, and which Deloitte Access Economics have identified as costing around $1.19 billion in excessive duplication of bureaucracy that we have at a state and federal level around environmental approvals. The coalition believes there must be a better way when it comes to environmental approvals. We want to uphold the highest standards, we want to uphold the very important matters of national environmental significance that are contained in the EPBC Act, which we brought into law when we were in government. Our commitment to those standards is in no way under any doubt because those standards were identified in laws that the Howard government passed. But those laws provided for the capacity to say that we should be able to align assessments and approvals processes at a state and federal level and, in doing so, remove the excessive duplication. The Greens amendments would seek to strip out that capacity to align those assessment and approvals processes.


I trust that the government, despite their complete flip-flopping on this important issue of reducing green-tape regulation, will support the coalition in opposing the Greens amendments. I hope the government will show just a scintilla of support for the judgement of the Australian people later this year when it comes to whether or not the coalition should be in a position to implement its policies. I hope the government does that because, of course, it was the government's own policy. Just a year ago the government was proposing to do, through the COAG processes, exactly the same thing. The Prime Minister said, back in 2012 when it was the government's policy:


Today COAG acted on that concern—


Concerns around duplication and costs—


and the Gillard Government and states and territories agreed to fast track arrangements to use state assessment and approval processes by March 2013.


Instead of delivering on that commitment made at the start of 2012—and why would we expect Prime Minister to deliver on a commitment when all she does is routinely break them?—the government, by the end of 2012, had abandoned it completely. They abandoned it so much that already built into this legislation is a limitation on the future operation of one-stop shops insofar as the new water trigger applies. If the Greens got their way, and if the government were reckless enough to support them, we would see a complete blockage on one-stop shops.


Lastly, the Greens propose another remarkable amendment completely unrelated to the bill before the Senate. This amendment would put in place a new section to the EPBC Act relating to national parks. It would add another five pages of legislation relating to how activities in national parks can be governed. This of course is a knee-jerk reaction of the Greens to decisions being made, justifiably, rightly, by state governments. Once again, the Greens want to tear up a century of federalism in this place. The Greens want to tear up the understanding of where responsibility lies in the Commonwealth for different activities and provide a whole new swathe of powers to give the Commonwealth minister capacity to encroach upon the activities of the states and the right of the states to govern their own national parks and to make their own determinations about land use.


These amendments once again have nothing to do with coal seam gas, nothing to do with large coal development and nothing to do with water resources. Nonetheless, the Greens seek, with no consultation, no opportunity for comment by anybody, to at the last minute bolt on to the legislation before the chamber, and simply sneak through, dramatic new changes to our laws. Again, the coalition rejects these efforts of the Greens.


In closing, I urge the government to allow a proper debate on these Greens amendments around national parks, because I know there are colleagues who want to have a contribution. Because the Greens have done these amendments all together, I have only been able to say a couple of words on them. But these are significant changes and they deserve to be properly debated, not gagged. (Time expired)

Senator CONROY

There are a range of amendments being proposed on a range of issues. The government does not support amendments that would broaden the scope of this bill. The proposed amendments are very broad. The government advice is that, because these amendments are so broad, they carry a high level of constitutional risk. I move:


That the question be now put.

I particularly am concerned that I was not given the opportunity of saying a few words on the amendment proposed by the Greens political party which would have had the effect of giving the Commonwealth minister the power to override the Queensland government in the management of its national parks and in particular the decision made by the Queensland government to allow starving cattle into Queensland national parks in an attempt to overcome an animal catastrophe, an animal welfare issue of horrendous proportions. 


This is a bill which has incensed every Queenslander, and as a senator representing the state of Queensland I believe I should have had the opportunity of at least debating the bill. Instead, it was guillotined on the motion of the Greens political party. I can remember sitting in this chamber for hour upon hour listing to the Greens political party rail against even the very moderate use of guillotines by the Howard government. For example, the regional forest agreement debate went for some 36 hours, kept going by the leader of the Greens political party simply repeating himself. When the Howard government moved to curtail the debate, after 36 hours of repetition, we then had hours more of the Greens saying how awful it was to curtail a debate after 36 hours. 


You and I, Mr Acting Deputy President Furner, as representatives of the state of Queensland, have a vital interest in this amendment dealing with Commonwealth control of state national parks. Were we given the opportunity to discuss it, to put forward the views of our constituents or to put forward the view of the RSPCA in Queensland, who thought it was a good idea? The Greens political party claim to be interested in animal welfare, but they would have 300,000 cattle in Queensland die a horrible death from starvation because they want to prevent them from using the limited grass that is available in some Queensland national parks.


This amendment moved by the Greens has nothing to do with the substantive part of the bill we were discussing—nothing to do with coal seam gas, the protection of water or care for the aquifers; nothing to do with that. But, here, tacked on, in a very tacky way, in the proposed amendments on sheet of 7394 the Greens political party have raised this issue of the declaration of national parks. Had these amendments been carried, they would have given the Commonwealth minister the power to override the Queensland minister and the Queensland government in that area, where a very sensible decision was made to allow starving cattle access to the limited food available in national parks. Yet, on this matter, we were not given the opportunity to say one word. Senator Birmingham had about 15 minutes to traverse a series of complicated amendments. That was all that was allowed. Then we saw the Greens political party move the guillotine, the gag, to stop debate on this most important issue.


However, I do not want to hold up the chamber any further. I understand we have a lot to discuss. I see I have 15 minutes left. I know that my colleague Senator Back would like to say a few words on the same subject and on the proposed amendment to the bill. But I make this point in all good faith. I could say a lot more in the 14 minutes or so I have left to address my other issues, but in consideration of the procedures of the Senate and because my colleague Senator Back wants to say a few words, I am going to sit down before my time is up. But I do hope that the guillotining frenzy of the Labor Party and the Greens will not apply at least for the next 14 minutes so that my colleagues have the opportunity of saying a few words on this very important issue.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:17):  It is extremely important to understand that in a short period of time the EPBC Act will have a water trigger and that that is supported by the coalition. This belies the story that has been peddled around in many areas that the coalition do not support the water trigger; we do. This matter has been held up for such a long period of time now for a whole range of reasons, but most importantly because the Greens have been frolicking with amendments that never had a snowflake's chance of ever getting up. They dealt with them for divisive purposes. They have never really properly prosecuted the argument. They have not properly lobbied people about them; they never do. The first we ever hear about most of these things is when they appear in the chamber. It has been clearly said throughout the New England area and in so many other areas, and around southern Queensland—peddled by Independents and the Greens—that the coalition do not support the water trigger. In a very short period of time, it will be legislation and it is supported by the coalition. That needs to be clearly put on the record.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:19):  Briefly, I rise firstly to support the comments of Senator Macdonald, who spoke so eloquently about the starving cattle in North Queensland and other places in Queensland. And I have spoken about this openly and frequently in Queensland and other places. There is no need for that cattle to be there in the first place. The heavily pregnant cows are about to calve. Their calves from last year should be being prepared now for sale and those from two years ago should have long gone. The important point to be made here is that so many of the national parks, which the graziers and the pastoralists requested be opened and whose request the Queensland state government approved—and I do hope Minister Burke will see the value in the matter—were in fact cattle stations. They are rich in buffel grass and species introduced specifically for cattle-grazing purposes. The perverse irony here is that if they are not opened that buffel grass will dry off and burn, and many of the environmental assets in those parks will be destroyed by the burning.


In the few moments allowed to me, I want to make some points. It is interesting that this amendment debate was gagged by the Greens or they joined in support of the gag in gagging their own amendment, something I find remarkable. I want to place on the record the circumstance of Western Australia, as a Western Australian senator in this. Whilst we recognise, as Senator Joyce said, that the coalition will be supporting the water trigger, the point is that these issues are principally confined to the eastern seaboard, particularly Queensland and New South Wales. Western Australia is not commercially prospective for coal seam gas, but we did view these amendments with concern. 


In the lead-up to the introduction of the amendments, the Commonwealth established the independent expert scientific committee to review coal seam gas and large coalmining deposits. Western Australia is not a signatory to the national partnership agreement that established the IESC. Western Australia views this as yet another imposition, another layer of regulatory approvals, over existing, comprehensive state regulatory arrangements in Western Australia. I use this opportunity to refute the comments that were made here by another Western Australian Greens senator, Senator Ludlam, in which he condemned Western Australia and its environmental processes.


It is a relief to us in Western Australia that this amendment has gone down. The IESC and the proposed amendments would only have served to increase delays and uncertainty, to encourage a lack of confidence in state processes in Western Australia and ultimately—and most importantly—to undermine the credentials of the state's Environmental Protection Authority. This is an organisation that I have had a long association with in different aspects of my professional career in Western Australia, and I have always found the EPA to be independent, to be fair and to be very, very serious in its approach. Representations that we made in my time as a chief executive officer of a state instrumentality were often rejected by the EPA. Therefore, we see it as a very severe issue that the Commonwealth would have the capacity to walk in and, for no reason, overrule it.


In the case of Western Australia, it is not coal seam gas but shale oil and shale gas that is very much the area of concern. I want to place on record that the WA government has a strong regulatory framework for commercial gas extraction, from deep shale and so-called tight rock formations, especially where hydraulic fracture stimulation—or fracking, as it is known—is involved. Those listening may be interested to know that fracking has safely been used in the Western Australian mining and extractive industries for some 55 years, since 1958, with no—I repeat: no—adverse effects on the environment, on water sources or indeed on the health of the communities in their vicinity. 


I again comment on the statements made by Senator Ludlam yesterday in which he called into question the transparency of information regarding fracking chemicals. I say this, and I say it proudly: in Western Australia, we have the strongest chemical disclosure requirements of any Australian jurisdiction; we have rigorous environmental and safety approval processes; and we have international standards for well design and integrity. It is not acceptable for any senator, let alone one from our own state, to stand up and deny that to be the fact. I would urge that the Western Australian standards be scrutinised nationally to establish that what I have said is the case and, if it is the case, let them become the benchmark for other state jurisdictions.


We have a very robust regulatory regime in Western Australia. We have an independent environmental protection authority. It is for that reason Western Australia coalition senators and, I am pleased to see, their Labor colleagues voted down that particular amendment.


I conclude by reflecting on the potential value of the shale oil industry not only for WA but also for the nation generally. It would appear once again that we have amongst the highest levels of shale gas reserves anywhere in the world. We already see that, in the United States of America, shale oil and shale gas in particular are now being extracted and, most importantly, we see a resurgence of manufacturing in the United States as the Americans bring back onshore, to continental USA, much of the manufacturing that they had outsourced to other countries. How wonderful it is, when their manufacturing industries were suffering so severely, with so much criticism that everything was going offshore, that now, because of cheaper energy, they actually have the capacity to bring their manufacturing back onshore.


Of course, we have all spoken in this debate about environmental safety, community safety and health and wellbeing. But I say again: we have the safeguards in place. I look forward to the extraction of shale gas being the next area in which Western Australia will not only advance as a state but also be able to make its contribution to the national economy.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (11:27):  I do not intend to detain the chamber for terribly long. There has been a lengthy debate on this bill, and it is unusual to make a contribution on the third reading, but it is important to make clear that, whilst the coalition has significant concerns about the way the government and the Greens have conducted this debate—grave concerns about the application of the gag and the guillotine, and concerns about some of the technical aspects of this bill which we have debated and sought to move amendments to—we nonetheless acknowledge, as I said way back in my contribution on the second reading and as Senator Joyce just emphasised, that there are genuine community concerns that surround the issue of coal seam gas development and large coalmining development, and what their impact may be on water resources. We understand the imperative to protect our water resources and we want to make sure that in the future they are appropriately protected and the right safeguards are in place. 


That is why the coalition ultimately supports this bill and will ultimately support the passage of the third reading of this bill. In the future, in government—as is our declared policy—we will to try to streamline assessment and approval processes to ensure that we minimise or eliminate, ideally, the duplication of costs between the Commonwealth and the states when it comes to environmental assessments. But that will in no way undermine our commitment to ensuring that the water resources of Australia are properly protected when it comes to how mining and exploration activities are undertaken.


I want to make it very clear, lest there be any doubt or any attempts by others to misinterpret the coalition's stance on this legislation, that despite our misgivings around the political and tactical handling of this legislation by those opposite in the government and the Greens, and despite vehement opposition to the amendment made by Mr Windsor that attempts to block any way of eliminating duplication and excessive costs to environmental regulation, we support the third reading of this bill, support the development of the new water trigger, and will make sure should we be elected to government that it is applied in a robust way and in a way that ensures that our water resources are appropriately protected but, hopefully, also in a way that eliminates the duplicative costs that we see from state and Commonwealth overlapping of environmental regulation. With that, I ultimately commend the bill to the chamber.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (09:31):  When the committee adjourned consideration and reported to the chamber just prior to question time yesterday, I was in the midst of making some comments regarding the amendment before the chamber, which is the Australian Greens amendment to extend and dramatically change the way in which ownership of minerals is recognised, by doing it with a backdoor method by essentially giving carte blanche power to landowners to be able to block any type of mineral exploration or development on their properties.


I gave the chamber some background on the very extensive history of state laws in this area, as did Senator Joyce, at length. We recognised in those contributions the genuine concerns of landowners and adjourning landowners, which need to be managed carefully. But I think it is important we recognise that laws as they exist at a state level at present do provide levels of process to ensure consent is ideally given and, if not, that mediation processes are undertaken. Not always do these processes provide the perfect outcome, but this Greens amendment would be a complete and utter over-reaction to the lack of perfection in some of those state processes.


To understand exactly where the states are in terms of their assessment of applications, and the processes they go through, I thought it would be useful for the chamber if in a reasonable quick way we went through step by step what some of those processes are. Importantly, there are distinctions between exploration activities and production activities in terms of the rights of landowners and the way in which consent is given or allowed.


For landowners in New South Wales, under the Petroleum (Onshore) Act 1991 as it currently stands, if a petroleum licence holder seeking to undertake exploration seeks to enter a property, a written notice detailing the licence holder's intention to obtain an access agreement must be served on the landowner. The licence holder and landholder must then reach an access agreement in order for such exploration activity to be undertaken. If that access agreement cannot be reached within 20 days of the serving of the notice of intention then an arbiter may be appointed whose role is to facilitate a conciliated agreement. If an agreement still cannot be reached, the arbiter is then bound to make a decision on access arrangements. This initial decision is known as an interim determination to allow for it to be varied either by the landholder or by the petroleum exploration licence holder subject to the agreement of both parties. If within 14 days no agreement variation is made to the interim determination, the determination becomes the arbiter's final determination. However, as a further right of recourse either party may apply for a review of the arbiter's final determination through appeal to the Land and Environment Court.


An access agreement may include arrangements for the time period for which access is permitted. It may identify the parts of the land that may be explored. It may identify the kinds of activities that can take place. It may identify the conditions that must be observed during the activities that are being undertaken. It may identify measures surrounding the protection of the environment. Importantly, it may identify the relevant compensation to be provided to the landholder. A licence holder cannot carry out any activity on the landholder's land other than which is prescribed in the access agreement.


Compensation, which as I indicated is a very, very important part of the agreement process, can be agreed to under the access agreement or determined separately. The licence holder is liable to compensate the landholder or every person having an estate or interest for any loss or interference as a result of any operations conducted by the licence holder. That is an important point and one that should be emphasised in this debate: the licence holder, the party planning to undertake exploration, is liable to compensate the landholder for any loss or interference as a result of any operations conducted by the licence holder. A licence holder cannot undertake any exploration activity on any land within 200 metres of a dwelling house, within 50 metres of a garden, vineyard or orchard or over any improvements or valuable work structure except with the written consent of the landholder. Those are the features in relation to exploration activities.


There are other features in relation to production and others in terms of how the Petroleum (Onshore) Act 1991 works in New South Wales. It is also relevant to note that there must also be appropriate development consent given under the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. So there are several hurdles that must be cleared. Under the Petroleum (Onshore) Act 1991, New South Wales must grant an approval. Under the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979, New South Wales must grant an approval. And, as we know—and are debating extending this—at the federal level there is the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and approval must be granted there.


In relation to production activities in New South Wales, a licence holder cannot carry out any mining operations or erect any works on the surface of any land that is under cultivation except with the consent of the landholder. Cultivation for the growth and spread of pasture grasses is not considered cultivation within the meaning of the act, though. The minister may, however, permit mining operations on land under cultivation if the minister considers that the circumstances warrant it.


There is no requirement in relation to production to enter into an access agreement. However, provisions relating to compensation—which I outlined before—and to the protection of homes and gardens and other areas that are applicable to exploration licences also apply to production leases. Once again, the compensation provisions state that any landholder must be compensated for any loss or interference as a result of any operations conducted by a licence holder.


I understand that there are legislative changes before the New South Wales parliament at present that again are responding to the types of concerns that have driven the debate on this measure by the Greens in this place. But it comes back to the fundamental point that these decisions—the management of legislation regarding land access undertakings—rightly belong at the state level. They are rightly decisions for state governments, as has been the case for more than 100 years. Constitutionally, as the government has indicated, it is likely that they must be decisions for state governments. So this chamber would find itself, and this parliament would find itself, exposing the Commonwealth government to a High Court battle in which the states, wanting to protect their rights in relation to land access and mining arrangements, would be taking on the Commonwealth should we pass this bill in an amended form as proposed by the Greens. For these reasons, and because of the many concerns we have about how significant this would be in overturning the longstanding practice of Australian law in relation to land management, the coalition again emphasises that it cannot possibly support the Greens amendment.



The CHAIRMAN:  Before I call Senator Waters I will just remind the chamber that the question that is before the chair at the moment is that amendment 1 on 7375, moved by Senator Waters, be agreed to. It was remiss of me to not indicate that up-front.

I thank you, Chair, and I thank the chamber for leave. These amendments are important amendments. Before I get to these amendments, I will reflect for a moment on what transpired in the chamber. We just saw the Australian Greens moving to gag debate on their own amendment. The Greens moved to gag debate on their own significant amendment to environmental laws. It is the most remarkable thing I have seen in this place. The sanctimonious Greens come in here on a regular basis and preach transparency and accountability and have told us countless times how paramount the importance of this chamber is and how significant it is, and railed during the Howard years against any attempt to gag debate by the Howard government. On countless occasions, far more than ever occurred in the Howard years, the Greens have supported the Labor Party to gag debate. But now we see the remarkable situation of the Greens themselves moving the gag motion. And they are not just moving the gag motion on, say, the opposition's consideration or on the legislation as a whole; they start moving the gag motion on their very own amendments.


Senator Waters stood up and noted that we had been debating the amendment for an hour, 60 minutes—wow, whoop-de-do, what a big deal, a whole hour of consideration to something that would overturn a century-plus of state environmental laws and state land planning laws. Well, why on earth would you want to spend more than an hour considering overturning something that has been enshrined in the way this country has operated for more than a century? Why on earth would you need more than 60 minutes to contemplate such a vast and significant change to the way land management laws work in Australia!


Really, the hypocrisy that comes from the Australian Greens on so many levels is quite astounding, but perhaps none more so than such a contemptuous act as this, in terms of the way this chamber operates and the way the Australian people should be treated, and in terms of the significance of the law-making changes that they have proposed in this country. I really do question the sincerity of the Greens when it comes to their sanctimonious comments about having proper debate in this place, and I really do question their sincerity when it comes to their approach to facilitating transparency and openness in government and law-making, if they just want to come in here and simply shut down debate, even on their own substantial amendments.


It is worth noting that the amendments proposed add little, if any, relevance to the bill before the chair. The amendments the Greens have proposed are amendments to introduce a whole new area of responsibility to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, an area of responsibility where the federal minister for the environment would become the gatekeeper and the checker on whether or not agreements had been reached between landowners and mining companies. There is not anything about whether environmental standards are met or whether the water trigger that has been put into this act is being appropriately applied, but a whole different scenario in terms of actual land use agreements.


I am pleased to say that, in speaking to the amendments moved by the opposition—the amendments that relate in particular to definitional issues surrounding coal seam gas development and large coalmining developments—we are going to come back to the legislation before the chamber and actually deal with the specific proposal in the bill before the chamber.


The Senate inquiry into this bill heard numerous concerns about definitional issues in relation to this legislation on a range of fronts. We heard concerns about how it is that a 'significant impact' is defined in the legislation. We know that regulations are being drawn up by the government, and we had some answers to questions about those earlier in the debate. I foreshadow to the government that I will have further questions for them about the significant impact provisions and how it is that they operate. Equally, the committee heard questions and concerns about how it is that a 'water resource' is defined in this legislation or how it will be treated in terms of its definition in this legislation. Of course, there was the not unreasonable question of what a 'large coalmining development' is. How big is big enough to be a large coalmining development? Obviously, that is a particularly vague term in that sense. 


In particular, the amendments that I have moved deal with the difference and distinction between exploration or appraisal activities and actual production and development activities. In the previous debate on the Greens' amendment, I highlighted what happens at a state law level in terms of the granting of approvals and the different tests that are applied to exploration and appraisal activities versus those applied to production and development activities. It is quite reasonable that they are distinct. On the one hand, companies go in and assess whether there is a decent deposit there worth looking at in the first place—a decent deposit of coal or a decent amount of gas that can be extracted. What does the ground below the surface actually contain? You do not know that until you do the assessment, appraisal and exploration work. That is such a critical component of what occurs right across Australia to try to ascertain what our minerals and resources potential is under the soil, state by state. It is very important that there be proper processes in place to facilitate that as easily as possible.


In many, many instances—probably in the vast majority of instances—when that work is done, when a hole is drilled to test what the content of the ground beneath the soil is, the company will find that it is not satisfactory and moves on elsewhere. The intrusion—the access to the land—is therefore short term and minimal. The environmental impact on the land is also relatively short term and minimal. But sometimes, of course, deposits are found and it is then worthwhile proceeding to the next stage, the stage of production.


Rightly, state laws recognise that these are two distinct areas. Separate licences are granted for exploration activities and production activities. Different processes for approvals occur for exploration activities and production activities. But a major flaw in the legislation before the Senate today is that in relation to this expansion of powers at the federal level no such distinction has been factored in. A company will face exactly the same federal environmental hurdles to clear in relation to exploration or appraisal activities as they would face in relation to production and development activities. That is a significant flaw in this legislation and has the real capacity to hold up some of the most important work done in Australia, which is that exploration work to identify what and where the resources are.


As I said, the Senate committee took evidence in regard to this matter and heard a number of concerns. Santos submitted to the committee as follows:


Most concerning to Santos is a seemingly unintended consequence of the amendments that 'exploration' and 'appraisal' activities will be captured. …Traditionally the Act has been interpreted to regard a 'development' as referring to a defined project already committed to by the proponent.


Obviously, there is a vast difference between simply exploring whether something is there and actually committing as a company to extract those resources from the ground. The company argued that of course development can only follow after they have a sound understanding of the resource that is there. That is simply logic. If you do not facilitate the exploration, companies will never know what is in the ground and indeed governments and regulators will not know what is in the ground. It is to the benefit not just of industry but also of government and regulators to have a very clear understanding and knowledge of what is contained within the ground when making assessments as to whether or not full production activities should be undertaken.


The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association submitted to the Senate inquiry and said:


The proposed amendment bill utilises the definition of coal seam gas development activity used by the existing Independent Expert Scientific Committee gateway. Coal seam gas development means any activity involving coal seam gas extraction that has, or is likely to have, a significant impact on water resources (including any impacts of associated salt production and/or salinity). This is a broad definition that is likely to extend to petroleum exploration activities, which involve small amounts of coal seam gas extraction. The inclusion of exploration activities in the scope of activities covered by the amendment will result in situations where exploration cannot proceed. This is despite the fact that it is the act of exploration that informs the assessment of a water resource. This paradox is particularly concerning in remote areas where little or no information already exists.


APPEA submitted that the bill should expressly exclude exploration activities from the definition of coal seam gas development. So we see very clearly there in the submission of APPEA that the bill, as drafted at present, would result in situations in which exploration could not proceed, thereby undermining the capacity of regulators to be informed when assessing what the water resource is that they are seeking to assess. So there is an internal failure in this bill: the government will be less informed because such exploration may not be undertaken.


Dr Dripps, the deputy secretary of the relevant department, informed the committee that:


The way the EPBC Act operates is that it is based on a 'significant impact' on one of the listed matters. So the stage of the activity, whether it is an early exploratory stage or an actual production stage, is not relevant in considering whether or not there is a significant impact.


Well, the opposition believes it is relevant, and we believe it is relevant because it does not just facilitate potential development; it facilitates better understanding and knowledge of the very water resources that the government seeks to be able to assess. By undertaking the exploration activities, we gain, especially in remote areas where there is little existing knowledge of some of those underground water resources, a far better appreciation, as a whole, of what is out there and how the connectedness operates and how it may indeed impact in terms of any future production that is to be undertaken.


That is why the coalition is moving this amendment. We would hope that the government—who, I know, want to see this industry grow but want to see it grow in a safe and sensible way—will recognise that this is a safe and sensible and largely technical amendment. So I would urge the government to support it.


As I flagged, I would also ask the government if, in relation to the 'significant impact' definitions, they can outline just what minimum level of consultation with industry they are committed to, and how those significant impact criteria in particular deal with the issues of exploration. Do those significant impact criteria make it clear that exploration activities are not considered to be of significant impact? If they do, that will be some level of comfort—although, obviously, it would be preferable if the legislation itself made clear, as the coalition moves and proposes, that exploration activities are expressly excluded.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (10:07):  I would just like to put on record the Greens' opposition to this amendment moved by the opposition to exclude anything but the production stages of coal seam gas and coalmining. Clearly, as we have heard at length from the experts, the very punching of a hole through aquifers to get to a coal seam is what potentially causes the connectivity which can lead to dropping of the groundwater table or contamination of the groundwater. So I am afraid that, in terms of water, there is little difference between exploration and production in terms of the possible damage to aquifers, and on that basis we will be opposing this amendment.

It is my great pleasure to move these final amendments to try to strengthen these new water protections against coal seam gas and coalmining. The first amendment goes to the application of these new protections.


Whilst the Greens are thrilled that almost two years after we moved similar legislation to protect aquifers the government finally has done so themselves, we are concerned that in the interim all the big projects have already been approved. Sadly we know that Minister Burke has not rejected a single coal seam gas or coalmine application that has crossed his desk. I was particularly disappointed that, only several days after approving Gloucester coal seam gas and three big coalmines in New South Wales—Maules Creek, Boggabri and Tarawonga—suddenly the minister announced that he would belatedly move to protect aquifers with this new water trigger bill.


This first amendment goes to the fact that those four projects should be subject to these new water powers and those big companies should now have to look at the impact of water. The federal environment minister should be obliged to ensure that water impacts are able to be managed and, if there is any uncertainty, the minister should have the ability to reject those projects. As I say, given that work has not already commenced, we think this is a safe and sensible approach.


The other effect of this retrospectivity amendment goes to those earlier approved Queensland coal seam gas projects. Within several months of becoming the environment minister, Minister Burke ticked off on the first two big coal seam projects and, several months thereafter, the third big coal seam gas project. Given that the fourth one is yet to be approved, we need the benefit of information about the water impacts of those first big three before the decision on the final fourth one gets made. This amendment would not change the approval status of those big three—given that, unfortunately, it was granted many years ago and work has commenced—but it would ensure that water studies have to be done so that we know what damage is already being done and how much risk those aquifers are already facing before the minister decides whether or not to approve the fourth project, that being Arrow coal seam gas. So that is the genesis of those amendments.


The second tranche of amendments goes to the protections that the Greens think the federal government should keep for nationally important environmental assets. We have seen that this bill was amended in the House to make sure that this new water power cannot be given away to state governments. We absolutely support that; in fact, we were behind that amendment getting up. But what we have now seen is an admittance, a concession, that the state governments do not always do the best job in looking the after the environment. If there is acknowledgement that water is too precious to be trusted solely to the states and that we need federal oversight, then we think it is only fair that World Heritage sites of international significance receive the same attention.


Likewise, all those other elements that are currently protected by the EPBC Act—threatened species, Ramsar wetlands, migratory species, the Great Barrier Reef, and national heritage areas—are of national importance. It is a craven shame that, while we originally saw a Labor government protecting these areas 30 years ago through intervening in the Franklin Dam, we now see a Labor government proposing to give away those federal veto powers to state governments.


I want to set the record straight, because there has been a lot of confusion and rhetoric promulgated by the Business Council and its ilk. We have two stages of environmental approvals—assessment and approval. The Commonwealth has already accredited the state assessment processes, so any duplication that might have existed has already been dealt with and put to bed. There is now no duplication; there is simply no need for the Commonwealth to also issue an approval or a refusal decision. As we know, generally an approval decision gets made. Nonetheless, we still need that important veto power. So it is simply ridiculous to contend that there is duplication going on, which is why it is so crucial that the Commonwealth retain that final power to say no to things like mines in World Heritage areas or to clearing the last vestige of a threatened species habitat that would send a threatened species to extinction.


People need to know that the national environment deserves national protection, and that is certainly what all the polls on these issues are telling us. People want the federal government to be able to protect the environment; it is not a bizarre concept, and it has majority support. So this amendment would delete those parts of the act that allow those final protection approval powers to be simply given away to state governments. This amendment would stop Mr Tony Abbott's coalition, who have committed to using these powers to hand off federal environment approval powers, from doing so—unless, of course, they get control of both houses of parliament and change the laws again, and that is in the hands of the people. The point of this amendment is to make sure that Campbell Newman is not solely in control of Queensland's environment, nor Barry O'Farrell solely in control of New South Wales's environment, nor any of the other state premiers solely in control of national parts of our environment that are often internationally significant. We need that final veto power of the federal government against state governments, who have a history of approving development even though it would damage the environment.


The final amendment goes to protecting our national parks. It is along a similar theme. Unfortunately, we have seen state governments in recent months approving shooting in national parks. Never mind the safety concerns of families wanting to walk in those parks who might actually not want to be shot. Who would have thought they would rather have a picnic than be dodging bullets! We have also seen grazing approved, originally in the alpine region of Victoria, which was then overturned, and now in Queensland. We have had shooting and we have had grazing—and logging has now been approved by the Queensland government, and of course prospecting has just been approved by the Victorian state government, and there are plans to sell off Victoria's national parks.


So I am afraid national parks are under threat from the reckless actions of state governments. When we have less than four per cent of the country covered by national parks, why on earth can't they be off limits to logging, mining, grazing and shooting? Why can't we just protect those areas and properly manage them? It does not seem unreasonable to me.


This amendment would deliver on Minister Burke's commitment of almost two years ago that, sadly, has gone nowhere. Minister Burke originally said he would step in and protect national parks if state governments continued on their destructive agenda. They have done so. They have gotten worse and still the federal government has not acted. So this amendment clearly says: national parks should be given national protection. We urge both sides of the chamber to support it.


The federal environment minister has missed the deadline to act to protect national parks by regulation. If he does so move, we would encourage him to do so, but we would rather he support this amendment here and now, which will deliver lasting protection for national parks. If the minister simply moves to add national parks as a trigger to these laws by regulation, we know those regulations are susceptible to disallowance and we can expect that the opposition, in government, if they gain that honour, will in fact disallow them. The only way to guarantee protection for national parks is to support this amendment. So it is with great pleasure that I commend these amendments to the chamber.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,2
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:27):  So eager are the Greens to collapse debate on this that they are now moving all of their remaining amendments in one fell swoop, despite the fact that, of course, there is absolutely no linkage between any of these amendments. They cover three completely different issues and areas and, indeed, two of them are completely unrelated to the bill before the chamber. Two of them are using the fact that we have a bill that seeks to amend the EPBC Act to amend it in completely different ways that have nothing to do with water or coal seam gas or large coalmines whatsoever. It is a remarkable approach by the Greens, who are coming in here and wanting to simply push through as much change to Australia's environmental laws as possible, without any assessment or consideration of the impact of those changes but the shortest of possible Senate debates.


After I finish speaking, the government will probably try to gag debate again, because the last two debates on amendments have been gagged—and gagged, indeed, after only the most fleeting of consideration. Most remarkably, the last time around, Senator Conroy stood up, having been asked some specific questions, and completely ignored those questions in gagging the debate.


So I again emphasise to Senator Conroy the specific questions. He could at least, before he gags the debate, do the industry and those interested in these matters the courtesy of answering the questions. The questions were in relation to the significant-impact criteria being developed. Will he outline what the minimum level of consultation on the drafting of those significant impact criteria will be? Exactly what opportunity does he expect industry, stakeholders, landowners, environmental groups and others to have to comment on those significant impact criteria? Exactly how long will they have and when will they have that opportunity? Secondly, having informed the Senate earlier in the debate that, yes, there is a draft and, importantly, that until those criteria are finalised all assessments under the amendments to the EPBC Act will be considered against those draft criteria, will he also inform the Senate how those draft criteria deal with matters of exploration and appraisal? I really hope that Senator Conroy might do the Senate and stakeholders the courtesy of at least answering those two questions; just answer those two questions, at least, when you stand up and before you decide to gag debate yet again on the legislation.


Now, to the three Greens amendments that we have before us: firstly, the amendment regarding the timing of assessment of applications. The Greens essentially are seeking to make this legislation have a greater retrospective effect than it already does. The Greens basically want to ensure that projects that are already well advanced in the assessment phase suddenly find that the parliament has changed the rules on them—that, having already spent time and money and effort in going through and complying with existing laws, proponents and applicants will suddenly have to comply with different laws. Now, the coalition stands resolutely against retrospectivity. And we note that there are already concerns that the bill, even in its existing form, has an unfair and unacceptable level of retrospectivity to it. The Senate inquiry heard evidence from those concerned about the retrospective application of aspects of the existing bill. Mr Hooke from the Minerals Council urged the Senate committee to:


… remove the retrospective application, the trigger for projects not undergoing EPBC Act referral. This is not a good point of law, to have retrospectivity applying in a situation where it creates great uncertainty for projects which may be currently undertaking activities, including ancillary activities. The legislation should clarify the grandfathering exemptions provided in 22(3) and 22(4) to expressly acknowledge that changes to grandfathered projects do not impact on the status of prior environmental authorisations of unchanged components or where changes are immaterial to the significance of or impact on a water resource.


Mr Hooke was not the only one to identify concerns. The Australian Coal Association equally had concerns about the retrospective application of the bill that is before us in its existing form. They submitted:


Industry is also concerned with the retrospective application of the new trigger to projects that are already well advanced in the approvals process. These projects now face further uncertainty and potential delays. There is also the potential for the water trigger to capture established coal developments even where there are no significant changes to their operations. The exemptions should clarify that new provisions apply only to existing projects where there is a major new development proposal.


They are concerned about the level of retrospectivity that exists in the bill as it currently stands. Yet the Greens have identified that they want to increase that level of retrospectivity, that they basically want to take it back and be able to cover pretty much anything that may not already be well and truly under operation. The Greens obviously want to do everything within their power to hold up and stall the types of developments that are being considered. The opposition emphatically rejects those moves by the Greens and emphatically rejects their attempts to increase the retrospective elements of this legislation, whilst expressing our concern at the level of retrospectivity that exists already within the bill before the chamber.


The second of the amendments that the Greens seek to apply is completely unrelated to coal seam gas, completely unrelated to large coal developments and completely unrelated to water resources. It is an amendment that is basically yet another attempt by the Greens, because they have done this on multiple occasions, to try to ensure that we lock into law forever in this country a dual system of state and federal environmental law that maximises the expense, that maximises the duplication, that maximises the bureaucracy, that simply would create an unacceptable situation wherein, now and into the future, no government of any persuasion could ever try to sit down with the states and say, 'Let's actually harmonise the assessments and approvals processes and get a one-stop shop in place.'


Everybody knows it is the coalition's clear policy that has long been stated. It is our policy to have a one-stop shop for environmental assessments and approvals. Much as the government and the Greens and others may accuse the coalition of not having policies, this is a substantial policy and a policy that we have had announced for a long period of time. It is something that we are determined to implement in government. What the Greens' amendment seeks to do is simply stymie, block and make it as hard as possible for the coalition, should we win the election later this year, to implement that policy. As I said, it is amendment that has nothing to do with what the bill before the chamber is about. It is an amendment that is a sheer act of bastardry from the Australian Greens to try to block and stop the coalition from being able to implement our policies should we win a mandate from the Australian people later this year.


Such is the contempt of the Greens for the views of the majority of Australians that they are not willing to let the coalition go to the election with our policies and see whether the people endorse us, elect us to government and endorse our policies in that process. They want to take pre-emptive action before the election to close the door on the coalition's ability to implement those policies. This is obviously a taste and a sign, should we succeed later this year, for just how obstructionist the Greens will be, for just how destructive the Greens will be, for just what lengths the Greens will go to to try to block and harass the coalition in the application of our policies.


We have grave concerns at the approach of the Greens in introducing these amendments. They would lock into law existing duplication, which I assessed and commented on earlier in this debate, and which Deloitte Access Economics have identified as costing around $1.19 billion in excessive duplication of bureaucracy that we have at a state and federal level around environmental approvals. The coalition believes there must be a better way when it comes to environmental approvals. We want to uphold the highest standards, we want to uphold the very important matters of national environmental significance that are contained in the EPBC Act, which we brought into law when we were in government. Our commitment to those standards is in no way under any doubt because those standards were identified in laws that the Howard government passed. But those laws provided for the capacity to say that we should be able to align assessments and approvals processes at a state and federal level and, in doing so, remove the excessive duplication. The Greens amendments would seek to strip out that capacity to align those assessment and approvals processes.


I trust that the government, despite their complete flip-flopping on this important issue of reducing green-tape regulation, will support the coalition in opposing the Greens amendments. I hope the government will show just a scintilla of support for the judgement of the Australian people later this year when it comes to whether or not the coalition should be in a position to implement its policies. I hope the government does that because, of course, it was the government's own policy. Just a year ago the government was proposing to do, through the COAG processes, exactly the same thing. The Prime Minister said, back in 2012 when it was the government's policy:


Today COAG acted on that concern—


Concerns around duplication and costs—


and the Gillard Government and states and territories agreed to fast track arrangements to use state assessment and approval processes by March 2013.


Instead of delivering on that commitment made at the start of 2012—and why would we expect Prime Minister to deliver on a commitment when all she does is routinely break them?—the government, by the end of 2012, had abandoned it completely. They abandoned it so much that already built into this legislation is a limitation on the future operation of one-stop shops insofar as the new water trigger applies. If the Greens got their way, and if the government were reckless enough to support them, we would see a complete blockage on one-stop shops.


Lastly, the Greens propose another remarkable amendment completely unrelated to the bill before the Senate. This amendment would put in place a new section to the EPBC Act relating to national parks. It would add another five pages of legislation relating to how activities in national parks can be governed. This of course is a knee-jerk reaction of the Greens to decisions being made, justifiably, rightly, by state governments. Once again, the Greens want to tear up a century of federalism in this place. The Greens want to tear up the understanding of where responsibility lies in the Commonwealth for different activities and provide a whole new swathe of powers to give the Commonwealth minister capacity to encroach upon the activities of the states and the right of the states to govern their own national parks and to make their own determinations about land use.


These amendments once again have nothing to do with coal seam gas, nothing to do with large coal development and nothing to do with water resources. Nonetheless, the Greens seek, with no consultation, no opportunity for comment by anybody, to at the last minute bolt on to the legislation before the chamber, and simply sneak through, dramatic new changes to our laws. Again, the coalition rejects these efforts of the Greens.


In closing, I urge the government to allow a proper debate on these Greens amendments around national parks, because I know there are colleagues who want to have a contribution. Because the Greens have done these amendments all together, I have only been able to say a couple of words on them. But these are significant changes and they deserve to be properly debated, not gagged. (Time expired)

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (10:42):  The purpose of the bill is to enable the Commonwealth environment minister to take into account significant impacts of coal seam gas and large coal-mining developments on a water resource—that is, the bill provides for a water trigger. There are a range of amendments being proposed on a range of issues. The government does not support amendments that would broaden the scope of this bill. The proposed amendments are very broad. The government advice is that, because these amendments are so broad, they carry a high level of constitutional risk. I move:


That the question be now put.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that the question now be put.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Waters, you asked that we divide separately on the three remaining blocks of amendments, which were taken together by leave. I see no need to divide the question as the government and the opposition during the course of the debate have indicated that they will be voting against. So, unless the Greens have a different position on any of the amendments, I intend to put them all as one block.

The CHAIRMAN:  You sought leave to have the three groups of amendments taken together, which was granted by the chamber. Precedent is that, unless there will be a different division on these amendments, they will be put together. It is at the discretion of the chair, and that is the way I rule.

Amendment (1) on sheet 7374, which would remove bilateral agreements from consideration, is inconsistent with the fact that amendment (1) on 7394 actually contains provisions that would allow for bilateral agreements to apply. So there is a level of internal inconsistency between them that may create a problem—

Senator WATERS:
  Thank you, Chair. I wanted to seek your guidance. When I asked that the amendments be moved together, I did specifically twice say that the vote be put separately, and I understand leave was granted on that basis or I would not have moved them together. So I just ask that we continue on that basis.



The CHAIRMAN:  I was not in the chair at the time. Leave was sought to have them all taken together, which was granted. You did indicate, which is why I raised the point prior to putting this motion, that you would like the three motions voted upon separately. Normally that would happen if there were an indication there was going to be different outcomes on different votes. At this stage, the government and the opposition have indicated that they will be opposing all three groups of amendments. So, unless the Greens are going to be voting differently on any of the amendments, I do intend to put them together.

It is the prerogative of people moving amendments to have them voted on separately, and that has been the request. Are you setting a precedent in this chamber that you will collectivise every amendment in this way? This would be an extraordinary precedent to set. I request that we vote for them separately.

The CHAIRMAN:  First and foremost, this is totally at the discretion of the chair—that is the first and foremost point. Secondly, I am following precedent and advice from the Clerk. Thirdly, the only matter for which leave was sought from the chamber was to take the amendments together. Leave cannot be sought as to how we divide and vote on matters concerning the bracket and the way the vote will be taken. So it is my decision that we will take them together.

  I raise a point of order, Mr Chairman, about the behaviour of the Leader of the Australian Greens. When you called that division, the Leader of the Australian Greens, in a very loud voice—I suspect you may not have heard it, Mr Chairman, because of other noise—made a direct reference to you, suggesting bias. Her words were along the lines of, 'This is the sort of biased treatment we can expect in the future.' She then issued a threat against you. I ask you to ask the senator to withdraw those reflections and that threat.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  On the point of order, Mr Chairman: I reject the assertion made by Senator Macdonald. Numerous conversations take place in this chamber. One of them on that side of the chamber, which I heard, included a slur about our leader. If you want to start going tit for tat, we can do that.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:12):  The motion that the report be adopted is a crucial part of the whole debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill. We are reluctant to adopt the report from the committee because there has not been sufficient debate on the bill. I particularly am concerned that I was not given the opportunity of saying a few words on the amendment proposed by the Greens political party which would have had the effect of giving the Commonwealth minister the power to override the Queensland government in the management of its national parks and in particular the decision made by the Queensland government to allow starving cattle into Queensland national parks in an attempt to overcome an animal catastrophe, an animal welfare issue of horrendous proportions. 


This is a bill which has incensed every Queenslander, and as a senator representing the state of Queensland I believe I should have had the opportunity of at least debating the bill. Instead, it was guillotined on the motion of the Greens political party. I can remember sitting in this chamber for hour upon hour listing to the Greens political party rail against even the very moderate use of guillotines by the Howard government. For example, the regional forest agreement debate went for some 36 hours, kept going by the leader of the Greens political party simply repeating himself. When the Howard government moved to curtail the debate, after 36 hours of repetition, we then had hours more of the Greens saying how awful it was to curtail a debate after 36 hours. 


You and I, Mr Acting Deputy President Furner, as representatives of the state of Queensland, have a vital interest in this amendment dealing with Commonwealth control of state national parks. Were we given the opportunity to discuss it, to put forward the views of our constituents or to put forward the view of the RSPCA in Queensland, who thought it was a good idea? The Greens political party claim to be interested in animal welfare, but they would have 300,000 cattle in Queensland die a horrible death from starvation because they want to prevent them from using the limited grass that is available in some Queensland national parks.


This amendment moved by the Greens has nothing to do with the substantive part of the bill we were discussing—nothing to do with coal seam gas, the protection of water or care for the aquifers; nothing to do with that. But, here, tacked on, in a very tacky way, in the proposed amendments on sheet of 7394 the Greens political party have raised this issue of the declaration of national parks. Had these amendments been carried, they would have given the Commonwealth minister the power to override the Queensland minister and the Queensland government in that area, where a very sensible decision was made to allow starving cattle access to the limited food available in national parks. Yet, on this matter, we were not given the opportunity to say one word. Senator Birmingham had about 15 minutes to traverse a series of complicated amendments. That was all that was allowed. Then we saw the Greens political party move the guillotine, the gag, to stop debate on this most important issue.


However, I do not want to hold up the chamber any further. I understand we have a lot to discuss. I see I have 15 minutes left. I know that my colleague Senator Back would like to say a few words on the same subject and on the proposed amendment to the bill. But I make this point in all good faith. I could say a lot more in the 14 minutes or so I have left to address my other issues, but in consideration of the procedures of the Senate and because my colleague Senator Back wants to say a few words, I am going to sit down before my time is up. But I do hope that the guillotining frenzy of the Labor Party and the Greens will not apply at least for the next 14 minutes so that my colleagues have the opportunity of saying a few words on this very important issue.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:17):  It is extremely important to understand that in a short period of time the EPBC Act will have a water trigger and that that is supported by the coalition. This belies the story that has been peddled around in many areas that the coalition do not support the water trigger; we do. This matter has been held up for such a long period of time now for a whole range of reasons, but most importantly because the Greens have been frolicking with amendments that never had a snowflake's chance of ever getting up. They dealt with them for divisive purposes. They have never really properly prosecuted the argument. They have not properly lobbied people about them; they never do. The first we ever hear about most of these things is when they appear in the chamber. It has been clearly said throughout the New England area and in so many other areas, and around southern Queensland—peddled by Independents and the Greens—that the coalition do not support the water trigger. In a very short period of time, it will be legislation and it is supported by the coalition. That needs to be clearly put on the record.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:19):  Briefly, I rise firstly to support the comments of Senator Macdonald, who spoke so eloquently about the starving cattle in North Queensland and other places in Queensland. And I have spoken about this openly and frequently in Queensland and other places. There is no need for that cattle to be there in the first place. The heavily pregnant cows are about to calve. Their calves from last year should be being prepared now for sale and those from two years ago should have long gone. The important point to be made here is that so many of the national parks, which the graziers and the pastoralists requested be opened and whose request the Queensland state government approved—and I do hope Minister Burke will see the value in the matter—were in fact cattle stations. They are rich in buffel grass and species introduced specifically for cattle-grazing purposes. The perverse irony here is that if they are not opened that buffel grass will dry off and burn, and many of the environmental assets in those parks will be destroyed by the burning.


In the few moments allowed to me, I want to make some points. It is interesting that this amendment debate was gagged by the Greens or they joined in support of the gag in gagging their own amendment, something I find remarkable. I want to place on the record the circumstance of Western Australia, as a Western Australian senator in this. Whilst we recognise, as Senator Joyce said, that the coalition will be supporting the water trigger, the point is that these issues are principally confined to the eastern seaboard, particularly Queensland and New South Wales. Western Australia is not commercially prospective for coal seam gas, but we did view these amendments with concern. 


In the lead-up to the introduction of the amendments, the Commonwealth established the independent expert scientific committee to review coal seam gas and large coalmining deposits. Western Australia is not a signatory to the national partnership agreement that established the IESC. Western Australia views this as yet another imposition, another layer of regulatory approvals, over existing, comprehensive state regulatory arrangements in Western Australia. I use this opportunity to refute the comments that were made here by another Western Australian Greens senator, Senator Ludlam, in which he condemned Western Australia and its environmental processes.


It is a relief to us in Western Australia that this amendment has gone down. The IESC and the proposed amendments would only have served to increase delays and uncertainty, to encourage a lack of confidence in state processes in Western Australia and ultimately—and most importantly—to undermine the credentials of the state's Environmental Protection Authority. This is an organisation that I have had a long association with in different aspects of my professional career in Western Australia, and I have always found the EPA to be independent, to be fair and to be very, very serious in its approach. Representations that we made in my time as a chief executive officer of a state instrumentality were often rejected by the EPA. Therefore, we see it as a very severe issue that the Commonwealth would have the capacity to walk in and, for no reason, overrule it.


In the case of Western Australia, it is not coal seam gas but shale oil and shale gas that is very much the area of concern. I want to place on record that the WA government has a strong regulatory framework for commercial gas extraction, from deep shale and so-called tight rock formations, especially where hydraulic fracture stimulation—or fracking, as it is known—is involved. Those listening may be interested to know that fracking has safely been used in the Western Australian mining and extractive industries for some 55 years, since 1958, with no—I repeat: no—adverse effects on the environment, on water sources or indeed on the health of the communities in their vicinity. 


I again comment on the statements made by Senator Ludlam yesterday in which he called into question the transparency of information regarding fracking chemicals. I say this, and I say it proudly: in Western Australia, we have the strongest chemical disclosure requirements of any Australian jurisdiction; we have rigorous environmental and safety approval processes; and we have international standards for well design and integrity. It is not acceptable for any senator, let alone one from our own state, to stand up and deny that to be the fact. I would urge that the Western Australian standards be scrutinised nationally to establish that what I have said is the case and, if it is the case, let them become the benchmark for other state jurisdictions.


We have a very robust regulatory regime in Western Australia. We have an independent environmental protection authority. It is for that reason Western Australia coalition senators and, I am pleased to see, their Labor colleagues voted down that particular amendment.


I conclude by reflecting on the potential value of the shale oil industry not only for WA but also for the nation generally. It would appear once again that we have amongst the highest levels of shale gas reserves anywhere in the world. We already see that, in the United States of America, shale oil and shale gas in particular are now being extracted and, most importantly, we see a resurgence of manufacturing in the United States as the Americans bring back onshore, to continental USA, much of the manufacturing that they had outsourced to other countries. How wonderful it is, when their manufacturing industries were suffering so severely, with so much criticism that everything was going offshore, that now, because of cheaper energy, they actually have the capacity to bring their manufacturing back onshore.


Of course, we have all spoken in this debate about environmental safety, community safety and health and wellbeing. But I say again: we have the safeguards in place. I look forward to the extraction of shale gas being the next area in which Western Australia will not only advance as a state but also be able to make its contribution to the national economy.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2013-06-19,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (12:45):  I have spoken previously in this place about the National Year of Reading 2012 and the importance of encouraging children to read, and I was really proud to serve as a national ambassador for this program along with great Australian icons such as William McInnes, Anh Do and Jennifer Byrne. The National Year of Reading was started by a national network of libraries and it linked together all the great things happening around Australia promoting books, literacy and a love of reading. That campaign was a resounding success. I have a few statistics to demonstrate how successful it was. The National Year of Reading received $1.7 million in funding, including $1.3 million from the Gillard government. From this, it leveraged $5.6 million of in-kind support and media coverage, with an estimated value of $26 million. That is roughly $20 of value for every dollar invested. More than 4,000 events were held across Australia and the campaign had 12,000 online followers and 200,000 participants.


Now that the National Year of Reading is over, the national network of libraries that started this campaign have decided to continue it with the Love2Read campaign. Both campaigns were motivated by an Australian Bureau of Statistics report entitled the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey, or ALLS. The report found that 46 per cent of Australians lacked the literacy skills needed to perform fully in life and work. In Tasmania, my home state, the figure is 49 per cent, the worst performance of all the states and territories, and an outcome that I am very keen to work to address. Having literacy skills at this level can mean facing difficulty in important day-to-day tasks like reading a newspaper or making sense of bus timetables. But it is hard to see whether these figures have improved.


The ALLS has been superseded by the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies, which in 2011-12 found that the number of Australians aged 15 to 74 with literacy skills below the level needed to fully function in life and work had fallen slightly to 44 per cent. However, the ABS cautions that the data from ALLS is not directly comparable with the data from this survey. Still, this is a disappointing result and one that as a nation we have to work hard to improve.


The overwhelming majority of Australian adults can read and write, but it is a question of whether their literacy skills are adequate for the most basic day-to-day challenges life throws at them. While adult literacy is important, we know that we can deliver the best outcomes by developing literacy skills early, especially in childhood. An important part of this is encouraging a love of reading, which we can achieve through our schools, through our public libraries, in the home and in many other settings. Research shows that young children who are read to regularly by family members develop literacy skills long before they are able to read, and they also experience emotional and mental benefits. Developing literacy skills confers many other benefits in childhood and later on in life. It is our most important way of acquiring the information we need for our work and day-to-day living. It is our primary source of learning and gaining knowledge. When we read fiction, it helps inspire us and develop our imagination, which sharpens our skills in creative thinking. 


Reading is the foundation of almost every other skill we will attain in life, even the most basic skills of writing, numeracy and critical thinking. That is why I support the Love2Read campaign because it is of such fundamental importance to our society. Love2Read helps to promote not just the practice but the enthusiastic enjoyment of an activity that leads to an essential life skill. Love2Read features several national events that promote the love of reading. 


On 22 May this year, I participated in National Simultaneous Storytime. I read a book to a group of about 20 children at the Learning and Information Network Centre, or LINC, in Rosney on Hobart's eastern shore. I have over a decade of experience as an early childhood educator, so I knew how to involve the children in the activity in a way that was fun and engaging for them, and they certainly were engaged in my reading the story. 


National Simultaneous Storytime aims to encourage young Australians to read and enjoy books, and involves the simultaneous reading at venues across Australia of a well-known children's book. The book chosen this year is Nick Bland's The Wrong Book. When I asked how many children in the group of about 20 knew this book, it was like being a schoolteacher in fact, because all bar about four kids put up their hands. That showed me that either the parents or the childcare educators in these children's lives were actively pursuing reading to them, and I was really happy to see that. The book was chosen to explore age-appropriate themes and address key areas of the national curriculum for grades 1 to 6. The event is now in its 13th year. If you have not read The Wrong Book, I would encourage everyone to take a couple of minutes of their life to read it. National Simultaneous Storytime 2013 was held at 2,300 locations with 410,000 children enjoying the story at the same time.


Another national event is The Reading Hour. The Reading Hour is a series of events and activities held nation-wide, which this year will take place on 24 August. While The Reading Hour is notionally between 6 pm and 7 pm, many events will be held during the day to accommodate venue opening hours or to coincide with other events. The Reading Hour is a campaign aimed at encouraging parents to read to their children for just 10 minutes a day, or roughly one hour a week, and I do not think that is too much to ask of any parent. It also tries to instil in parents the attitude that reading should start at the earliest possible time in a child's development. Most of our brain development happens between birth and the age of three, so we should not just assume that reading is something that happens at school. Parents have a responsibility to read to their kids and to ensure that regular reading is part of their routine.


As a national ambassador for Love2Read I do whatever I can to promote reading. I often read books to children during some of my many visits to local schools in Tasmania; I try to promote Love2Read initiatives through local media; and I donate books as prizes for school fairs and end-of-year school assemblies, and to childcare centres when I visit them. I also attend literacy related events throughout Tasmania.


Just in March this year, I participated in a Rock & Rhyme event, which is an interactive session for parents and/or carers and their babies, at the Kingston LINC, some 500 metres away from my office. Rock & Rhyme is a weekly series of half-hour sessions which include songs, nursery rhymes, stories and music. It promotes listening, memory and vocabulary skills, as well as promoting the bonds between children and their parents. Rock & Rhyme is based on the Canadian Parent-Child Mother Goose Program. It started at the Launceston Lending Library in Hobart, which is now the Launceston LINC, and it has been rolled out state wide and even interstate, and it is getting great support.


Of course, you do not have to be a Love2Read ambassador to promote the joys of reading. As I have mentioned quite a few times already, it is something I really believe we all have a responsibility to do. 


If you are an adult who finds reading challenging, why not enrol in a literacy class? Thanks to the Tasmanian government and some non-government community services, my home state has free adult literacy programs available through LINC Tasmania, the 26TEN grants program and a variety of other providers, including some neighbourhood houses and community centres. The Australian government also provides help to job seekers in developing reading, writing, maths and language skills through the Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education's Language, Literacy and Numeracy Program. It is never too late to enhance your reading skills; and, when you do, you will find that it opens up a whole new world of possibilities. Not only is it useful and educational but it has the added benefit of being fun—not all the time but a lot of the time.


For more information about the Love2Read campaign, I encourage you to visit their website at www.love2read.org.au. The Love2Read website has links to Facebook and Twitter, so those on social media can share their information through that process. For Tasmanians, there is also some fantastic information about adult literacy at www.26ten.tas.gov.au.


We in this place have precious little spare time but, when we do, reading a good book or a newspaper is a great way to fill it. I know that lots of senators and members do take advantage of the time we spend in the air to do some reading, whether it is newspapers, fiction or non-fiction books. I certainly try to read whenever I get the time, and I do encourage every Australian to discover the joys of reading, if they have not already. As a child I lived in the country and did not have access to a library until I was seven years old. When we first moved into the suburbs, one of the first things my mum did was take me to the library, because until then we had only had access to the mobile school library bus. I found it was not much of a detour, walking home from school, to go via that library and I dropped in fairly frequently. I still love going to libraries when I get the chance. 


Obviously, the Parliamentary Library is a very valuable asset to senators and members here, and I am very proud to be on the Joint Standing Committee on the Parliamentary Library. The library has a fiction section as well as a non-fiction section, and there are some brilliant books in there. I would encourage any member or senator who has not been in the Parliamentary Library to go in and support it.


It is really important that we not only enjoy reading for ourselves but share and promote a love of reading at every opportunity. You can set up a reading group if you have the time. You can discuss your favourite books with your friends. I know that in my family we actually share our books and pass them around to other family members. If you are not a member of your local library, as I have said previously, now is the time to join. It is free. I do not understand why any adult, in particular, would not be a member of their local library.


In the last few minutes of this contribution, I reiterate the importance of reading to kids and young people. We cannot overestimate the importance of our involvement in reading to kids, not just as a learning concept—the child learning to read, understanding words and how grammar and those sorts of things work—but also as a bonding process. Even if you do not have children of your own, you must know children, and I would encourage everybody to take the time to read to a small person. It is quite a heart-warming experience. As I said earlier, 10 minutes a day is not a huge ask of a parent—and, once kids start school, it is too late, really, to worry about starting the process of them learning to read. So, if you have kids, read to them. Establish a regular habit of reading; that is really important. I know that when my children, now adults, were very small it was a very important part of their bedtime routine. Lots of parents do that and I think that is a great thing to do, as it is part of relaxing before they go to sleep and brings all those other benefits I have already mentioned. Encourage any other parents you know to do the same. As I said, we all have a part to play in ensuring that everybody, including us, has this essential life skill, because if you cannot read—if you cannot read what is it says on the can in the supermarket, if you cannot read a newspaper, if you cannot read a bus timetable—then life is going to be very difficult. I think, if everybody in this place encouraged people to read and to make sure they can read adequately, we should be able to become a nation of readers very easily.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (15:01):  Mr President, for the information of senators I table additional information on two questions asked of me in the Senate yesterday by Senator Birmingham. I seek leave to have this additional information incorporated into Hansard.


Leave granted.




The answer read as follows—



MINISTER FOR BROADBAND, COMMUNICATIONS AND THE DIGITAL ECONOMY


Senate Question without Notice 18 June 2013




Question No: 1



Senator BIRMINGHAM (South Australia) (14:30): Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Has any reprofiling or adjustment to the planned schedule for the handover of Telstra pits to NBN Co. occurred as a result of asbestos concerns? If so, in which states and on how many sites has this occurred? Again, can the minister indicate on how many sites Telstra has delayed work and whether this has delayed handover of any NBN rollout sites as yet?




Answer:



NBN Co. will not compromise safety for speed. The upgrade of national infrastructure is required. At some point this will involve interaction with material containing asbestos. It is not an issue of stopping the rollout, but ensuring work is done safely and responsibly.


NBN Co is working with the government, the unions, the national health and safety regulator Comcare, and the independent asbestos taskforce to examine closely the asbestos safety regime being applied across all aspects of the rollout.


The steps are unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall rollout timetable. The entire project remains on track to be completed by June 2021. NBN Co is currently assessing what impact these measures may have on the pace of the rollout in the short term.




Question No: 2



Senator BIRMINGHAM (South Australia) (14:32): I thank the minister for taking that aspect of the question on notice. My final supplementary is: has NBN Co. made any changes to the contractual expectations or policies it expects its NBN Co. contractors to adhere to as a result of asbestos concerns? If so, what changes has NBN Co. made in relation to its expectations of its contractors?




Answer:



A new national standard for dealing with asbestos in pit and pipe infrastructure is being developed. Until such time as the new national standard is agreed and the training course is up and running, NBN Co will transfer the important task of handling and removing asbestos in pit and pipe, and disposing of asbestos waste, from its Tier One contractors to specialist asbestos removal firms. This is already happening in the Northern Territory where NBN Co is managing the rollout directly.


From day one of the rollout, NBN Co has required its contractors to develop and implement certified safety management systems, work procedures and detailed safety management plans that are required to be compliant with contractual and legislative requirements.


These include, but are not necessarily limited to:


The Work Health and Safety Act 2011(Cth) and the Work Health and Safety Regulations 2011 (Cth);


Code of Practice on How to Manage and Control Asbestos in the Workplace; and


Code of Practice on How to Safely Remove Asbestos.


NBN Co has implemented a system of regular audits as a means of satisfying itself that its contractors' and their sub-contractors are meeting their legal and regulatory obligations.


To date NBN Co has conducted some 2,947 audits and inspections of its contractors for the purposes of assessing their compliance with health and safety requirements.


NBN Co also implemented a series of additional safety measures.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2013-06-19,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Ludwig) to a question without notice asked by Senator McKenzie today relating to farm finance concessional loans.


If there was ever any doubt about the Labor government's issues and understanding of the regional economy and regional people, we had it on display today. We have had numerous examples: live cattle, the impact of the carbon tax on our food production systems, the dairy industry et cetera. Two months ago, with no consultation with the states, the government announced—like it has done right throughout its history—packages that have financial implications for others and about which it had not sought to actually consult with them before going about the announcement. The government announced the concessional loans at 4.5 per cent. You saw from the minister's answers today, and it could be seen from the evidence given in estimates, that he had no clue what he was actually talking about. I asked the minister a question in good faith during estimates. A 4.5 per cent concessional loan is going to be a significant benefit to our farmers, to the struggling northern cattlemen right across Queensland and the Northern Territory, to the dairy farmers in western Victoria, to the fruit growers in central Victoria and to the WA sheep and wheat farmers, who are all struggling with the realities of farming in this nation. They need this concessional loan. But the 1.5 per cent difference between what the government is setting it at and what the government is lending it out at adds up to $100,000 a year. That money could be going into farmers' pockets if it was not going into consolidated revenue, as was the evidence that was given.


Senator Wong, Treasurer Swan and Prime Minister Gillard are always very keen to quote that revenue is down. But this takes the cake in terms of a new revenue measure, the $6.3 million that will be raised per annum if this differential of 1.5 per cent is applied. As I found out, they have not done the modelling on the administration costs. My understanding is that the typical amount that is allowed for this is around the one per cent mark. But they could not even confirm that during estimates.


This is basically taking money that should be going to farmers and putting it into consolidated revenue. It is actually burdening the states even more, who right now are working very hard at paying back ALP government debt. I might say that there are a few who are working extremely hard and extremely well at that. Victoria was left with $7.9 billion and New South Wales was left with $9.2 billion. They are doing a damn good job of paying it back, but it requires that they stick to their budgets. It requires carefully considered and strategic planning for contingencies. But for this federal government and its poor decision-making you cannot plan.


You cannot plan for the contingency of Joe Ludwig standing up one day and announcing that you are going to have to find additional money in your budget for the administration of the farm concessional loans program and then going on a PR campaign with struggling farmers groups to apply the pressure. We should not have been surprised. That is out of the ALP playbook of the moment in how to treat our states. We can see that if we look at the health funding issues from last year and the Gonski negotiations that we are watching play out right now. Then there is environmental regulation: the Prime Minister stood up and said, 'We're going to streamline all this environmental legislation and work cooperatively with the states.' We all breathed a sigh of relief. Kevin said he was going to end the blame game.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator McKenzie, I let you go the first time when you did not refer correctly to Senator Ludwig and I was going to pull you up at the end. But please refer to members of the other place, ministers and senators by their correct titles.




Senator McKENZIE:
  I apologise, Mr Deputy President. I should know better. Mr Kevin Rudd, when he was Prime Minister, was going to end the blame game between states and the feds, and that has not happened—if anything, it has gotten worse. Prime Minister Gillard saw a jump in the polls late last year when she took the premiers on, and that has become her modus operandi.


This week, we have been trashing and we continue to trash our Federation as the ideology of the Greens and their lack of respect for the place of state governments in our Federation is being subsumed into ALP ideology. We know have a toxic relationship. That relationship needs to be restored so that it functions effectively for all, and especially for those struggling farmers in regional Australia, across every single state. The minister is right that they need access, but you cannot keep expecting state governments to pick up the can for every harebrained idea that you have, because when you actually have a good one they cannot afford to make it happen.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2013-06-19,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (15:07):  I too rise to take note of the answers to Senator McKenzie's questions today in question time. I am a bit perplexed, I have to say, because prior to being in this place I spent quite a long time as a member of the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority and I remember many stories of distressed property owners seeking to have some kind of access to farm finance. Many of those people have welcomed the farm finance package that was announced by the government in April this year. In fact, I am even more confused because I recall that at Senate estimates Senator McKenzie admitted that this was a very good deal. But unlike those others of us who acknowledge that it is a good deal she—like the rest of the National senators here and the National members of parliament—has been very quiet on convincing the states to provide this assistance to farmers.


I spend much of my time in regional New South Wales talking to farmers, farmers' groups, farmers' wives and rural producers of all shapes and forms, and I know that the concessional loans that are being outlined in this package are going to provide breathing space so that people can focus on growing and improving farm businesses. It is pretty unfair that Senator McKenzie has come into this place, supported by her National colleagues, to play mischief with the fact that the delay in all of this is with the state and territory governments. They are the ones who are playing hardball on signing up to this assistance package.


To be perfectly frank, 4.5 per cent is a very good rate. It is a significant loan. In terms of farm management deposits and concessional loans, 4.5 per cent is very good access to the finance supporting our farm businesses. As someone who works with them quite closely, I know that the farming community is pursuing and appreciating these issues, and the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority and the Rural Finance Corporation of Victoria have been meeting to work out the arrangements that will come into place. The starting concessional rate of 4.5 per cent will apply nationally, and it will be reviewed to make sure that it remains relevant. I have to say that any one of us seeking finance for a business enterprise would be very pleased to be able to borrow at that generous rate of 4.5 per cent. It is at least one per cent below what you would get from a commercial lender. It is all about the government's intention to assist in relieving debt pressure and allowing eligible farm businesses to grow and improve.


If you support the concept of a reconstruction bank—as Mr Katter might propose, and I know many people in rural Australia might consider it—then you need to get behind the work that is being done now. A reconstruction bank in the future might deliver something, in Mr Katter's world, but farmers need the money right now. Until our state and territory colleagues get behind this proposal, it is the farmers who will be missing out.


The Farm Finance package includes additional rural financial counsellors. They are the people who are talking to me and asking me to see what can be done to escalate the issue and get these farm packages, these concessional loans, in place. We want this funding to be ready to go from 1 July. That is the week after next. It is our state and territory governments who are playing hooky on this and preventing it from happening. So let's just call it what it is: a stalling tactic by Liberal-National governments. (Time expired)

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (15:12):  I have to say that was a very disappointing presentation by Senator Stephens. I think—and I think Senator McKenzie sees this too—that she misrepresented the situation in her contribution. I was present when Senator McKenzie was asking questions at both the DAFF estimates and the Treasury estimates as part of this process, and Senator McKenzie, along with the rest of us, has cause to be concerned about the way the government has approached this particular measure.


Let's take the way that the measure was started. On 27 April, Minister Ludwig writes to the states, without any prior consultation, and tells them in the letter that they will be responsible for administering the loans, for applicant assessment costs, application processing costs and delivery of the loans. No consultation and no discussion—'You're paying the bill.' That is the way that this government has approached this process. We start asking questions at DAFF estimates, some time later, about this particular measure, and Minister Ludwig says, 'But I've written to the states again to tell them what the details of the loans, the conditions of the loans, were.' So we ask when he wrote to the states. The answer is 'last Friday'. He is trying to blame the states for slowing the process down, which happened because they did not understand the terms and conditions of the loans, they did not know the interest rates, until that letter went to them, on 24 May—almost a month after his initial letter went out to the states advising them of the package that was going to be launched. So a month later he writes to them and tells them that the rate will be 4.5 per cent and that, at the end of five years, it will revert to commercial rates. So they are not 4.5 per cent across the life of the loan; we accept that 4.5 per cent is a good deal for farmers, but the rates are 4.5 per cent for a period of time, five years, then they revert to commercial rates.


You talk to the banks and they had no idea this was coming. How did these loans interact with their existing loans? Were they on top of existing debt? Did they replace existing debt? The banks did not know that. Senator Stephens talks about the rural financial counsellors. I was talking to rural financial counsellors only weeks prior to this announcement: they did not even know if their funding was going to be continued, let alone if there would be new rural financial counsellors. They found that out when Senator Ludwig's press release came out to advise them of this magnificent new package. There was no consultation with any of the stakeholders in this process, yet now the minister expects the states to pick up the bill when they find out that the Commonwealth is making $6.3 million a year on the interest rate. Don't you think it is reasonable that they might ask a question about that?


Minister Ludwig, Senator Stephens and, I am sure, others on the other side will try and blame all the Liberal states. How come none of the Labor states have signed up? What about the Tasmanian government? They have not signed up. What about the South Australian government? They have not signed up. I have a joint statement from New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia: 'The Commonwealth should not profit from farm loans'—and yet we know that it is.


We asked at estimates about the numbers in the budget and we were told as part of that process that they were effectively the opportunity cost of the loans. The numbers in the budget, we were told at estimates, were the opportunity cost of the loans. Yet we now find out that the Commonwealth is making $6.3 million a year on the interest rate. So how is the calculation of the interest rate of the opportunity cost made? The officer quite correctly said, 'I'm not an accountant, but I'm happy to provide the details.' We have not received any of that back yet from the government. We have not received any answers to questions on notice from estimates yet, so we do not have that information. We do not know how the calculation of the opportunity cost has been made in the budget. I would seriously love to see the answer.


As Senator McKenzie quite rightly said, this is indicative of the way that this government has treated agriculture. The budget for the portfolio used to be $3.8 billion; it is now only $1.6 billion. This portfolio has been hollowed out. I put on the record that part of that was EC payments, but this issue is indicative of how the government continues to treat agriculture and the states.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2013-06-19,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (15:17):  I rise to take note of answers from Minister Ludwig on the issue of assistance for farmers. Our government has a plan for Australian agriculture. Contrary to what we have heard from the other side, this plan was brought to life in the last federal budget delivered by our government. That was an investment of $1.9 billion in our farmers and our food. Part of that was a plan for agriculture that will include a whole range of people: farmers, fishers, foresters, industry leaders, researchers and officials. The aim of that is to ensure that Australian agriculture can continue to grow from strength to strength into the future.


We know that, while many are able to succeed in agriculture, not everyone is feeling the benefits of this strong economy. I absolutely welcome the opportunity to speak about the government's Farm Finance package. In April, $420 million in concessional loans for farmers was announced, particularly for those farmers doing it tough. There are lots of reasons why farmers are doing it tough. There are lots of fires; there are droughts; there is the high dollar—there are a whole range of issues as to why farmers in this country are doing it tough. Even viable operations are still struggling under the weight of that high dollar and, of course, reduced land values and other issues. But we have listened to the concerns of the farmers.


That is why this government announced that Farm Finance package. The package is one of concessional loans that give farmers breathing space so that they have time to focus on growing and improving their own farm businesses. They are a relief for the farmers. That is what the loans are; they are to provide relief for farmers in a tough time. Eligible farm businesses can save anywhere around $100,000 if they want to consolidate an existing loan. Our plan for agriculture is to assist our farmers and strengthen the foundation for them to be able to tackle debt head on.


But this support requires cooperation and partnership with the states. We want the state and territory governments to make the loan products available across the country as soon as possible so that the farmers can access the assistance they need at a time when everything is tough for them. The state governments have the infrastructure and the expertise on the ground to do this. However, as yet they have been very slow coming to the table. The only contribution we have asked them to make in this agreement is to deliver the loans and cover the administrative costs. It is not a huge ask for the states to come forward and provide this assistance for the farmers, who are doing it tough for many reasons. This is real money for our farmers. It is about real money to assist them in the process of getting on with the business they are out there doing every day, which is to grow product, wheat, sheep, beef or whatever it is they grow. This is about helping them.


As my colleague Senator Stephens indicated, the starting concessional rate is set at 4.5 per cent, and that would apply nationally. That is a very reasonable rate—of course, it is going to be reviewed, but it is a reasonable rate. We are bearing the entire risk of these loans. The government is doing this to assist people when times are tough. Our No. 1 priority for farmers is to get this rolling, and to do this we need to have the state governments onside to make sure we get this out to those who need it most. We know there are lots of benefits in this.


The farm finance consists of four measures: concessional loans to help restructure debt and invest in productivity; additional rural finance counsellors to work directly with farm businesses; progressing a nationally consistent approach to debt mediation; and to enhance the Farm Management Deposits Scheme— (Time expired)

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (15:22):  I, too, rise to take note of answers given by Senator Ludwig to questions from Senator McKenzie and to the responses we have heard from senators Urquhart and Stephens. Regarding the comment about the 4.5 per cent loan being at a reasonable interest rate, I do not think anyone is disagreeing with this. But this is actually not the point. The point raised is that 4.5 per cent is actually 1.5 per cent over the interest rate at which the government can borrow this money. So we have a situation where the federal government are crowing about helping out our farmers by providing them with concessional loans, while they are actually profiting from it. That is the crux of the issue. It is about profiteering on something. They have gone out there and made it sound like they are jolly good chaps because they have put these concessional loans in place, but it is really just a revenue measure. Those opposite then have the audacity to say that it is the fault of the state and territory governments for not taking this up. But it is they who have been left with the actual cost and expense of administering these loans, while the federal government are making money out of it. I think this shows extraordinary hypocrisy and it is something the government need to be called to account on. It is a complete and utter outrage.


The other thing Senator Urquhart crowed about is the fact that it is a plan for farming and a strong economy. When you announce a policy there are two things you do: you announce it so that people know what you are doing and then you have to put the policy implements and actions in place to support the policies. But, when it comes to agriculture across the whole of Australia and how this government is dealing with our primary producers, what we seem to be seeing is that they talk about lots of things. They talk about things like the national food plan. They talk about Australia being the food bowl of the world. They talk about the Asian century and the opportunities that this all gives to our farmers and to our country. But at the exact same time as they are out there trying to convince people that they are the party looking after rural and regional Australia they are enacting other policy mechanisms and instruments that are destroying our agricultural and farming sectors. We have heard time and time again about the impacts of the knee-jerk reaction of the government to the live exports situation. We have heard time and time again about the implications on the sovereign risk of this country from the reaction to the Margiris, the ship that had legitimately collected fishing quotas—but, no, the government decided on a knee-jerk reaction from a GetUp! campaign that this particular thing could not go ahead.


The government talk about cost recovery. This is another example of the government saying, on one hand, 'Yes, we're going to do all these wonderful things to assist our farming and agricultural sectors,' but on the other hand taking the money back. They are clawing back and putting things in place that are detrimental to or an encumbrance on our farming sector. The AQIS cost-recovery situation and charges we have been talking about in this place recently is a classic example. When we went to cost recovery there was supposed to be a suite of cost-saving measures that went with it, but we have gone to cost recovery and have not seen any of the cost-saving measures.


I say to the government: if you are going to announce these sorts of policies and talk about how you are supporting rural and regional Australia, you cannot just say it; you have to do it, too. Talking the talk does not pass muster; you have to be able to walk the walk. Unfortunately, this suite of packages to which the questions are referring today is just another classic example of talking the talk and not putting the things in place that will enable these sorts of projects to be implemented.


Back to the states: the states have been asked to implement these projects, but none of the states, apart from Queensland, had in place a mechanism by which they could deliver the money to the farmers. Now we have big brother, the federal government, smacking the state governments because they have not done something that the government thought was a great idea, but the government did not give the states the time and did not consult with them. The states had no capacity whatsoever to deliver this package because they did not have the things in place.


This is a real outrage. I also take offence at concessional loans on the basis that they are just bandaids on the cuts that have been inflicted on the rural sector by this government. Let us stop sticking bandaids on things. Let us stop making the cuts in the first place. Let us address rural and regional policy so that we can give the opportunity to our rural sector to be successful, instead of just propping it up by these pathetic means.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-06-19,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:51):  In one of the more difficult times for dealing with such a contentious issue as a constitutional referendum, when people are rightly questioning and wanting to make sure that they get a fair hearing and have the capacity to ensure that the views that they earnestly hold are able to be ventilated in a way that is not inhibited to an extent by problems of the other side, it is very important that fair funding is given to both sides of the debate. It was a disappointing but great surprise to me when I found out on Monday that the two sides to this issue had vastly different access to resources to mount their cases. 


It might be that the circumstances of next week mean that there is no referendum. If Mr Rudd challenges Ms Gillard, as we believe he is going to, and becomes the new Prime Minister and we go off to an early election we will not get to the prescribed period. You then have to ask the question: what is going to happen to the $75 million or so that was put aside for this referendum? Or will that be another fiasco of this current government? But on the presumption that this manic approach to this referendum is pursued then there has to be a fair capacity for both sides to engage with the Australian people on their well-held views as to why there should or should not be support for this referendum.


It is also worth noting that at a time when the contentious views for and against this referendum can live happily side by side in the same chamber and at a time when the Taliban is negotiating with the United States, we still cannot get a proper negotiation between Ms Gillard and Mr Rudd as to who will be the Prime Minister of Australia. Why that is pertinent to this is that it is extremely relevant to this referendum and how it goes. If we head to an election early then there is no need for any money because we will not have the proper passage as prescribed by section 126 of the Constitution.


In making sure that we have a vessel to hold the funds for the yes and the no cases, we need proper and transparent mechanisms to ensure that organisations on both sides have the capacity to be audited so that when the funds turn up we feel they are going to the appropriate purpose. That would stand to reason. We also acknowledge that in the constitutional referendum debate there were two well-established camps—the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy and the Australian Republican Movement. They both had well-respected organisations where money could be delivered and spent. But, most importantly, they each received equal funding. So I think it is incumbent somewhat upon the government that on the delivery of an organisation that passes the audit test for the no case—and that is a hair's-breadth away; it could happen tomorrow or tonight or it might already have happened, I am not sure—there should be parity of funding between the two. Otherwise you will build up a natural form of suspicion amongst the Australian people as to exactly where this funding is going.


For me, the overwhelming frustration is that the local government representatives who have been continuously, one after the other, coming into my office are really talking to the wrong person—because I am on side. They have to start lobbying the people who are not on side. Convincing me of a requirement I agree with is probably a waste of time. But I am happy to see them anyway. I think it is extremely pertinent that one of them said, 'This issue only raised itself up in the last couple of days.' I said, 'No, this issue has been on the boil for about a year.' In fact, one of my good staff members, Samantha, informed me that it has been going for longer than that. That just goes to show that the transparency and ventilation of the debate is not wide. If those in the centre of the debate do not know about it, then what hope do we have for those on the periphery of the debate? What hope do we have for those in Johnson Street, Smith Street or Betty Street knowing about the debate? We know what happens if they do not. If there is a sense of suspicion or they do not have a complete comprehension of the issues, they will do what most people do—when in doubt, vote out.


If we want to succeed with this—and obviously I am pushing the barrow that I want it to succeed—then we have to have four things. We have to have a diligent process, which is not in place. We have to have time, which we do not have. We have to have key stakeholders on side, which are not there. And we have to have a sense of fairness. If there is not a sense of fairness in the delivery of the proposition then people will think—and most of the time they would be right—that there is something tricky going on and they will move away from it. For the yes case to prevail, I plead that the no case be equally funded because it helps both cases.


I have said that I want a referendum to win on its merits, not on its finances. The merits of the case will be well thought out with well-instructed camps from both sides. You will have two different views within this chamber. You will have state governments that are overwhelmingly against it and you will have local governments that are overwhelmingly for it. In that environment, the nation will go to a referendum on the same day as an election that will be sucking the oxygen out of any possible ventilation of this issue.


This also goes back to the fact that supporting a case on either side is going to require a campaign like anything else. Just as there are 150 seats that will determine the outcome at a general election, there are 150 seats that have to be lobbied and that have to participate in the appropriate politics throughout the nation for the referendum. For that process and coordination to take place, it is going to require substantial funds. It will require substantial funds just to get one mail-out to one electorate. If you are looking at 110,000 to 120,000 voters in an electorate, it is going to cost you around $110,000 or $120,000. When you think of the cost of an envelope, a stamp and the other bits and pieces that go with it and the content, you would be doing very well to get out of it for less than a dollar a letter. That means that, with the $500,000 there at the moment, you would probably get about four electorates done, and there are 150 electorates. This is where the costs rack up. Any person who has ever been engaged in a marginal campaign will understand that concept perfectly well, will understand the actual cost of running a campaign.


The people whose views are evolving now on both sides of the debate seem to be people who are immensely decent and driven by views that are ardent but well thought out, including former Senator Nick Minchin and others for the no case and other people for the yes case. It would seem peculiar that I would stand up and say this, but I think it is a vitally important issue. The Australian people will naturally be suspicious if they think the fix is on. They have an inherent desire to always support the underdog. Especially of late, they have held that the verdicts—(Time expired)

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2013-06-19,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (16:01):  I rise to make a contribution to this discussion and perhaps to put on record a few of the facts of the matter. The department of local government is funding a $10 million non-partisan civics education campaign to ensure that people are fully informed of the basis of the amendment to the Constitution. Further, the Electoral Commission will spend approximately $40 million on preparing for the referendum. This includes disseminating the official yes/no campaign pamphlet drafted by the parliament. The Electoral Commission will also develop referendum-specific advertising, particularly dealing with informing electors how to cast a formal vote. The partisan funding campaigns, totalling $10.5 million, will form only a small part of the overall information going to voters on the proposal. 


It is the government’s prerogative to fund campaigns. Contrary to Senator Brandis’s comments, it has always been the prerogative of the government whether, how and how much to fund partisan campaigns. This is separate from the official yes/no pamphlet. Mr Howard may well have equally split costs for campaigns, but at no point did he concede this was anything other than a decision of the government. And, importantly, members have voted in the House 133 to two in favour of including local government in the Constitution, and this should affect the funding. 


Any voter or anyone interested in this matter, upon making a cursory investigation, will find some excellent resource work done by the Local Government Association of South Australia, in a very interesting document entitled 'Referendum myths':




Myth 1:  This is Julia Gillard’s referendum.



This referendum is the result of six years of work by Local Government through the Australian Local Government Association (ALGA). The concept was agreed formally in documents signed by the Greens and Independents as a part of arrangements to secure Government in 2010. An expert panel considered it in 2011 and a Parliamentary Select Committee set up in 2012 recommended it. Opposition Leader Tony Abbott and Nationals Leader Barnaby Joyce have publicly supported it since 2011.




Myth 2: This referendum has been rushed.



After significant preliminary work the ALGA ran a Summit in Melbourne in 2008. Following the Pape case in the High Court in 2009 the ALGA formalised its position aimed at securing funding for communities through Councils. The LGA of SA formally endorsed the proposed wording change recommended by Professor George Williams in October, 2010 and all 68 SA Councils formally endorsed this position in the first half of 2011. Opposition Leader Tony Abbott and Nationals Leader Barnaby Joyce gave a commitment to support financial recognition of Local Government in 2011 at the ALGA Conference in 2011.




Myth 3: There is no need for this referendum. 



Specific legal advice indicates that since the Pape case in 2009, the High Court has no support for direct funding of Local Government. Programs such as the Howard Government’s “Roads to Recovery” program (worth $28m a year to SA communities) will fall at the slightest challenge. Even if not challenged directly, no Commonwealth agency will now recommend a direct funding model for fear it will be challenged.




Myth 4: The referendum is about “recognising” Local Government and entrenching it as a level of government.



No, this is about financial recognition. The ALGA sought specific legal advice in order to craft an amendment to the Constitution which would address the direct funding problem but not open the confusion surrounding the 1974 and 1988 referenda. The advice indicated that our objective could be achieved by amending Section 96 of the Constitution (a funding section). The High Court has previously found that Section 96 provides no power to make laws. As a result of the change, the Federal Government will only be able to offer funding to Councils, which may be refused. Indeed our advice is that the State, if it wished, would be able to prevent Councils receiving funding by passing laws to that effect.




Myth 5: It is a power grab by Canberra to control local Councils.




Through this amendment, the Commonwealth can not make laws about Local Government. The amendment makes clear that Local Government is created by, and accountable to State Parliaments. Indeed subject to requirements of State Constitutions, State Parliaments will continue to have the power to abolish Local Government without recourse to the Commonwealth. Myth 6: The Coalition is opposed to recognising Local Government in the Constitution. 


There is bipartisan support for this referendum.


The vote was 133 to two in the House, so there is clearly bipartisan support for this referendum. The document continues:


Prior to the Hawke referendum of 1988, the Liberal Party adopted a position in support of recognising Local Government in the constitution—through a committee chaired by Bob Katter Senior. Liberal Leader Tony Abbott and Nationals Leader Barnaby Joyce have indicated their strong support for confirming the power of the Commonwealth to fund Councils directly as in the Howard initiated Roads to Recovery Program. Both gave a clear commitment to recognition in front of 900 Council delegates at the ALGA National General Assembly in 2011.




Myth 7: This question has been rejected twice before by the public
.


It's 
the same question as posed in 1974 and 1988. 



In 1974 the Whitlam referendum proposed amending Section 51 of the Constitution—the Commonwealth's law-making powers. In 1988 the Hawke referendum proposed establishing a new section in the Constitution to recognize Local Government. Both created confusion about the extent of the change being sought and both were proposed by the Commonwealth. The current referendum has been sought and designed by Local Government only to confirm Federal funding powers.


There you have a very salient case put by the Local Government Association of South Australia, an organisation representative of the councils of South Australia. This question is wholly supported by all those councils. It is very clear that there is a lot of political mischief being played in this argument. I have been receiving emails quoting amounts of funding that I have no evidence to suggest are the actual amounts. I have received considerable numbers of emails that appear to be based on misinformation. They are consistent in form. The only thing that changes is the name and the address at the bottom, although you may get six of them at one time from the same address.


It appears as if, as usual, there is a touch of political mischief afoot, with people taking any opportunity to muddy the waters and malign the motives of those who are pressing forward with a fairly modest agreed position. The Local Government Association of South Australia say that all 68 of their councils are in agreement. I enjoyed a very fine meal with a number of mayors from South Australia on Sunday night. I detected no antipathy towards this proposal. In fact, it appeared as if they were going to get on with the job and disseminate the information necessary, Senator Joyce has said, to get the convincing position for the affirmative supported. That is going to be a matter for the electors, but the facts are quite clear.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:11):  Thank you, Senator Gallacher, for your contribution, but I think you spent about the first minute actually addressing the subject matter of the MPI—the failure of the Gillard government to commit to equal resources for a yes case and a no case for the proposed referendum question on the Constitution and local government—and the remainder of your time arguing for the yes case. I guess that is your prerogative, but that is quite a separate issue to the matter that we have raised here today. Senator Gallacher said—and this was about the extent to which he got into it—that the funding should reflect the vote in parliament. If he is correct, I think that would have very interesting results for all other areas of government funding, when you look at the proportionality of the votes that take place here. Senator Gallacher pointed to the $10.5 million that has been allocated by the government for the partisan campaigns. He said that all the rest would be equal—the yes/no booklet and all that would be funded equally. But the $10.5 million is the partisan part, and that is where the disproportionality exist.


The decision to disproportionately fund the yes and no campaigns and the extent to which it will be done is undoubtedly one of the most extraordinarily appalling decisions of this Labor government. Given the litany of broken policies and disastrous policies of this government, that is really saying something. In an almost inexplicable decision, this Labor government has decided to provide $10 million to the yes side yet just one-twentieth of that sum, $500,000, to the no campaign. This is despite the fact that, during the cross-party discussions, there was no mention whatsoever of a disproportionality in funding or, further, that it would be based on the parliamentary vote.


All Australians, whether they were born here or chose to live here, are incredibly lucky to have inherited an incredibly robust and balanced document in the form of our Constitution. We are one of only a handful of nations which remained democratic throughout the 20th century and into this one, one of the very few nations whose citizens have continuously enjoyed the liberties and freedoms that we now take for granted. We are incredibly lucky. But that luck has been greatly assisted by the fact that the document we now refer to as the Australian Constitution was thoughtfully and carefully drafted over 110 years ago and delivered exactly what we needed as a young nation to survive in our early years and mature into what is now one of the world's oldest democracies.


As such, Australians are rightly very cautious when it comes to changing this document fundamental to our democratic success. I acknowledge that, despite its great robustness, the Constitution does need to be changed from time to time to reflect circumstances our forebears could not or did not foresee, but it is right and correct, given the importance it plays in underpinning our democracy and the balance it achieves, that such change is approached carefully, cautiously and in a considered manner by Australians. Past practice shows it is usually also approached in the same manner by governments when putting up proposals for constitutional change. But, to the great shame of this government, that is not what we are seeing here. Ignoring for the moment the motivating factor behind Labor's decision to proceed with this referendum—that is, the deal done with the Greens and Independents after the last election to retain government—the process followed by Labor has shown a total disregard for a suitably careful, cautious and considered approach to this change. In the end, it is the people who should decide on change and, in doing so, it is right that they should fully understand the issues and the arguments for and against the proposed change.


I do not support the proposal, but I would not necessarily have been opposed in principle to the passing of the enabling bill if steps had been taken to ensure that the Australian people were as well prepared as possible to make a fully informed decision. This clearly will not be the case, both because of the failure of the government to act in a timely manner over the past 2½ years and, now, because of the government's attempt to make up for this failure by what looks awfully like trying to buy the outcome through grossly disproportionate funding of the two sides of the question—a partisan campaign, as Senator Gallacher referred to it. 


As deputy chair of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government, I enjoyed the opportunity of hearing from constitutional experts, bureaucrats, local governments and other interested parties throughout the inquiry process, which ended earlier this year. What was patently obvious to me from that inquiry is that the government has seriously mishandled the process leading up to the announcement of this referendum. I would have thought it obvious that no proposal to change our Constitution should be put to the people unless all practical and reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that the Australian people are as equipped as possible to make their decision on a fully informed basis. 


Witnesses at the joint committee's hearings all supported that position. I suspect many who are opposed to the passage of the bill to enable the referendum would be far less stridently opposed if the process leading up to its consideration had been properly handled by the government. As it was not properly handled, I have far less confidence that the Australian people will have the necessary exposure to, or the necessary understanding of, the arguments for and against to allow them to make a fully informed decision on 14 September—or any earlier date which may transpire. 


The government's failure to act on the recommendations of its own expert panel, particularly the recommendation for early engagement with the public on the issues, is only exacerbated by the decision announced this week to grossly disproportionately fund the yes case relative to the tiny amount made available for the no campaign. This can only be an attempt to skew public information and engagement towards an understanding of the issues from the yes perspective and away from the no. Such a move is entirely unprecedented, is dishonest and is unfair to all Australians.


The chamber is aware that the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott, has written to the Prime Minister on this subject. I associate myself with the remarks he made in his letter. He said:


The Coalition believes that it is not up to the Government of the day to pre-determine the outcome of any referendum question: a referendum is a decision for the Australian people to make.


…   …   …


Any bid to change the Constitution should succeed on the strength of a fair and well-argued case, not on the weight of advertising. We should not lightly change our Constitution. Argument, not money, should determine the outcome.


…   …   …


It is the first time that any notion of public funding based on parliamentary votes has ever been raised with the Coalition, or publicly.


That is the dishonest aspect of what the government are doing. The letter goes on to say:


The fact that this grossly disparate funding split was never raised with the Coalition at any time during a process where bipartisanship was sought makes a mockery of so-called consultation.


You will recall that at the last referendum, the Government funded both the 'yes' and the 'no' case on the question of a Republic equally. Rightly, Mr Howard determined that the choice to support a change to the Constitution was a choice for the Australian people and government's role was to merely put up a sound question and ensure that the arguments could be put and a genuine community debate could be conducted.


He then calls on the Prime Minister to do the same and concludes:


Anything less than equal funding for the 'yes' and 'no' cases puts at risk the fairness of this process.


It is bad enough that the government has entirely inappropriately decided to fund the yes and no campaigns disproportionately, but what does it say about the minister's—or indeed the government's—view of the Senate when he says that the decision made was to fund the campaigns in accordance with the vote on the floor of parliament? Here is some news for the minister: the Senate is part of the parliament. (Time expired)

"Madigan, Sen John",DLP,2013-06-19,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (16:19):  When the Constitution Alteration (Recognition of Local Government) Bill, which is what today's MPI is about, originally came up, I intended to support it. Generally, the DLP and I support any call for a referendum, because there is no better example of democracy than giving the people a direct voice in the running of their country and the shaping of their Constitution. It is for this reason I introduced the Citizen Initiated Referendum Bill, which is currently before committee. A democracy cannot function properly if the political representatives of the nation usurp all power to themselves. Quite frankly, we have seen some incredible examples of that with recent governments. 


Unfortunately, I find myself in the position of not supporting this call for a referendum, because to do so would be to become complicit in eroding the democratic rights of the Australian people. How can we accept that the funding of the yes and no cases for this referendum should be determined by how many parliamentarians voted for it in the House of Representatives and by how many local councils support it? The only people who are entitled to change the Australian Constitution are the Australian people. It is not up to local government, it is not up to state parliaments and it is certainly not up to the Senate or the House of Representatives.


If you are trying to say that we are the people who were elected to represent the Australian people and are therefore capable of deciding everything for our constituents, you are kidding yourselves. If you want to argue that, why not go back and count what percentage of the vote each parliamentarian and councillor received and apportion the funds according to that? Yes, that is a nonsense argument, but it is infinitely fairer than the undemocratic and, more to the point, despotic attempt to skew the debate we have before us. If the funding were fairly apportioned as it should be, I would support the call for a referendum. But, with this unbelievable infringement of the democratic process as the only option, I simply cannot accept it and will vote against it.


However, if the government were to decide against this ridiculous position and grant equal funding I would gladly support the democratic process of putting the question to the people. That should not be misconstrued as my support for the intention of the referendum. Neither I nor the Democratic Labor Party agrees with the constant attack of successive federal governments on the rights of the states. This deliberate attempt to further undermine the powers of the states should be seen for what it is—one step further along the road to the removal of state governments and the consolidation of all power in the federal government. This has been a platform of the ALP since the 1960s and is one that the DLP has never agreed to.


I will not vote in favour of this referendum at the election, and the DLP will campaign against it. But the question here is the fairness of the funding and, as I have said, I cannot support the bill unless that is improved. The only people who can change the Australian Constitution are the Australian people, and we are kidding ourselves if we think it is up to us. We had better stop eroding the rights of the Senate and the job it is supposed to do as the true house of review that represents the States.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2013-06-19,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:23):  I rise to speak on the important referendum question of the constitutional recognition of local government. Again, unfortunately, we have seen in this matter of public importance discussion in the Senate a misrepresentation of the facts by those opposite in an attempt to score political points. As those opposite would be aware, the Department of Regional Development, Local Government, Arts and Sport is spending $10 million on a non-partisan civics education campaign to ensure that people are fully informed of the basis for the proposed amendment. The Australian Electoral Commission will spend around $40 million in preparing for the referendum. This includes circulating the official yes/no pamphlet, which will be drafted by the parliament. The AEC will also develop referendum-specific advertising, particularly to inform electors on how to cast a formal vote. So the partisan or yes/no campaign funding, which totals $10.5 million, will only form a small part of the overall information campaign on the proposed referendum change.


It is worth noting that the constitutional recognition of local government did enjoy bipartisan support at the federal level. I am not sure of the current position of those opposite, but of course we do know that Mr Abbott did indicate his in-principle support, I think was the term he used, for the yes case but that appears not to be the position of his party any more. Whether it is still his own personal position I do not know. The recent vote in the House of Representatives was 133 to two in favour of the proposed amendment to include local government in the Constitution. This vote formed the basis of providing funding for each of the cases. It reflected the proportion of members in the other place who voted for and against this constitutional change. Over 98 per cent of members voted for the change and less than two per cent voted against the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) Bill. In fact, the no case actually attracted proportionally less compared to the $500,000 the government is providing for proponents of the no case. The two members who voted against constitutional change will be asked to determine the distribution of this funding.


Let us examine what the proposed constitutional change is and what impact it will have. The proposed change to the Constitution is quite small and involves the addition of 17 words to section 96. The Constitution would be updated to read:


96 Financial assistance to States and local government bodies


During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State, or local government body formed by a law of a State ...


The insertion of these 17 words does not diminish the role of the states in the administration of local government. This is a practical change to the Constitution that recognises what is the modern reality of the way the Commonwealth and local government already interact. The Commonwealth already partners with local government on a range of programs, including road funding under the Roads to Recovery Program, which is a highly successful program. Together the Commonwealth and local government have been able to work together to upgrade and repair 16,000 road sites across the country. The Commonwealth has also partnered with local government to deliver other local roads, sporting facilities, libraries, childcare and community services. This is already taking place and the constitutional change will do nothing more than acknowledge this fact. 


This strong partnership is already delivering significant benefits in my home state of Tasmania. In particular, the Glenorchy City Council in the electorate of Denison, one of 29 councils in Tasmania, is benefiting from Commonwealth funding through the KG5 sporting precinct redevelopment, the CCTV cameras program, the Glenorchy Art and Culture Park stages 1 and 2, and many other infrastructure projects. I will take a moment to talk about these projects to demonstrate exactly how this relationship between the federal government and local government is already working. 


Under the Regional Local Community Infrastructure Program—from memory a $250 million program—each council across the country has received funding. From the funding Glenorchy City Council received in that first round, we saw irrigation systems upgraded at Montrose Bay and Claremont recreational grounds, childcare centre upgrades, electric barbecues installed at Tolosa Park, landscaping at Tolosa Park and landscaping at the Katoomba Crescent reserve. Also, we also the upgrade of the Glenorchy skate park, work done at the Wellington Park mountain bike trails and the Barossa Creek stormwater litter traps. Just in one council area in the first round of the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program we saw eight projects that benefited the local council and the residents who live in that area. It was a very successful round of that program. 


In Hobart city, where my office is, the Hobart City Council has received Roads to Recovery funding as well as support to replace old lighting around the city with LED lighting, upgrade the soccer pitch for the South Hobart Soccer Club and upgrade the Lenah Valley RSL community hall. So we can see that a strong working relationship already exists between the federal government and local governments. As I have demonstrated, that relationship acknowledges that local government is the tier of government closest to the community and it provides many of the services and infrastructure projects that affect the local community. 


This level of support being provided to local government has been reiterated today with the announcement of $150 million to be shared between all local councils and shires across Australia to help build and renew community infrastructure. This funding has been delivered through round 5 of the Regional Development Australia Fund and the Liveable Cities Program as part of the federal government's commitment to supporting jobs and growth as well as investing in regional and local communities. This boost will mean councils and shires will share in funding based on the current financial assistance grants distribution.


Protections will be put in place to ensure that the smaller councils, of which there are many in Tasmania, will receive a base payment of at least $30,000. Seventy per cent of the funding, about $105 million, will be directed to rural and regional councils through the Regional Development Australia Fund. The other 30 per cent of funding, $45 million, will be delivered to urban councils through the Liveable Cities Program to make our cities more productive, liveable and sustainable. The funding is for councils and shires to build and renew community infrastructure with sporting facilities, town halls and playgrounds. Essential community services are expected to benefit from this funding. Back home in Tasmania I know local councils will be very happy with Minister Albanese's announcement today. I have read out some of the projects that were funded through a similar program that was delivered through— (Time expired)

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (16:33):  I have a great deal of sympathy for Senator Brown from Tasmania and Senator Gallacher from South Australia. To have been dragged into this chamber to defend the indefensible this afternoon took great courage. I have never heard a more lacklustre, more lazy, more lame or more loose defence of any government decision than this decision—




Senator Carol Brown:
  Mr Acting Deputy President Fawcett, I raise a point of order. I object to Senator Smith's comments. He is misrepresenting my contribution today.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator SMITH:
  I have never heard a more lame, lacklustre, lazy or loose defence of any government decision in the 13 months that I have been in this Senate than I have heard this afternoon. Unless I heard incorrectly, I do not think I heard the words 'fairness', 'fair go', 'democratic values' or 'integrity' from any of the speakers on the other side with regard to this matter. That was a shameful exercise in our democracy. We heard Labor senators talk about the government's prerogative to fund the campaign. I want to hear about the government's responsibility to fund the campaign equally. We heard about Labor senators defending the decision to allocate funding based solely on the decision of the House of Representatives. Labor senators could not even defend their own role in the democratic process.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  That is not true. That is a misrepresentation.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Collins, you are aware that under standing order 197 it is disorderly to interrupt except to call attention to a quorum, privilege or a point of order.




Senator SMITH:
  Labor senators also talked about facts and myths. Let me share one fact and it was reported in The Australian on Tuesday, 18 June, by Christian Kerr. It said: 


The row erupted as a brief by the West Australian Local Government Association emerged, containing the admission that 'Refining the Constitution will create a slightly broader head of power for the federal government' but omits to mention grants would be tied.


Let me share another myth. The first chapter in this deceit is the decision not to fund equally the yes and no campaigns. The second chapter in this deceit is to set up the referendum task force unit using $1.6 million of Australian taxpayers' money—not a secret, it was in the Senate estimates process. When I challenged the government to give me a guarantee that this $1.6 million sub-branch of the yes campaign would not be used to promote just one side of the argument, this is what I was told. The official said:


We would be providing the normal support to the minister on a range of tasks.


I said:


But you are the referendum taskforce unit. To an outside observer it could look like you are becoming an advocate for the referendum proposal. Is that true? So is $1.6 million being allocated to advocate for the referendum?


The official said:


The taskforce is there to provide support to the government to deliver the referendum.


She said, further on:


The taskforce, as I said, is a part of the department, so in the same way as the department is established to serve the requirements of the government, so is the referendum taskforce. We in the taskforce will implement government policy, which is to facilitate the running of a referendum.


This deceit does not have one chapter; it has two. That is what we know today. What will we know tomorrow?


I think it is worth considering for a moment what the government's decision earlier this week means. We know there is $10 million for the yes campaign and $500,000 for the no campaign—and I add that money does not necessarily mean you have the most convincing argument. If we look at the 1974 referendum on the same issue and at the national vote that was achieved for both the yes and no campaigns, we see the funding allocation looks much fairer, with $4.6 million for the yes campaign and $5.3 million for the no campaign. If we look at the 1988 referendum result, we see there was $3.3 million for the yes campaign and $6.6 million for the no campaign. Integrity and fairness must be integral to this process. But, when I asked the government at Senate estimates, 'Can you guarantee that the process will be fair,' this is what Senator Lundy had to say:


It is certainly our intention to have a fair process. I cannot be any more specific than the officers, but we will do what we can and make it as fair a process as possible.


I said:


Great, so fairness means that you will guarantee that the activities of the referendum taskforce—


Senator Lundy interrupted:


No, I will not say anything specific, but I am telling you it is the intention of the government to make this a fair process.


This was the exchange at estimates on 30 May. It continued:



Senator SMITH: So you cannot specifically—



Senator Lundy: No.



Senator SMITH: You cannot specifically guarantee fairness?


Senator Lundy replied that she was happy to take that on notice. So she took it on notice on 30 May and, at the beginning of this week, Australians found out that what the government was doing was not enshrining fairness but damaging the fabric of our democratic process.


There is much for this Labor government to be ashamed of, but surely this must be the most shameful moment of all. But there is a redeeming feature. This particular element of this particular debate means the referendum secret is no more, and Australians will now be forced to examine the facts, which speak for themselves: Labor cannot be trusted to govern our country; Australians should not trust them to change the Constitution. That is as clear as it can be, as clear as it can get.


The bipartisanship that has often been talked about is close to being in tatters, and it should be. The good faith of many people has been breached, including the good faith of the Leader of the Opposition and the good faith of the Senate. I think it is time for the Australian Local Government Association and the Western Australian Local Government Association to distance themselves from this particular element of the campaign and call for equal funding of the yes and no campaigns. That is the right thing to do, that is a fair thing to do and it is in keeping with the Australian character.

Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (16:41):  In rising to contribute to this matter of public importance this afternoon, I want to reflect on one point that has not been touched on during the debate, and that is: of the three levels of government we have in this country, who should be the beneficiary of the outcome of the referendum proposed for 14 September this year? As a Queensland senator I can say, hand on heart, that from my travels around the state and my consultations and involvement with local councils I know there is great need out there. The care of our roads, parks and all those services that are provided by local councils need some recognition. There needs to be greater transparency and the delivery of some funds to those areas without the ordeal of going through state government processes. Fundamentally, I think that is the purpose of this referendum—to deliver for those councils around the country that require funding in the right place. I think they are the best level of government to consider where that funding should be delivered.


I was privileged to be the deputy chair of the Senate Select Committee on the Reform of the Australian Federation. Senator Back was also a very active participant in that committee as well and knows the evidence we as a committee received, having heard it firsthand. There are a number of parts in the report of that committee that I wish to refer to—because there is no doubt that one of the roles of the Senate, and it does it very well, is to report on matters for consideration and of importance, and this is an extremely important issue. It is an issue that has been taken to the Australian public on two occasions now but, unfortunately, has not been accepted. But, as with most referendums, we know that that is the case historically: most referendums are rejected by the Australian public. The government has set out the question that is to be put on 14 September in a manner that ensures that most people will understand not only its importance but also why this referendum is required. I refer to paragraph 6.21 of the select committee report, which states:


Evidence was presented to the committee arguing that the Commonwealth's constitutional authority to fund local government rested on two heads of power. First, Section 96 of the Constitution—


and we have heard deliberations and evidence on that today in the chamber from both the opposition and the government—


which allows the Commonwealth to provide financial assistance to the States 'on such terms and conditions as the Parliament sees fit.'


We know that is the process at present. Also, it was in evidence provided by Professor Brown in this particular area that assistance to the states was on such terms as seen fit. They are examples of such funding. The committee's report states: 


As the Hon. Christian Porter MLA, Western Australian Attorney-General, noted, section 96 grants cannot go directly to local government as the section 'requires Commonwealth funds to be provided only to the states…


This is where the hurdle is. This is where there needs to be acceptance of local councils recognised in the Constitution. Surely they have a right to have an opinion and have a say in the manner that funding is delivered to them as local councils. The report went on to refer to further evidence in regard to the history of local government referenda. As I have indicated, a proposal has been made twice for the Constitution to recognise local government. On both occasions it has been rejected. We go back to the first occasion in 1974 when the Constitution Alteration (Local Government Bodies) Act proposed to enable the Commonwealth to borrow money for, and to grant financial assistance to, local government bodies. That referendum considered a proposal for additions to the Constitution and suggested a new section 51(IV)(a) to provide that the Commonwealth may make laws for the borrowing of money by the Commonwealth for local government bodies.


The main issue that is being debated this afternoon is equal funding. The Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government is funding a $10 million nonpartisan civics education campaign to ensure people are fully informed of the basis of the amendment. This is an example of the appropriateness of ensuring that people have the understanding and the education to make their democratic choice on 14 September—when they go to the ballot box for the election of the next federal government—to also make a decision on this referendum about the Constitution. They will decide on whether this aspect of the Constitution should be amended. This is a particularly important area and one where education is to be provided so those who are making their choices at the ballot box can make an informed choice in deciding which way they vote, whether it be yes or no—that is the democratic process we have in this country. It is an amazing process; it is a process that many countries would envy. I am sure, Mr Acting Deputy President Fawcett, that in your travels around certain parts of the world you would also have been informed that it is process that makes us the envy of many countries. We have an amazing Constitution. We have an amazing democracy under which people can have a choice in deciding to vote yes or no in an amendment to their Constitution.


The Australian Electoral Commission also will spend approximately $40 million preparing for the referendum. This amount includes disseminating the official Yes/No pamphlet drafted by the parliament and developing referendum-specific advertisements informing electors how to cast a formal vote. We know, when it comes to the AEC, of the wonderful task they do and the wonderful role they perform at times of an election, preparing for those elections in an orderly and informed manner. People can turn up to the ballot box on the day being fully aware of what they are doing when making an informed and democratic decision.


The partisan funding campaigns totalling $10.5 million will form only a small part of the overall information going to voters on the proposal. We must reflect and remind ourselves that it is a government's prerogative to fund campaigns. Contrary to Senator Bernardi's comments, it has always been the prerogative of governments as to how and how much they fund partisan campaigns. This is separate to the official Yes/No pamphlet case. Under the Howard government, John Howard might have had an equal split cost for campaigns but certainly did not concede that this was anything other than a decision of government. It falls back to the decisions of the government of the day when it comes to a referendum to amend the Constitution. It falls back on our decision-making persons to decide as a government whether that is the case.


We also need to reflect that when this matter was before the other House, members voted 133-2 in favour of including local government in the Constitution. That should affect the funding. That sort of substantial vote clearly demonstrates that members of the House of Representatives—I am only assuming this—have regular contact with their local councils and understand the importance and the need for this type of funding to assist those local councils. I know for certain that the local council where I reside—the Moreton Bay Regional Council—is 100 per cent supportive of this referendum. 


If those opposite and others who have made contributions here today would have some sort of involvement with their councils, I am sure they would form the same opinion if they consulted with them. Only about four or five weeks ago I was in Gladstone discussing matters that the Gladstone Shire Council raised with me. No doubt they are supportive of this type of assistance for a referendum to make sure, for the first time in its history, that this matter is corrected so that local councils can have a say in how their funding is delivered.

The speech read as follows—



CHARITIES BILL 2013


The Charities Bill 2013 introduces a statutory definition of charity that applies to all Commonwealth legislation.


The Gillard Government is dedicated to supporting a strong, vibrant, diverse and independent not-for-profit sector.  As part of this commitment, in the 2011 12 Budget the Government announced that it would introduce a statutory definition of charity.


The meaning of charity and charitable purpose has not been previously comprehensively defined for the purposes of Commonwealth law.  It has been administered on the basis of principles derived from the common law. 


The common law meaning has developed over 400 years, largely based on the Preamble to the Statute of Charitable Uses, which is an English statute from 1601. The development of the definition of charity and charitable purpose through case law since that time has resulted in charity law that is in some areas unclear, inconsistent, or does not adequately address matters relevant to the contemporary Australian charity sector.


A statutory definition of charity and charitable purpose is a reform with a strong evidence base. It was first recommended in the report of the 2001 Inquiry into the Definition of Charities and Related Organisations and in later reports including Australia's Future Tax System Review in 2010.  The Productivity Commission recommended in its 2010 report, Contribution of the Not-for-Profit Sector, the introduction of a statutory definition in accordance with the recommendations of the 2001 Inquiry.


Charities are such an important part of the Australian community and deserve a modern regulatory framework which will support them as they grow into the future.


Having a definition of charity set out in legislation will provide greater clarity and certainty for charities, the public and regulators in determining whether an entity is charitable.


It will cut down on compliance costs for those wishing to establish charities and make the definition more accessible to the community. The definition aims to preserve common law principles, with some minor variations. The definition is informed by the 2001 Inquiry, which identified principles underlying the common law.  The definition also takes into account the findings of more recent judicial decisions that further clarify the meaning of charity, including the Aid/Watch decision which extended charities' ability to advance public debate.


Importantly, the definition retains the flexibility inherent in the common law that enables the courts, as well as Parliament, to continue to develop the definition within the statutory framework. This will ensure that the definition remains appropriate and reflects modern society and community needs as they evolve over time. The Bill sets out the key principles for an entity to be a charity, including that it must be not-for-profit and have only charitable purposes except for any ancillary or incidental purposes that further or aid the charitable purpose.  


The charitable purposes must be for the public benefit. A purpose that an entity has is for the public benefit if the achievement of the purpose would be of public benefit, and the benefit from the purpose is available to members of the general public or a sufficient section of the general public. The nature of the benefit may be tangible or intangible.


In limited circumstances there are exceptions to this principle. These apply to the purpose of relieving the necessitous circumstances of individuals or small numbers of individuals. It also applies in the case of open and non-discriminatory self-help groups and closed or contemplative religious orders.


One departure from common law principles relates to entities with native title or other traditional rights in connection with the land. These entities might fail a public benefit test because they provide benefits only to indigenous individuals who are related, or have some other special relationship with the other potential benefit recipients, are treated as being for the public benefit in particular circumstances.


Consistent with the common law, the statutory definition retains presumptions of benefit for certain charitable purposes. These purposes are the relief of poverty, distress and disadvantage of individuals or families; preventing and relieving sickness, disease or human suffering; the care and support of the aged and individuals with disabilities; advancing education; and advancing religion. The Bill extends the presumption to the whole of the public benefit test for these purposes.  Also consistent with the common law, the presumption ceases to apply where there is evidence to the contrary.


The Bill lists categories of charitable purposes. This list is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather identifies purposes that have strong recognition in the common law.


The Bill reflects the Aid/Watch decision that charities may have a purpose to generate public debate about a charitable purpose.  It allows for an entity to have a charitable purpose, including a sole purpose, of promoting or opposing a change in the law or government policy relevant to another charitable purpose.


Another area where the Bill extends common law principles relates to the purpose of assisting rebuilding, repairing or securing assets after a disaster, in furtherance of the purposes of exempt entities within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. This purpose is included within the charitable purpose of advancing social or public welfare.


The effect of this is to extend existing charitable purposes to include re-establishing not for profit community assets after a disaster, independently of the relief of individual distress. Any benefits of a commercial or private nature must be only incidental or ancillary to re-establishing the community assets and the assets must not be government assets. Given the destruction we have witnessed in recent years caused by natural disasters, this is a timely change to support rebuilding and reconstruction after a disaster.


Under the Bill, a purpose of engaging in, or promoting, activities which are unlawful or contrary to public policy is a disqualifying purpose. The Bill clarifies that public policy in this context refers to matters such as the rule of law, the constitutional system of government of the Commonwealth, the safety of the general public and national security.


Political parties are not charitable and a purpose of promoting or opposing a political party or candidate for political office is a disqualifying purpose. This relates to direct partisan political engagement, and the Bill provides that this does not apply to the purpose of distributing information or advancing debate about the policies of political parties or candidates for political office. By their nature, policy debates involve engagement with the political process and the Bill makes clear that charities are free to engage in policy debates by assessing, critiquing, comparing and ranking the policies of political parties and candidates for political office.


The not-for-profit sector has been widely engaged in the development of the definition with over 200 submissions on a public consultation paper in 2011 and further consultation on the draft Bill. The Government has been very responsive to issues raised during the consultation process, including in the most recent consultation on the draft Bill.


The Government appreciates the extensive and significant contribution of the sector to the development of the definition and thanks all stakeholders for their valuable input. Their contribution will help ensure the definition supports and facilitates the important and significant contribution that charities make to the Australian community.


Further details are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.


I commend this Bill to the Senate.


CHARITIES (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2013


The Charities (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 accompanies the Charities Bill 2013.


It gives effect to the expanded number of categories of charitable purpose, includes transitional arrangements for streamlining registration of the subtypes of entities with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, and makes clear that the charitable status of certain entities that were charitable before the introduction of the statutory definition is preserved.


The Bill also makes consequential amendments to other legislation to ensure that the Commonwealth law operates as intended when the Charities Bill takes effect.


I commend this Bill to the Senate.

Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:16):  I rise to speak to the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013 bill. Local government, councils, shires and municipalities right across Australia are an extremely important part of our national governance framework. Despite the fact that there are clear examples of major problems with councils being run by bad or just incompetent people, on the whole local government has delivered good grassroots local solutions to local problems and will continue to do so regardless of the outcome of this bill or the consequent referendum. 


Like all of levels of government, sometimes the solutions can be worse than the problems, and my role as deputy chair of the Coalition Deregulation Taskforce has certainly seen plenty examples of that thrown up at the local government level. But tackling red and green tape is to the most extent a separate issue to that we are looking at in this place today. So let me make it clear: I am a supporter of local government and the good work done by its elected representatives and employees right across the country, but particularly in regional and rural Australia. It is important that local decisions are made by local bodies that understand the issues from a local perspective. However, it is for that very reason that I am opposed to the change to Australia's Constitution that this bill proposes to put to the people. 


Despite my opposition to that change, I would not necessarily, in principle, be opposed to the passing of this bill if the consequent question had been treated appropriately to ensure the likelihood that the Australian people were as best prepared as possible to make a fully informed decision. But this clearly will not be the case. As deputy chair of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government, I enjoyed the opportunity to hear from constitutional experts, bureaucrats, local governments and other interested parties throughout the inquiry process, which ended earlier this year. What was patently obvious to me from that inquiry was that the government has seriously mishandled the process leading up to the announcement of this referendum. Putting aside the subject matter of this proposed referendum for a minute, it is my view that no proposed change to our constitution should be put to the people unless all practical and reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that the Australian people are best equipped to make its decision on that question on a fully informed basis.


Our constitution is a core pillar, providing support for the robust and stable democracy that is Australia, which is now one of the oldest democracies in the world. Stability of government, combined with strong adherence to the rule of law, is a rare thing, and the fact that we as a nation have achieved that for so long, at least in large measure, is because our constitution works. Although I recognise change may from time to time be desirable or even necessary, I firmly believe we should not promote change to our constitution lightly and certainly not on an uninformed basis. I suspect Australians inherently agree, and this is why referenda questions have so often failed to get up. The evidence also suggests that where people do not have the benefit of a full understanding of the question, their tendency is to vote no, and this possibly also reflects the inherent understanding of Australians that the document does work for Australia and they are not going to agree to change it unless they are absolutely convinced that there is very good reason. 


The question of some form of recognition of local government in our constitution has been in the public discourse for decades. Indeed, the question has been put in referenda in 1974 and 1989—both times failing. However, in recent times two factors have driven the renewal of this debate and have ultimately led to this bill being before this place today. The first is the impact of the Pape and Williams High Court cases, the decisions in which cast serious doubt over the constitutionality of some forms of direct funding of local government programs by the Commonwealth. The issues raised by these cases are real and not disputed by any mainstream constitutional experts, including those who do not support this proposed change. However, as I will touch on later, their impact does not, in my view, pose any threat to ongoing funding of local government programs by the Commonwealth, as constitutionally valid methods of doing so continue to exist. 


The second driver is the deal done by the Independents and the Greens with the government in order to obtain confidence on the floor of the other place following the last election, which included the government agreeing to put the question we are looking at today to the people during the term of this parliament. As mentioned, I have a view of the advisability of agreeing to that question and will be voting accordingly, if required to, on referendum day. As such, that view also informs my decision that this bill should not be passed. But, as I firmly believe in democracy, I would be far less stridently opposed to the passage of this bill and the posing of the question if, indeed, the process leading up to today had been properly handled. As it has not, I have far less confidence that the Australian people will have the necessary exposure to and understanding of the arguments for and against to make a fully informed decision. My lack of confidence is only enhanced by the fact that the government has taken the unprecedented step of grossly, disproportionately funding the yes case compared to the tiny amount made available for the no campaign. Precedent, indeed the law as it stood, required equal public funding on issues of constitutional change, reflecting the very serious nature of asking people to consider changing the document at the foundation of our democracy.


It is bad enough that the government has decided to fund it disproportionately, but it is a real snub to the Senate that it has chosen to set that proportionality only on the basis of the vote on the floor of the other place. The other place and this place are treated equally in terms of constitutional change. Deciding to ignore the result of the coming vote in this place when setting the proportions exposes the contempt Labor has for the Senate and the vital role it plays in our democracy.


Let us take a look at what has occurred since September 2010 when the government agreed with the Greens and Independents to hold a referendum on this issue. In August 2011 the government formed the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government to identify options for the constitutional recognition of that level of government and to report on the level of support for such recognition among stakeholders and across the broader general community. The expert panel's final report in December 2011 stated that:


The majority of panel members support a referendum in 2013 subject to two conditions: first, that the Commonwealth negotiate with the States to achieve their support for the financial recognition option; and second, that the Commonwealth adopt steps suggested by ALGA necessary to achieve informed and positive public engagement with the issue, as set out in the section of this report on the concerns about a failed referendum … Steps include allocating substantial resources to a major public awareness campaign and making changes to the referendum process.


As such, the expert panel was supportive of a 2013 referendum on financial recognition of local government through a change to section 96 of the Constitution provided those two conditions were met. The first condition was negotiation with the states to achieve their support for the government's proposed question. The second was to take steps as recommended by ALGA to achieve informed and positive public engagement with the issue.


The expert panel's final report was delivered in December 2011, almost two years prior to the latest possible date for the next federal election. As at that date, the government had plenty of time to ensure that it took that blueprint, put it in place and proceeded to put the question to a voting public that had been properly equipped with the benefit of a full public education campaign on all the issues. Interestingly, at the first hearing of the select committee in mid-January 2013, evidence was received that even given the latest possible date for an election, then being late November 2013, the prospects of meeting the preconditions set by the government's own expert panel in time to hold the referendum at the same time as the election were not high. This was back in January. Given the nominated date of the election and the time that has since elapsed, the prospect of those preconditions being fully met by 14 September this year is nigh on impossible. As such, a referendum held in conjunction with this year's federal election will almost certainly be held in an environment where potential conditions of stakeholders, including the states, have not been met and where the opportunity to fully inform the voting public through public education and other avenues has not been fully realised.


The independent Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government was appointed in August 2011 by the Labor government. It is important to note here the delay of some 12 months or one-third of the current term of the parliament before the government got around to the first stage of addressing the issue. The panel, however, did its job expeditiously, consulted nationally and considered feedback it received from Australians before handing its report to the government in December 2011, some three months later.


As mentioned, amongst other findings, the expert panel recommended a number of preconditions be met before proceeding and that the government get busy on ensuring that they were met as quickly as possible. As far as anyone can tell, no action took place towards satisfying those conditions for almost 12 months. One of the recommendations of the panel was the establishment of a joint select parliamentary committee to examine certain issues. The government dragged its heels, not establishing this committee until 1 November 2012, some 11 months after the delivery of the final report of its expert panel. The timing necessarily meant that, once members were appointed and preliminaries taken care of, the work of the select committee would not be completed until well into 2013. This is in fact what occurred with the final report not being delivered until March of this year. As such, the government has demonstrated an extraordinary lack of action to advance the case and cause of this question in a responsible and considered manner. In particular, even recognising the delay in getting up the expert panel, it failed then to follow the panel's recommendations and put in place the preconditions for success it highlighted and that were strongly and publicly supported by other stakeholders, such as the Australian Local Government Association.


It was some months after the March 2013 delivery of the joint select committee's final report which urged specific activities be undertaken—again, they were not acted upon—before the government acted to bring legislation before this parliament. As a direct consequence, the time remaining between now and 14 September is likely to be insufficient to put in place the necessary mechanics, education campaigns and other measures highlighted by expert witnesses and bureaucrats as necessary to ensure a fully informed outcome for the referendum question. I am strongly of the opinion that this, like any referendum, should only be considered once a full and proper public education campaign has been conducted.


There is strong conclusive evidence that program-specific funding which the Commonwealth currently provides directly to local government may still be provided in full via existing avenues that are constitutionally valid. As such, it is my view that this backs the argument of the existence of valid alternative funding pathways to address the funding uncertainty introduced by the recent High Court cases. This then supports the argument for a reduced imperative to pursue constitutional change. The public should be aware of all such arguments before making their decision.


Of course, the great irony is that history shows that when Australians are not fully informed on referendum questions and feel they do not really know enough to make an informed decision they vote no. This is a rational approach and, as mentioned, reflects an inherent and desirable conservatism when it comes to changing a document that is so fundamental to our nation's democratic success. So in their failure to address the issue in a timely manner, the government may well be assisting those of us who do not think this is the answer to the issue raised by the High Court cases. Indeed, it is my view that the failure of the government to take timely action to seek to satisfy the expert panel's recommendations severely undermines the prospects of success and raises questions about the advisability of spending some $50-odd million of taxpayers' funds on posing the question when the timing is now so clearly wrong. This financial expenditure, together with the risk of a lack of informed and positive public engagement with the issue, appears to be unnecessary given the alternative pathways to ensuring ongoing local government program funding should the direct model in fact be successfully challenged in the courts.


I will now go to another of the expert panel's conditions that was considered vital to be met before any referendum on this issue was put to the people. Australia is a federation of states and, as the evidence placed before the joint committee attests, the support of state governments can make or break referenda. If state governments have been largely opposed to the change, history proves it has been very difficult for referenda of the past.


The expert panel made it clear in December 2011—a long time ago—that negotiations with the states were required to develop a proposal that would attract their support. The committee was told, however, that the government position was that negotiation could not occur with the states until a proposal was developed. But the reality is that the government failed to make best use of the time available to it since December 2011 by failing to undertake such negotiations and that this delay has potentially undermined the prospect of a full and informed referendum proposition being put in 2013. In any event, the expert panel put forward a proposed set of words in its final report in December 2011, and this could and should have formed a starting point for such negotiations at that time. ALGA further refined those words in an attempt to allay concerns voiced by some states. Yet the government again failed to use the refined words as a starting point. We are now less than three months from the nominated date for the election, with neither of the two conditions recommended by the expert panel having been satisfied, despite great opportunity for real and determined attempts to deliver them.


The committee's preliminary report was tabled on 24 January this year, and all members of that committee strongly recommended urgent action to engage state and territory governments. Yet nothing was done until sometime around mid-February, around three weeks later, with a request for responses by 4 March 2013. The three-week delay in getting these letters out, in the face of such short time lines and the work needed to be done to conduct a meaningful referendum, when combined with their previous lackadaisical approach to actioning this issue, raises questions in my mind about the government's commitment to meeting the preconditions set by the expert panel—and ALGA—and, hence, their commitment to success of the question. As the government now intend to proceed to hold the referendum together with the 2013 election, it would be open for one to conclude that they are setting the question up to fail or, at the very least, posing the question with a reckless disregard for its success, with their main objective being able to say that they kept their promise to hold the referendum—or maybe their gross imbalance in funding is their attempt to make up for their past failures in this process. Who knows? 


Despite the inexplicable delays by the minister in seeking to meaningfully engage with the states on this issue, state governments are known to have made statements and comments that are, to some degree, indicative of their thoughts on the referendum question. It is unclear at this point whether any states will be campaigning actively in favour of the referendum, and there almost certainly will be states that will be campaigning actively against the referendum. On the whole, the state concerns seem mostly to relate to the potential impact of proposed constitutional change on state governments' relationships with local government. For example, one state which forwarded correspondence to the committee was concerned that the proposed amendment might later be found by the High Court to give rise to an implied constitutional obligation on the states to maintain particular systems of local government. Evidence received, particularly by constitutional experts at the first hearing, suggested that such concerns may hold some basis. But, if the concerns of some state governments are justified, the acceptance of the proposed constitutional change could have an impact that extended further than intended. This would be a concern to me and underlines why I do not support the proposition itself. Nevertheless, the abject failure of the government to implement detailed engagement with all the states and territories to address and negotiate through any concerns they may hold has undoubtedly contributed to the current level of opposition to or distrust of the proposed change. 


As mentioned, decisions made by Australians in relation to potential changes to the Constitution should always be made on as fully informed a basis as possible. The desirability of the public being well informed regarding potential constitutional change is even more important given that all Australian citizens are required to vote in a referendum. As such, it is not just those who have taken an active interest in the question but those who are notably disinterested who are required to make the decision. I consider that prior to a change in the Constitution being put to the people, parliament should take all reasonable steps to maximise the likelihood that all voting Australians understand the question and have an opportunity to thoroughly consider the yes and the no arguments before making a decision, including those who would otherwise be disinterested. 


The constitutional experts who appeared at the hearing provided support for the conclusion that inaction by the government has amplified risks. For example, Professor Williams stated at the hearing in mid-January:


But it is a risky course—I certainly agree with that—and not the most desirable course, either. The most desirable course would be that, by this point, more work would have been done over the past months to actually build the level of public recognition, to get the support on board. It is dreadfully late and that itself is a major problem. 


Bear in mind that that statement was made five months ago. There were a number of other constitutional experts, including those who were actually supportive of the need for the change, who agreed that more time was needed. Professor Brown indicated that, in his view, you needed more than six months to actively and positively engage with the public, yet here we are with less than three months to go. As such, I remain to be convinced that the time left is sufficient to be able to do the proposed constitutional change justice by ensuring a fully informed decision is made. This outcome is even less likely given the announcement this week of the extraordinary decision to not fund the yes/no case equally.


As noted, the committee received constitutional evidence that clearly demonstrates that avenues exist for funding currently provided directly to local government to still be provided in full, even in the face of potential judicial findings that some direct payments are not constitutional. The most obvious avenue is through grants through the states, tied on the basis that they must be both passed on in full and subject to use for the programs currently funded, or as directed under future Commonwealth-local government programs. I acknowledge that this may be a less clean avenue than direct payment but accept the evidence that options such as this are constitutional, are available, were the primary source of funding for most of the time since 1901 and that, accordingly, there is no potential risk of loss of funding to local government eventuating from further developments following the Pape and Williams cases. This risk is the argument that has been put forward by most stakeholders as the reason for the need for change. It is, with the greatest respect, clearly a furphy. 


The threat of further High Court cases which undermine the constitutionality of some payments by the Commonwealth directly to local government are real and likely to succeed in certain circumstances. However, there is no dispute amongst constitutional experts that this in no way limits the ability of the Commonwealth to continue to fund local government through clearly constitutionally valid avenues, primarily through section 96 of the Constitution—that is, through the states—and would have no impact whatsoever on direct funding in areas of clear Commonwealth responsibility.


I consider this proposal is counter to the interests of local government local decision making, can certainly lead to the undermining of state powers and to a further centralisation of power in Canberra and that it should not be supported. (Time expired)

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-06-19,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:37):  Well, there goes another coalition no—to the proposition that we should have a referendum to recognise local government in the Constitution. What a shame that is. There was so much hope when the Greens signed the agreement with the Labor government in 2010. One of the key parts of the agreement was that there be would be constitutional recognition for Australia's Indigenous people and constitutional recognition for local government. I am very proud of the work that has been done towards constitutional recognition of Australia's Indigenous people and I congratulate my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert, who has played a key role in advancing that, as a member of the expert panel that worked on the issue. We have respected the recommendation from that expert group to not proceed with a referendum on that matter at this time but to keep on working towards it—to delay it and in the meantime have the Recognise legislation. It is a really proud time, because it means that we have got one step further down the track towards Indigenous recognition.


The local government referendum is something that local governments have been campaigning for for a long time, and quite rightly. It is important that we recognise local government in the Constitution. The federal government provides grants to local councils to fund many programs. The one that the community is probably most familiar with is the Roads to Recovery program. Councils have warned that, without federal funding, residents will face either fewer services or higher rates. That is undoubted. Ratepayers are concerned and want to make sure that the federal government can work directly with local government and not have to mediate constantly through state governments. I will come to that a bit later.


The Australian Greens have listened carefully to those arguments and we are now standing with local government and the community to secure this important reform. Unlike the coalition, the Australian Greens are 100 per cent behind the yes campaign for the recognition of local government and will be campaigning for that. A yes vote in September, or whenever the election is held, would guarantee the federal government's ability to directly fund local government projects. As I mentioned before, everyone is well aware of the upgrade and repair work that Roads to Recovery has enabled to around 16,000 sites across the country. The federal government also helps to fund services like child care, sporting facilities, community facilities, swimming pools and libraries. The Australian Greens have pledged support for $10 million to fund and facilitate regional arts, many of those dollars to go towards assisting local government to employ cultural officers in their communities. A yes vote will guarantee those services, from which all Australians will benefit.


Why do we need this constitutional recognition? The 2009 High Court case Pape v Commissioner of Taxation, followed by the 2012 Williams v Commonwealth case, known as the school chaplains case, have created uncertainty around the ability of the federal government to directly fund local councils. Pape involved a challenge to the Rudd government's payment of bonuses to taxpayers in an attempt to stimulate the economy at a time of global financial downturn. As the Commonwealth has no express or implied power in the Constitution to directly fund local governments, the implication of Pape is that each instance of funding must be linked to a specific Commonwealth head of power. The Pape decision has cast sufficient doubt and restrictions on the ability of the Commonwealth to directly fund local government that a response to the High Court decision is needed. This bill, the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013, makes a simple amendment to section 96 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia to make specific provision in relation to the granting of financial assistance to local government bodies. The change was recommended by the expert panel, on which my former colleague former Senator Bob Brown was a member, and was also recommended by the parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government. It is based on extensive consultation with the community, with the states and with local councils.


There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that direct access to Commonwealth cash for ratepayers is what ratepayers want and is what the community wants. I have looked right around the country at the level of concern about the cost-shifting that goes on when the Commonwealth tries to fund things at the local government level and state governments get involved and the local council gets squeezed. One classic example is the Northern Territory, where the Commonwealth moved to try and provide money to Indigenous communities after the shire amalgamations. The Northern Territory government intervened and the result was that local government was left to fund the services that are necessary in those Indigenous communities, because no-one can sort out who is going to take responsibility and, while they are still arguing over it, local government has to actually deliver the services. This has to be sorted out, and the best way of sorting this out is not to leave local government having to explain which Commonwealth head of power the money relates to and therefore organise it in that way. Why don't we just make this straightforward and clear up this mess, get the state governments out of the way and directly fund what the Commonwealth chooses to fund or what local government and the Commonwealth negotiate? It is clear to me that that is what needs to happen. 


This is a minimalist change to section 96 of the Constitution. But we all know that agreement from all sides of government is essential if a referendum in Australia is to succeed. The two previous referenda held on recognition of local government failed, in 1974 and 1988, in part due to a lack of bipartisan support at that time. As I have indicated, the Greens are 100 per cent committed to securing financial recognition of local government in the Constitution, but it is pretty apparent now that there is not going to be tripartite support. It is clear that the coalition is not going to support the yes case. I think it is totally irresponsible for the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, to play politics with the local government referendum. As he knows, as we know, referenda are notoriously difficult to pass and we need cross-party support to have the best chance of getting this up in the community and explaining the case.


When the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, addressed the general assembly of the Local Government Association in 2011, he made a solemn pledge to back constitutional recognition for local government, provided it was minimalist and practical change which secured future federal funding without undermining a state's ability to create and sack councils. That is exactly what is happening. This could not be made more minimalist if you tried. This is yet another example of the Leader of the Opposition going out and giving false hope to a peak body. Everyone knew getting constitutional recognition for local government was part of the agreement between the Greens and the government. The Leader of the Opposition went to speak to ALGA and said yes—but now he is backing off at a great rate. Why is he backing off? Because he cannot get unity in his team. That is why—because there is a rump in the coalition which does not support constitutional recognition. 


This is a very interesting point and reflects what happened with the Tea Party and the Republicans in the US. When the Tea Party got control of some states, they had moved so far to the right that they could not maintain unity and there was massive infighting. We are already seeing that happening now in the coalition over this local government issue. Barnaby Joyce, the National Party senator, is telling the Local Government Association right now that, were it not for him, the coalition would be out opposing the referendum. In fact they are out there opposing the referendum in spite of him—or with him, who knows? But they are opposing it. 


We saw that very clearly yesterday when Senator Brandis stood up in here and said they 'would not oppose the question being put'. That is a vastly different proposition. Do you support the referendum being held and the people being allowed to vote on it? That is one question. The second question is: do you support the proposition which is being put? Just lamely saying, 'Yes, we will support the question being put,' but not committing to actively going out and supporting the yes case is absolutely sabotaging the yes case. That is exactly what the coalition are currently doing. They are sabotaging the yes case.


I turn now to the fearmongering being done by Liberal state governments, supported by members of the coalition in some cases.



Opposition senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Moore
):  Order! Senators on my left, we have just had a full speech from Senator Bushby with no interruption at all. I ask that the same courtesy be shown to Senator Milne.




Senator MILNE:
  The fearmongering is putting the proposal in jeopardy. It is simply not true that the bill diminishes the role of the states—which is what is being claimed. Recognition in the Constitution does not alter the fact that local governments are created by and accountable to state governments. This is in the documentation. It shows quite clearly that the law continues to apply. If a state government wishes to sack a council because of malfeasance, corruption or whatever, they will still be entitled to do so. State governments under the law are able to do that and what is being proposed does not put that in jeopardy. 


As I said, what is being proposed meets exactly the criteria for support the coalition leader, Tony Abbott, set out. He said he would support the proposal if it were minimalist practical change which secured future federal funding without undermining a state's ability to create and sack councils. That is exactly what is on the table.


The allocation of funding for the yes and no campaigns reflects the overwhelming bipartisan support for the referendum in the House of Representatives. We understand that the Local Government Association will be driving the yes campaign and I look forward to getting out and engaging with the community to support that campaign. 


Clearly it is time for the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, to get out there and make a very clear statement. If he does not intend to support the yes case, he should get out there and tell local government and the community that he is not going to and he should explain why. He should not allow this murky mess—people hearing them say that they will not oppose the question being put. That is a very interesting way of putting their position. It will confuse people into thinking it means that they are backing the proposition—when clearly they are not. It is, in my view, sneaky language. We want clear language from the coalition on this matter.


The coalition have been talking about the proposed funding model as if there were some longstanding precedent for how referenda are funded. That is not the case. For the referendum on Australia becoming a republic, $7½ million was provided for each of the yes and no campaigns and $4½ million was provided for a neutral general education campaign. Before that, referenda had been funded by the Australian Electoral Commission. For the 1988 referendum on local government, parliamentary terms et cetera, the government of then Prime Minister Hawke tried to run a government funded advertising campaign, but the High Court found that this meant that the government was, in effect, running the yes campaign, so the advertising was stopped. There is a long history and various ways of managing the funding issue have been tried. 


In this case, the expert panel had a look at all the ways previous referenda had been funded—or not funded, noting that there is not a long history of Commonwealth government funding of referenda. The expert panel recommended the funding model which is before the Senate. They did so on the basis of advice from submissions that, without a strong campaign, the risk of the referendum failing is high. The expert panel, on page 2 of their  report:


The majority of panel members support a referendum in 2013 subject to two conditions: first, that the Commonwealth negotiate with the States to achieve their support for the financial recognition option; and second, that the Commonwealth adopt steps suggested by ALGA necessary to achieve informed and positive public engagement with the issue, as set out in the section of this report on the concerns about a failed referendum.


We also know that the Local Government Association proposed that the Commonwealth apportion the funds for the yes and no cases for each referendum based on those parliamentarians voting for and against the bill, and that this funding be equivalent to that provided for elections. That is the basis on which this funding has been determined; it is the recommendation by both the expert panel and the Local Government Association.


In my view it is critical that we clarify that this is not an excuse for state governments to beat up all these fake arguments. There is a lot of discussion around Australia about what a mess Commonwealth-state relations are in. There is a lot of criticism of the COAG process, and rightly so. I have said a million times that the COAG process is the big black hole that government shoves issues into to have them disappear off the political agenda. They stay in COAG forever and if they emerge, years later, they are nothing like what was put in there. 


Around the country people are asking why is there such a poor relationship between the federal and state governments on a whole range of matters. That has come up recently in relation to fixing the mining tax, and many people said it was time we had a rewrite of Commonwealth-state relations, particularly in terms of financial engagement and relationships. State governments are panicking that, if local government gets recognition in the Constitution and local government and the federal government can negotiate directly and on their own terms for particular programs, state governments will be sidelined—they will have less of an ability to cost-shift and less of an ability to muddy the waters so that local government has to pick up the remnants of whatever programs are on offer. The states are feeling quite threatened by this process because it is going to put into the minds of people the question: what is it that state governments actually do in their constituencies? Rather than beat up scare campaigns, state governments have to prove their worth to their local constituencies, and that is a good thing.


Let us have the debate about Commonwealth-state relations, but do not let us mix that up with getting rid of the uncertainty that is already there about the Commonwealth and local government relationship. I am sure that, around the country, people are making it absolutely clear that into the future they want the Commonwealth to continue to be able to fund a number of services that local government regard as critical in the community. The community need to get the right information about the minimalist nature of the change and be reassured that it is not going to change a state government's ability to oversee how local government is being managed and they can sack a council if there is corruption or malfeasance. We can then have a vigorous debate around Australia. 


If the coalition come out and sabotage this by running a no case, they will destroy this and the next federal government, of whatever colour, will be dealing with this very uncertainty and is likely to be facing the outcome of High Court challenges in relation to funding. Frankly, their actions are totally irresponsible and they show yet again that when the Leader of the Opposition says something, even when he writes it down in a speech, you cannot believe it—a couple of years later he will be back and changing that undertaking or abandoning it altogether. I urge the coalition to come out and be clear and front up with the Australian people. The Australian Greens are going to support the yes case. What is the coalition going to do?

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (17:56):  I wish to speak in support of the no case for the referendum for recognition of local government in the Australian Constitution. Senator Milne has just talked about a rump in the Liberal Party which opposes the constitutional recognition of local government. Last year at the federal council of the Liberal Party in Melbourne a motion was passed almost unanimously opposing the constitutional recognition of local government. That involved most state divisions of the Liberal Party; it was far from a rump of the Liberal Party opposing the constitutional recognition of local government.


I am against the constitutional recognition of local government because I believe such an amendment is unnecessary as Commonwealth government funding can be provided to the states for any purposes including under section 96 of the Constitution. This referendum, while portrayed as involving a simple amendment to the Constitution, could seriously undermine our federalist system. It is claimed that a 12-word addition to section 96 of the Constitution is required to preserve, for example, Roads to Recovery. I do not think they are necessary, but the additional words proposed are 'to any local government body formed by a law of a state.' 


These 12 words may seem simple but the implications of their incorporation in the federal Constitution are not. In fact, the incorporation of these words could completely alter our federalist system of government, which has served Australia well since 1901, by leading to a complete change in the relationship between the central government—the Commonwealth—and the state governments, with an increase in the role of local governments in governance at the expense of the state governments. While some people may think this is a good idea, I point out that Australia is a vast country with widely differing regions and small communities whose needs are much more completely understood by their state government than by a government in distant Canberra. 


The concept of federalism was, and I understand still is, that the Commonwealth has certain designated powers while the state governments, which are effectively regional governments, look after all the other matters such as health, regional development and education. With the states ceding the taxing power to the Commonwealth as an emergency measure during World War II, and the Commonwealth since then retaining that role, the financial relationship between the states and the Commonwealth has changed since Federation so that some Commonwealth funding is provided through the states to local government for many of the services which affect our lives.


It is important to remember that local government was deliberately left out of the Constitution by our founding fathers because local government was regarded as an administrative extension of state governments not having a relationship with the Commonwealth, and so it remains today, in effect. Also, let us remember that it was the states which formed the Federation and that the states, as the governments of the differing regions of Australia, remain the cornerstone of our system of government.


Why, one must ask, is this question being put again when it has been defeated three times already under ALP governments? Firstly, in 1944 under Curtin; again, specifically on local government, under Whitlam in 1974; and more recently, under the Hawke government. What is behind this, one might well ask? It has been ALP policy since the 1920s to effectively replace the state governments with a series of regional councils directly funded from Canberra, even though it is patently obvious that the existing state governments are best placed to have the resources to service their regions. In January this year, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke called for the abolition of the states, so demonstrating that the ALP policy on the abolition of the states has not changed since 1920.


This 2013 referendum proposal is based on the view that the so-called Pape case raises doubt about the Commonwealth's ability to provide funding to local government. However, the Hon. Michael Mischin, Attorney General of Western Australia, has written that, in his view, the Pape case does not preclude the Commonwealth from providing direct funding to local governments for two reasons. Firstly, the Commonwealth can directly appropriate money for local government 'where the expenditure is for purposes within existing Commonwealth powers, which have been expansively interpreted by the High Court'. Secondly, Attorney General Mischin states: 


Pape does not limit other avenues of funding such as section 96 grants of financial assistance.


He further states that 'the Commonwealth's ability to fund local government by this mechanism is effectively unlimited'. Attorney General Mischin goes on to state that 'the Pape decision, especially in constitutional law matters, is open to varying and different interpretations' and this highlights the potential problem of adding what ALGA describes as '12 simple words to the Constitution'—namely, that the High Court may find unexpected references, intentions and meanings in additional words added to the Constitution which may take years of litigation to clarify and the outcome of course may not be what was expected.


In my opinion, it is extremely naive to think that the addition of any words to the Constitution is a simple matter. A great example of this has been the High Court's interpretations of the external affairs powers of the Constitution, which has enabled the Commonwealth to greatly expand its jurisdiction within Australian society. I repeat that, according to the WA Attorney General, no doubt on the advice of the crown law department, there is no impediment under section 96 to the Commonwealth providing funds to the states for local government purposes. So if there is no restriction to the provision of funds by the Commonwealth to the states, what is the point of a third referendum from the ALP to write local government into the Constitution unless it is to progress the long-term ALP policy of sidelining the states? 


Attorney General Mischin's views on this are supported by a number of eminent constitutional lawyers, including Professor Greg Craven, who has argued:


It will be sold as a modest change that will boost funding for local governments, but it's really about expanding commonwealth power.


It's like a scorpion, small but lethal.


Professor Anne Twomey has argued:


The sting is in the tail—the 'terms and conditions'. This means that the Commonwealth can intervene in any area of state responsibility, such as health or education, by placing conditions on its funding to the state.


Further, Professor Cheryl Saunders has argued:


We should think again on the terms of 'recognition' of local government by constitutional referendum in September … This is not a good idea. It is correct, as several premiers have argued, that it undermines the authority of the states in areas of state responsibility. The muddle that is Commonwealth-state relations, which urgently needs sorting, should not be further complicated by a measure of this kind.


There are a few other points which need to be referred to and which already have been to some extent in this debate. Firstly, referendum information will not be posted to the registered addresses of an elector but will go as 'to the householder' mail, where in my opinion it is likely to be thrown out unread. One must ask, if that is the case, could it be that the proponents of the legislation do not acknowledge that electors have a right to be informed before voting and they simply hope that people will go along and donkey-vote, and perhaps enough will vote yes for this to get through? I think it is a very real and severe criticism of the government that they are not proposing to post the material to the electors' official addresses. 


Some question whether equal funding will be provided to the yes and no cases. Again, I think that if there is not equal funding, as it appears there will not be, that is a very a severe criticism of the government and clearly shows their bias for the yes case, in that the yes case funding will run into millions of dollars whereas I believe there is barely half a million dollars for official material for the no case.


In conclusion, it is my view as a committed federalist that the states remain the best-equipped entities to look after the diverse interests of the many and diverse regions of Australia precisely because they are the regional governments across this huge continent of ours, not bureaucrats based in Canberra. Accordingly, I hope this referendum will be defeated. I think the old aphorism 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' very much applies to this case.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (18:08):  Our Constitution must be treated with respect. With the way the Gillard Labor government has handled this proposal to conduct a referendum on the recognition of local government in the Constitution, it is treating our Constitution with contempt. No government should initiate any change to our Constitution lightly. Any change to our Constitution should be based on broad community consensus; it should be based on strong bipartisan support; it should be conducted in a way that is consistent with one of our greatest democratic values, procedural fairness; and, where a proposed constitutional change has implications for the states, it should be based on a broad consensus with the state governments.


No government should try to buy a change to our Constitution or stack the decks in favour of one argument over another, using taxpayers' money to fund its side of the argument while effectively ignoring, deliberately disadvantaging and discriminating against the alternative case. Typically, and true to form, the Gillard Labor government has completely mismanaged the process leading to the proposal before the Senate today. Typically, its handling has been divisive, ham fisted and mostly focused on the pursuit of base political objectives in the lead-up to a difficult election for the government, rather than on the genuine pursuit of the national interest and genuine constitutional reform. No change to our Constitution should be pursued on that basis. No change to our Constitution should be pursued like this.


This proposal for a change to our Constitution, to be put at the next election, has of course been put twice to the Australian people before over the past few decades. The Australian people have defeated this proposal twice before. The Gillard government, in the way it has approached this proposal for constitutional change, has not made a case to the Australian people that they should change their minds. In seeking to legislate this referendum at this late stage, as the Gillard government is seeking to do, and in seeking to favour the yes case at taxpayers' expense along the way, without having made the case for change, there is no doubt in my mind that the Australian people will return the same verdict as they have in relation to such Labor proposals in the past.


There is no broad community consensus. There is no strong bipartisan support. There is no consensus with state governments. And, contrary to Senator Milne's inaccurate and misleading assertions earlier, there is not even consensus with the Labor-Greens state government in Tasmania. There is not even total support for this change across local government. The Gillard government, by pursuing this proposal now and in this way, is also ignoring the advice of its own Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government. The government's own panel made this referendum subject to two key conditions. No. 1 is:


… that the Commonwealth negotiate with the States to achieve their support …


The Gillard Labor government has not. No. 2 is: 


… that the Commonwealth adopt steps … to achieve informed and positive public engagement with the issue …


The Gillard Labor government has not. Even those who strongly support this referendum, including the government's own expert panel, made the point that certain things should happen first. But they did not happen. That is of course why this referendum legislation should not be pursued at this time—certainly not now and certainly not in this way. On the best available interpretation, the Gillard government has left it too late to put the case for changing our Constitution to the Australian people properly and in time, because of its characteristic incompetence. It is more likely that the recommendations of the expert panel were deliberately and consciously ignored.


Even the Australian Electoral Commission, the objective and independent statutory arbiter when it comes to the proper conduct of contested elections and referenda, warned the Gillard government not to pursue a change to our Constitution at this election if it were initiated after 1 March this year. The Australian Electoral Commission pointed out that if it started referendum related preparations after 1 March, it would leave:


… insufficient, or no, time in a truncated timetable, that is one commencing 1 March 2013 …


It is now 19 June 2013, more than three months after that date, and the election, on the current timetable, is less than three months away. The Australian Electoral Commission also pointed out that in rushing the process, by initiating it so late in the piece, the government is exposed to an elevated level of criticism by stakeholders and the wider public of the way that voters are not effectively informed that the advertising campaign is biased to one side. And of course, since then we have found out that the government is doing even more to inappropriately and unfairly stack the decks in favour of its own argument and against the alternative point of view.


Indeed, the Australian Electoral Commission said in its submission in relation to the expert panel inquiry that a truncated time frame like the one we have now will 'jeopardise the AEC election preparations'. That is pretty damning advice from the independent objective umpire, yet still the Gillard Labor government is pressing ahead—with a change to our Constitution no less—regardless. That is why the coalition's official position is that this referendum should not be proceeding at this time. It is too late to change the Constitution in an appropriate and respectable way. What we have said is that if, despite our objections, the government insists and persists with putting this legislation to a vote now, we will not oppose it, leaving the judgment and the merits and the question on changing the Constitution to the Australian people. But, of course, the government should not be pursuing a change to the Constitution in the way that they are doing now. It is not right.


We do support the principle of putting beyond doubt the capacity of the Commonwealth to provide direct financial assistance to local government. I am not convinced that this is the best way to do that. Importantly though, our position is that the next election should be a referendum on the world's largest carbon tax, Labor's failed mining tax and the incompetent Gillard Labor government—not on local government. We have made very clear that at this next election the coalition will be campaigning for a change of government, not for a change to the Constitution.


If this legislation passes, it will again be up to the Australian people to decide how they want to respond to the referendum question on local government, as they have before. I, along with my coalition colleagues, will be campaigning for a change of government that Australia so desperately needs, not for a change to the Constitution. As part of this second-reading debate the coalition is moving a very important amendment to force the government to provide equal funding for both the yes and the no cases. This should really be a no-brainer. There should not even be any argument about this. If the government does want to pursue this proposed change to our Constitution of course there should be equal funding for both the yes and the no cases. That is the established convention; that is the well-established precedent; that is what has happened in the past; that is what the Australian people would expect to happen.


If the Gillard government were truly interested in a genuine expression of the public will on this, that is what it would do. In fact, if our Prime Minister had any political judgment, even from her point of view, from the point of view of somebody who wants to achieve a successful yes vote, quite frankly the best thing she could have done would have been to ensure equal funding to both sides of the argument. In acting the way she has, the Prime Minister is offending Australians' highly developed sense of fair play. She is feeding people's natural distrust of government by pursuing change to the Constitution in this way. In acting the way she has, the Prime Minister has further undermined her own cause and, again, divided the nation.


As well as treating our Constitution with contempt by basing its decision on how much funding to allocate to each case only on the vote in the House of Representatives, the government is also treating the Senate with contempt. No senator in this chamber should allow themselves to be complicit in this. No self-respecting senator would allow themselves to be complicit in this.


To summarise, a change to our Constitution should not be pursued in the way the Gillard government is pursuing. We do not approve of the way the Gillard government has handled this. Given how late we are in the electoral cycle, this should not be happening. If the government insists on pressing ahead with this legislation, we have said that the coalition will not oppose it. However, we will be putting our trust in the Australian people to get this judgment right again, because at the next election we will not be campaigning for a change in our Constitution; we will be campaigning for a change of government. The next election should be a referendum on a very bad government which has well and truly lost its way, not on local government.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (18:20):  Following Senator Cormann, I am reminded that in politics adherence to principle is just about everything in public life. You can respect someone you disagree with if they have a principled position. It enables those who have strong views to frame the answers to very difficult questions, making them actually easier to resolve and satisfy.


I am one who will not compromise principles that I brought to this place, and that I believe are at the very heart of my political life—my political commitment—and my political party. They include a commitment to faith, stronger families, free enterprise, general freedom, our flag, our Federation and our Constitution. This bill, and I believe, the referendum and the question that is going to be put, undermines our Constitution. I think it undermines the principle of federalism. It is worth reflecting on the words of a Mr Holder from the 1898 debate at the Australasian Federal Convention:


… we have harmonized the interests of several states where they differed, and we have provided a Constitution sufficient to provide for the fullest and the most self-reliant government of a free people. We have created an instrument of partnership between us which, I believe, secures the independence of the several states, will provide for the joint control of certain matters, at the same time as it also leaves free and complete self-government on all matters not committed to the central authority.


There are those—some of my colleagues for whom I have tremendous respect—who have a view that times have changed since 1898, and indeed they have. But the principle that was applied at the formation of our Constitution to create a Commonwealth of Australia built upon the independence and success of the states was very, very clear, and I do not believe it should be undermined. I do not believe we should be centralising more power in Canberra, because, quite frankly, I think that political organisations that are closer to the people, like state governments and local councils, are often better connected about the needs and wants of a local community than a Canberra based politician or bureaucrat, or even the politicians here who assiduously stay in touch with their communities. They work together hand in hand, and each has a distinct and unique role.


I would also like to reflect on a submission to the Senate Select Committee on the Reform of the Australian Federation from the Council for the Australian Federation. They said:


Australia’s federal structure provides for a number of significant benefits that in fact outweigh [the] perceived costs:


The customisation of policies to meet local needs


Incentives to innovate and experiment in policy and service delivery


Supporting choice and diversity


Competition and comparison that supports continuous improvement


Greater scrutiny of national policies as a result of the need to achieve cooperation


Protection for the individual by checking the concentration of power.


They went on:


Importantly, the benefits of federalism do not preclude the development of national approaches to common problems. In addition, the federal structure allows for new ideas to be pioneered by one jurisdiction and, if successful, to be adopted by others.


As I mentioned before, I am opposed to the centralisation of power in Canberra. The writers of our Constitution recognised, during a critical time in the founding of our country, that the division and separation of powers was needed to help prevent the centralisation of power in any one place. This referendum seeks to change that system of checks and balances. It undermines the principles of federation. It undermines the principle of states' rights. The states, quite frankly, need to be accountable for how they conduct themselves in accordance with our constitutional road map, and they need to stop passing the buck to Canberra. But what concerns me about this constitutional amendment is that Canberra will now be dealing, supposedly, directly with local councils. That gives another arm of our government authorities around the country an opportunity not so much to be held to account but to pass the buck to Canberra.


I say to the Australian people that if you think Canberra can resolve all of your problems then you are not asking the right question, because more limited government is in our national interest. More trust in local authorities and communities to determine their own direction and self-direction and more responsibility and accountability from state governments will result in the better governance of your state. I simply have not bought the idea that a bureaucrat or an idea formulated in Canberra is somehow better than one formulated in your local community, because the Commonwealth does not know more about what is necessary in local council areas than local councils themselves.


I raise the issue because, with funding from any government—they are not benevolent institutions, let me tell you—there are always conditions. Conditions that the Commonwealth could impose could indeed override aspects of a council's self-determination. We have already have complaints in parts of South Australia that the state government is overriding or insisting upon changes to planning laws or regulations in some local council areas as a condition of funding. Let me tell you that the Commonwealth could intervene and interfere in issues such as that to a much greater and more substantive extent. Any number of strings could be attached to direct federal government funding to local councils, and this has all sorts of implications for local government decisions. Decision making can then be taken out of the hands of locals and passed up the line to someone sitting behind a desk in Canberra. That means Canberra's priorities will come first, rather than the local communities'.


As I said, there is a potential for even more buck passing between the three tiers of government. Of course, increased funding and promised efficiencies often do not appear. Extra funding agreements often mean extra regulations. The regulations increase costs and red tape. If there is one thing that this country needs less of it is red tape, quite frankly. The question is, who is ultimately going to end up footing the bill for higher costs and more bureaucracy? It is going to be the taxpayers and the ratepayers of Australia.


The other aspect of this referendum is that the current system actually works. It is not broken. There is nothing that stops the federal government from funding local councils through the traditional means that have always been available to it since the 1920s, and that is through the states. In fact, about 80 per cent of federal funding to local governments is provided through the states in this manner. In the last financial year, about $2 billion dollars was provided to local government by the Commonwealth using section 96 of the Constitution. There was also additional, direct funding to local government that bypassed the states but, nonetheless, that is not necessary to achieve outcomes. And why would we risk—or deliberately want to remove—the checks and balances that are inbuilt in our current system simply for political convenience and for an ideological agenda that is driven essentially by the left of the political spectrum, which seeks to impose its decisions and dominate the power-sharing arrangements, because it has not always used that system appropriately.


Mr Deputy President, let me make this point: if you want a more egregious example of the misuse and abuse of the power of the Commonwealth, then the bill before us today and the announcement by Mr Albanese about the inequitable funding for the yes/no case demonstrate the point entirely. There has been a consultation about a change to the Constitution, and yet what is being put by this government—and the wording—has changed significantly and substantively from what has been discussed, what has been researched, what has been workshopped and what we have had expert advice on. Constitutional experts have indicated that that has widespread implications for our constitution that have not been robustly tested. But—on a more base note—if we are trusting in the altruism of our Commonwealth and in the benevolence of acting the national interest, there are many examples I could give you where that has not been the case. But in every previous referendum where public funding has been provided, there has been equal funding for the yes case and the no case. You do not have to be on one side of the fence to think that that gives the Australian people a reasonable and fair shot at making the right decision. Let the advocates for either side put their case into the public arena on an equal footing and allow the Australian people to decide. Yet, somehow, fairness, equity, convention, tradition and decency have escaped this Labor government.


After a vote was taken in the House of Representatives, and after an agreement had been reached where the facilitation of this bill would go through and there would be registered but limited objection to it, simply so that the AEC, the Australian Electoral Commission, could prepare a case—a no case—Mr Albanese unilaterally announced that $10 million would be given to the no campaign. This is on top of other publicly funded propaganda, and funds that have been provided to external organisations to continue to prosecute the no case. Mr Albanese, in his benevolence, in his equity and in his compassion, gave $500,000—one-twentieth of the amount—to the people who are trying to protect and defend our constitution from those who seek to centralise power in Canberra and take it away from local communities. He said that this was based on the result of the vote. Well, Mr Albanese has ignored another fundamental principle of this place—that is, that the Senate is a very important part of our parliament. It is the states house. We should be sticking up for states' rights here, not undermining them. Yes, we have allegiance to our political parties; yes, we have allegiance to the national interest—but we are here because of the constituents in our states. For Mr Albanese to ignore the vote that is going to take place up here—to virtually say it does not matter—gives you an example of how those who have a flagrant disregard for the checks and balances built into our system, and those who have no respect for convention, for the traditions or for the institutions that have made this such a great country, will behave, should you give them virtually unfettered powers. No decent Australian can concede that there is somehow equity in a decision to fund a no case that benefits the government and, essentially, a decision not to fund to any substantive measure the counter-case, in dealing with our constitutional roadmap—our founding document. This is a document where the checks and balances were established because our forefathers knew exactly what could happen, should we allow power to concentrate in any one place.


I make the point for those who are on the yes side that there is no proof that local government would actually be any better off if this referendum passes. There is no proof whatsoever. There is no guarantee that they are going to receive any sort of special status or receive any more funding. According to the Constitutional Reform Unit at the Sydney Law School, overall, local government receives about 84 per cent of its funding from its own revenue sources—rates, service fees, investments and so on; about eight per cent is provided by the federal government; and a further eight per cent or thereabouts by the states. Yes, there are variations among different local councils; some are more reliant on the Commonwealth and state grants than others. However, councils that rely significantly on grants for more than 58 per cent of their revenue represent about 0.4 per cent of the population.


The other aspect of this, which I will touch on briefly in the time that I have left, is to reflect on the history of this particular issue in Australia. The Labor party have had a focused, consistent and diligent approach to trying to take power out of local communities and reinstate it in Canberra—they have been doing this since Gough Whitlam was Prime Minister. They have had two previous referendums on this very issue. The first was in 1974: it failed, with just 46 per cent of the vote, and only New South Wales voted in favour. The second referendum, in 1988, failed: it got just one-third of the vote and no states voted in favour of it. It seems as though now is to be 'third time lucky', except that the deck is stacked. The deck is stacked by the ideologues who are insistent upon grasping more power from local communities because they want to be able to tell them what is actually good for them. There has been no history of success of concentrating power in any country around the world.


We live in one of the best—if not the best—democracies anywhere in the world. That is because our Constitution has delivered strength and stability through the separation of powers. Whether that is by some quirk of fate, by grand design or by some inherent wisdom in our forefathers I cannot tell you.


Labor wants to overturn that. It thinks that the vessel of knowledge in the country resides somehow in this building. It does not. It resides in our communities; it resides in our local councils; it resides in our state governments; and it resides in every individual and family. They elect us to represent their interests. This is not in my community's interest and it is not in my state's interest. We cannot allow it to go through unchallenged. I am on the record as being opposed to this. If you were in any doubt, Mr Deputy President, I am opposed to this referendum. I accept that the question is going to be put. I feel deeply uncomfortable with the injustice that is being put upon the Australian people by the inequity of the decisions of Mr Albanese and the Labor Party.


I regret the haphazard, hasty and disingenuous manner in which this referendum question has been hustled through the parliament. As Senator Cormann said, the Australian people are not interested in rendering a verdict on giving more power to the people in here. They are interested in rendering a verdict on how the people in here have used, misused and abused the powers they already have. That is what we should be debating, discussing and advocating between now and 14 September. But, alas, a magnificent distraction to the tune of $10 million of public funding—plus many millions more—has been engineered.


I ask the Australian people to reflect upon their own interests. Are they happy with the way that our country has been governed over the last year, two years, three years, five years or six years? Ask yourself that question. Would it have been any different or any better if Canberra could make decisions about who was allowed to build a house in your community or in your street? Would it have been any better if, when you went to see your local councillor and asked them for advice or to get something done in your street, they had to refer it up the line to some bureaucrat in Canberra? Let me tell you: I do not think that it would be. I think the Australian people will emphatically reject this attempt to abuse and radically change our system of government in this country. I will be voting against it.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:40):  I rise to oppose the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) Bill 2013. I wish to put into the record the effect of the proposed change to section 96 of the Constitution should the referendum succeed. It would read:


During a period of 10 years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State, or to any local government body formed by a law of a State, on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit.


If thinking people around Australia, people associated with local government, and communities—particularly in the small-population states of Tasmania, Western Australia and especially South Australia—do not understand the statement 'on such terms and conditions as the parliament thinks fit' then I recommend very, very strongly that they examine it in more detail. That is because there could not be a more dangerous change to this Constitution for the people of the smaller states. In fact, it flies in the face of many of the aspects of the Constitution and, indeed, this chamber in which we sit—it being the states house.


As was presented by the professor of constitutional law at the University of Sydney, Professor Anne Twomey, there are four obstacles to the success of this referendum. They are firstly the need for popular support; secondly the unintended consequences that may emanate from it, thirdly the obvious question of whether it is necessary, and fourthly the question of whether it is for symbolic recognition only. As has been put by those who are interested in this subject, there are two benefit tests that must be applied: it must be demonstrated that there is a problem and it must be demonstrated that any change be seen as a benefit to solving that problem.


This referendum fails on both counts. There is no problem to solve, so by definition—ipso facto—there would be no benefit. So what are the proponents, particularly in local government associations around Australia, putting to their ratepayers as validation and justification for taking money out of ratepayers' pockets and putting it into the yes vote for this constitutional change? The first is that they believe in security of funding under section 96. But there is absolutely and utterly nothing that requires change. There is no guarantee that there would be any difference in the funding from the Commonwealth to local government should this amendment be passed, simply because of those words 'on such terms and conditions as the parliament thinks fit'. There is nothing in section 96 now that precludes the Commonwealth government from continuing to fund local governments as they have been funding them for many years.


The second justification is the argument about the High Court challenge in the Pape case. What the ratepayers of Australia need to understand is that Pape swung not on section 96 of the Constitution but on section 81. I was privileged to be a member of the Select Committee on the Reform of the Australian Federation, which reported to the Senate in June 2011. A lot of discussion took place around Pape. We had before us officers of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and also of Treasury. The department concluded: 


Taking into account the implications of the Pape decision, the Commonwealth remains able to make grants under its general powers in the Constitution as well as make payments to the states for purposes relevant to their responsibilities, which do include local government currently.


…   …   …   


The Treasury and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet reviewed the constitutionality of Commonwealth payments in the wake of the Pape case and, based on advice from the Attorney-General, found that payments could continue. A similar position was reached by the Western Australian Government and the Council for the Australian Federation.


So ALGA had got it wrong. Section 96 guarantees nothing, and Pape was never determined under section 96. The other case that they quote is, of course, Williams in the High Court. When Senator Brandis spoke so eloquently earlier in the chamber today on this matter, he made the observation that Williams did not turn on section 96. In fact, it was the opinion of the judges of the High Court that there was no legislative basis at all for the allocation of funds in Williams. I make the point in terms of road funding, because this is critically important funding. Roads to Recovery was commenced by the Howard government, continued by the Rudd and Gillard governments is paid under section 96. Those payments commenced in 1923 under section 96, and 90 years later the same payments are being made. Therefore, it is clearly obvious that there is no argument based on those from the Australian Local Government Association. 


I now turn to my own state and the Western Australian Local Government Association. Documentation that was presented recently made the observation by WALGA of what they are or are not seeking. The first thing they said was that they are not asking for Commonwealth takeover. The simple fact is that, under the Constitution at the moment, the Commonwealth has no powers over local governments—no powers at all; absolutely none. Yet what the government are proposing in this referendum is that they will accord to the Commonwealth, to the federal government, the opportunity to provide financial assistance to any local government on such terms and conditions as the parliament sees fit. They are unwittingly passing over to the Commonwealth powers that it currently does not have. Not only would it give Commonwealth some powers; it would give the Commonwealth exhaustive powers. As time develops in this particular contribution, I will make that point more obviously. 


The second thing they said was that they are not seeking exemption from state control. They need only go to section 109 of the Constitution, which speaks the title 'Inconsistency of laws', and I quote: 


When a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid. 


The local government in WA are saying here that they are not seeking exemption from state control, yet they are passing a circumstance into fact where the Commonwealth would actually have power over the states. 


The third thing that WALGA said is that they are not pursuing symbolic recognition. It has been said in the past that local government is the foundation of democracy and 'if it fails, democracy will fail'—to quote Robert W Flack. Whether they intend it or whether they do not, the very thing that they are doing with this move, according to symbolic recognition or not, is that they are placing at severe risk local government as we know it in this country today. They are also saying that they do not want to interfere in any way with the Commonwealth Financial Assistance Grants. Once again, I come back to the words of the proposed changes to the Constitution and I warn WALGA and those who are the ratepayers around Western Australia that it is the very thing that they are doing. They are putting at risk the possibility of the Commonwealth in its Financial Assistance Grants. 


They claim it would only lead to minimal expansion of Commonwealth powers. The simple fact at the moment is that, under the Constitution, because local government does not exist, the Commonwealth has no powers. If they think that all they are doing is giving minimal powers, I will in continuation of this debate speak about the relationship between Mr Rudd and Premier Barnett and Ms Gillard and Premier Barnett on health and education.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! The time for this debate has now expired. Senator Back, you are in continuation. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013</title>,BILLS,19,1
"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:16):  I rise to speak to the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013 bill. Local government, councils, shires and municipalities right across Australia are an extremely important part of our national governance framework. Despite the fact that there are clear examples of major problems with councils being run by bad or just incompetent people, on the whole local government has delivered good grassroots local solutions to local problems and will continue to do so regardless of the outcome of this bill or the consequent referendum. 


Like all of levels of government, sometimes the solutions can be worse than the problems, and my role as deputy chair of the Coalition Deregulation Taskforce has certainly seen plenty examples of that thrown up at the local government level. But tackling red and green tape is to the most extent a separate issue to that we are looking at in this place today. So let me make it clear: I am a supporter of local government and the good work done by its elected representatives and employees right across the country, but particularly in regional and rural Australia. It is important that local decisions are made by local bodies that understand the issues from a local perspective. However, it is for that very reason that I am opposed to the change to Australia's Constitution that this bill proposes to put to the people. 


Despite my opposition to that change, I would not necessarily, in principle, be opposed to the passing of this bill if the consequent question had been treated appropriately to ensure the likelihood that the Australian people were as best prepared as possible to make a fully informed decision. But this clearly will not be the case. As deputy chair of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government, I enjoyed the opportunity to hear from constitutional experts, bureaucrats, local governments and other interested parties throughout the inquiry process, which ended earlier this year. What was patently obvious to me from that inquiry was that the government has seriously mishandled the process leading up to the announcement of this referendum. Putting aside the subject matter of this proposed referendum for a minute, it is my view that no proposed change to our constitution should be put to the people unless all practical and reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that the Australian people are best equipped to make its decision on that question on a fully informed basis.


Our constitution is a core pillar, providing support for the robust and stable democracy that is Australia, which is now one of the oldest democracies in the world. Stability of government, combined with strong adherence to the rule of law, is a rare thing, and the fact that we as a nation have achieved that for so long, at least in large measure, is because our constitution works. Although I recognise change may from time to time be desirable or even necessary, I firmly believe we should not promote change to our constitution lightly and certainly not on an uninformed basis. I suspect Australians inherently agree, and this is why referenda questions have so often failed to get up. The evidence also suggests that where people do not have the benefit of a full understanding of the question, their tendency is to vote no, and this possibly also reflects the inherent understanding of Australians that the document does work for Australia and they are not going to agree to change it unless they are absolutely convinced that there is very good reason. 


The question of some form of recognition of local government in our constitution has been in the public discourse for decades. Indeed, the question has been put in referenda in 1974 and 1989—both times failing. However, in recent times two factors have driven the renewal of this debate and have ultimately led to this bill being before this place today. The first is the impact of the Pape and Williams High Court cases, the decisions in which cast serious doubt over the constitutionality of some forms of direct funding of local government programs by the Commonwealth. The issues raised by these cases are real and not disputed by any mainstream constitutional experts, including those who do not support this proposed change. However, as I will touch on later, their impact does not, in my view, pose any threat to ongoing funding of local government programs by the Commonwealth, as constitutionally valid methods of doing so continue to exist. 


The second driver is the deal done by the Independents and the Greens with the government in order to obtain confidence on the floor of the other place following the last election, which included the government agreeing to put the question we are looking at today to the people during the term of this parliament. As mentioned, I have a view of the advisability of agreeing to that question and will be voting accordingly, if required to, on referendum day. As such, that view also informs my decision that this bill should not be passed. But, as I firmly believe in democracy, I would be far less stridently opposed to the passage of this bill and the posing of the question if, indeed, the process leading up to today had been properly handled. As it has not, I have far less confidence that the Australian people will have the necessary exposure to and understanding of the arguments for and against to make a fully informed decision. My lack of confidence is only enhanced by the fact that the government has taken the unprecedented step of grossly, disproportionately funding the yes case compared to the tiny amount made available for the no campaign. Precedent, indeed the law as it stood, required equal public funding on issues of constitutional change, reflecting the very serious nature of asking people to consider changing the document at the foundation of our democracy.


It is bad enough that the government has decided to fund it disproportionately, but it is a real snub to the Senate that it has chosen to set that proportionality only on the basis of the vote on the floor of the other place. The other place and this place are treated equally in terms of constitutional change. Deciding to ignore the result of the coming vote in this place when setting the proportions exposes the contempt Labor has for the Senate and the vital role it plays in our democracy.


Let us take a look at what has occurred since September 2010 when the government agreed with the Greens and Independents to hold a referendum on this issue. In August 2011 the government formed the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government to identify options for the constitutional recognition of that level of government and to report on the level of support for such recognition among stakeholders and across the broader general community. The expert panel's final report in December 2011 stated that:


The majority of panel members support a referendum in 2013 subject to two conditions: first, that the Commonwealth negotiate with the States to achieve their support for the financial recognition option; and second, that the Commonwealth adopt steps suggested by ALGA necessary to achieve informed and positive public engagement with the issue, as set out in the section of this report on the concerns about a failed referendum … Steps include allocating substantial resources to a major public awareness campaign and making changes to the referendum process.


As such, the expert panel was supportive of a 2013 referendum on financial recognition of local government through a change to section 96 of the Constitution provided those two conditions were met. The first condition was negotiation with the states to achieve their support for the government's proposed question. The second was to take steps as recommended by ALGA to achieve informed and positive public engagement with the issue.


The expert panel's final report was delivered in December 2011, almost two years prior to the latest possible date for the next federal election. As at that date, the government had plenty of time to ensure that it took that blueprint, put it in place and proceeded to put the question to a voting public that had been properly equipped with the benefit of a full public education campaign on all the issues. Interestingly, at the first hearing of the select committee in mid-January 2013, evidence was received that even given the latest possible date for an election, then being late November 2013, the prospects of meeting the preconditions set by the government's own expert panel in time to hold the referendum at the same time as the election were not high. This was back in January. Given the nominated date of the election and the time that has since elapsed, the prospect of those preconditions being fully met by 14 September this year is nigh on impossible. As such, a referendum held in conjunction with this year's federal election will almost certainly be held in an environment where potential conditions of stakeholders, including the states, have not been met and where the opportunity to fully inform the voting public through public education and other avenues has not been fully realised.


The independent Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government was appointed in August 2011 by the Labor government. It is important to note here the delay of some 12 months or one-third of the current term of the parliament before the government got around to the first stage of addressing the issue. The panel, however, did its job expeditiously, consulted nationally and considered feedback it received from Australians before handing its report to the government in December 2011, some three months later.


As mentioned, amongst other findings, the expert panel recommended a number of preconditions be met before proceeding and that the government get busy on ensuring that they were met as quickly as possible. As far as anyone can tell, no action took place towards satisfying those conditions for almost 12 months. One of the recommendations of the panel was the establishment of a joint select parliamentary committee to examine certain issues. The government dragged its heels, not establishing this committee until 1 November 2012, some 11 months after the delivery of the final report of its expert panel. The timing necessarily meant that, once members were appointed and preliminaries taken care of, the work of the select committee would not be completed until well into 2013. This is in fact what occurred with the final report not being delivered until March of this year. As such, the government has demonstrated an extraordinary lack of action to advance the case and cause of this question in a responsible and considered manner. In particular, even recognising the delay in getting up the expert panel, it failed then to follow the panel's recommendations and put in place the preconditions for success it highlighted and that were strongly and publicly supported by other stakeholders, such as the Australian Local Government Association.


It was some months after the March 2013 delivery of the joint select committee's final report which urged specific activities be undertaken—again, they were not acted upon—before the government acted to bring legislation before this parliament. As a direct consequence, the time remaining between now and 14 September is likely to be insufficient to put in place the necessary mechanics, education campaigns and other measures highlighted by expert witnesses and bureaucrats as necessary to ensure a fully informed outcome for the referendum question. I am strongly of the opinion that this, like any referendum, should only be considered once a full and proper public education campaign has been conducted.


There is strong conclusive evidence that program-specific funding which the Commonwealth currently provides directly to local government may still be provided in full via existing avenues that are constitutionally valid. As such, it is my view that this backs the argument of the existence of valid alternative funding pathways to address the funding uncertainty introduced by the recent High Court cases. This then supports the argument for a reduced imperative to pursue constitutional change. The public should be aware of all such arguments before making their decision.


Of course, the great irony is that history shows that when Australians are not fully informed on referendum questions and feel they do not really know enough to make an informed decision they vote no. This is a rational approach and, as mentioned, reflects an inherent and desirable conservatism when it comes to changing a document that is so fundamental to our nation's democratic success. So in their failure to address the issue in a timely manner, the government may well be assisting those of us who do not think this is the answer to the issue raised by the High Court cases. Indeed, it is my view that the failure of the government to take timely action to seek to satisfy the expert panel's recommendations severely undermines the prospects of success and raises questions about the advisability of spending some $50-odd million of taxpayers' funds on posing the question when the timing is now so clearly wrong. This financial expenditure, together with the risk of a lack of informed and positive public engagement with the issue, appears to be unnecessary given the alternative pathways to ensuring ongoing local government program funding should the direct model in fact be successfully challenged in the courts.


I will now go to another of the expert panel's conditions that was considered vital to be met before any referendum on this issue was put to the people. Australia is a federation of states and, as the evidence placed before the joint committee attests, the support of state governments can make or break referenda. If state governments have been largely opposed to the change, history proves it has been very difficult for referenda of the past.


The expert panel made it clear in December 2011—a long time ago—that negotiations with the states were required to develop a proposal that would attract their support. The committee was told, however, that the government position was that negotiation could not occur with the states until a proposal was developed. But the reality is that the government failed to make best use of the time available to it since December 2011 by failing to undertake such negotiations and that this delay has potentially undermined the prospect of a full and informed referendum proposition being put in 2013. In any event, the expert panel put forward a proposed set of words in its final report in December 2011, and this could and should have formed a starting point for such negotiations at that time. ALGA further refined those words in an attempt to allay concerns voiced by some states. Yet the government again failed to use the refined words as a starting point. We are now less than three months from the nominated date for the election, with neither of the two conditions recommended by the expert panel having been satisfied, despite great opportunity for real and determined attempts to deliver them.


The committee's preliminary report was tabled on 24 January this year, and all members of that committee strongly recommended urgent action to engage state and territory governments. Yet nothing was done until sometime around mid-February, around three weeks later, with a request for responses by 4 March 2013. The three-week delay in getting these letters out, in the face of such short time lines and the work needed to be done to conduct a meaningful referendum, when combined with their previous lackadaisical approach to actioning this issue, raises questions in my mind about the government's commitment to meeting the preconditions set by the expert panel—and ALGA—and, hence, their commitment to success of the question. As the government now intend to proceed to hold the referendum together with the 2013 election, it would be open for one to conclude that they are setting the question up to fail or, at the very least, posing the question with a reckless disregard for its success, with their main objective being able to say that they kept their promise to hold the referendum—or maybe their gross imbalance in funding is their attempt to make up for their past failures in this process. Who knows? 


Despite the inexplicable delays by the minister in seeking to meaningfully engage with the states on this issue, state governments are known to have made statements and comments that are, to some degree, indicative of their thoughts on the referendum question. It is unclear at this point whether any states will be campaigning actively in favour of the referendum, and there almost certainly will be states that will be campaigning actively against the referendum. On the whole, the state concerns seem mostly to relate to the potential impact of proposed constitutional change on state governments' relationships with local government. For example, one state which forwarded correspondence to the committee was concerned that the proposed amendment might later be found by the High Court to give rise to an implied constitutional obligation on the states to maintain particular systems of local government. Evidence received, particularly by constitutional experts at the first hearing, suggested that such concerns may hold some basis. But, if the concerns of some state governments are justified, the acceptance of the proposed constitutional change could have an impact that extended further than intended. This would be a concern to me and underlines why I do not support the proposition itself. Nevertheless, the abject failure of the government to implement detailed engagement with all the states and territories to address and negotiate through any concerns they may hold has undoubtedly contributed to the current level of opposition to or distrust of the proposed change. 


As mentioned, decisions made by Australians in relation to potential changes to the Constitution should always be made on as fully informed a basis as possible. The desirability of the public being well informed regarding potential constitutional change is even more important given that all Australian citizens are required to vote in a referendum. As such, it is not just those who have taken an active interest in the question but those who are notably disinterested who are required to make the decision. I consider that prior to a change in the Constitution being put to the people, parliament should take all reasonable steps to maximise the likelihood that all voting Australians understand the question and have an opportunity to thoroughly consider the yes and the no arguments before making a decision, including those who would otherwise be disinterested. 


The constitutional experts who appeared at the hearing provided support for the conclusion that inaction by the government has amplified risks. For example, Professor Williams stated at the hearing in mid-January:


But it is a risky course—I certainly agree with that—and not the most desirable course, either. The most desirable course would be that, by this point, more work would have been done over the past months to actually build the level of public recognition, to get the support on board. It is dreadfully late and that itself is a major problem. 


Bear in mind that that statement was made five months ago. There were a number of other constitutional experts, including those who were actually supportive of the need for the change, who agreed that more time was needed. Professor Brown indicated that, in his view, you needed more than six months to actively and positively engage with the public, yet here we are with less than three months to go. As such, I remain to be convinced that the time left is sufficient to be able to do the proposed constitutional change justice by ensuring a fully informed decision is made. This outcome is even less likely given the announcement this week of the extraordinary decision to not fund the yes/no case equally.


As noted, the committee received constitutional evidence that clearly demonstrates that avenues exist for funding currently provided directly to local government to still be provided in full, even in the face of potential judicial findings that some direct payments are not constitutional. The most obvious avenue is through grants through the states, tied on the basis that they must be both passed on in full and subject to use for the programs currently funded, or as directed under future Commonwealth-local government programs. I acknowledge that this may be a less clean avenue than direct payment but accept the evidence that options such as this are constitutional, are available, were the primary source of funding for most of the time since 1901 and that, accordingly, there is no potential risk of loss of funding to local government eventuating from further developments following the Pape and Williams cases. This risk is the argument that has been put forward by most stakeholders as the reason for the need for change. It is, with the greatest respect, clearly a furphy. 


The threat of further High Court cases which undermine the constitutionality of some payments by the Commonwealth directly to local government are real and likely to succeed in certain circumstances. However, there is no dispute amongst constitutional experts that this in no way limits the ability of the Commonwealth to continue to fund local government through clearly constitutionally valid avenues, primarily through section 96 of the Constitution—that is, through the states—and would have no impact whatsoever on direct funding in areas of clear Commonwealth responsibility.


I consider this proposal is counter to the interests of local government local decision making, can certainly lead to the undermining of state powers and to a further centralisation of power in Canberra and that it should not be supported. (Time expired)

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-06-19,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:37):  Well, there goes another coalition no—to the proposition that we should have a referendum to recognise local government in the Constitution. What a shame that is. There was so much hope when the Greens signed the agreement with the Labor government in 2010. One of the key parts of the agreement was that there be would be constitutional recognition for Australia's Indigenous people and constitutional recognition for local government. I am very proud of the work that has been done towards constitutional recognition of Australia's Indigenous people and I congratulate my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert, who has played a key role in advancing that, as a member of the expert panel that worked on the issue. We have respected the recommendation from that expert group to not proceed with a referendum on that matter at this time but to keep on working towards it—to delay it and in the meantime have the Recognise legislation. It is a really proud time, because it means that we have got one step further down the track towards Indigenous recognition.


The local government referendum is something that local governments have been campaigning for for a long time, and quite rightly. It is important that we recognise local government in the Constitution. The federal government provides grants to local councils to fund many programs. The one that the community is probably most familiar with is the Roads to Recovery program. Councils have warned that, without federal funding, residents will face either fewer services or higher rates. That is undoubted. Ratepayers are concerned and want to make sure that the federal government can work directly with local government and not have to mediate constantly through state governments. I will come to that a bit later.


The Australian Greens have listened carefully to those arguments and we are now standing with local government and the community to secure this important reform. Unlike the coalition, the Australian Greens are 100 per cent behind the yes campaign for the recognition of local government and will be campaigning for that. A yes vote in September, or whenever the election is held, would guarantee the federal government's ability to directly fund local government projects. As I mentioned before, everyone is well aware of the upgrade and repair work that Roads to Recovery has enabled to around 16,000 sites across the country. The federal government also helps to fund services like child care, sporting facilities, community facilities, swimming pools and libraries. The Australian Greens have pledged support for $10 million to fund and facilitate regional arts, many of those dollars to go towards assisting local government to employ cultural officers in their communities. A yes vote will guarantee those services, from which all Australians will benefit.


Why do we need this constitutional recognition? The 2009 High Court case Pape v Commissioner of Taxation, followed by the 2012 Williams v Commonwealth case, known as the school chaplains case, have created uncertainty around the ability of the federal government to directly fund local councils. Pape involved a challenge to the Rudd government's payment of bonuses to taxpayers in an attempt to stimulate the economy at a time of global financial downturn. As the Commonwealth has no express or implied power in the Constitution to directly fund local governments, the implication of Pape is that each instance of funding must be linked to a specific Commonwealth head of power. The Pape decision has cast sufficient doubt and restrictions on the ability of the Commonwealth to directly fund local government that a response to the High Court decision is needed. This bill, the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013, makes a simple amendment to section 96 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia to make specific provision in relation to the granting of financial assistance to local government bodies. The change was recommended by the expert panel, on which my former colleague former Senator Bob Brown was a member, and was also recommended by the parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government. It is based on extensive consultation with the community, with the states and with local councils.


There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that direct access to Commonwealth cash for ratepayers is what ratepayers want and is what the community wants. I have looked right around the country at the level of concern about the cost-shifting that goes on when the Commonwealth tries to fund things at the local government level and state governments get involved and the local council gets squeezed. One classic example is the Northern Territory, where the Commonwealth moved to try and provide money to Indigenous communities after the shire amalgamations. The Northern Territory government intervened and the result was that local government was left to fund the services that are necessary in those Indigenous communities, because no-one can sort out who is going to take responsibility and, while they are still arguing over it, local government has to actually deliver the services. This has to be sorted out, and the best way of sorting this out is not to leave local government having to explain which Commonwealth head of power the money relates to and therefore organise it in that way. Why don't we just make this straightforward and clear up this mess, get the state governments out of the way and directly fund what the Commonwealth chooses to fund or what local government and the Commonwealth negotiate? It is clear to me that that is what needs to happen. 


This is a minimalist change to section 96 of the Constitution. But we all know that agreement from all sides of government is essential if a referendum in Australia is to succeed. The two previous referenda held on recognition of local government failed, in 1974 and 1988, in part due to a lack of bipartisan support at that time. As I have indicated, the Greens are 100 per cent committed to securing financial recognition of local government in the Constitution, but it is pretty apparent now that there is not going to be tripartite support. It is clear that the coalition is not going to support the yes case. I think it is totally irresponsible for the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, to play politics with the local government referendum. As he knows, as we know, referenda are notoriously difficult to pass and we need cross-party support to have the best chance of getting this up in the community and explaining the case.


When the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, addressed the general assembly of the Local Government Association in 2011, he made a solemn pledge to back constitutional recognition for local government, provided it was minimalist and practical change which secured future federal funding without undermining a state's ability to create and sack councils. That is exactly what is happening. This could not be made more minimalist if you tried. This is yet another example of the Leader of the Opposition going out and giving false hope to a peak body. Everyone knew getting constitutional recognition for local government was part of the agreement between the Greens and the government. The Leader of the Opposition went to speak to ALGA and said yes—but now he is backing off at a great rate. Why is he backing off? Because he cannot get unity in his team. That is why—because there is a rump in the coalition which does not support constitutional recognition. 


This is a very interesting point and reflects what happened with the Tea Party and the Republicans in the US. When the Tea Party got control of some states, they had moved so far to the right that they could not maintain unity and there was massive infighting. We are already seeing that happening now in the coalition over this local government issue. Barnaby Joyce, the National Party senator, is telling the Local Government Association right now that, were it not for him, the coalition would be out opposing the referendum. In fact they are out there opposing the referendum in spite of him—or with him, who knows? But they are opposing it. 


We saw that very clearly yesterday when Senator Brandis stood up in here and said they 'would not oppose the question being put'. That is a vastly different proposition. Do you support the referendum being held and the people being allowed to vote on it? That is one question. The second question is: do you support the proposition which is being put? Just lamely saying, 'Yes, we will support the question being put,' but not committing to actively going out and supporting the yes case is absolutely sabotaging the yes case. That is exactly what the coalition are currently doing. They are sabotaging the yes case.


I turn now to the fearmongering being done by Liberal state governments, supported by members of the coalition in some cases.



Opposition senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Moore
):  Order! Senators on my left, we have just had a full speech from Senator Bushby with no interruption at all. I ask that the same courtesy be shown to Senator Milne.




Senator MILNE:
  The fearmongering is putting the proposal in jeopardy. It is simply not true that the bill diminishes the role of the states—which is what is being claimed. Recognition in the Constitution does not alter the fact that local governments are created by and accountable to state governments. This is in the documentation. It shows quite clearly that the law continues to apply. If a state government wishes to sack a council because of malfeasance, corruption or whatever, they will still be entitled to do so. State governments under the law are able to do that and what is being proposed does not put that in jeopardy. 


As I said, what is being proposed meets exactly the criteria for support the coalition leader, Tony Abbott, set out. He said he would support the proposal if it were minimalist practical change which secured future federal funding without undermining a state's ability to create and sack councils. That is exactly what is on the table.


The allocation of funding for the yes and no campaigns reflects the overwhelming bipartisan support for the referendum in the House of Representatives. We understand that the Local Government Association will be driving the yes campaign and I look forward to getting out and engaging with the community to support that campaign. 


Clearly it is time for the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, to get out there and make a very clear statement. If he does not intend to support the yes case, he should get out there and tell local government and the community that he is not going to and he should explain why. He should not allow this murky mess—people hearing them say that they will not oppose the question being put. That is a very interesting way of putting their position. It will confuse people into thinking it means that they are backing the proposition—when clearly they are not. It is, in my view, sneaky language. We want clear language from the coalition on this matter.


The coalition have been talking about the proposed funding model as if there were some longstanding precedent for how referenda are funded. That is not the case. For the referendum on Australia becoming a republic, $7½ million was provided for each of the yes and no campaigns and $4½ million was provided for a neutral general education campaign. Before that, referenda had been funded by the Australian Electoral Commission. For the 1988 referendum on local government, parliamentary terms et cetera, the government of then Prime Minister Hawke tried to run a government funded advertising campaign, but the High Court found that this meant that the government was, in effect, running the yes campaign, so the advertising was stopped. There is a long history and various ways of managing the funding issue have been tried. 


In this case, the expert panel had a look at all the ways previous referenda had been funded—or not funded, noting that there is not a long history of Commonwealth government funding of referenda. The expert panel recommended the funding model which is before the Senate. They did so on the basis of advice from submissions that, without a strong campaign, the risk of the referendum failing is high. The expert panel, on page 2 of their  report:


The majority of panel members support a referendum in 2013 subject to two conditions: first, that the Commonwealth negotiate with the States to achieve their support for the financial recognition option; and second, that the Commonwealth adopt steps suggested by ALGA necessary to achieve informed and positive public engagement with the issue, as set out in the section of this report on the concerns about a failed referendum.


We also know that the Local Government Association proposed that the Commonwealth apportion the funds for the yes and no cases for each referendum based on those parliamentarians voting for and against the bill, and that this funding be equivalent to that provided for elections. That is the basis on which this funding has been determined; it is the recommendation by both the expert panel and the Local Government Association.


In my view it is critical that we clarify that this is not an excuse for state governments to beat up all these fake arguments. There is a lot of discussion around Australia about what a mess Commonwealth-state relations are in. There is a lot of criticism of the COAG process, and rightly so. I have said a million times that the COAG process is the big black hole that government shoves issues into to have them disappear off the political agenda. They stay in COAG forever and if they emerge, years later, they are nothing like what was put in there. 


Around the country people are asking why is there such a poor relationship between the federal and state governments on a whole range of matters. That has come up recently in relation to fixing the mining tax, and many people said it was time we had a rewrite of Commonwealth-state relations, particularly in terms of financial engagement and relationships. State governments are panicking that, if local government gets recognition in the Constitution and local government and the federal government can negotiate directly and on their own terms for particular programs, state governments will be sidelined—they will have less of an ability to cost-shift and less of an ability to muddy the waters so that local government has to pick up the remnants of whatever programs are on offer. The states are feeling quite threatened by this process because it is going to put into the minds of people the question: what is it that state governments actually do in their constituencies? Rather than beat up scare campaigns, state governments have to prove their worth to their local constituencies, and that is a good thing.


Let us have the debate about Commonwealth-state relations, but do not let us mix that up with getting rid of the uncertainty that is already there about the Commonwealth and local government relationship. I am sure that, around the country, people are making it absolutely clear that into the future they want the Commonwealth to continue to be able to fund a number of services that local government regard as critical in the community. The community need to get the right information about the minimalist nature of the change and be reassured that it is not going to change a state government's ability to oversee how local government is being managed and they can sack a council if there is corruption or malfeasance. We can then have a vigorous debate around Australia. 


If the coalition come out and sabotage this by running a no case, they will destroy this and the next federal government, of whatever colour, will be dealing with this very uncertainty and is likely to be facing the outcome of High Court challenges in relation to funding. Frankly, their actions are totally irresponsible and they show yet again that when the Leader of the Opposition says something, even when he writes it down in a speech, you cannot believe it—a couple of years later he will be back and changing that undertaking or abandoning it altogether. I urge the coalition to come out and be clear and front up with the Australian people. The Australian Greens are going to support the yes case. What is the coalition going to do?

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (17:56):  I wish to speak in support of the no case for the referendum for recognition of local government in the Australian Constitution. Senator Milne has just talked about a rump in the Liberal Party which opposes the constitutional recognition of local government. Last year at the federal council of the Liberal Party in Melbourne a motion was passed almost unanimously opposing the constitutional recognition of local government. That involved most state divisions of the Liberal Party; it was far from a rump of the Liberal Party opposing the constitutional recognition of local government.


I am against the constitutional recognition of local government because I believe such an amendment is unnecessary as Commonwealth government funding can be provided to the states for any purposes including under section 96 of the Constitution. This referendum, while portrayed as involving a simple amendment to the Constitution, could seriously undermine our federalist system. It is claimed that a 12-word addition to section 96 of the Constitution is required to preserve, for example, Roads to Recovery. I do not think they are necessary, but the additional words proposed are 'to any local government body formed by a law of a state.' 


These 12 words may seem simple but the implications of their incorporation in the federal Constitution are not. In fact, the incorporation of these words could completely alter our federalist system of government, which has served Australia well since 1901, by leading to a complete change in the relationship between the central government—the Commonwealth—and the state governments, with an increase in the role of local governments in governance at the expense of the state governments. While some people may think this is a good idea, I point out that Australia is a vast country with widely differing regions and small communities whose needs are much more completely understood by their state government than by a government in distant Canberra. 


The concept of federalism was, and I understand still is, that the Commonwealth has certain designated powers while the state governments, which are effectively regional governments, look after all the other matters such as health, regional development and education. With the states ceding the taxing power to the Commonwealth as an emergency measure during World War II, and the Commonwealth since then retaining that role, the financial relationship between the states and the Commonwealth has changed since Federation so that some Commonwealth funding is provided through the states to local government for many of the services which affect our lives.


It is important to remember that local government was deliberately left out of the Constitution by our founding fathers because local government was regarded as an administrative extension of state governments not having a relationship with the Commonwealth, and so it remains today, in effect. Also, let us remember that it was the states which formed the Federation and that the states, as the governments of the differing regions of Australia, remain the cornerstone of our system of government.


Why, one must ask, is this question being put again when it has been defeated three times already under ALP governments? Firstly, in 1944 under Curtin; again, specifically on local government, under Whitlam in 1974; and more recently, under the Hawke government. What is behind this, one might well ask? It has been ALP policy since the 1920s to effectively replace the state governments with a series of regional councils directly funded from Canberra, even though it is patently obvious that the existing state governments are best placed to have the resources to service their regions. In January this year, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke called for the abolition of the states, so demonstrating that the ALP policy on the abolition of the states has not changed since 1920.


This 2013 referendum proposal is based on the view that the so-called Pape case raises doubt about the Commonwealth's ability to provide funding to local government. However, the Hon. Michael Mischin, Attorney General of Western Australia, has written that, in his view, the Pape case does not preclude the Commonwealth from providing direct funding to local governments for two reasons. Firstly, the Commonwealth can directly appropriate money for local government 'where the expenditure is for purposes within existing Commonwealth powers, which have been expansively interpreted by the High Court'. Secondly, Attorney General Mischin states: 


Pape does not limit other avenues of funding such as section 96 grants of financial assistance.


He further states that 'the Commonwealth's ability to fund local government by this mechanism is effectively unlimited'. Attorney General Mischin goes on to state that 'the Pape decision, especially in constitutional law matters, is open to varying and different interpretations' and this highlights the potential problem of adding what ALGA describes as '12 simple words to the Constitution'—namely, that the High Court may find unexpected references, intentions and meanings in additional words added to the Constitution which may take years of litigation to clarify and the outcome of course may not be what was expected.


In my opinion, it is extremely naive to think that the addition of any words to the Constitution is a simple matter. A great example of this has been the High Court's interpretations of the external affairs powers of the Constitution, which has enabled the Commonwealth to greatly expand its jurisdiction within Australian society. I repeat that, according to the WA Attorney General, no doubt on the advice of the crown law department, there is no impediment under section 96 to the Commonwealth providing funds to the states for local government purposes. So if there is no restriction to the provision of funds by the Commonwealth to the states, what is the point of a third referendum from the ALP to write local government into the Constitution unless it is to progress the long-term ALP policy of sidelining the states? 


Attorney General Mischin's views on this are supported by a number of eminent constitutional lawyers, including Professor Greg Craven, who has argued:


It will be sold as a modest change that will boost funding for local governments, but it's really about expanding commonwealth power.


It's like a scorpion, small but lethal.


Professor Anne Twomey has argued:


The sting is in the tail—the 'terms and conditions'. This means that the Commonwealth can intervene in any area of state responsibility, such as health or education, by placing conditions on its funding to the state.


Further, Professor Cheryl Saunders has argued:


We should think again on the terms of 'recognition' of local government by constitutional referendum in September … This is not a good idea. It is correct, as several premiers have argued, that it undermines the authority of the states in areas of state responsibility. The muddle that is Commonwealth-state relations, which urgently needs sorting, should not be further complicated by a measure of this kind.


There are a few other points which need to be referred to and which already have been to some extent in this debate. Firstly, referendum information will not be posted to the registered addresses of an elector but will go as 'to the householder' mail, where in my opinion it is likely to be thrown out unread. One must ask, if that is the case, could it be that the proponents of the legislation do not acknowledge that electors have a right to be informed before voting and they simply hope that people will go along and donkey-vote, and perhaps enough will vote yes for this to get through? I think it is a very real and severe criticism of the government that they are not proposing to post the material to the electors' official addresses. 


Some question whether equal funding will be provided to the yes and no cases. Again, I think that if there is not equal funding, as it appears there will not be, that is a very a severe criticism of the government and clearly shows their bias for the yes case, in that the yes case funding will run into millions of dollars whereas I believe there is barely half a million dollars for official material for the no case.


In conclusion, it is my view as a committed federalist that the states remain the best-equipped entities to look after the diverse interests of the many and diverse regions of Australia precisely because they are the regional governments across this huge continent of ours, not bureaucrats based in Canberra. Accordingly, I hope this referendum will be defeated. I think the old aphorism 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' very much applies to this case.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (18:08):  Our Constitution must be treated with respect. With the way the Gillard Labor government has handled this proposal to conduct a referendum on the recognition of local government in the Constitution, it is treating our Constitution with contempt. No government should initiate any change to our Constitution lightly. Any change to our Constitution should be based on broad community consensus; it should be based on strong bipartisan support; it should be conducted in a way that is consistent with one of our greatest democratic values, procedural fairness; and, where a proposed constitutional change has implications for the states, it should be based on a broad consensus with the state governments.


No government should try to buy a change to our Constitution or stack the decks in favour of one argument over another, using taxpayers' money to fund its side of the argument while effectively ignoring, deliberately disadvantaging and discriminating against the alternative case. Typically, and true to form, the Gillard Labor government has completely mismanaged the process leading to the proposal before the Senate today. Typically, its handling has been divisive, ham fisted and mostly focused on the pursuit of base political objectives in the lead-up to a difficult election for the government, rather than on the genuine pursuit of the national interest and genuine constitutional reform. No change to our Constitution should be pursued on that basis. No change to our Constitution should be pursued like this.


This proposal for a change to our Constitution, to be put at the next election, has of course been put twice to the Australian people before over the past few decades. The Australian people have defeated this proposal twice before. The Gillard government, in the way it has approached this proposal for constitutional change, has not made a case to the Australian people that they should change their minds. In seeking to legislate this referendum at this late stage, as the Gillard government is seeking to do, and in seeking to favour the yes case at taxpayers' expense along the way, without having made the case for change, there is no doubt in my mind that the Australian people will return the same verdict as they have in relation to such Labor proposals in the past.


There is no broad community consensus. There is no strong bipartisan support. There is no consensus with state governments. And, contrary to Senator Milne's inaccurate and misleading assertions earlier, there is not even consensus with the Labor-Greens state government in Tasmania. There is not even total support for this change across local government. The Gillard government, by pursuing this proposal now and in this way, is also ignoring the advice of its own Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government. The government's own panel made this referendum subject to two key conditions. No. 1 is:


… that the Commonwealth negotiate with the States to achieve their support …


The Gillard Labor government has not. No. 2 is: 


… that the Commonwealth adopt steps … to achieve informed and positive public engagement with the issue …


The Gillard Labor government has not. Even those who strongly support this referendum, including the government's own expert panel, made the point that certain things should happen first. But they did not happen. That is of course why this referendum legislation should not be pursued at this time—certainly not now and certainly not in this way. On the best available interpretation, the Gillard government has left it too late to put the case for changing our Constitution to the Australian people properly and in time, because of its characteristic incompetence. It is more likely that the recommendations of the expert panel were deliberately and consciously ignored.


Even the Australian Electoral Commission, the objective and independent statutory arbiter when it comes to the proper conduct of contested elections and referenda, warned the Gillard government not to pursue a change to our Constitution at this election if it were initiated after 1 March this year. The Australian Electoral Commission pointed out that if it started referendum related preparations after 1 March, it would leave:


… insufficient, or no, time in a truncated timetable, that is one commencing 1 March 2013 …


It is now 19 June 2013, more than three months after that date, and the election, on the current timetable, is less than three months away. The Australian Electoral Commission also pointed out that in rushing the process, by initiating it so late in the piece, the government is exposed to an elevated level of criticism by stakeholders and the wider public of the way that voters are not effectively informed that the advertising campaign is biased to one side. And of course, since then we have found out that the government is doing even more to inappropriately and unfairly stack the decks in favour of its own argument and against the alternative point of view.


Indeed, the Australian Electoral Commission said in its submission in relation to the expert panel inquiry that a truncated time frame like the one we have now will 'jeopardise the AEC election preparations'. That is pretty damning advice from the independent objective umpire, yet still the Gillard Labor government is pressing ahead—with a change to our Constitution no less—regardless. That is why the coalition's official position is that this referendum should not be proceeding at this time. It is too late to change the Constitution in an appropriate and respectable way. What we have said is that if, despite our objections, the government insists and persists with putting this legislation to a vote now, we will not oppose it, leaving the judgment and the merits and the question on changing the Constitution to the Australian people. But, of course, the government should not be pursuing a change to the Constitution in the way that they are doing now. It is not right.


We do support the principle of putting beyond doubt the capacity of the Commonwealth to provide direct financial assistance to local government. I am not convinced that this is the best way to do that. Importantly though, our position is that the next election should be a referendum on the world's largest carbon tax, Labor's failed mining tax and the incompetent Gillard Labor government—not on local government. We have made very clear that at this next election the coalition will be campaigning for a change of government, not for a change to the Constitution.


If this legislation passes, it will again be up to the Australian people to decide how they want to respond to the referendum question on local government, as they have before. I, along with my coalition colleagues, will be campaigning for a change of government that Australia so desperately needs, not for a change to the Constitution. As part of this second-reading debate the coalition is moving a very important amendment to force the government to provide equal funding for both the yes and the no cases. This should really be a no-brainer. There should not even be any argument about this. If the government does want to pursue this proposed change to our Constitution of course there should be equal funding for both the yes and the no cases. That is the established convention; that is the well-established precedent; that is what has happened in the past; that is what the Australian people would expect to happen.


If the Gillard government were truly interested in a genuine expression of the public will on this, that is what it would do. In fact, if our Prime Minister had any political judgment, even from her point of view, from the point of view of somebody who wants to achieve a successful yes vote, quite frankly the best thing she could have done would have been to ensure equal funding to both sides of the argument. In acting the way she has, the Prime Minister is offending Australians' highly developed sense of fair play. She is feeding people's natural distrust of government by pursuing change to the Constitution in this way. In acting the way she has, the Prime Minister has further undermined her own cause and, again, divided the nation.


As well as treating our Constitution with contempt by basing its decision on how much funding to allocate to each case only on the vote in the House of Representatives, the government is also treating the Senate with contempt. No senator in this chamber should allow themselves to be complicit in this. No self-respecting senator would allow themselves to be complicit in this.


To summarise, a change to our Constitution should not be pursued in the way the Gillard government is pursuing. We do not approve of the way the Gillard government has handled this. Given how late we are in the electoral cycle, this should not be happening. If the government insists on pressing ahead with this legislation, we have said that the coalition will not oppose it. However, we will be putting our trust in the Australian people to get this judgment right again, because at the next election we will not be campaigning for a change in our Constitution; we will be campaigning for a change of government. The next election should be a referendum on a very bad government which has well and truly lost its way, not on local government.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (18:20):  Following Senator Cormann, I am reminded that in politics adherence to principle is just about everything in public life. You can respect someone you disagree with if they have a principled position. It enables those who have strong views to frame the answers to very difficult questions, making them actually easier to resolve and satisfy.


I am one who will not compromise principles that I brought to this place, and that I believe are at the very heart of my political life—my political commitment—and my political party. They include a commitment to faith, stronger families, free enterprise, general freedom, our flag, our Federation and our Constitution. This bill, and I believe, the referendum and the question that is going to be put, undermines our Constitution. I think it undermines the principle of federalism. It is worth reflecting on the words of a Mr Holder from the 1898 debate at the Australasian Federal Convention:


… we have harmonized the interests of several states where they differed, and we have provided a Constitution sufficient to provide for the fullest and the most self-reliant government of a free people. We have created an instrument of partnership between us which, I believe, secures the independence of the several states, will provide for the joint control of certain matters, at the same time as it also leaves free and complete self-government on all matters not committed to the central authority.


There are those—some of my colleagues for whom I have tremendous respect—who have a view that times have changed since 1898, and indeed they have. But the principle that was applied at the formation of our Constitution to create a Commonwealth of Australia built upon the independence and success of the states was very, very clear, and I do not believe it should be undermined. I do not believe we should be centralising more power in Canberra, because, quite frankly, I think that political organisations that are closer to the people, like state governments and local councils, are often better connected about the needs and wants of a local community than a Canberra based politician or bureaucrat, or even the politicians here who assiduously stay in touch with their communities. They work together hand in hand, and each has a distinct and unique role.


I would also like to reflect on a submission to the Senate Select Committee on the Reform of the Australian Federation from the Council for the Australian Federation. They said:


Australia’s federal structure provides for a number of significant benefits that in fact outweigh [the] perceived costs:


The customisation of policies to meet local needs


Incentives to innovate and experiment in policy and service delivery


Supporting choice and diversity


Competition and comparison that supports continuous improvement


Greater scrutiny of national policies as a result of the need to achieve cooperation


Protection for the individual by checking the concentration of power.


They went on:


Importantly, the benefits of federalism do not preclude the development of national approaches to common problems. In addition, the federal structure allows for new ideas to be pioneered by one jurisdiction and, if successful, to be adopted by others.


As I mentioned before, I am opposed to the centralisation of power in Canberra. The writers of our Constitution recognised, during a critical time in the founding of our country, that the division and separation of powers was needed to help prevent the centralisation of power in any one place. This referendum seeks to change that system of checks and balances. It undermines the principles of federation. It undermines the principle of states' rights. The states, quite frankly, need to be accountable for how they conduct themselves in accordance with our constitutional road map, and they need to stop passing the buck to Canberra. But what concerns me about this constitutional amendment is that Canberra will now be dealing, supposedly, directly with local councils. That gives another arm of our government authorities around the country an opportunity not so much to be held to account but to pass the buck to Canberra.


I say to the Australian people that if you think Canberra can resolve all of your problems then you are not asking the right question, because more limited government is in our national interest. More trust in local authorities and communities to determine their own direction and self-direction and more responsibility and accountability from state governments will result in the better governance of your state. I simply have not bought the idea that a bureaucrat or an idea formulated in Canberra is somehow better than one formulated in your local community, because the Commonwealth does not know more about what is necessary in local council areas than local councils themselves.


I raise the issue because, with funding from any government—they are not benevolent institutions, let me tell you—there are always conditions. Conditions that the Commonwealth could impose could indeed override aspects of a council's self-determination. We have already have complaints in parts of South Australia that the state government is overriding or insisting upon changes to planning laws or regulations in some local council areas as a condition of funding. Let me tell you that the Commonwealth could intervene and interfere in issues such as that to a much greater and more substantive extent. Any number of strings could be attached to direct federal government funding to local councils, and this has all sorts of implications for local government decisions. Decision making can then be taken out of the hands of locals and passed up the line to someone sitting behind a desk in Canberra. That means Canberra's priorities will come first, rather than the local communities'.


As I said, there is a potential for even more buck passing between the three tiers of government. Of course, increased funding and promised efficiencies often do not appear. Extra funding agreements often mean extra regulations. The regulations increase costs and red tape. If there is one thing that this country needs less of it is red tape, quite frankly. The question is, who is ultimately going to end up footing the bill for higher costs and more bureaucracy? It is going to be the taxpayers and the ratepayers of Australia.


The other aspect of this referendum is that the current system actually works. It is not broken. There is nothing that stops the federal government from funding local councils through the traditional means that have always been available to it since the 1920s, and that is through the states. In fact, about 80 per cent of federal funding to local governments is provided through the states in this manner. In the last financial year, about $2 billion dollars was provided to local government by the Commonwealth using section 96 of the Constitution. There was also additional, direct funding to local government that bypassed the states but, nonetheless, that is not necessary to achieve outcomes. And why would we risk—or deliberately want to remove—the checks and balances that are inbuilt in our current system simply for political convenience and for an ideological agenda that is driven essentially by the left of the political spectrum, which seeks to impose its decisions and dominate the power-sharing arrangements, because it has not always used that system appropriately.


Mr Deputy President, let me make this point: if you want a more egregious example of the misuse and abuse of the power of the Commonwealth, then the bill before us today and the announcement by Mr Albanese about the inequitable funding for the yes/no case demonstrate the point entirely. There has been a consultation about a change to the Constitution, and yet what is being put by this government—and the wording—has changed significantly and substantively from what has been discussed, what has been researched, what has been workshopped and what we have had expert advice on. Constitutional experts have indicated that that has widespread implications for our constitution that have not been robustly tested. But—on a more base note—if we are trusting in the altruism of our Commonwealth and in the benevolence of acting the national interest, there are many examples I could give you where that has not been the case. But in every previous referendum where public funding has been provided, there has been equal funding for the yes case and the no case. You do not have to be on one side of the fence to think that that gives the Australian people a reasonable and fair shot at making the right decision. Let the advocates for either side put their case into the public arena on an equal footing and allow the Australian people to decide. Yet, somehow, fairness, equity, convention, tradition and decency have escaped this Labor government.


After a vote was taken in the House of Representatives, and after an agreement had been reached where the facilitation of this bill would go through and there would be registered but limited objection to it, simply so that the AEC, the Australian Electoral Commission, could prepare a case—a no case—Mr Albanese unilaterally announced that $10 million would be given to the no campaign. This is on top of other publicly funded propaganda, and funds that have been provided to external organisations to continue to prosecute the no case. Mr Albanese, in his benevolence, in his equity and in his compassion, gave $500,000—one-twentieth of the amount—to the people who are trying to protect and defend our constitution from those who seek to centralise power in Canberra and take it away from local communities. He said that this was based on the result of the vote. Well, Mr Albanese has ignored another fundamental principle of this place—that is, that the Senate is a very important part of our parliament. It is the states house. We should be sticking up for states' rights here, not undermining them. Yes, we have allegiance to our political parties; yes, we have allegiance to the national interest—but we are here because of the constituents in our states. For Mr Albanese to ignore the vote that is going to take place up here—to virtually say it does not matter—gives you an example of how those who have a flagrant disregard for the checks and balances built into our system, and those who have no respect for convention, for the traditions or for the institutions that have made this such a great country, will behave, should you give them virtually unfettered powers. No decent Australian can concede that there is somehow equity in a decision to fund a no case that benefits the government and, essentially, a decision not to fund to any substantive measure the counter-case, in dealing with our constitutional roadmap—our founding document. This is a document where the checks and balances were established because our forefathers knew exactly what could happen, should we allow power to concentrate in any one place.


I make the point for those who are on the yes side that there is no proof that local government would actually be any better off if this referendum passes. There is no proof whatsoever. There is no guarantee that they are going to receive any sort of special status or receive any more funding. According to the Constitutional Reform Unit at the Sydney Law School, overall, local government receives about 84 per cent of its funding from its own revenue sources—rates, service fees, investments and so on; about eight per cent is provided by the federal government; and a further eight per cent or thereabouts by the states. Yes, there are variations among different local councils; some are more reliant on the Commonwealth and state grants than others. However, councils that rely significantly on grants for more than 58 per cent of their revenue represent about 0.4 per cent of the population.


The other aspect of this, which I will touch on briefly in the time that I have left, is to reflect on the history of this particular issue in Australia. The Labor party have had a focused, consistent and diligent approach to trying to take power out of local communities and reinstate it in Canberra—they have been doing this since Gough Whitlam was Prime Minister. They have had two previous referendums on this very issue. The first was in 1974: it failed, with just 46 per cent of the vote, and only New South Wales voted in favour. The second referendum, in 1988, failed: it got just one-third of the vote and no states voted in favour of it. It seems as though now is to be 'third time lucky', except that the deck is stacked. The deck is stacked by the ideologues who are insistent upon grasping more power from local communities because they want to be able to tell them what is actually good for them. There has been no history of success of concentrating power in any country around the world.


We live in one of the best—if not the best—democracies anywhere in the world. That is because our Constitution has delivered strength and stability through the separation of powers. Whether that is by some quirk of fate, by grand design or by some inherent wisdom in our forefathers I cannot tell you.


Labor wants to overturn that. It thinks that the vessel of knowledge in the country resides somehow in this building. It does not. It resides in our communities; it resides in our local councils; it resides in our state governments; and it resides in every individual and family. They elect us to represent their interests. This is not in my community's interest and it is not in my state's interest. We cannot allow it to go through unchallenged. I am on the record as being opposed to this. If you were in any doubt, Mr Deputy President, I am opposed to this referendum. I accept that the question is going to be put. I feel deeply uncomfortable with the injustice that is being put upon the Australian people by the inequity of the decisions of Mr Albanese and the Labor Party.


I regret the haphazard, hasty and disingenuous manner in which this referendum question has been hustled through the parliament. As Senator Cormann said, the Australian people are not interested in rendering a verdict on giving more power to the people in here. They are interested in rendering a verdict on how the people in here have used, misused and abused the powers they already have. That is what we should be debating, discussing and advocating between now and 14 September. But, alas, a magnificent distraction to the tune of $10 million of public funding—plus many millions more—has been engineered.


I ask the Australian people to reflect upon their own interests. Are they happy with the way that our country has been governed over the last year, two years, three years, five years or six years? Ask yourself that question. Would it have been any different or any better if Canberra could make decisions about who was allowed to build a house in your community or in your street? Would it have been any better if, when you went to see your local councillor and asked them for advice or to get something done in your street, they had to refer it up the line to some bureaucrat in Canberra? Let me tell you: I do not think that it would be. I think the Australian people will emphatically reject this attempt to abuse and radically change our system of government in this country. I will be voting against it.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2013-06-19,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:40):  I rise to oppose the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) Bill 2013. I wish to put into the record the effect of the proposed change to section 96 of the Constitution should the referendum succeed. It would read:


During a period of 10 years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State, or to any local government body formed by a law of a State, on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit.


If thinking people around Australia, people associated with local government, and communities—particularly in the small-population states of Tasmania, Western Australia and especially South Australia—do not understand the statement 'on such terms and conditions as the parliament thinks fit' then I recommend very, very strongly that they examine it in more detail. That is because there could not be a more dangerous change to this Constitution for the people of the smaller states. In fact, it flies in the face of many of the aspects of the Constitution and, indeed, this chamber in which we sit—it being the states house.


As was presented by the professor of constitutional law at the University of Sydney, Professor Anne Twomey, there are four obstacles to the success of this referendum. They are firstly the need for popular support; secondly the unintended consequences that may emanate from it, thirdly the obvious question of whether it is necessary, and fourthly the question of whether it is for symbolic recognition only. As has been put by those who are interested in this subject, there are two benefit tests that must be applied: it must be demonstrated that there is a problem and it must be demonstrated that any change be seen as a benefit to solving that problem.


This referendum fails on both counts. There is no problem to solve, so by definition—ipso facto—there would be no benefit. So what are the proponents, particularly in local government associations around Australia, putting to their ratepayers as validation and justification for taking money out of ratepayers' pockets and putting it into the yes vote for this constitutional change? The first is that they believe in security of funding under section 96. But there is absolutely and utterly nothing that requires change. There is no guarantee that there would be any difference in the funding from the Commonwealth to local government should this amendment be passed, simply because of those words 'on such terms and conditions as the parliament thinks fit'. There is nothing in section 96 now that precludes the Commonwealth government from continuing to fund local governments as they have been funding them for many years.


The second justification is the argument about the High Court challenge in the Pape case. What the ratepayers of Australia need to understand is that Pape swung not on section 96 of the Constitution but on section 81. I was privileged to be a member of the Select Committee on the Reform of the Australian Federation, which reported to the Senate in June 2011. A lot of discussion took place around Pape. We had before us officers of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and also of Treasury. The department concluded: 


Taking into account the implications of the Pape decision, the Commonwealth remains able to make grants under its general powers in the Constitution as well as make payments to the states for purposes relevant to their responsibilities, which do include local government currently.


…   …   …   


The Treasury and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet reviewed the constitutionality of Commonwealth payments in the wake of the Pape case and, based on advice from the Attorney-General, found that payments could continue. A similar position was reached by the Western Australian Government and the Council for the Australian Federation.


So ALGA had got it wrong. Section 96 guarantees nothing, and Pape was never determined under section 96. The other case that they quote is, of course, Williams in the High Court. When Senator Brandis spoke so eloquently earlier in the chamber today on this matter, he made the observation that Williams did not turn on section 96. In fact, it was the opinion of the judges of the High Court that there was no legislative basis at all for the allocation of funds in Williams. I make the point in terms of road funding, because this is critically important funding. Roads to Recovery was commenced by the Howard government, continued by the Rudd and Gillard governments is paid under section 96. Those payments commenced in 1923 under section 96, and 90 years later the same payments are being made. Therefore, it is clearly obvious that there is no argument based on those from the Australian Local Government Association. 


I now turn to my own state and the Western Australian Local Government Association. Documentation that was presented recently made the observation by WALGA of what they are or are not seeking. The first thing they said was that they are not asking for Commonwealth takeover. The simple fact is that, under the Constitution at the moment, the Commonwealth has no powers over local governments—no powers at all; absolutely none. Yet what the government are proposing in this referendum is that they will accord to the Commonwealth, to the federal government, the opportunity to provide financial assistance to any local government on such terms and conditions as the parliament sees fit. They are unwittingly passing over to the Commonwealth powers that it currently does not have. Not only would it give Commonwealth some powers; it would give the Commonwealth exhaustive powers. As time develops in this particular contribution, I will make that point more obviously. 


The second thing they said was that they are not seeking exemption from state control. They need only go to section 109 of the Constitution, which speaks the title 'Inconsistency of laws', and I quote: 


When a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid. 


The local government in WA are saying here that they are not seeking exemption from state control, yet they are passing a circumstance into fact where the Commonwealth would actually have power over the states. 


The third thing that WALGA said is that they are not pursuing symbolic recognition. It has been said in the past that local government is the foundation of democracy and 'if it fails, democracy will fail'—to quote Robert W Flack. Whether they intend it or whether they do not, the very thing that they are doing with this move, according to symbolic recognition or not, is that they are placing at severe risk local government as we know it in this country today. They are also saying that they do not want to interfere in any way with the Commonwealth Financial Assistance Grants. Once again, I come back to the words of the proposed changes to the Constitution and I warn WALGA and those who are the ratepayers around Western Australia that it is the very thing that they are doing. They are putting at risk the possibility of the Commonwealth in its Financial Assistance Grants. 


They claim it would only lead to minimal expansion of Commonwealth powers. The simple fact at the moment is that, under the Constitution, because local government does not exist, the Commonwealth has no powers. If they think that all they are doing is giving minimal powers, I will in continuation of this debate speak about the relationship between Mr Rudd and Premier Barnett and Ms Gillard and Premier Barnett on health and education.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:53):  This year I have spoken on numerous occasions in this chamber about how the coalition is increasingly relying on the tactics perfected by the Tea Party movement in the United States. The Tea Party movement, I would remind you, is an example of astroturfing—a fake grassroots movement established by powerful interests supposedly generated by mass public support yet largely designed to serve their own ends.


Numerous astroturf movements have been explicitly vocal about environmental issues. Perhaps the most glaring example is the Australian Environment Foundation, which was spun out of the conservative Institute of Public Affairs think tank several years ago. It has quite a history. It has just the sort of history you would expect from a body that had its genesis in the IPA. This is an organisation that has delivered speeches to university students challenging the view that the activities of mankind need to be reined in to avoid the effects of climate change. I bet even those students recovering from festivities the night before could see through those biased claims. This group has also issued media releases with headlines such as 'Dump emissions trading scheme now' and 'Carbon tax hoax begins'. It even went as far as branding the price on carbon:


The most expensive and useless public policy since Federation …


The Australian Environment Foundation is about instigating fear and distrust.


Now I can advise that we potentially have another group employing similar tactics upon us. This is a group called—and, unfortunately, I am not making this up—Stop These Things. Yesterday it held a rally outside Parliament House to protest against renewable energy. Stop These Things has enlisted the support of numerous coalition politicians. In fact, a handful of coalition members spoke at the rally yesterday, including Senator Ron Boswell, Senator Chris Back, the member for Hume, Albie Schultz, and the member for Wannon, Dan Tehan. Senator Boswell told the crowd:


There is a lot of pressure in the Coalition party room … there are many others who share our view …


It is probably no surprise that the ever-present Alan Jones acted as the master of ceremonies. I am told that he relayed an incredible story about how the Soviets used to send people to the gulags but now we send the gulags to the people. I am sure it made as little sense at the time as it does now.


As one economist in the Courier Mail pointed out recently, Stop These Things makes some extraordinary claims. Its website actually states that one of its operatives has intercepted communications from the United States Pentagon stating that 'giant wind turbines are being deployed as weapons of mass destruction'. The site features an experts section that only contains the biography details of one expert—an acoustic engineer called Stephen Cooper. It also has a variety of interesting comments from members of the public in its 'rumour file'. Many of them are probably listening to me right now wearing their tinfoil hats.


I am afraid the truth is a lot less interesting than this group would have us believe. In 2011 the Senate Community Affairs References Committee investigated concerns around noise and vibrations from wind farms. The committee examined all the relevant evidence and found that there was no identified link between wind farm noise and adverse human health effects. This is a view also shared by the National Health and Medical Research Council, the South Australian Environment Protection Agency and the Victorian Department of Health.


This issue also raises questions about the coalition's stance on wind farms and, indeed, renewable energy generally. It has been suggested in numerous media reports that the coalition is about to backflip on the Renewable Energy Target, a bipartisan commitment to source a fifth of Australia's power from renewable energy by 2020. We have also had the members for Tangney, Hume and Riverina claim during a debate on a motion in the other place that renewable energy does not reduce emissions. This is just incredible.


The Gillard government, on the other hand, has a strong commitment to delivering on renewable energy targets. Since Labor came to power, wind capacity in Australia has risen from just over 1,100 megawatts to over 3,000 megawatts. In fact, last year wind farms in this country produced enough electricity to power over one million homes—an incredible achievement that looked impossible not that long ago. This government believes in dynamic climate change policies that drive investment in renewable energy and reduce pollution. It is about long-term vision. It is about planning for the future. It is about caring what sort of planet we leave for future generations. The combination of the carbon price, the Renewable Energy Target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency is delivering results.


We hear a lot from the opposition about the price on carbon. Their simplistic misrepresentation of this issue is heartbreaking. If you want the facts, renewable energy generation increased by almost a third within one year of the carbon price. In that same period, emissions in the National Electricity Market were down 7.4 per cent. This has led to a surge in investment in the renewable energy industry and new jobs have been created. Already the Renewable Energy Target has attracted $18.5 billion in new investment to Australia. In addition to this, the scheme as a whole stands to create 30,000 jobs, many of them in regional and rural areas, where clean energy resources are located.


What this government has achieved is groundbreaking. We are positioning ourselves at the forefront of new technologies in renewable energy that will attract investment and ensure our long-term economic security. We are creating highly skilled jobs for people in regional areas and playing a crucial role in combating climate change. In contrast, the coalition would like to halt or scrap altogether the Renewable Energy Target, repeal the carbon price and abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. They have also indicated that they want to duplicate state and territory planning requirements over wind farm noise. What they are really doing is creating sovereign risk for renewable energy investment in Australia. My home state of Tasmania is benefiting—



Senator Colbeck interjecting—




Senator POLLEY:
  Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I would have thought that my colleague from Tasmania would be interested in this. Actually, he could be educated about what is happening in Tasmania. It will be interesting to see where he stands when the people of King Island vote on whether or not they are going to support the wind farm investment on that island. 


In my home state of Tasmania we are benefiting handsomely from the developments in renewable energy technologies, particularly wind technology. The state has been the recipient of several grants under the Clean Technology Investment Program and the Clean Technology Innovation Program, which have reaped real dividends. These programs have allowed one company, Naturale, to upgrade equipment at its Ringarooma stockfeed supplement manufacturing plant. That project will reduce the company’s site-wide carbon emissions intensity by 46 per cent and will enable the product to be manufactured at a lower overall cost. I would have thought that my Tasmanian colleagues from all sides would welcome that, particularly in the north-east of Tasmania. 


These things are happening in renewable energy in Tasmania, and it is a great thing for our state. As I mentioned earlier, the residents of King Island are voting on the development of what will be the Southern Hemisphere’s largest wind farm. Residents and landowners will vote yes or no to the proposal to build a 200-turbine wind farm, which will obviously play a significant role in helping Australia meet its Renewable Energy Target. According to Hydro Tasmania, the development will bring hundreds of millions of dollars into the local community as well as infrastructure upgrades and at least 60 jobs. I think it is great that the company elected to send out surveys on this to gauge the level of community support before it goes ahead with a feasibility study. It says it wants 60 per cent approval by the local community. A final decision is expected next week. I am in favour of wind turbines, subject to appropriate planning and environmental control, and I think renewable energy should be embraced in Australia. 


This government has worked extraordinarily hard to boost investment in the area of renewable energies, and it has worked. If left unchanged, it will continue to drive investment to transform our energy sector over the next decade and beyond. It is certainly something that this country can be proud of.
