"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-03-16,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move: 
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to General Business notice of motion No. 468.
The motion relates to news in the financial press that BHP has publicly noted that it is about to sell off or abandon its responsibility for the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea. BHP has a half share in the mine with the Papua New Guinea government. The world was rocked with the news of the disastrous effects on the environment and therefore on the social integrity of the Papua New Guinea people living in the vicinity when the sediment from the mine went down the river. It has effectively poisoned the river for hundreds of kilometres, it has killed the ecosystem below Ok Tedi and it has destroyed the agricultural and fishing potential in that region for the people who have based their livelihoods on it for thousands of years. 
There have been moves through the courts for reparation for the people, but there is now a recognition by BHP, the Papua New Guinea government and everybody else who looks at this issue that a great deal of money would need to be spent not only to contain tailings from future mining operations but also to ameliorate the damage that has occurred to the magnificent Fly River ecosystem. We have here a situation which is not dissimilar to the recent cyanide spill from a Romanian mine that involved the Australian company Esmeralda, which I hear is now going into liquidation and is unable to meet its responsibilities there. BHP is a much bigger corporation and has the ability to shed its responsibilities and leave it to somebody else. I think this parliament has to face the impact on the nation's reputation from mining corporations which create, wittingly or otherwise, enormous environmental and social devastation—whether it be domestically or elsewhere—and then leave it to somebody else to clean up. BHP, the Big Australian, has an international responsibility here to show the lead. It is not going to do that by abandoning that responsibility. Even if it gives half of the copper mine to Papua New Guinea, it is leaving it to a government which does not have the resources of this big multinational corporation to fix up, as best as is scientifically and technologically possible, the damage that has been done. That is an expensive task.
Where corporations are involved in activities that cause environmental damage, whatever they might be, those corporations are charged with the task of defraying that damage. It is their responsibility. The solution is not to abandon that responsibility and move out and leave it to somebody else.
One news report that I have seen this week—I think it was in the Financial Review—says that BHP has two other corporations lined up wanting to take its share in Ok Tedi. That in itself is not good enough. When you get transition of ownership, what happens is that the new owners take responsibility for what they do but take no responsibility for the past, and the past owners take no responsibility for what they have done either. So who is left to carry the tab for this? It is the indigenous people in and downstream from Ok Tedi and the environment. We are talking here not just about the locality; we are talking about hundreds of kilometres of a major river system upon which thousands of people have been dependent for their livelihood. 
There is no doubt in my mind that BHP sees that this is more damaging to it than it is worth. But BHP went into this with its eyes open. It has made an enormous amount of money out of it. We, as a parliament, need to be in the business of persuading BHP to shoulder its responsibilities in the name of Australia as well as in the interests of the Papua New Guinea people.",SENATE,<title>OK TEDI COPPER MINE: PAPUA NEW GUINEA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,4,1
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2000-03-16,"—The government will be opposing this motion. Clearly, the shareholders of the Ok Tedi mine are the people involved with the decision making about the future of that mine. Clearly, it is the government's position that we are not a shareholder and have no say in the matter.",SENATE,<title>OK TEDI COPPER MINE: PAPUA NEW GUINEA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,4,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I thought that was a rather poor and inadequate contribution from Senator Heffernan in trying to explain to the Senate what the position of the government is in relation to urgency on this important question. But let me say—through you, Madam President—to Senator Brown that the opposition does share the concerns of Senator Brown and many other Australians about the environmental impact of the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea. There is no doubt that there are very serious and significant environmental issues that have arisen at Ok Tedi, and this is a matter that I think should be of concern to responsible Australians and to the Australian parliament.
One of the difficulties in matters like this is that Senator Brown has put down a motion before the Senate and the opposition finds itself in a position where, while it agrees with the thrust of the motion and the general sentiments that have been expressed by Senator Brown in both the motion and the contribution he has made, it does believe the motion in its current form ought not to be supported. If it moved to a debate, then the opposition would propose a range of amendments that it believes would significantly improve the motion.
I do not know—as you would understand, Madam President—because of the logistical difficulties we have in this place, whether the opposition amendments have actually been provided to Senator Brown. I do not know whether Senator Brown has had an opportunity to see those yet. Perhaps Senator Brown might be able to assist me with whether he has seen those amendments or not.
—Yes, and the amendments have been incorporated.
—This is what we are not clear on. Senator Brown says to me that the amendments have been incorporated. But—through you, Madam President—Senator Brown asks for formality for this motion; he did not ask for formality of a motion on the Notice Paper as amended but the one that actually appeared on the Notice Paper.
In this circumstance, I am not going to commit the opposition to supporting a suspension of standing orders on this matter. I do believe, however, it is a matter that can be worked through, and I hope that we might be able to reach some agreement on this issue and on wording. But at the moment, we have before us a request for formality for a motion to which the opposition has indicated an intention to move a significant number of amendments. So the balance becomes: do we spend a great deal of time in debate now, working these amendments through with a substantive motion before the chair after a suspension of standing orders, or do we try the alternative approach of seeing whether we can get a motion for which formality can be granted and to which a majority agreement can be reached in the chamber? I think on this particular occasion it is worth pursuing that second course.
—Madam President, perhaps I could help the Senate through a point of order; I would like to do so. Senator Faulkner is quite right. I ought to have sought leave for the motion to go forward as amended, as circulated. I would seek leave of the Senate to be able to do that so that we can then proceed with the motion as amended. 
—There is no point of order. It is a matter for negotiation.
—On this basis, Madam President, so that we can get some clarity about it, I think the course of action that I am counselling is correct. I think that we should defeat this proposal for a suspension of standing orders before the chair, have a quick look at what proposal is coming before the chair and, if it can be done today—I do not know what the government's position on this is—as far as the opposition are concerned, we would be happy to give leave for Senator Brown to deal with this a little later on if there has been some misunderstanding.
But the problem is that it is the original question that is before the chair. I do not know and my colleague the Opposition Whip does not know what has been incorporated and what has not. There is no alternative here but to defeat this suspension of standing orders and to start this process again. I can indicate in good faith to Senator Brown that, if we can get some agreement, as far as we are concerned we will facilitate this. That is the spirit in which I make the contribution.",SENATE,<title>OK TEDI COPPER MINE: PAPUA NEW GUINEA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,4,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-03-16,"—I will briefly put the Democrats position on the record. As I understand it, the motion we are considering is the one on the Notice Paper which has been amended pursuant to standing order 77. That is certainly the one I am speaking to. It reads to me as though the amendments have already been made. Regardless, I put on the record that the Democrats support the substantive motion. 
The issues are certainly serious. I have spoken in recent times about the Esmeralda issue in Romania and Hungary and some issues relating to the perceptions of the operations and responsibilities of Australian companies operating overseas. That is an important issue that was acknowledged by all sides at the time. This is one where the environmental consequences are not in any doubt at all and are far more significant and serious than those that have been alleged to have occurred in relation to the mining operation that Esmeralda had some involvement in. The Ok Tedi situation stands as a monument to the worst-case scenario of operations of mining companies—in this case BHP. It does not reflect well on Australia to have that smirch on the country's reputation, because there are clearly a lot of operations that have Australian involvement that act responsibly. In terms of environmental safeguards with mining operations, I would say that there is a lot of expertise in Australian companies that other countries in the world would find quite valuable. It is certainly not a matter of trying to oppose any form of involvement of Australian companies in overseas mining operations. To some extent it is to the contrary. 
That is why Ok Tedi needs to be addressed as strongly as possible. We need to show that Australia and Australian companies are serious about their environmental responsibilities and are serious about dealing with the consequences of failings in how they have operated in the past. It is not just Australia as a nation but all Australian corporations and investors being serious about meeting their responsibilities, whether that is in terms of future operations or in admitting past mistakes and taking responsibility for remedial action in those situations. It is an important issue. Whether you are talking about Ok Tedi specifically or some of the broader principles that I have touched on briefly, the Democrats support the motion as amended in the Notice Paper.",SENATE,<title>OK TEDI COPPER MINE: PAPUA NEW GUINEA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,4,1

Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I am pleased to table the report, Katukalpa, with respect to the serious problem of indigenous education. The inquiry was first referred to the committee on 9 March 1998. Progress has been delayed as a result of considerable work pressure within the committee secretariat over the past two years. It was not until halfway through last year that public hearings and inspections were able to be scheduled.
When the committee first discussed the terms of reference for this inquiry it was thought to be appropriate to review the recommendations of the large number of reports commissioned by governments over the previous decade or more, to find out which recommendations had been implemented and those which had not been, and the reason for the lack of action where this was apparent. Over the course of the inquiry, however, it became clear that indigenous education is an issue in perpetual motion, affected by political and social change at all levels as well as by evolution on educational thinking. Hunting through the archives came to be regarded as a less useful activity for a Senate committee than placing on record a fresh set of observations, reflections and recommendations. Nonetheless, the report does cover in some detail the reports of the past 15 years which have guided policy makers in indigenous education.
Indigenous education is a shared responsibility of the states and territories and the Commonwealth. Given that the states and territories each have their own traditions, priorities and curriculum cultures there are some differences and some disparities across the country in the delivery of indigenous education. Differences are to be expected, but the committee has some concern about the disparities evidenced by pockets of neglect across the country. My colleague Senator Crossin may have something to say about the Northern Territory schools in this regard.
The committee has recommended that MCEETYA, as the national policy clearing house, look at best practice in each state and replicate that across the country to avoid such neglect. In the course of its travels and investigations the committee heard from a large number of dedicated people, some with success stories to relate and others indicating to us the extent to which challenges are still to be met. Despite the best endeavours of many educators, the goal of equity of achievement between indigenous and non-indigenous students appears to be far distant. The most recent record of indigenous education shows that participation levels in post-school vocational education are by far the most useful and encouraging indicators of success, while the rate of participation in secondary schools indicates the most intractable and serious problem. 
The committee takes the view that much can still be done by governments and their agencies and by educational institutions to accelerate the slow progress in indigenous education. The committee has made a number of recommendations calling for better targeting of resources and the concentration of funds and efforts in ways that will make a difference. Finding solutions to the educational underachievement of indigenous youth should concentrate our minds on priorities. Clearly evident to the committee was the interconnection between low school achievement and dislocated family life and poor health. Low literacy rates, high drop-out rates—particularly for boysevidence of poor nutrition standards and a very high incidence of otitis media are well documented in the report. The committee believes that the best way to come to grips with the health and nutrition problems is to train sufficient numbers of indigenous health workers, and this should be a priority. Another priority should be improving the quality of teacher education in universities to equip teachers with the skills to handle health and literacy problems with more assurance. The supply of good teachers to remote areas and to schools which have a high enrolment of indigenous students is dependent not only on improved teacher education but on more attractive incentives and improved living conditions. It should be acknowledged that some states, particularly Western Australia, provide better incentives and conditions of unemployment than others, especially in standards of accommodation. The committee has recommended that MCEETYA look into this matter of professional incentives and living conditions.
In the course of its inquiry the committee travelled to four states and the Northern Territory. It visited a number of schools and received valuable evidence and advice from a large number of educational practitioners in the field. The appendix to the report lists all of these people. I would like to thank my colleagues on the committee—in particular, Senator Crossin—for their work and their interest, and also commend the work of all the members of our committee secretariat, noting in particular the efforts of David Redway in pulling together the draft report and Kerrie Nelson for her valuable insights into indigenous education. These members of the committee secretariat are in the chamber now and I would like to acknowledge their presence. 
As a final point, it is noteworthy that the committee has produced a unanimous report. This is in part a recognition of the issues we have encountered and dealt with—that they are of fundamental importance. No government, at either Commonwealth or state level, will be able to claim now or in retrospect that indigenous education has been as well looked after as it could have been. Some governments have been able to show more commitment than others and some may lay claim to more success than others, but measurement of success is always problematic. The committee hopes that this report will drive progress somewhat further and much faster.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,11,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-03-16,"—It is timely, I think, that the front page of the Australian yesterday reported on national literacy levels across this country. It is unfortunate that we see that indigenous students have only reached a reading benchmark of 66.7 per cent in Queensland and a staggering, very low 29.7 per cent in the Northern Territory. Yet we can see that in places like South Australia, Western Australia, Victoria, the ACT and New South Wales the rate of success is well above 80 per cent. So it is timely that today the Senate produces its report, Katukalpa, which is a result of our inquiry into the effectiveness of education and training programs for indigenous Australians. Let me say something about the title of this report. I think it is quite impressive and reflects a sentiment that the committee gained from Papunya School. The translation of the title means `reaching to go higher and further with your whole body and spirit'. I think this title is significant because it is a reflection of the commitment of indigenous people in their communities to wanting their children to achieve and their ongoing struggle but firm belief and hope that they will be able to achieve that. Despite the many years of disadvantage, the inequities and the lack of commitment from some governments around this country, particularly in the Northern Territory, these people still have firm hopes for their children and their future. 
I want to take this time to personally thank David Redway and Kerrie Nelson, who I also acknowledge are here today, for their writing of the report and for the many hours that we spent trying to shape this report into the kind of document I think the federal parliament should be proud to send around this country. In terms of indigenous education, if you stand still on a day for too long you will find that the next day the issues are different and some of the threads are hard to pick up. I think one of the main things about this report is that it was important to actually close the chapters and to move on because if you do not do that you are going to find yourself facing a whole new set of problems. I also want to pay tribute to Senator John Tierney for his work on the committee. I think it is an outstanding achievement that on an issue, such as indigenous education, where there can be a number of conflicts of interest and different political points, the committee did not use this is as an opportunity to do that. There is a genuine commitment, I think, from all sides of politics to progress this issue, to recognise it as a major national problem and to genuinely want to do something about this together. For that, Senator Tierney, I thank you for your input and for your commitment in producing what we now have before us—a majority report.
It is important that people note the very first recommendation of the report. It is important in the light of the figures that were released yesterday nationally that the raising of literacy and numeracy skills of indigenous students remains not only a national priority but, as the report says, an urgent national priority. There are many problems in indigenous education. I do not think any one of us has quite got it right yet. Millions of dollars have been spent on indigenous education over the last 12 years, with the AEP and now IESIP funding, and yet we still saw results yesterday of only 29 per cent in the NT and 66 per cent in Queensland. We must surely be wondering where that money has gone and what we have actually achieved. But I do not think it is proper for us to dwell too much on some of those failings. We need to recognise them, but we also need to recognise where gains and improvements have been made, and we need to move on.
It is important to draw people's attention to the fact that this report covers a broad spectrum of indigenous education issues. One of the most important, in my mind, is the interaction between health and education outcomes. We know health outcomes in Aboriginal communities are not good, and we know that significantly impacts on learning ability. It is important that this report recognises that the next step is to link health and education outcomes. Government departments across a broad range of areas must start to talk to one another and have priorities and outcomes that complement each other and do not work in opposition to each other. You cannot expect a child to sit down and comfortably learn a skill while that child has an earache, is hungry or has scabies. It is very important that this report recognises the interaction between those two areas.
The other important thing that this report recognises is the enormous input that Aboriginal parents and communities must have, and must be encouraged to have in the future, in determining their children's learning outcomes and curriculum content. I remember the argument we had many years ago about devolution of funds to schools. It started in New South Wales, and it has now flowed to schools around the country. But this report asks governments to seriously look at devolving funding completely to the school source to give communities and parents the responsibility of controlling funds which impact on their children's education and the way their school operates. It also encourages further participation by Aboriginal parents in driving policy outcomes in the schools. That is an important element of this report that I would hope not only MCEETYA but also all state and territory governments take into consideration. 
The report makes a suggestion that MCEETYA set up a consultative body that would particularly advise them on indigenous education, comprising representatives from ATSIC and indigenous education consultative bodies. I would urge MCEETYA to take on that recommendation and I sincerely hope that they do. They need to take indigenous education much more seriously than they are now. That is not to say that they do not take it seriously, but they need to push it up the ladder a few rungs in terms of priorities. They need to set up a structure through which those priorities can be monitored, they can be provided with some feedback and they can set policy directions. To do that, it is important that they get advice from an independent indigenous group.
In conclusion, I want to raise a number of issues pertinent to the Northern Territory. There are some very strong statements in this report about bilingual education, as well there should be—in particular, the recommendation that where bilingual programs are maintained in indigenous communities they are seen as appropriate and necessary by the communities. So this report does not accept that bilingual education is irrelevant in this country. This report accepts that it is an integral part of some communities. Where those communities actually want bilingual education and where it is appropriate, they should be encouraged to continue it. This report comments on the lack of preschool education in remote communities and the significant lack of access to secondary education in remote communities—particularly, and no less shamefully, in the Northern Territory.
The report comments on the important role of indigenous education workers and again makes a recommendation about the need to have a proper salary structure and a career structure for these people and, more particularly, to give them a final incentive to get their teacher qualifications. It is no use having Aboriginal education workers who are seen to be assistant teachers without encouraging them to take the next step to become teachers and to take control of their school in all ways. The report also looks at providing incentives for teachers in remote schools—for getting them there and keeping them there—and for improving teacher education in universities. I sincerely hope that, after this report has been tabled today, it does not sit on the shelf. I hope government members can encourage their minister to make a very prompt reply to these recommendations. I hope MCEETYA pick up each and every recommendation and that those recommendations become a national priority.

The other important thing that this report recognises is the enormous input that Aboriginal parents and communities must have, and must be encouraged to have in the future, in determining their children's learning outcomes and curriculum content. I remember the argument we had many years ago about devolution of funds to schools. It started in New South Wales, and it has now flowed to schools around the country. But this report asks governments to seriously look at devolving funding completely to the school source to give communities and parents the responsibility of controlling funds which impact on their children's education and the way their school operates. It also encourages further participation by Aboriginal parents in driving policy outcomes in the schools. That is an important element of this report that I would hope not only MCEETYA but also all state and territory governments take into consideration. 
The report makes a suggestion that MCEETYA set up a consultative body that would particularly advise them on indigenous education, comprising representatives from ATSIC and indigenous education consultative bodies. I would urge MCEETYA to take on that recommendation and I sincerely hope that they do. They need to take indigenous education much more seriously than they are now. That is not to say that they do not take it seriously, but they need to push it up the ladder a few rungs in terms of priorities. They need to set up a structure through which those priorities can be monitored, they can be provided with some feedback and they can set policy directions. To do that, it is important that they get advice from an independent indigenous group.
In conclusion, I want to raise a number of issues pertinent to the Northern Territory. There are some very strong statements in this report about bilingual education, as well there should be—in particular, the recommendation that where bilingual programs are maintained in indigenous communities they are seen as appropriate and necessary by the communities. So this report does not accept that bilingual education is irrelevant in this country. This report accepts that it is an integral part of some communities. Where those communities actually want bilingual education and where it is appropriate, they should be encouraged to continue it. This report comments on the lack of preschool education in remote communities and the significant lack of access to secondary education in remote communities—particularly, and no less shamefully, in the Northern Territory.
The report comments on the important role of indigenous education workers and again makes a recommendation about the need to have a proper salary structure and a career structure for these people and, more particularly, to give them a final incentive to get their teacher qualifications. It is no use having Aboriginal education workers who are seen to be assistant teachers without encouraging them to take the next step to become teachers and to take control of their school in all ways. The report also looks at providing incentives for teachers in remote schools—for getting them there and keeping them there—and for improving teacher education in universities. I sincerely hope that, after this report has been tabled today, it does not sit on the shelf. I hope government members can encourage their minister to make a very prompt reply to these recommendations. I hope MCEETYA pick up each and every recommendation and that those recommendations become a national priority. This report is a means to achieving further progress in indigenous education in this country.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,11,2

I am somewhat distressed that, because of the program, I do not have an opportunity to speak on the report today.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-03-16,"—Yesterday the opposition raised issues relating to the treatment of the lessor-lessee arrangement with regard to the structural adjustment package. I have received some information privately that the government are minded to respond favourably to the opposition's request that they look again at this issue in the context of what the opposition said in Hansard yesterday. If, as we say, there are inequities and anomalies which appear able to be addressed either through changing the ministerial order process documentation or perhaps even by requiring a subsequent amendment to the Dairy Industry Adjustment Bill, the government are minded to follow that process. In an attempt to short-circuit this process, it might be useful if the parliamentary secretary could confirm that or otherwise for the committee. ",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-03-16,"—With regard to the remarks that Senator O'Brien has just made, I do wish to convey to him that the government position is as I put it yesterday: we believe that the principles of the Dairy Industry Adjustment Bill 2000 are fair and just and that the bill delivers structural adjustment to those most adversely affected. As I said yesterday, the government will look at any apparent unusual circumstances to see if solutions can be found, but this can only be within the principles and framework laid down in the bill. 
I think I covered some of this ground yesterday but, for Senator O'Brien's information, I will go over it again. The lessors of the land are the landlords and a high value property with well-maintained facilities will receive a good rent; a lower value, poorly maintained property, a lower rent. Most dairying is in high value country and will have alternative uses. It is very unlikely that the rent value will decline, and we do not see that the lessor will be put in a disadvantaged position. In fact, the lessors of the land are not going to face structural adjustment pressure anywhere near as severe as the pressure the lessees will face. However, and this might seem odd to some people, they will receive a part of the entitlement even though rent values are unlikely to decline.
With the example that some senators referred to yesterday of a lessor being on a farm for only a few weeks then `walking away'—I think that was the term that was used—with an entitlement, can I pose several questions: how do we know that that person has not moved to a new farm or purchased a farm—that is, they are continuing in dairying; what would you do to a new lessee who had been on the farm for only three weeks and who was firmly committed to staying in dairying; and how do we know whether or not there is, right now, a new lessee with an entitlement working on the property of the lessor? Are you suggesting that we should create two classes of people and treat them differently?
This package, as I outlined yesterday, is about structural adjustment. Lessors and lessees may move, change their businesses and leave dairying, or they may well stay in dairying. The package assists them to do this. As I said yesterday to Senator O'Brien, I am sure he can come up with a thousand different scenarios to test the boundaries of the government package. Each of those scenarios will have a different ratio of entitlements by a lessor or lessee, but we believe that the package enables everybody to make their own choice as to what they are going to do. Those business decisions are up to the people involved. The government cannot tell them what to do, and it will not be doing so.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I thank the parliamentary secretary for that response. I think what the government are saying is that they are going to be looking at this issue. They are not minded at present to change the legislation—neither are we asking them to—and they are not minded at present to vary the drafting instructions. We are simply asking that it be looked at closely in the context of what I believe even Senator Crane has conceded are some anomalies which arise. We have been at pains to say that we are not wishing to pursue amendments to the legislation precipitously because we are conscious of the possibility for unintended consequences; neither are we, in a general sense, asking for the general principles that are being applied to the package to be varied. However, we believe we have made the case that there are potential inequities and anomalies that need to be looked at. If, as I understand the parliamentary secretary, the government are prepared to look at those, and are in the position that, if they are persuaded that action is needed, they will take it, then that seems to address in a substantial way the concerns which we have already expressed. ",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I will add some comments to those of my colleague Senator O'Brien. I think all of us have been made aware of these concerns directly by the industry. Certainly the committee was made aware of them the other day in our hearings. I received calls this morning from concerned dairy farmers—lessors—about this situation. It is a real concern. It has been put to me, and I understand it has also been put to the government in a variety of ways, including through the hearings, that in some regions the lessors, the owners of the farms, have already been made aware that many lessees will be seeking the entitlement, collecting the entitlement and departing.
That is of major concern because that does not suggest to me that they will depart, go to some other enterprise and seek to continue in the industry. It does not make a lot of sense and it does not seem logical—as you would suggest, Parliamentary Secretary—that a person would take the entitlement, leave a property and then go to another property and start dairy farming again. What is the value of doing that? If they want to continue in the industry, the more likely scenario would be that they would collect the entitlement with respect to the enterprise that they are currently involved in and would seek to continue in the industry at that enterprise.
So I think this suggestion that they will pick up the entitlement and then find another dairy farm to go and lease is a little bit of a red herring. I do not think the real world operates quite that way. The more likely scenario is that, if it is in their personal financial interest to take the entitlement and get out of the industry because they see their potential income in the future being seriously affected—according to, say, the figures that Senator Woodley has put forward—that is what they would be more likely to do. I am being told that the lessors, the farm owners, are already aware that significant numbers of farms will be affected in this way with the lessees leaving. It seems to me also that that makes a bit of a mockery of the exit package.
We know that this exit package is a tax-free amount of $45,000 that is available for any person who wishes to exit the industry. That payment is subject to the provisions of the relevant scheme under which it operates and is capped by a means test. The indications that we have are that there would be very few farmers who really would be in a position to take up that exit payment, that $45,000, because of the means test. They are better off if they can access the structural adjustment entitlement, which in some cases—in many cases, one would assume, given the average figures that we have been given—would be more than the exit package payment; they would take that option.
I reiterate the comments of Senator O'Brien. I gather from what you are saying, Parliamentary Secretary, that the government does not believe that these issues are as serious as we make them out to be; that they are not really likely to occur; and that all sorts of other factors, such as potential improvements in the value of the properties, will occur—and we dispute that as well. The government should be prepared to take notice of what we and this section of the industry are saying. The government should look at that, see how it works out over the next few months and, if a real problem with lessors does eventuate, as has been argued, it should be prepared to come back and address it.
As we have said before, this is a difficult choice. We are not able to put forward amendments that could deal with this specific problem without undermining the essential character and fabric of the package itself. That is because of the difficulties in trying to introduce a regime for a discrete group of people where you might take into account asset values and capital contributions, et cetera, to the enterprise as well as the impact upon income when, as we know, the whole package is founded on compensation or structural adjustment payments—if you want to use that term—for the loss of income that will occur through deregulation.
But I would seriously urge the parliamentary secretary to give a commitment on behalf of the government that it will consider this issue and, if in the future problems arise that are not able to be fixed by the dairy industry authority that is to be established under this act and people and their interests are seriously affected—because those interests will be interests in the dairy industry and we do want to see a better, more efficient, more productive industry—address those problems. If such issues and problems are not addressed, clearly we will be leaving some sectors of the industry in perhaps a worse position than they are currently in.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-03-16,"—I want to extend this debate because, while I recognise that Senator O'Brien and Senator Forshaw at this point are willing to trust the government, I am not—and I will say that up front. I think they are correct though in that, at the end of the day, the government will have to sort this out. I really believe the government has to give us the commitment that Senator Forshaw is asking for, but I think that commitment needs a fair bit more content. At this stage I am not prepared to simply support the comment that Senator Forshaw is making. I just do not think it is good enough that, if we discover problems along the road, the government might look at this issue. I want some commitment from the government that there is a process that will enable that to happen. I have been talking again to the people involved this morning, and it is not an insignificant number of people. That is the first point I want to make.
The second point is that, if we use the processes of appeal, tribunals or whatever to solve this problem, what we are really saying to these people is, `The only recourse you are going to have will be a long, expensive and legal one.' I do not think that is good enough. It has been shown very clearly—at least to the rural and regional affairs committee when it met—that there is a significant problem. I believe that we ought to be getting from the government a proper process for resolving that problem. 
Let me underline this issue by quoting from the Hansard of the Senate hearing on Friday, 10 March. It reads:
Senator McGAURAN—I think you have articulated a case clearly for us all. Can you confirm whether the greater majority of sharefarmer lessor/lessee relationships reside in the state of Victoria?
Mrs George—I think they do.
Mr Mynard—Absolutely. There are nearly five times the number of sharefarmers and lessees in Victoria than in other states, yes. The answer is yes.
Senator McGAURAN—Do you happen to have a figure of how many you would represent?
Mrs George—Not personally. I had a lot of faxes sent through to Senator Harris's office. We have access to those. They are somewhere around here. They just give you a few different cases. Different people have written in just to voice their opinion and to give their personal particulars of what is happening. They are free for you to read too.
Mrs Wilson—I would say it would be in the vicinity of 300 and 500 farmers.
Senator McGAURAN—Significant.
Mrs Wilson—Yes.
I support what I said yesterday, I want to put on the record a further question that Senator McGauran asked. It reads:
Senator McGAURAN—Therefore, if that is the case, you represent a significant number—a greater majority reside in the state of Victoria. What then—in a nutshell, if you can, because we are always pressed for time—is your representative body, the United Dairy Farmers, telling you about your case?
Mrs George—I have been to meetings and I have spoken with Alan Burgess and Max Fehring. 
I am aware that those people are present in the gallery. I want them to know that this was the evidence given to us. Mrs George continues:
They seem sympathetic to me personally, but they really say, `There's always going to be a few that slip through. There's nothing you can do. You'll have to wait and appeal at the end.' They are basically saying that I am an odd person, that I am just one. But, from the response to our advertisement in the paper, we are not a minority. There are a lot of us out there, and I think we are going to be flooding the tribunal in the end. Surely they cannot cope with the amount of people who will be doing this.
Senator McGAURAN—So the UDF is not representing your particular point of view?
Mrs George—No, we feel that they are not interested in us. That is the feeling I get from speaking to them. I am a member too. We pay our fees.
I put this on the record to show you that the evidence given to our committee was significant.  
There is a real problem here. People are feeling that there must be some way in which this issue can be resolved. While I respect greatly what Senator O'Brien and Senator Forshaw are saying, I believe that the government must give us more assurances than simply saying, `At the end of the road there will be a process. You will be able to go to tribunals,' and all the rest of it, which is time consuming, usually involves legal representatives, usually is expensive and will mean that there will be a long drawn out process before people can get any justice. I believe that is not good enough and that the government must do more while we have the bill before us. As we all know, good intentions are expressed by everybody but once we pass legislation they are often forgotten. What we must have is a commitment on the record from the government that there will be a proper process to resolve this issue. 
While I am on my feet, I point out that Senator Boswell entered this debate at this very point yesterday and slurred me significantly. I want to answer that slur. 
—Senator Boswell! 
—Yes, Senator Boswell. The Hansard states:
Senator BOSWELL—I can do my sums as well as you can, Senator, but I do not run around in the pretence of being the chairman of a Senate committee and build up expectation and hope. You know very well that this is a very generous package.
This kind of slur has been made against me regularly—and I say quite clearly—by members of the UDV and others. I have ignored them up to this point. I have simply allowed them to go. Senator Boswell was not at any meeting that I was at. So he is repeating things that have been repeated over and over again in these debates. I went as chairman of the committee, at the invitation of a number of branches of the UDV and the New South Wales authority, to explain the details of the report. I must say that there was total ignorance of what the report contained, even from those who said that they accepted that the report said that deregulation is inevitable. That is the only part of the report most of them read. 
I put on the record in those meetings what the report actually said. Then I clearly said, `As a Democrat senator, I am against deregulation.' I made that very clear. Surely I am able to do that. As the chairman I presented what the report said. Senator Boswell was not at any of those meetings. I could add a few more of the slurs which were made against me which have come back to me. For instance, that I am a minister of a small religious sect in Queensland and therefore anything I say should be discounted. The Uniting Church is fairly large and is a mainstream church, last time I checked. One can let these things go, but when they are repeated in this chamber by the Leader of the National Party because that is what he was told—he was not at any of the meetings—I do start to get a little annoyed. I believe I have the right to correct the record in the same place in which the slur was repeated.
—He is the leader of a small sect.
—It is getting smaller. At one of the meetings also, it was said to me that my position could be respected if I had written a minority report. That is a ridiculous assertion because there was no need to write a minority report; I accepted and put my name to that report. It was a unanimous report, because I believed in every word of it. The fact that deregulation is inevitable is quite correct, and the reason it is inevitable is that there is no political will to do anything about it. That is the problem. I could expand on that at great length but I will not. Let me say where the lack of political will is coming from; I think if I whistle you can point. I will not expand on that.
I just wanted to put on the record that that was a slur. It was a slur that was simply repeated because it parallels many other slurs that have been made. While I have not answered them before because I did not think it was worth it, let me now place on the record that it is a slur and it is incorrect.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I want to ask a question of the parliamentary secretary. I was listening to the debate on the monitor, and there are a whole range of possibilities that we will not be able to identify up-front. Even with regard to the lessor-lessee circumstance, a whole range of situations could develop. Is it envisaged that the DAA will have the capacity to consider some of these potential anomalies if they arise? If it will, what will the process be for it to deal with them? ",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-03-16,"—I think I already indicated in my remarks at the end of the second reading debate that the DAA, in considering the rights to entitlement of lessors, lessees and other people in the dairy industry, will make a decision on what the entitlement for that individual will be. If that individual does not agree with the amount that has been decided, they then have the capacity to appeal to the DAA itself, and there is a capacity for review of that. This will partly answer, I hope, Senator Woodley's comments as well. That is the process. 
If the person or persons are then not happy with the review that has been done by the Dairy Adjustment Authority, they can then make a further appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. So there is that double-edged capacity for review of the decision, and that is the process that occurs. The government has built this into the legislation and, unlike some of the inferences which have been made by Senator Woodley, we do have a process for dealing with it and that is the way in which it will operate.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-03-16,"—I would like to place on record some further information that was drawn to my attention last night, and I would like to read from a letter that I addressed to each of the senators. It is from a constituent in Victoria, and it states:
I wish to inform you that I have been talking to one of the Victorian constituents who has just won the title of Large Herd Australian Business of the Year 2000, a prestigious Australian wide recognition of his outstanding work in the dairy industry. He also took out the most profitable award. 
He informs me that, under the deregulation package, he will no longer be profitable and plans to exit the industry. He also informs me that the farmers in England are tipping their milk down the drain for three days this week to try to get across to their parliamentarians that deregulation has been a failure and they are now reduced to peasant farming standards.
I am concerned with the process and the options that the parliamentary secretary is putting before this committee—that is, if any person within this process is aggrieved, their only means of proceeding with that issue under the government's proposal is to go to court. Senator Troeth also said that, if they discover things along the road, they will put in place measures to cope with those situations. But it is very, very clear that the problems have been put before the government already. We do not have to wait until we get down the road; we already know what some of the problems are. 
I would like to quote the particular situation of a New South Wales constituent. I have the lady's permission to name her: Mrs Joy Boucher. The Bouchers purchased their dairy farm in 1984, operated it themselves for a period of years and leased it in 1987. They have no quota milk at all and, under the government's legislation, the entire package is going to go to their lessee. The lessee has already put Mr and Mrs Boucher on notice that, as of July, they intend to exit the industry. They will take with them the entire package, approximately $90,000, that would be attributed to their production from manufacturing milk. 
Here we have a classic example of what Senator Troeth is saying: that the only option these people have is to go to court. I believe that we would be erring as senators in this chamber if we did not address the issue now. It is not a case of getting down the road, finding the problem and then putting an issue in place that will remedy it. We know what the problems are. I am not saying that this is not a complex issue; it is extremely complex, and it is going to be difficult to find a situation that will in actuality give fairness to all.
I would like to move on to some of the outcomes of the dairy adjustment package. If we look at the market milk that is produced on a state by state basis, the production in New South Wales, in actuality, far outstrips the production in Victoria. New South Wales produces 597 million litres of market milk in a year, Victoria produces 508 million, Queensland produces 391 million, South Australia produces 186 million, Western Australia produces 192 million and Tasmania produces 58 million. So the area that, I believe, will be worst hit in relation to losses in the price of market milk is New South Wales. 
When we look at the adjustment package and the share state by state, New South Wales actually loses 504.61 million and Victoria loses only 429 million. But, when you look at the net difference in those two states, New South Wales ends up losing 167 million overall, while Victoria actually gains 335 million. So it is very, very clear that the predominant funding for the dairy adjustment package will come out of New South Wales and end up in Victoria. This is as a result of the way the package is structured. We can go on and list a considerable number of cases. In New South Wales alone, there are over 100 dairies who operate without a quota. So, if there is a lessee-lessor arrangement, every one of those will have no option other than to go to court to sort out the issue.
I believe that the amendments that I will move at a later stage in this debate will address the issue. Concerns have been raised that it may, in actuality, restrict the ability of people to exit the industry. If the package is attached to the property, I believe that it will be equitable whether those people wish to leave the property or not. In real terms, if the property is offered for sale under the government's proposal whereby the person can exit the industry and take the adjustment package with them, that will reflect in the price of the property. If they choose to leave it there, or it is tied to the property, they will gain the same amount that they would have by selling the property without the adjustment package, taking the lower price and walking away with the package. I believe that this will have the effect of placing the adjustment package where it should fairly sit. I believe it is totally inequitable to put a package up that is paid by the producers who are staying in the industry to support somebody who wishes to leave that industry and start in a different area.
In conclusion, I would like to place on record very clearly that we will not be opposing the adjustment package legislation, and again I reiterate very clearly that the dairy industry finds itself in this situation as a result of the undesirable and relentless pursuit by successive governments of the national competition policy. I believe that the only way that it is possible for large companies and multinational corporations to get their hands on the primary industries in Australia is to remove the cooperative system, and this has been done through the national competition policy, which then exposes all of those industries to large mergers and takeovers. That, I believe, is the base of the problem that we have in the industry and through other industries within Australia. In closing, I reiterate that we will support the bill but believe that the bill will be far more equitable to the industry if the amendments that I will propose at the appropriate time are carried.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-03-16,"—I will reply to some of those remarks very briefly. In the first instance, both Senator Woodley and Senator Harris have indicated that there is no process, that once this event occurs all dairy farmers will be plunged into an absolute morass of not knowing, of having no certainty about what their entitlements are going to be and of having no recourse if they do not agree with their entitlements. I have said, and I will say again for the record, that the Dairy Adjustment Authority has been set up to deal with what people's entitlements should be. If the individuals or persons do not agree with the amount that is decided for them, they then have the recourse of appealing to the Dairy Adjustment Authority for a review. Then, if they do not agree with that, they can go on further to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That is the process that we have set in place, and that is the process that we believe will fit the purpose.
In response to Senator Woodley's remarks that every lessee in Victoria or people who lease again will be thrown into uncertainty, the information I have been given is that most of the 390 leasing farms in Tasmania and Victoria are on a three- to five-year contract, which will override the period of this adjustment. So they have every expectation, unless they choose to break it, of what the arrangements are going to be. To insinuate that the entire dairy industry is going to be thrown into uncertainty as a result of this bill is very wrong indeed.  
Lastly, with regard to the case of the Bouchers cited by Senator Harris, the Bouchers do not have any quota milk, Senator Harris. They produce totally manufacturing milk. The price will not change and is not affected by deregulation.
—It will probably go up. 
—It will probably go up, as my colleague Senator Boswell says. So for you to draw the conclusions that you have from that case is totally unwarranted. To all senators I simply say that my remarks as of before still apply. The government will, of course, look at any apparent unusual circumstances and will undertake to see if solutions can be found. I do not propose to add any more to that.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-03-16,"—I will check the Hansard record, but I do not think I said the whole industry would be thrown into chaos. I very carefully read the evidence from the committee report. I was talking about the problem for lessees and lessors. I also do not think I said there was no process. If I did, I apologise to the parliamentary secretary. I certainly did not mean to say there was no process. The emphasis I put on it was that the process will involve people in lengthy, time consuming, probably requiring legal assistance and costly involvement in order to get the issue resolved for them.
That is the concern I have, that the process itself is not going to give a quick or cheap answer to these people, and the problem is being created by the legislation. I do believe that the problem should be solved in either a legislative way or by a commitment from the government which is not the one that has been given. I am not going to delay the Senate any longer, but that is the concern I have. Although the parliamentary secretary is doing her best, I still believe the process she has spelt out is one that will create problems for those people involved. I will not say any more because I do not want to hold up the Senate any longer.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will support these amendments. They reflect the belated concern of this government, dragged kicking and screaming to accept the recommendations of the Senate committee's report that there should be a package of assistance for the impact that deregulation will have upon regional communities. We could probably stand here and talk for some time about that issue. We did deal with it extensively in our report last October. I am sure Senator Woodley will add some further remarks. It was clear to us as we travelled around the country that there would be an impact upon towns in dairying regions. We urged the government in our recommendations that they needed to look at the implications and the impact of deregulation upon those communities. 
It is at the eleventh hour that they have come to the table with this proposal for $45 million. It would have been far more helpful and constructive if the government had given us that indication some time ago, because we would then have been given an opportunity to consider whether or not that was a sufficient amount. I have my doubts. Again, to some extent we are having to consider things that will occur in the future. We know they will occur, but it would have been helpful for the committee when it was examining this bill earlier this week to have had before it the information that the government was prepared to do this, to give us the opportunity to consider whether this was an effective and adequate amount. 
We will certainly be monitoring this situation, as indeed we monitor the impact of this government's policies on rural and regional Australia. I spoke about that yesterday in the matters of public interest debate. We have seen the serious impact of many government decisions, whether it be in education, health, Telstra and so on, upon rural and regional Australia. This situation also calls for specific targeted assistance in those communities. We are happy to support these amendments because at least the government have finally woken up and realised that they have to do something. ",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-03-16,"—I will ignore interjections, otherwise we will extend this debate. I indicate to Senator Boswell that he will extend the debate quite considerably if he interjects.
—Are you threatening the dairy industry?
—I will respond to that interjection—it may have been directed at Senator Forshaw, but I am not sure. Apart from Senator McGauran, whom I commend for his attention to this issue, the National Party have been absolutely absent from this debate. I think that is a threat to the dairy industry, because they are the ones who always claim that they represent farmers. That is my reply to that interjection.
The Democrats welcome these amendments from the government. While we are talking about state governments, let me pay tribute to the state government of Queensland. Minister Palaszczuk put together a very extensive package along these lines and took it to the ARMCANZ meeting, where it was not accepted, but there was a high level task group of state ministers set up in order to monitor the effects of deregulation in regional areas. I certainly believe that his action in doing that was part of the catalyst—along with the Senate report which recommended that this particular action be taken—for the government to finally put in place these particular amendments.
I had half finished getting amendments drafted along exactly the same lines myself, but once the government indicated they would be moving these amendments, I ceased having those amendments drafted, because obviously it is much more effective if the government move amendments such as these themselves. Those were some of the motivations for these amendments to be brought forward. I commend the government for them. I believe they will go some of the way to addressing the recommendation which the Senate committee made in its report.
However, I have several questions. It will be a lot quicker if I ask them all together. I direct them to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. One of the issues that was raised with me—and was raised by Minister Palaszczuk's submission to the ARMCANZ meeting—was the involvement of the state ministers task group in this issue. In my amendments, I was trying to get them involved, but realised we are dealing with money that the Commonwealth is handling so it is appropriate to channel it through a Commonwealth department, but state ministers are obviously very close to the impacts in regional areas. Could the Commonwealth give some assurance that it may also be involved in at least indicating to the states where these impacts are occurring? I think it would be very useful if that could be done. I realise that this has come late to the Senate so it is not possible to spell out all of the details—I trust the government on that point—but under paragraphs (2)(a), (b), (c) and (d) we have an indication of the kinds of guidelines which will be drawn up. I imagine the government has not yet had any indication of what those might be. But does the government have in mind who the recipients of payments might be and whom they will be directed at? Are there any limits on the amounts of the payments? The timing is covered, because it is within the next three years. Are there any terms and conditions yet in the government's mind that may be applied to these payments? Those are my questions.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-03-16,"—I rise to put on record One Nation support for the government amendments and, in doing so, to reflect on the issue of the quotas. I realise this does not go to quotas, but I will make the linkage. The states themselves have the powers to deregulate and, therefore, in doing that, to do away with the quotas. The milk quotas do have a market monetary value. They are used as security against loans when approaching banks, so they definitely have a market monetary value. I believe that the states should kick into this process as well in a meaningful way. In doing that, they would also be adding a considerable amount of finance into this restructuring package, and that would go directly into the relevant areas; that is, relevant to what we are speaking about. 
I indicate to the chamber that I will be moving an amendment to one of the government's amendments in relation to the rural restructuring package, and I will speak to that at the appropriate time.
—Now is the appropriate time to move your amendment, Senator Harris, and you may speak as well.
—I move the following amendment:
(1) At the end of subclause 84A(2), add:
; provided that all payments must be made with the object of providing assistance only to those regions where entities which produced market milk and/or manufacturing milk were located at the commencement of this programme.
In moving the revised amendment on running sheet 1741, I draw the chamber's attention to the intent of the amendment. The intention of the amendment is to ensure that the money that is actually disbursed under the rural adjustment package goes into those areas where the dairy products are actually produced. Initially, the original amendment that we circulated used the terminology `where the payment of the levy was initiated'. In actuality, we have been correctly shown that that is paid by the consumer, so that is the reason for the change to the amendment.
The amendment primarily seeks to ensure that the package goes into those regions and districts where the dairy industry is operating, so that it will effectively assist those people whose livelihood— and there are a considerable number of them—depends on the provision of services for the dairy industry. We could very easily become so tied up in the enormous potential of the impact of the adjustment program by focusing on the dairy producers, lessors, lessees and owner-operators, that we could overlook the potential effect that this will have on the rural regions that primarily exist because of the dairy industry. In conclusion, I commend the amendment to the Senate. It does not take away from anything that the government is setting out to do. It adds clarity as to where the rural adjustment package will actually end up.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-03-16,"—Could I briefly say in response to Senator Woodley's questions that the program is based on the recommendation of the regional advisory committees. So we have taken that into account. With regard to the state government commitments, obviously it is up to each state government to give their own responses to this, and certainly we have yet to see any response from Queensland on this, and that is out of the federal government's hands.
Could I also indicate to Senator Harris that the government will not be supporting his amendment because I have already said that our package is specifically targeted to those dairy dependent communities and it is obviously targeted at the dairy industry. We believe that whatever your amendment does is already encompassed in ours. We will not be supporting your amendment, Senator Harris.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2000-03-16,"—I will take very little time, but I wish to pick up a remark made by Senator Woodley who said that the National Party was not interested in the debate. I received a deputation from the dairy industry today in my office who asked me to get this legislation through as soon as possible. It is going to cause some concern if it is not through today. That is the reason why I have not joined in the debate either yesterday or today. I want that very much on the record.
—Were you here yesterday?
—I was here yesterday. I was sitting in here yesterday monitoring what you said.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-03-16,"—Can I just indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will not be supporting this amendment. I recognise the good intentions of Senator Harris in his remarks, but the parliamentary secretary covered the issues adequately in her response. Clearly, we would be expecting that the announcement from the government will be targeted at the appropriate communities and regions, and be handled through the appropriate scheme that exists. We do not really think that it needs this amendment to achieve the intent. 
Whilst I am on my feet, the issues raised by Senator Woodley are, of course, important issues and no doubt we will have on opportunity through the estimates process in the future to further examine just how and where this money is ultimately spent to ensure it is appropriately spent for the assistance of those is intended to assist.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-03-16,"—by leave—I move :
(1)	Schedule 1, item 17, page 9 (after line 27), after the definition of premium component insert:
qualifying enterprise means an enterprise referred to in paragraph 13(2)(a).
(2)	Schedule 1, item 17, page 15 (after line 7), after paragraph (a), insert:
(aa)	the entity continues to hold an eligible interest in the qualifying enterprise; and
(3)	Schedule 1, item 17, page 18 (line 9), at the end of subclause (5), add:
; (d)	whether the entry has supplied a significant proportion of the labour required to carry on the eligible dairy farm enterprise. 
(4)	Schedule 1, item 17, page 20 (after line 3), after paragraph 15 (2)(b), insert:
 (ba)	the entity continues to hold an eligible interest in the enterprise mentioned in paragraph (b); and

(a)	the transferee is an eligible entity and has an interest in the qualifying enterprise in respect of which the units were issued; or
(b)	the transferee gives the DAA a written undertaking to assign the unit to an eligible entity with an interest in the qualifying enterprise in respect of which the units were issued, within 60 days after the transfer is registered.
(6)	Schedule 1, item 17, page 29 (line 8), omit “first day”, substitute “first and last days”.
(7)	Schedule 1, item 17, page 29 (line 23), omit “first”, substitute “last”.
(8)	Schedule 1, item 17, page 30 (after line 2), at the end of clause 23, add:
DSAP payments only payable in respect of ongoing dairy farm enterprises
(9)	The eighth objective is that a DSAP payment is payable only if an entity continues to hold an eligible interest in, and carry on, the qualifying enterprise.
I would like to briefly go through and speak to each of the amendments, just to clarify the intention of them. The purpose of amendment (1) is to insert a new definition into the definitions setting out a `qualifying enterprise'. The intention, broadly speaking, of all of the amendments is to tie the package to the property. From my consultation with the dairy producers, the overwhelming concern that has been expressed by them is that under the government's proposal people can exit the industry, walk away and leave a property owner with a defunct dairy and no ability to attract somebody to come back in and rework it. So all of these amendments are structured to achieve that purpose. So amendment (1) would insert the `qualifying enterprise', and that means an enterprise referred to in paragraph 13(2)(a).
Amendment No. 2 makes another insertion on the standard payment right. That requires the entity to continue to hold an interest in that enterprise to receive that right. Amendment No. 3 requires the authority to take into account the labour content of the lessee in an effort to put a balance between the lessor and the lessee, particularly in some of the cases where the major input from the lessee is the labour content. An example is: where the lessor has the property, the buildings and the herd, operates the enterprise and manages and looks after the pastures, the larger percentage of their input is in a labour content. So if they were working in a dairy that had a large percentage of market milk, then their input, if it is assessed purely on an economic basis, would be disproportionately disadvantaged to them. So amendment No. 3 on running sheet 1740 is there so that the committee would take into consideration that labour content of the lessee.
Amendment No. 4 is to apply and require the enterprise that is successful in putting up a case for an anomaly payment to also remain attached to that entity to continue to be eligible for that anomaly payment. Amendment No. 5 omits the existing paragraph that refers to the transferral of the registered units and substitutes that the units must be returned to the entity within 60 days after the transfer has been registered. Amendment No. 6 then moves to transfer the actual payment of the levy from the first day of the quarter to the last day of the quarter. The purpose of doing that is so that the levy then becomes payable in the period that the recipient has actually worked within the industry rather than having it paid on the first day. Amendment No. 7 is in the same vein of changing the dates.
Amendment (8) adds an additional clause. That requires the entity to stay in the industry to continue receiving those payments. As I said in my earlier remarks, I believe that the major problem that has been indicated to me from the producers themselves is the concern that people will be actually leaving the industry and taking the package and moving into another industry and leaving those who are battling on and soldiering on in the industry to actually provide that finance.
One question that I would like to put to the parliamentary secretary is: has the government actually structured the payment in this way to encourage people to leave the industry and, therefore, reduce the number of producers in the industry? Because, if it was not their intention, it certainly will become the outcome of this legislation. I believe that is grossly unjust for the people who are going to stay in the industry. I understand that the government will put the argument that it is the consumer who is going to pay the price of the levy. I think really if the government believe that they also believe in the tooth fairy. The industry is indicating to me very clearly—they are crying out—that they believe the 11c levy is already being reflected in the prices that they themselves are receiving. 
To sum up, the intention is to ensure that this money that is being generated within the industry will stay within the industry and will be there to support those who intend to stay there and continue to produce the dairy products.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-03-16,"—Just very briefly in response to Senator Harris, the government will not be supporting these amendments. We believe that to tie the entitlement to the farm and not the individuals negates the intent of this legislation. Senator Harris, the government's intention is to facilitate individuals in their life choices in what they want to do, whether they want to stay in the industry, move on in the industry or move out of the industry. That is why we have structured the package as it is. To move on these amendments as proposed by Senator Harris means that the package would be unworkable and so inflexible as to make a nonsense of the government's intention and, indeed, I believe the work that has been put by the whole of the dairy industry into this package to move the dairy industry on. Therefore, the government will not be supporting these amendments.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-03-16,"—I need to indicate the Democrats will support these amendments, but for a particular reason. The reason is that we believe the government response on this issue has been inadequate. Senator Harris has tried to do the work for the government. Whether there are unintended consequences in these amendments or not I do not know, but at least what they do is move the debate and, I would hope, focus the government's attention on the fact that we believe this issue is more serious than the government's response has indicated.
Can I also just point out that in the drafting there is one word that probably needs changing. I think amendment No. 3(d) should read `entity' not `entry'.
—Yes.
—Anyway, I indicate that we will support these. I do not think there is any need for a division, because I understand the Labor Party will not support them, and I can count.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will not be supporting these amendments. But by saying that does not mean that we do not recognise—as we have said earlier on countless occasions in this debate and in the hearings—that there are some potential problems. We all know that. But we do not believe that this is the way to fix those problems. Indeed, we are concerned that if these amendments were to be accepted you would change the essential nature—indeed, the whole fabric—of the package from one which has clearly been developed to, as I said, compensate or provide an adjustment payment to reflect the fact that incomes will be affected, will be reduced, to one which was based upon the value of the enterprise, the capital contribution, the asset value and so on. That would be a substantial change in the package. In order to try to fix a potential problem with a discrete group of people that have been identified—in this case lessors—it could and would, we believe, seriously affect the many thousands of other persons in the industry who will receive an entitlement under the package. We are not prepared to do that. We are not prepared to destroy this package in that way.
The times have been set. We know that it is due to commence on 1 April. The DMS ends on 1 July. This is effectively the last sitting day that we can get this legislation through this parliament—indeed, I think we probably have about 20 minutes left—otherwise there will be no package. If these amendments were to be carried there would not be a package, in our view. That would mean that deregulation would occur with no package at all. This was something the committee considered last year. The choice was between a package or deregulation by cold turkey. I think, as Senator Woodley indicated—and I reject his assertion that there is a lack of political will—there is a political reality: we know that the Commonwealth and each of the states have now accepted deregulation. It is not within the power of this parliament to stop that. We are not about to abandon the rights and entitlements of everybody in the industry by supporting these amendments. I understand where Senator Harris is coming from. He is attempting to try to solve some problems that we have indicated could occur, but the advice we have is that these amendments will not do that and indeed that we would jeopardise the entire package. So we cannot support these amendments.

Would the parliamentary secretary like to bring to the chamber's attention the possibility of that section also being able to bring the levy in on powdered milk itself that is placed on the supermarket shelf.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-03-16,"—What I was seeking from the parliamentary secretary—I understood that the section picks up all liquid milk—was whether the government could, if they had the intent through section 6.2, apply the levy to imports of powdered milk placed on the supermarket shelf. Very quickly, my reason for raising this is that I am concerned that we may see imports of powdered milk rise. I believe it would be prudent to have a process where the government could capture that as well and also have the funds contribute to the adjustment levy.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-03-16,"—The adult telephone service industry employs around 3,000 people, and most of these are women. There are sensible options for achieving a balanced outcome in terms of keeping children off adult phone services, protecting jobs and allowing adults to choose whether to use those services or not. It is difficult to get precise figures, but we know a number of callers are now taking advantage of overseas telephone sex lines, so we are essentially shifting this industry offshore.
The amendment I will move today when we reach the committee stage is identical to the amendment I moved in May last year. This amendment supports the freedom of expression of Australian citizens. It allows for the education of telephone account holders so that they can choose what they and their households may access. This amendment protects the access choice rights of telecommunications consumers. In short, our amendment goes to allowing people to opt out of adult phone services if they so wish by simply making one phone call. In the same way that all Australians can now bar STD and international phone calls, they would have the same option—if they so choose—with adult phone services. We think that is a very balanced approach. It will make the present unworkable system workable and, more importantly, it will preserve another 3,000 jobs in a telecommunications industry about to be decimated by the short-sightedness of a privatised national communications carrier. 
We are now witnessing a very substantial climate of censorship in this country. It fair to say that the Democrats have consistently stood for those kinds of liberties and for moving governments away from the role of being the arbiter of morals and censoring what people can say to one another. That is essentially what this legislation is about: what people can say to one another. For those who are concerned that our action in moving this amendment might delay the passage of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill 1999, I make it clear that I am informed that any delay in the progression of the bill will not impact in any way on the users of the national relay service.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-03-16,"— Let me begin by saying that the Timor Gap Treaty (Transitional Arrangements) Bill 2000 has a major impact on the Northern Territory and its involvement in the changes we have seen in Indonesia with the establishment now of East Timor as a country in its own right. So, as a senator for the Northern Territory, I am pleased to be able to stand here today and support the bill. 
The purpose of this bill is to amend the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Act 1990 and related acts to reflect the fact that the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor—UNTAET, as it is commonly known now—has replaced Indonesia as Australia's partner in the operation of the Timor Gap Treaty. As we know, on 26 October 1999 UNTAET was established by resolution 1272 of the United Nations Security Council as the interim administrative and legal authority for East Timor. From that time on, Indonesia ceased to exercise any sovereign rights in the area covered by the Timor Gap Treaty.
The bill is consistent with the Labor Party's approach to the future of the Timor Gap, specifically that an independent East Timor could and should be encouraged to replace Indonesia in respect of the operation of the Timor Gap Treaty. That policy was first enunciated by the ALP in September 1998. In Dili, on 10 February, diplomatic notes were exchanged between the United Nations Transitional Administrator in East Timor and Australia's diplomatic representative in East Timor on the interim arrangements for the Timor Gap Treaty. So UNTAET, acting on behalf of East Timor, becomes Australia's partner in the treaty, and the terms of the treaty will continue to apply in the transitional period until East Timor's full independence as a country.
It is a matter of public record that this agreement was negotiated in consultation with East Timorese representatives and, in a press release on 10 February announcing the agreement between Australia and UNTAET, Foreign Minister Downer and the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin, indicated:
In talks in Jakarta last week—
that is, of course, the first week of February—
Indonesian representatives agreed that following the separation of East Timor from Indonesia, the area covered by the Treaty was now outside Indonesia's jurisdiction and that the Treaty ceased to be in force as between Australia and Indonesia when Indonesian authority over East Timor transferred to the United Nations.
The agreement between Australia and UNTAET, the exchange of notes on 10 February, provides that UNTAET accepts all of the rights and obligations previously exercised by Indonesia under the Timor Gap Treaty. Speaking on 10 February, UNTAET Administrator de Mello rightly said that the agreement comes at `a very important moment for East Timor'—and he is right—as it will guarantee potentially valuable revenues for the territory as it recovers from last year's violence and outbreak of anti-independence action on behalf of Indonesia. The agreement with UNTAET applies retrospectively from the establishment of UNTAET, thereby achieving a seamless transition between Indonesia's exit from the Timor Gap Treaty and UNTAET's entry into that relationship with Australia. This interim agreement is without prejudice to the position of the future government of an independent East Timor. 
Long-term arrangements for the Timor Gap will need to be concluded between Australia and an independent East Timor after the departure of UNTAET. There will no doubt be ongoing discussions between Australia and East Timor's political leadership on this issue. It is a matter of public record that East Timorese leaders have expressed a range of views on possible future arrangements for the Timor Gap and have raised the possibility of renegotiation. Our ALP shadow minister for foreign affairs, Mr Laurie Brereton, has stated he is confident that Australia and an independent East Timor should be able to conclude arrangements which ensure continuity, give security to the companies operating in the Timor Gap and ensure that East Timor will derive significant economic benefits from the Timor Gap.
It is an important historical landmark for our country to come to terms with our responsibilities as a neighbour to East Timor now. As a nation, we have become involved and committed to East Timor in a very positive way—in particular, no doubt, in the last 12 months. These actions have been recognised and acknowledged not only by Australians but also most importantly by the East Timorese community. Through our leadership under Major General Cosgrove and INTERFET, we have repaid an enormous debt in the form of the relationship we historically had with East Timor as a result of the Second World War, and we have now recognised the importance of the East Timorese being self-determining in their relationships with us. 
The enactment of this bill could contribute to investor certainty in the Timor Gap. Over $US700 million has been spent on petroleum exploration and development of area A of the Timor Gap zone of cooperation since the treaty entered into force in 1991. The first commercial oil production commenced in July 1998 with the development of the small Elang-Kakatua field, which currently produces about 16,000 barrels a day and generates revenues to both Australia and East Timor at a rate of approximately $US3 million per annum.
Development of other projects in the zone of cooperation, notably the Bayu-Undan and Sunrise gas condensate fields, could involve capital expenditures of $US15 billion, including major onshore facilities in the vicinity of Darwin. The development of the Bayu-Undan liquids project, a world-class project by a Phillips Petroleum led consortium, has the potential to provide several tens of millions of dollars per annum to both East Timor and Australia for a period of 10 to 20 years, commencing in 2004. The Bayu-Undan project has the potential to make a very significant contribution to the economic development and stability of an independent East Timor. Development of the second LNG production phase of the project has even greater potential for both East Timor and the Northern Territory. 
In the Northern Territory we are well placed to take advantage of the benefits that will flow from the development of the Timor Gap. We already know of the plans by Phillips Petroleum—and now we hear of Woodside and Shell—for the future development of the resources which will come out of the Timor Gap through plants developed in the Northern Territory near Darwin. Those are very important to our economy and I do not think we should underestimate their importance to our economy or the fact that they will provide significant benefits to the people of the Northern Territory. 
The changes contained in this bill should provide continuity in the arrangements under the terms of the Timor Gap Treaty to reflect the change in Australia's treaty partner from Indonesia to UNTAET and to validate the actions of the Timor Gap Ministerial Council and Joint Authority since October of last year. They will also enable the continuation of a range of Australian taxation, customs, immigration, crime and quarantine laws relating to petroleum operations in the Timor Gap. They should not have any direct financial impact on companies or individuals or on the Australian government. Finally, let me say in finishing that this bill has the Labor Party's strong bipartisan support. On behalf of the people of the Northern Territory, and in particular those in Darwin, I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TIMOR GAP TREATY (TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-03-16,"—On behalf of the Democrats, I say that we agree with what both Senator Crossin has said on behalf of the Labor Party and the minister has said in the second reading speech on the Timor Gap Treaty (Transitional Arrangements) Bill 2000, which was tabled a few weeks ago. I cannot help myself; I have to draw to the attention of senators a few of the more ironic aspects of this bill. 
We are going through this bill during what is commonly known, amongst the whips at any rate, as the time for non-controversial legislation. The reason for that is that this is non-controversial legislation. Everybody agrees with it. I am sure a lot of senators in this place will remember when the original bill went through this place. It was anything but non-controversial. It was one of the most controversial pieces of legislation that we had throughout that whole parliament. I am so pleased to see that this has changed well and truly for the better and especially that it is considered non-controversial by all parties in the Senate.  
The explanatory memorandum makes quite amusing reading if you look at a few of the things contained in it. I will go through a couple. I will not take much of the time of the Senate. Firstly, the definition of `Indonesia' has been removed from several places within the bill because the definition of Indonesia that included East Timor is now redundant. Many of us thought that the definition of Indonesia which included East Timor was pretty redundant when the bill went through in the first place. I am pleased to see that that has been changed. 
Secondly, in the future under this legislation, the minister will be allowed to adjust the definition of `East Timor' in the regulations. Normally, that sort of thing would worry me and I would look closely at what power that conferred upon the minister. In the case of this bill, I must say that it does not worry me at all. I am quite pleased that the minister has the flexibility to redefine `East Timor' in regulations. I see that East Timor is now heading inexorably towards being a self-governing nation. 
Thirdly—and this is my personal favourite—in item 4, paragraphs 9A(2)(b) and (c) the definition of `East Timor' has been defined with particular reference to the Macquarie Dictionary, second revision, reprinted in 1989. The Macquarie Dictionary and the explanatory memorandum define `nation' as `a body of people associated with a particular territory who are sufficiently conscious of their unity to seek or to possess a government peculiarly of their own'. I would have thought that that could have applied to East Timor well and truly when the first bill went through. It certainly does apply now. With a little more imagination perhaps we could have come to this conclusion a long time ago and avoided all the ruction that that first bill caused. 
I acknowledge the foreign policy objectives of Australia at the time of the first bill, the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill 1990. I am immensely pleased to support absolutely wholeheartedly this amendment bill to the original bill. I am immensely pleased that it is going through non-controversially. I do not think we will see it again and that is probably to its advantage as well. I also commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TIMOR GAP TREATY (TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-03-16,"—I thank the opposition and other senators who have spoken for their support for this important bill, the Timor Gap Treaty (Transitional Arrangements) Bill 2000. It does give effect under Australian legislation to the new treaty arrangements for the Timor Gap zone of cooperation. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-03-16,"—The Labor Party supports the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999. This bill provides for the scheduling under the act of three parcels of land associated with the Warumungu and Frewena land claims. It arises out of a negotiated settlement between the Central Land Council, acting on behalf of the traditional land owners, and the Northern Territory government and pastoralists. The Warumungu land claim has been described by the Central Land Council as one of the longest and most bitterly fought land claims in the history of the Land Rights Act. It was first lodged in November 1978 to an area east of Tennant Creek, but it did not come before the Aboriginal Land Commissioner until 1985 due to a number of legal attempts to block it. The then Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Mr Justice Maurice, recommended in 1988 a grant of fee simple to most of the area covered by the land claim. A significant part of this land has been returned to its traditional Aboriginal owners since then.
Part of the recommendation included land that contained a stock route and a travelling stock reserve used by the adjoining pastoral interests. Negotiations continued over this part of the recommendation until a land swap was agreed upon. In return for giving up their claim to the stock route, the traditional owners received land of better configuration for their needs. It is the land subject to this land swap that will be scheduled under the act in this bill, along with the Frewena land claim, which lies adjacent to the south. As a result of these negotiations, only one part of the original Warumungu claim has yet to be dealt with—that part involving the Brunchilly pastoral lease. If and when this is resolved, the Warumungu land claim will finally have been settled 20 years after its initiation. 
It is interesting to note that, when Mr Justice Maurice delivered his report, as required by the act, to the minister in July 1988 he included a short history of the Warumungu. He described the Warumungu in 1901 as a flourishing nation. He went on to make the comment that, after a matter of years, they were a group of people that had been completely dispossessed. In his report, he went on to say:
Astonishingly, perhaps, much of the Warumungu identity remains, and even today the sense of belonging to the land is a powerful influence in the lives of these people of the Barkly Region.
The Warumungu were, and still are, the custodians of a specific area of land with an organised form of government—a `flourishing nation' in the words of the Land Commissioner who conducted a lengthy and thorough investigation into the claim. They are words which in simple language unequivocally designate the Warumungu as custodians of their traditional lands; words that many people in Australia, including the Prime Minister, do not seem willing to acknowledge. Stories such as that of the Warumungu clearly illustrate the longevity of indigenous history and culture, the pride of indigenous people in their land and their resilient spirit.
The story of the Warumungu also illustrates the ongoing success of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Several of the claims that have been scheduled under the act have resulted from negotiation. This has often been a difficult and protracted process, as in the case of the Warumungu claim, yet it is negotiation that has ended in results—results which, at the end of the day, as we have seen in this legislation, indigenous Australians, pastoralists, miners and even the Northern Territory government have been able to live with. The Northern Territory land rights act is the most successful legislation involving indigenous Australians in terms of these results. Once this bill has received royal assent, I understand that 64 parcels of land will be returned to their Aboriginal traditional owners. This land has provided and will continue to provide its traditional owners with a sense of connection, a sense of pride and a place where they can enrich and celebrate their culture in traditional ways. The involvement and support of indigenous Australians is the primary reason for the success of this legislation.
This government is intent on destroying the very foundation that has enabled this success to occur. I understand that this federal government is on a mission to destroy the very fabric of the land rights act and to amend it in a way which is opposed by traditional landowners in the Northern Territory. You can be assured that the Australian Labor Party will also oppose this action. I remind the Senate of the first recommendation in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs report Unlocking the future. This central and core recommendation—indeed, the recommendation which qualifies every other recommendation in that document—reads:
The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 ... not be amended without:
traditional Aboriginal owners in the Northern Territory first understanding the nature and purpose of any amendments and as a group giving their consent; and
any Aboriginal communities or groups that may be affected having been consulted and given adequate opportunity to express their views.
Unless the federal government meets this objective and unless we can see very transparently that in any attempt to amend the land rights act it has first had the informed consent of these people, then we will oppose it. And I expect that my colleagues on the government side of the house who were part of this committee's report will take the same position. After all, the committee reported unanimously with members from all sides, including the government side, supporting the recommendation. 
The government has a number of proposals which I understand are the subject of a cabinet submission at this point in time. I want to take this opportunity to raise what I understand are the subject of this document. These proposals deal with, among other things, amendments to the objects of the Northern Territory land rights act. There has been no attempt thus far to negotiate with Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory or to inform them about these issues. There has been no attempt to sit down with the traditional owners in the Northern Territory and inform them. No-one from this government, as I understand it, has gone to any of the four land councils in the Territory—the Northern, Central, Tiwi or Anindilyakwa Land Councils—with a set of proposals and said to them, `We would like to discuss these with your membership.' The collective membership of these four land councils covers every Aboriginal person throughout the Northern Territory. These proposals have, as I understand it, been put to ATSIC but they have not been discussed with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory. It is a bit like Kemp's secret cabinet document in relation to higher education last year which nobody knew about until it was well and truly aired in public.
As well as the proposal to amend the objects, I understand there is a proposal to break up the major land councils in a way this government says is in some part in accordance with the recognition of this report. It proposes to form an assessment process for the formation of new land councils. As well there is to be a plebiscite conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission requiring a majority of 55 per cent of the formal vote. This is the informed consent of an absolute majority; it is not the informed consent of traditional owners. Let me take this chamber to recommendation 7 of the House of Representatives Standing Committee's report, which says:
Section 21(3) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 ... be amended to: 
.    define `substantial majority' as at least 60% of those Aboriginal people living in the area; and 
.    require the Minister to be satisfied that the appropriate traditional Aboriginal owners have given their informed consent to the setting up of a new land council in accordance with section 77A of the Act.
The current proposal being put forward by this federal government—being discussed by the cabinet, I understand—to have informed consent of those traditional owners says 55 per cent. How does 55 per cent equate to the substantial majority under anyone's definition? I put to the Senate that this is a very cute trick by the government on this issue.
I understand there is also a proposal to deal with the issue of sacred sites. The proposal is to exclude, in large part, the land councils from their current roles under section 69 of the land rights act, which gives them a role in relation to sacred sites. The government needs to understand that this will be a particularly contentious issue among Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. The government again should go back to recommendation No. 1 in the House of Representatives report—informed consent—before seeking to impose these laws upon the Aboriginal community of the Northern Territory in relation to amending the land rights act. The government would be well served to look at the two reports produced by Royal Commissioner Justice Woodward and the subsequent review reports done by Justice Toohey in relation to the land rights act to see exactly what was said about these issues.
I understand there is another proposal being put forward by the government about the application of Northern Territory laws. They are proposing to amend the act to provide that certain Northern Territory laws, such as those related to environmental protection and conservation, public health and safety, the supply of essential services, and maintenance of law and order or the administration of justice—and there are others—shall apply to Aboriginal land. The House of Representatives committee looked at this issue and could find no evidence that there was any difficulty with the application of Territory laws in relation to Aboriginal land. The committee recommended that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs consider whether the powers need to be extended, but then go through a process of consultation, discussion and negotiation. In fact, on page 136 under `Core Principles' of the committee's recommendations, paragraph 8.40 says: 
As stated in the previous chapter, the Committee believes that negotiation and consultation are the best methods of achieving mutually satisfactory outcomes and a productive partnership between Aboriginal people, non Aboriginal people and the Northern Territory Government.
This does not propose that at all. There is also a proposition for compulsory acquisition of Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. There is no case for the compulsory acquisition of Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. Again, this issue was looked at seriously by the House of Representatives committee and they unanimously came down with the view that there was no case for this proposal, yet it is a proposal which is being picked up by the current minister for Aboriginal affairs and, presumably, by the cabinet. They are putting this proposal forward knowing full well that there has been a process, the Reeves report, and then the House of Representatives standing committee came down with a unanimous report rejecting this proposal.
I have very serious concerns about what is behind these ideas. There are proposals in the government's submission to deal with the Aboriginal benefits trust account and to deal with mining provisions of the act. I am sure there has been no attempt to have any process of discussion or negotiation with those people who are affected by these issues. There are a range of other issues which the government's proposals address. The bottom line is that, unless these proposals have the support of Aboriginal people, unless they have their informed consent, they will be opposed by the Labor Party.
We have heard a great deal recently from the Prime Minister about the need for reconciliation. I say to the Prime Minister, this parliament and the Senate that, if they believe reconciliation is going to be achieved by seeking to divide the community against Aboriginal Australians, if it is going to be poll driven or if it is going to be enhanced by secret cabinet documents that seek to discard the recommendations of a House of Representatives report based on the Reeves review, then they are wrong.
Shane Stone, the previous Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and now the President of the Australian Liberal Party, saw this as a real attempt by the government to ensure that there is divisive political debate over the issue of land rights in the Northern Territory and in Australia generally. I believe this government will try to capitalise politically on this issue over time as we lead up to the next federal election. That is their intent. If they believe we are gong to be cowered by these sorts of attempts to intimidate the Australian community and vilify Aboriginal Australians, then they are sadly mistaken.
There will be a great deal of discussion about these issues in the weeks to come, I have no doubt. Among these issues there will be attempts to attack the way in which the Northern Territory land councils work. Let me say that these organisations are not beyond reproach, these organisations are not beyond improvement and they must be accountable. Again, these are questions which were examined in detail by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. They are questions on which the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs made specific comment.
The context of the way in which this government is dealing with Aboriginal issues and indigenous issues generally must be put on notice. The way the federal government is dealing with these issues is not good enough. We have had the sorry sight of this parliament gagging the Leader of the Opposition for seeking to take up with the Prime Minister the issue of reconciliation and his lack of leadership on this issue. We have seen the Prime Minister gag his own party on the issue of mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory this week. We are seeing another example of a lack of leadership by this government over these attempts that we will see no doubt in the form of draft legislation very shortly to amend the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. 
What this government is about is eroding rights. It is about taking away the rights of indigenous Australians. I want to say to this chamber and to the members opposite that, if this is the case, then they will have a fight on their hands. I do not believe any proposals that they put in accordance with this will get through the parliament. 
But let me say in finishing that I commend the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 3) to the Senate for endorsement. It is a fine example of the success of the current land rights act in the Northern Territory, an act which should stay as it is. If there is an intent to change or amend this act, then it must be done as the report recommends--with consent, but with informed consent, of the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1

"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,2000-03-16,"—As Senator Bolkus, I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my remarks! 
Leave granted.
Senator Bolkus's speech read as follows--
The passage of this legislation through both Houses of Parliament has not been smooth.
The Bill was introduced towards the end of the sitting period of last year.  At the last moment, Government attempted to rush this Bill, which amounts to a grab bag of a number of unrelated amendments through the Parliament.
This was not and could not be supported.  The Parliament has a real and important role to fulfil with respect to legislation - it must be given time to scrutinise every Bill before it is passed.
While there was no dispute over the importance of doing all that we can to ensure that the Sydney Olympics are drug free, this was not a good enough reason to expedite the passage of this Bill through the Parliament without appropriate scrutiny.  The Opposition repeatedly voiced its support for the principle that international sporting events should be drug free.  However, the Opposition was not willing to abrogate its responsibility to ensure that all legislation contains reasonable and responsible legislative responses to principles.
The Bill was therefore referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional committee for review.  This review was dominated solely by consideration of the need to prevent performance enhancing drugs from following into the country.   Unfortunately, there was no discussion about the appropriateness of the increase in penalties for the importation of non sports drugs; nor was there any general discussion about the appropriateness of bringing sports drugs into the criminal law regime. Many of the other provisions in the Bill were given no or only cursory scrutiny.
Following the report of the Senate Committee, the Opposition was determined that the provisions of the Bill which had the potential to impinge upon civil liberties were both looked at and addressed.  The particular concerns were brought to the attention of the Minister's office, which led to a number of ultimately constructive and productive meetings between the Minister's office and that of the Shadow Minister.
The Opposition and the Government were able to agree on a number of amendments to the Bill. 
The bulk of these amendments were supported by the Opposition through the House.  However, there was one point of disagreement between the Government and the Opposition in the House which has now been resolved, and which will result in the Government moving and the Opposition supporting an additional amendment today.
The Opposition has been particularly concerned about, and adamant in our opposition to, provisions of the Bill which increased the allowed Customs officers to open private mail unsupervised.
Currently, section 90S of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 allows an authorised officer to open an article in the presence of a customs officer if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the article contains anything on which customs duty or sales tax is payable, or which is being carried in contravention of a law of the Commonwealth relating to the importation or exportation of that thing. 
The Bill seeks to insert a new s90T into the Postal Act, so as to introduce a different regime for the opening of articles which are reasonably believed to contain or consist of drugs or other chemical compounds.  The Bill allows Customs officers to remove the article; to open and examine the article and the goods contained; and to either confiscate the article or to return it to the normal course of carriage, marked as opened; all in the absence of an authorised Australia Post official.
The Bill therefore allows for Customs officers to remove and open postal articles without any outside supervision whatsoever.  As the Postal Act currently reads, Customs officers may not open articles without the presence of an Australia Post officer.  While not an infallible regime, the current requirement that an Australia Post officer opens the mail in the presence of a Customs officer provides some overview of the actions of Customs officers.
Customs has argued that the amendments in the Bill are necessary to allow for controlled operations.  Customs has suggested that there may be some circumstances where an Australia Post officer is suspected of being involved in some way in the importation of drugs.  Customs claimed that it would increase the security and effectiveness of controlled operations if they were not forced to ask an Australia Post officer to open the mail.
Labor has taken a strong and responsible stance on this issue. The regime which was proposed in the Bill is not acceptable, as it would mean that a Customs officer would be free to open mail on their own inclination, without either seeking authority or being monitored.  Allowing individuals to open mail without any one else present is providing the potential for mail to be tampered with, for narcotics to be planted, or for merely mischievous opening of private mail.
In the House, the Shadow Minister for Justice argued against these provisions at length.  However, the Government could not see its way to amending the Bill in that place so as to protect the civil liberties of any one sending a private letter through the international post.  The Opposition moved amendments which would have allowed Customs officers to request that either an AFP or and Australia Post officer open the mail.  This was intended to address the concerns voiced by Customs about the need for controlled operations, while also preventing the situation where a single Customs officer could open the mail on their own initiative, without any supervision whatsoever.
Following debate in the House, Customs came to the Shadow Minister with amendments to the Bill, which would ensure that at no time would a Customs officer be able to open private mail without supervision.  The amendments alter the scheme proposed by the Bill to provide for the safeguards which the Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs argued so vehemently for.  The Government's amendments exclude all mail under 25 grams, which covers private letters, from the new regime.  They will also mandate that no mail article is to be opened by a lone Customs officer, and that any article must be opened by a superior of the officer who identified the article as suspect.
The Opposition is satisfied that the amendments which will be moved by the Government will address the concerns which we have raised.  It is gratifying to see that Customs and the Ministers office have taken note of the concerns raised by the Opposition, and have come to us with a suggestion aimed at addressing these concerns.  As such we will be supporting the amendment.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-03-16,"—I must say that when I looked into the provisions of this bill, I had some serious qualms about it, the reason being that the bill introduces some fairly intrusive provisions into what may be regarded as civil liberties. It increases the power of Customs and of its officers and it increases some penalties quite drastically. I draw attention to the fact that one set of penalties, for instance, increases from, I think, $5,000 to $250,000. I draw attention to the fact that certain new forms of equipment to identify whether people are carrying prohibited substances are introduced and greater powers are given to Customs.
However, having said that, this bill was looked at by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, on which Senator Greig from my party sits. He did not provide a minority report, but I noted that Senator Schacht did, which I thought was a very useful and helpful minority report. I am really standing here to record a general unease about this bill. I do hope that my unease is not justified at some future date when we find that the provisions of this bill end up being used to excess and in a way which is detrimental to good order and good conduct in the exercise of civil liberties and the proper enforcement of Customs legislation. 
Having expressed my views of general unease, I nevertheless indicate my party's position, which is that we will support the bill; and I indicate my party's position that we will support the proposed government amendments as put forward.
I wish to take the opportunity to briefly mention two specific aspects of the bill. The first is a substantial increase in the penalties for illegal importation and exportation that the bill introduces. I would like to lend my support to comments made by Senator Schacht. In his minority report he said:
While the principle of introducing tougher penalties for the importation of performance enhancing drugs is supported, it must be noted that these penalties form an element of a much broader criminal and civil regime. It is important that the legislative approach to the importation of illicit drugs is consistent and appropriate.
The minority report from Senator Schacht recommends that the appropriateness and effectiveness of the increased penalties be reviewed after the Olympic Games, and I am not aware of what the government's position is on that. Perhaps the minister will tell us in his closing remarks.
The Australian Democrats do support the call for a review in due course of penalties of this sort for their consistency, appropriateness and effectiveness, and we regard such a review as essentially encompassing state legislation as well. One of the unhappy features of our federation is that there are differing standards of civil liberties throughout Australia, and I have always held the belief that, as far as possible, Australians should experience similar laws as regards their rights and obligations in every state. We do not have a preconceived idea that the current or the proposed penalties are too high or too low but, as an example, the increase in the maximum penalty for importing 100 grams of cannabis, which is not very much, from $4,000 to $250,000 needs to be substantiated as a fair and reasonable penalty rather than an arbitrary figure.
The second issue to which I wish to turn briefly is the opening of international mail articles. I understand that, at present, articles may only be opened by Australia Post officers at the request of a Customs officer. In its original form, the bill abolished the need for articles to be opened by Australia Post officers and allowed for Customs officers to open and examine articles. That provision was of concern to us to the extent that the opening of articles by a single Customs officer could lead to a perception of an ability to plant illegal substances. That is not an inference that that is what Customs officers like to do, normally do or would do; nevertheless, you always have to take cognisance of the fact that you can have rogue elements in any organisation. In my absence, my staff met with the minister's office and the Australia Customs Service to discuss the issue, and the Australian Democrats were supportive of a Labor Party suggestion to require that articles be opened by either Australia Post officers or officers of the Australian Federal Police in the presence of a Customs officer. But we were advised by the government that, due to AFP resource constraints, that would simply not be a practical solution.
The government then negotiated with the Labor Party and arrived at the amended proposal, which involves identification of articles for inspection by one Customs officer and their opening by another more senior Customs officer in the presence of a third Customs officer. The proposed amendment in relation to opening mail articles is by no means perfect, but it is a great improvement. We would prefer that an independent third party conduct, or at least witness, the opening of mail, but we understand that there is the potential for that to compromise the integrity of Customs investigations, and there are also practical difficulties with implementing such a regime. 
I would like to conclude by repeating that we will support the bill and the government's amendments but also repeat that I think the increase in penalties, the new equipment aspects and the question of greater rights being given to Customs officers with respect to ordinary persons' rights and liberties will need future review and future attention, which I think is a legitimate request from us.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I was in my room and heard Senator Murray talking on this bill, and I thought I would come in and make some comments as well. I notice that the minister, Minister Ellison, understands what I am going to say here, that is, I think what Senator Murray said is right. There is always a matter of balance, and I want to hear from your fellow Western Australian on this when he gets up, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, because he is a man that understands these arguments, having listened to them over the years. As far as he is concerned, there is probably no point in me speaking; I do so for other people who might want to listen. 
What Senator Murray said is correct. There is always that balance between trying to see that wrongdoing is detected and properly punished once detected, and the ability of us all to walk free and even to do wrong to some extent. I might be the only person that has done a wrong thing during his life, but I rather doubt it. There is always a balance to be struck where you say, `Yes, things have got to be investigated, and we need this new equipment,' which is correct—you cannot set aside technology: for example, DNA tests—but there does come a point when the whole process becomes intrusive. What I mean by that is that the technology or methods used to go around investigating tend to demean a person and diminish that sense we have of being a person of some significance in the world—and that is how we all ought to feel because we all are that—that feeling of self-worth and that sense of being able to walk abroad in the streets and to meet your neighbour, as you will, to say hallo and all. That is diminished if people can intrude upon the person, and that is what this is all about. On the other hand, if you have got facts which you can establish as truth—and technology tends to be able to do that--or if there is a fact that can be established through an X-ray screen properly used, then that is a matter that should be used in the balance.
I was listening to Senator Murray; and I am not sure what the position is on the ability of Customs officers to open letters. I know that Australia Post is able to do that at the moment. Again, that is a great intrusion but an intrusion that the community has, up until now, accepted as reasonable for people in Australia Post to carry out in the interests of seeing society properly administered. But, as we investigate mail, as we investigate telephone calls and as we investigate all the electronic equipment, it shrinks the ability of us all to exchange communications as we would like to. You, Mr Acting Deputy President, should be able to go around Western Australia and talk, do things freely, express your opinion, have a joke and exchange pleasantries with others without there being an interference.
The other thing I want to say before I sit down is that you can tend to get onto a law and order binge almost. The witch-hunt syndrome comes along in many different forms, and this law and order binge, this witch-hunt syndrome, has to be watched so that we do not get to the point where law and order is so overwhelming that it starts to diminish us as persons. It is proper that, with the Olympic Games coming on, people should not be allowed to bring in drugs but, on the other hand, we should not be having people come into this country and treat them as regimes of the past may have treated people. To some extent, Australia is a long way away from being totalitarian but, now that the Cold War has gone, there is a tendency right around the world to use measures which may not have been used in Western countries during the Cold War because we wanted to distinguish ourselves from those totalitarian regimes. Now that those totalitarian regimes have gone, there is no longer that incentive to keep ourselves as distinct from them as we might otherwise have done, so we start to fall into the ways that they had. So, Mr Acting Deputy President, with those rather random remarks, I sit down.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-03-16,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I thank at the outset the opposition and the Democrats for their support of this bill and acknowledge the useful contributions from Senators Murray and Cooney and also note their longstanding interest in matters which touch on individual rights, perhaps particularly so when a state and the individual might come into conflict. I think that this is an important aspect to bear in mind, and the government does believe that this balance has been achieved.  
As to a review mentioned, I think, by Senator Murray, the Attorney has not determined as yet whether there should be a review at any particular time, but I do not see that as posing any problem. In any event, this very chamber has committees which from time to time review legislation such as this. I might even mention the Scrutiny of Bills Committee as one such excellent committee which stands as a watchdog at the portals of the Senate in relation to any legislation which might be wayward and trespassing unduly upon the rights of the individual. 
Having said that, though, I commend this bill to the Senate as a bill which is an effective means of deterring trafficking in drugs, illicit substances and particularly performance enhancing drugs, which of course are now more in the spotlight because of the forthcoming Olympics.
There are amendments the government will be moving in the committee stage. They came about as a result of debate in the other place and also, I think, as a result of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee making some recommendations--and a very good committee that is, too. So I will deal with those when we come to the committee stage, but suffice it to say this is a bill which does, I think, an excellent job in relation to law enforcement but also keeps the balance in relation to individual rights as opposed to the state.

"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-03-16,"—Yesterday, I was asked questions in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care. I have responses for Senator Collins, Senator Faulkner, Senator Evans and Senator Ludwig. I seek to leave to incorporate the responses in the Hansard.
Leave granted.
The documents read as follows—
AGED CARE
Senator COLLINS - My question is to Senator Herron, the Minister representing the
Minister for Aged Care. Is the Minister aware that last year the owners of the Templestowe Private Nursing Home in Victoria closed the facility owing tens of thousands of dollars to staff, including superannuation entitlements. Isn't it also the case that the government then allowed the same operators to take over another nursing home while their former employees continued to pursue them over their lost entitlements? Why did the Howard government reject last year Labor's amendment to protect aged care worker' entitlements in this type of situation? Isn't this another example of the government's ad hoc approach on the issue of protecting workers' entitlements? Would nursing home workers' rights be protected only if the Prime Minister's brother had an interest in nursing homes as well as textile companies.
SENATOR HERRON - The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
The owner of the Templestowe Private Nursing Home in Victoria sold the facility to another provider in May 1999. It did not close, as suggested by Senator Jacinta Collins, on 15 March 2000.
I have received a letter from the Australian Nurses Federation, setting out a detailed list of claims, which my Department has been investigating and will continue to investigate.
I note that the vendor of the nursing home disputes these claims.
AGED CARE: SENIOR EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE PAY
Senator FAULKNER - My question is to Senator Herron, the Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care. Can the Minister confirm that the Minister for Aged Care has severely criticised her department for failing to remedy the many defects that have been brought to light in the nursing home sector? What steps has the minister taken to restructure her department, given her view that the department has comprehensively failed to achieve the government's objectives in the nursing home sector? How many SES officers working in the aged care section of the department received performance pay in the financial year 1998-99? 
Senator FAULKNER - Madam President, I ask a specific supplementary question. Will the Minister for Aged Care be requesting the Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to take into account of her department's alleged failures in the nursing home area when evaluating the performance agreement for the Secretary of the department? If it transpires that the Secretary of the department receives his performance bonus, won't this indicate that the department is not in fact at fault, but it is Mrs Bishop who should get a pink slip?
SENATOR HERRON - The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question..
The Minister for Aged Care has made no decision to restructure the Department. The management of the Department and any performance payments for Senior Executive staff are a matter for the Secretary.
The distribution of performance pay is set out in the Department's Annual Report each year. For privacy reasons, the distribution is not disaggregated to each program area as this could reveal individual performance assessments.
Departmental Secretaries' annual performance assessment is a matter for the Prime Minister on the advice of the Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Public Service Commissioner, following consultation with the Portfolio Ministers.
AGED CARE: KENSINGTON PARK NURSING HOME
Senator CHRIS EVANS - My question is directed to Senator Herron in his capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care. Can the Minister confirm that the Perth nursing home involved in the allegation of maggots in a bandaged foot, as reported in the West Australian today, is the Kensington Park Nursing Home? Can the Minister advise whether there have been any spot checks carried out on this home since 1998? Can the Minister advise whether there have been any accreditation or review audit reports on Kensington Park in the last two years? If there have been reports, why are they not publicly available?
Senator CHRIS EVANS - Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister also investigate allegations that nurses have resigned from that particular nursing home because of their concerns over management's decision to roster only one qualified nurse on night shift to care for 60 residents? Would the Minister consider that this staff to patient ratio would be adequate to provide adequate patient care?
SENATOR HERRON - The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
The proprietor of Kensington Park released a media statement yesterday (Wednesday 15 March 2000) confirming that Kensington Park is the home in question.
There have been no spot checks on Kensington Park since 1998.
There have been no accreditation or review audits in the last two years, consequently no reports are available.
In his media statement, the proprietor has advised that overnight care provided at Kensington Park is in line with industry standards.
The Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency commenced a review audit today (Thursday 16 March 2000) - which will examine the adequacy of care provided at Kensington Park.
AGED CARE: SURPRISE INSPECTIONS
Senator LUDWIG - My question is to Senator Herron, the Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care. Can the Minister confirm that prior to 15 February this year, there had been no surprise inspections of nursing homes under the government's new system? Can the Minister inform the Senate how many surprise inspections have been carried out since 15 February?
Senator LUDWIG - Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I understand the minister's answer but, to be sure, can he take it on notice and get back to me about the two parts of the question in respect of the number of inspections?
SENATOR HERRON - The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-03-16,"——On 7 March, the Senate passed a resolution ordering that I table an ABARE document estimating the benefits and costs of restrictions on tree clearing in Queensland. The government has considered carefully the terms of the order of the Senate and has reached the conclusion that the document referred to in the Senate order is a working draft to assist the Commonwealth policy makers in determining the financial assistance the Commonwealth might be able to provide to the Queensland government and land-holders in Queensland in support of possible regulation of land clearing in Queensland. The Prime Minister and the Queensland Premier have agreed to establish a joint task force to pursue these issues further. As these negotiations could be prejudiced by the tabling of this document, in accordance with longstanding practice, the government has formed the view that it would not be in the public interest to table the document at this time. The document further contains information which could prejudice Australia's current international greenhouse negotiations. For this additional reason, it would not be in the public interest to table the document at this time.",SENATE,<title>TREE CLEARING IN QUEENSLAND</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-03-16,"—by leave—I will respond briefly to the statement by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. The opposition have been quite reasonable in respect of this return to order over the last week or so. We have allowed the minister a bit of extra time to consider whether he would table the document or not. We find his decision not to table it totally unacceptable; we find his reasons even more unacceptable. It is in the public interest to ensure that this document does surface and that parties, for instance, in negotiations between the Commonwealth and Queensland, have all the information at their fingertips.  
We are talking here about a document that was commissioned from ABARE. The project proposal document says that it is a document which proposes to meet the short-term information requirements of policy makers. The project has been designed to provide Environment Australia with a series of data and briefing outputs in order to assess the magnitude of the impacts of tighter controls over tree clearing in Queensland, to enable assessment of the relative importance of various factors and assumptions in estimating the opportunity cost of land clearing, and so on. The project proposal goes through a work plan, and that work plan makes it very clear that, in many instances, we are talking about bringing together information from ABARE's farm survey databases. It is in the public interest; it is in the interests of adequate scrutiny to ensure that this document is made available. 
The minister, by not making this document available today, once again lets down the public policy formulation process. It indicates his disdain for meaningful and honest relationships with, in this instance, the state of Queensland. It is not good enough for him to say, `It is my assessment that it is not in the public interest.' I think most Australians would assess that adequate, timely information in respect of land clearing in Queensland is in the public interest, particularly if it is drawn from publicly available databases and the like. His second argument in respect of greenhouse is one that he pulls out of the bottom of the bag again. You could argue that a whole range of areas might be connected to greenhouse in his portfolio. Once again, the minister seems to hide behind this particular defence. We will have to consider what further action we can take on this matter. I indicate that we will probably come back to the Senate when we resume.",SENATE,<title>TREE CLEARING IN QUEENSLAND</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-03-16,"—by leave—I will try not to take up too much time, but it is an important issue not only in terms of this specific ABARE report into land clearing—land clearing itself being a crucial issue—but also in terms of governments wilfully defying orders of a house of parliament to produce a document. We have had a case just in the last day of the PM ignoring the parliamentary process and basically refusing to allow a bill that the parliament has produced and processed to even be debated in the House of Representatives, and I commend an excellent editorial in today's Courier-Mail for senators to have a look at on that issue. It comes back to quite a fundamental component of our democratic system, which is the responsibility and role of the parliament as against that of the government, and the separation between those two bodies. 
We have here, as we have had many times over the years, a return to order, which is a directive of a house of the parliament, for a document or something to be produced—a document in this case. Unfortunately, in this statement of the minister we have what is becoming an all too frequent occurrence of a refusal of the government of the day to comply with that order of the parliament. Whilst there have been occasions in the past where governments have given good reasons—reasons that the parliament has accepted—for a return to order not being complied with, I would have to say that, on first hearing the reasons the minister gave just now, they seem to be completely inadequate. 
I am pleased that towards the end of last year the Senate finally moved towards taking some form of punitive action for failures of the government to respond to legitimate requests for the production of documents in relation to Minister Newman. I think that was a good start on the part of the Senate, because it is important for the parliament to assert its powers and duties for proper scrutiny in the public policy formulation process and in the process of public debate on important issues. Certainly, between now and when the Senate resumes, the Democrats will be looking closely at this issue and, as Senator Bolkus indicated, considering what further action may be appropriate. But, on the surface, it seems that the reasons the minister has given are completely inadequate. To simply suggest that it is not in the public interest in his analysis is obviously inadequate: it may not be in the government's interests, but that is very different from the public's interest or the parliament's interest. Certainly, that is not a decision the minister should have the total say over.  
Similarly, in relation to our greenhouse negotiations: I fail to see on examination of the minister's initial statement how it can be good to hide information about Australia's performance on greenhouse related issues, unless we are trying to set up some sort of deceptive process as part of those negotiations, which is completely the wrong way for Australia to go on an issue of widely acknowledged environmental and global importance. The land clearing issue is a significant part of the greenhouse issue. It is widely acknowledged as a very significant, if not the most significant, environmental issue in Australia today. It is one of those exasperating issues where all sides of politics recognise that it is a serious environmental issue, yet somehow or other we are unable to get action on it. I fear this is another example of the failure of the political process to deliver action in that regard. I want to emphasise the Democrats' disappointment on first examination of the minister's statement about his failure to comply with the Senate's order. I indicate that the Democrats consider it a serious matter when governments refuse to comply with returns to order of the Senate. Certainly, we will be giving serious consideration to how we should progress this matter further.",SENATE,<title>TREE CLEARING IN QUEENSLAND</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), to a question without notice asked by Senator Murphy today, relating to the goods and services tax and petrol prices.
In noting—I suppose you could call it—an answer from Senator Kemp to a question I put to him today in question time, I would say it now is quite apparent that the Australian motorist will confront yet another broken promise on the part of this government with regard to the introduction of the GST. This is the government led by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, who on the one hand said a little while back that he would `never ever' introduce a GST. But in connection with his now proceeding to do that, he also told the Australian public, along with a whole raft of other things, that petrol prices would not rise as a result of the introduction of the GST. Indeed, in August 1998 he said:
The ordinary motorist will not pay any more for petrol but of course they will not get that reduction. They will not pay any more though, it won't go up, the price at the pump will be the same.
Just one month later, the great Treasurer of our nation said—
—You're going a bit far there.
—I probably am in respect of `the great Treasurer'. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, said that no petrol price would rise as a result of the GST anywhere. Of course, we know that it is now universally accepted that the CPI will rise by at least 5½ per cent with the introduction of the GST. There is nobody, except probably Senator Kemp, who would not accept that.
On 14 March this year the Automobile Association, through its Executive Director, Mr McIntosh, said that, that being the case, motorists could expect the GST to add at least 2c per litre to the price of petrol. We all know how much petrol has gone up recently, and there are some reasons for that. But this does not take away from the fact that this government, in the course of the election in 1998, said clearly that the price of petrol would not increase as a result of the introduction of a GST. Mr McIntosh also points that out when he says:
The Prime Minister has given an undertaking that petrol prices will not increase as a result of the GST and we welcome that, however the Government has not indicated just how it will meet this commitment.
I asked the Assistant Treasurer—which is what he is supposed to be—the minister responsible for the implementation of the GST, what the government's estimate was. His response was, `We stick to our policy commitment; petrol prices need not rise.' But I am not quite sure whether the Assistant Treasurer is saying that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are telling pork pies when they say it will not rise. On 14 January this year, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Hockey, said that petrol prices would actually fall; they would go down, not up—not stay level, but that they would actually go down. The Prime Minister, in February of this year, on radio 2UE, said, `The imposition of the GST is not going to produce an increase in the price of petrol.' 
So one has to ask, as I did: what is the government going to do about it, what is its estimate and how is it going to meet its commitment? That, I guess, is in the minds of all of the motorists of this country because, as we know, the price of petrol is over a dollar in a lot of areas already and the introduction of the GST could have a significant impact on them. We have been told that the government is looking at this and it will make some announcement closer to the time. But the reality is that it promised the people when they voted at the last election that this would not happen. It is again just another example of the government breaking its promises to the people—or, indeed, it is that the promises that were made in the first place were not the truth.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2000-03-16,"—It is interesting that Senator Kemp for a fortnight now has been challenging anyone in the opposition to stand up here—and particularly in question time or on debates taking note of tax answers—and say, `We are not going to keep the goods and services tax.' Senator Kemp repeatedly makes the claim, especially in question time, that it is now no longer the coalition's tax policy but a policy that has been adopted by the Labor opposition.
Senator Hutchins is a very honourable man and I think he might be speaking in this debate. I look forward to maybe Senator Hutchins or Senator Carr actually telling the chamber whether they are going to keep the GST or whether there will just be this roll-back. Senator Murphy has talked about fuel. This has come from a senator of a party that was in government for 13 years that consistently increased the price of fuel and increased taxes. Taxes, taxes, taxes—they just went up. But there was no compensation, and Senator Murphy did not do anything about it.
In the 1993-94 budget, Mr Beazley subjected all Australians to $13.4 billion in new taxes. The wholesale sales tax went up. Petrol taxes went up. The tobacco excise went up. In the 1994-95 budget there were further increases in taxes. In the 1995-96 budget there were further increases in taxes. The opposition do not want to talk about that. They now want to talk about the goods and services tax which they support—and they must support it because they do not deny Senator Kemp's assertions every day that they support it. They will not tell us what it is they are going to roll back. They have told us that they are going to scrap the tax cuts. We at least know that bit. They are going to keep the goods and services tax, but people will not have the tax cuts and nor will the pensioners or the welfare recipients have the increases in benefits. 
They will not tell us what is going to be rolled back. Senator Murphy is leaving the chamber. He did not tell us in his contribution whether they would roll the tax back on fuel and replace it with another tax or just have no tax. We do not know that. It would have been nice for Senator Murphy to actually say what the Labor Party thinks. Senator Sherry very honestly said on 13 May last year, `I am certainly not privy to advanced copies of any tax policy. It does not exist at the present time.' There is only six weeks to go and it will be 12 months since he said that. Here we are and the Labor Party still does not have a tax policy. 
When the Labor Party were rabbiting on about various elements of the goods and services tax the other day I put down the challenge to them, as Senator Kemp has done every single solitary day: what is it that you are going to roll back? This week they have raised beer, motor vehicles, clothing, food, insurance, deposits, charities, local government, petrol, trucks, sanitary products, local shows and solar suits. Not one single solitary item that they have grizzled about having the goods and services tax attached to it have they actually committed themselves to rolling back.  
Why say this is all bad news and not at the same time say, `We will give the people of Australia a commitment to roll this back.' They know that they cannot give such a commitment because they know that not even the Labor premiers will support Mr Beazley in what he is trying to do in rolling it back. They reckon that will make it far more complicated. Mr Beazley and the Labor Party do support the goods and services tax because Mr Beazley has said that the simple fact of the matter is that business will have spent billions on putting in place systems to conform with it. The states will have had all their own arrangements readjusted and some changes in the taxation arrangements associated with that. It is just amazing. They have to confess.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I welcome this opportunity to follow Senator Knowles in taking note of Senator Kemp's answer to Senator Murphy's question in relation to petrol prices. The issue of petrol prices arose when, as Senator Murphy said, Mr Lachlan McIntosh of the Australian Automobile Association issued a press release earlier this week in which he said: 
We're also concerned about the inflationary effect of the GST. The current higher fuel prices we're experiencing will increase inflation, which impacts on the indexation of excise. It's now expected the CPI will rise by at least 5.5% in the first year of the GST. That sort of rise will push petrol prices up by at least 2 cents a litre, as a direct result of the introduction of the GST.
I hope I am not slandering Mr McIntosh, but I think that in a previous life Mr McIntosh was the head of the Australian Shippers Council. I do not think that Mr McIntosh would be regarded as a friend of Labor—and maybe I am wrong here too. For someone who may be involved or supporting the conservative side of politics to put out a press release like this is something that should start to ring alarm bells in the coalition. If I were a member of the coalition, I would start to cringe now. When the motorists start to queue up and pay well over a dollar a litre for their fuel then they are going to look around for someone to blame. The prices are really going to increase in country Australia. This is where the real prices are going to increase. 
You would think that those people had done something wrong. A number of seats in country Australia are still held by the coalition and in my state of New South Wales. The people voted for them. I am a bit concerned where we are going to in this regard. Once people start to queue up and pay $50 to $55 to fill their cars they are going to look around for someone to blame. If I were a member of the coalition, particularly in the lower house, I would be starting to cringe now. They must be wondering what they have done wrong. As we know and has been highlighted by the Labor Party all this week, the services available to country people are being reduced. The job opportunities available to them are going to be reduced over the next few years by the actions of this government. Once again, I come back to that rhetorical question: what have they done wrong to be punished like this? The only way they are going to alleviate this punishment is to ensure that they get even with them at the next federal election and kick them out. 
I also want to highlight one other aspect of this increase in fuel prices. I have a copy of a magazine entitled Owner Driver which deals with a number of areas relating to the road transport industry. As has been highlighted, fuel prices have increased 15 per cent in the last 12 months. As one lorry owner driver said, every time fuel goes up a cent a litre it costs him another $23 a week. These men and women who are carrying the country are already having difficulties in trying to recover costs from retailers and manufacturers. At the same time as their prices are going up, retailers and manufacturers are pressuring them to put them down. That is going to lead to other consequences which we will see down the track. What I am worried about is that when the changes occur on 1 July there will be pressure on the transport companies to reduce their costs but no pressure on the retailers or manufacturers to reduce their costs. As you would know, Madam Deputy President, the community suspects that prices have already increased to cover cost rises that will occur as a result of the introduction of the GST. 
So when people get an opportunity to get a hold of this government, they will remember the non-answers we have been given by Senator Kemp. They will remember, particularly country Australia, that they have been punished because they live in the country. When we have the opportunity for an election, I hope they do not forget that, because I can tell you that we in the Labor Party will not let the community forget exactly what the coalition has done to them.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol</title>,Questions Without Notice,24,1
"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2000-03-16,"—As a member of the coalition, I would like to assure Senator Murphy that we are not afraid of any scaremongering technique that the Labor Party and the media might wage on the GST, particularly on petrol prices, because we have faith that the Australian motorists are thinking people and that they understand that, if they are paying more for petrol, it is not because of the GST. Senator Murphy is a champion fly fisherman. We all know that. That has been reported many times. A champion at catching fish he may be, but he cannot count, because anybody with any sense would know that the price of petrol at the pump comprises a number of components. Anyone would know that petrol to be supplied at the pump will comprise, firstly, the cost of the materials and then the cost of production. Then it comprises cost of delivery, which also includes things like taxes and excise. Finally, there is a component of profits.
Of all these components in the cost of delivery, only a small part of it—which is the excise and taxes collected by the government—is under the control of the government. The bulk of the cost of the raw material is not under the control of the government. Everybody knows that. The Australian public knows that, but it seems that Labor Party members do not know that. They keep trying to blame the petrol price increases on the GST. 
The important thing about our GST argument is that it is no longer simply a coalition policy. The Labor Party could not wait to sign on to it. It is true that every time Senator Kemp points that out to the Labor Party senators in this chamber, Senator Cook, among other people, shouts out loudly, `No, it's not true.' Yet he has never been able to get up and say exactly what the Labor Party's policy on the GST is. The reality is that the Labor Party have promised that, if they take government, they will certainly keep the GST, but as long as they are in opposition, they will keep complaining about the GST. Isn't that true, Senator Conroy? If you become government, you will take the GST.
—Address the Chair, please, Senator Tchen. 
—Senator Conroy, you have been here long enough to know that interjections are disorderly. You should not be encouraging them or answering statements that are not made through the Chair. 
—The point is that, as recently as 12 January, one of the opposition frontbenchers, Mr McMullan, said on Adelaide radio 3AA in answer to a question about the GST, `Well, the GST overall should be good for exports.' Even Senator Cook, on 26 March last year, said to the Minerals Council of Australia that he suspected there is a quantifiable advantage to the mining industry from the new tax package.
There is no question that the GST has been adopted by the Labor Party, whether they admit it or not. But what comes with the GST under a Labor government is the question of what sort of roll-back they would have and whether they would guarantee that they would keep the income tax cuts which we are bringing in and which will come in at the same time as the GST implementation. That tax cut will put $47 a week into the pockets of ordinary Australians.
—And take out $100. 
—Madam Deputy President, through you: Senator Hutchins said we will take out $100. I am not sure what his expenditure is like that he will expect to lose an additional $100 a week. Maybe he has far more income than other senators, maybe in the range of Mr Richard Pratt.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I am not touching that one with a barge pole. Senator Tchen is relatively new to the chamber, so I am going to take some licence here. He is new to the chamber so he was not involved in the hypocrisy and deceit that this government took to the last election.  
Senator Tchen asked, `What is the Labor Party's policy on tax?' Let me give you a history lesson, Senator Tchen. What we have seen in the last two years was this government deceiving the Australian people for month after month after month. This government refused to tell the Australian people what was in its tax policy. This government hid its tax policy, consulted with its mates for six months and kept it secret. Then after six months of secret consultation with its business mates and all its spivs that wanted the GST in, what happened? The government announced the policy, announced a $20 million fraudulent propaganda campaign that was probably illegal, and called the election three weeks later. So this party that Senator Tchen represents announced its tax policy three weeks before the election was called. Don't come into this chamber and say, `Where's your tax policy?' when we are nearly 18 months from the election. What utter hypocrisy and humbug. Three weeks before the government called the election, it revealed its policy.
There is a real credibility gap when it comes to your tax policy and the timing of elections. But I am rising to, once again, draw attention to the utter incompetence and incapacity of Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, to answer the simplest of questions on the impact of the GST. He was asked a question about petrol prices going up under the GST. This government tried to hide it before the election. It deceived the Australian public before the election. We had the big promises: the GST will not widen the city-country petrol price gap. A few weeks ago in estimates, the ACCC admitted that it cannot do anything but widen the gap, so what we saw was Senator Kemp quickly whispering to a few journos, `We've got a rebate scheme coming, and it'll be out soon.' We were told at the beginning of last week that it would be out last week. Where is it at? It is the end of two parliamentary sitting weeks. We were promised it last week. Where is this fuel rebate for country petrol prices? Where is it, Senator Tchen? Where is it, Senator Watson?
It has taken them nine months to design the diesel fuel rebate. They have not worked out a conurbation there. It must be a nightmare trying to work out which country petrol stations will get the rebate. This must be an absolute motser. There have been a few other people with ideas about drawing lines on maps recently. Maybe they have given you some advice and you have worked out you cannot do it. It is going to be a joke, and you know it. That is why you have not brought it into this chamber yet.
—Order! Address the Chair, please, Senator Conroy.
—We have the other big promise: petrol prices need not rise— once again demonstrating a complete lack of understanding of how the petrol taxation system works. Petrol taxation works on an excise and then the GST. So, if the excise goes up, the GST is on top of that. So, when the CPI—the index the excise is linked to—goes up by 2c, because the inflation rate that this government have fibbed to the Australian people about is higher than they originally told them, the GST impact is greater. So what happens is that the GST leads to a spiralling tax, and it is a tax on a tax.
We heard a lot about taxes on taxes from this government and how they were bad and evil and had to be done away with; and the first thing they did was deceive the Australian public, particularly regional and rural voters, about the impact of the GST. It mathematically cannot do anything but put this tax up. This rebate scheme is their way to try to fix it. They are going to throw more money at the problem. It is going to be a total, utter and complete farce. Senator Ellison, you were not listening when I started. For your information, you lot called an election three weeks after you announced your tax policy. So do not come in here and tell us to reveal ours now. (Time expired)

The statement read as follows—
I am pleased to table this report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services, entitled Roundtable on Choice of Superannuation Funds, together with the submissions received and the Official Committee Hansard of the roundtable forum which the Committee held in Sydney in December last year.
This report summarises the evidence received on the main issues involved when considering a greater availability of superannuation fund choice.  In so doing, it represents the Committee's first step in addressing its major terms of reference, namely to inquire into matters pertaining to superannuation and financial services, with particular reference to prudential supervision and consumer protection for superannuation, banking and financial services.  
The evidence received reflects the views of twenty organisations - including representatives from government, the superannuation industry, service providers to industry, consumer advocates, employer and employee bodies and the major consulting groups.
These people made themselves available at short notice to assist the Committee to identify the best features that might be considered in any future choice of funds regime.  These include:
the options for the form of choice;
preconditions and other measures which would need to be in place prior to the introduction of the choice option;
other implementation issues associated with the introduction of the choice option, including the arrangements for default funds, insurance, asset allocation and frequency of payments of employee contributions;
prudential supervision and consumer protection issues; 
investment choice; and
the timing of the introduction of the choice option.
Many of these issues were addressed during the previous Committee's inquiry into Choice of Fund in 1998.  The 1999 roundtable provided an important forum for revisiting the issues, and for exploring the possibilities associated with emerging technologies, such as e-commerce.
The Government's proposals for choice of fund have been before Parliament since December 1997.  Although the legislation has been subject to some revision, debate on the bill in the Senate was adjourned in February last year and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 1998 remains on the Table for consideration.
In the two years that have elapsed since the draft legislation was first formulated, choice has become a reality for some groups in some states although figures were not available to the Committee.  Most industry representatives suggest there is now a need for a stronger regulatory framework.
From the roundtable discussion and submissions made to the Committee, it was evident that there was not a unanimous position.  Views fell into three broad categories; those who support fund member choice with few reservations; those who believe fund member choice will not be in the interests of fund members; and those who believe fund member choice can be made workable subject to a range of conditions being met. 
In an atmosphere of spirited discussion, all groups indicated their support for adequate protective measures, including a standardised approach for disclosure of fund details and an extensive education campaign.  There was also debate on mechanisms to address the respective rights of both employers and employees.
I'll now outline the views expressed on the major issues addressed at the roundtable.
On options for the form of choice, we recognised that some participants were opposed to the concept of choice.  However, there was a body of opinion that, should it be introduced, the option favoured by the majority was for unlimited choice.  Support was also expressed for the award fund as an alternative.
Most witnesses agreed, that for consumers to be able to make informed choices, there was a need for an appropriate and standardised disclosure regime and an extensive awareness and education campaign.  There was also agreement that the disclosure regime should come well before the commencement date for choice.  However, different views were expressed on the timing of the education campaign.
Witnesses generally agreed that e-commerce had the potential to reduce administration costs for some fund members and some employers, particularly if standard protocols were in place. While some witnesses queried Australia's readiness for e-commerce, and pointed to the difficulties likely to be experienced by small business, others pointed to the significant cost and other advantages which were likely to be derived.
A number of other implementation issues were raised by participants.  Witnesses generally supported maintaining the existing practice of the default fund being the relevant award fund where there is award coverage; and where there was no award coverage, the favoured option was that the majority fund in the workplace be the default fund.
The arrangements to ensure continuity of insurance cover, the need to address the problems of cross-subsidies and the questions of the cost and level of insurance cover, were also emphasised by witnesses.  A number of witnesses also recommended that asset allocation be a minimum standard for default funds.
Almost all witnesses favoured monthly, or at least quarterly contributions by employers to employee superannuation funds, instead of the current annual contribution.  Some witnesses pointed out that there were advantages, particularly for small business, to contribute quarterly to be more consistent with taxation requirements.
Prudential supervision and consumer protection issues were extensively canvassed. Evidence to the Committee was strongly in favour of appropriate prudential supervision and consumer protection measures, in addition to those provided by full disclosure and adequate education, to address the issues of commission based selling, and other related practices.  There was also general agreement on the need for an effective dispute resolution mechanism, with a number of suggestions being made to address the capability of the current mechanisms.
On the important issue of investment choice, witnesses drew attention to the increasing number of options for investment choice, but pointed out that the take-up rates varied among funds offering investment choice.  The main factor for this appears to be a lack of awareness and education in relation to the range of investment available; other factors include the possible costs involved in switching between investments and, of course, account balance.
While there were many different points of view expressed on the timing of the introduction of a choice regime, there was general agreement that:
implementation be a staged process; 
the first stage be no earlier than 1 July 2001;
whatever date is chosen be dependent not only on the finalisation of the legislation and prudential supervision regulations, but also on an appropriate and standardised disclosure regime and the conduct of an appropriate education program; 
the start-up date be 12 months after the finalisation of the above (including the CLERP 6 reforms) as well as other measures being in place such as standard protocols for e-commerce); and
there was a probable need to defer the extension of choice to defined benefits funds because of the difficulties which would be involved in identifying what should be transferred and when.
The Committee has not drawn any conclusions from the evidence, nor made any recommendations, but presents this report in order to progress public debate on the complex issue of choice of superannuation fund.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank those who made submissions and presented their views at the roundtable.  
The lessons learnt from the experience in Western Australia and other states have also been extremely beneficial in considering the requirements associated with choice from a federal perspective. 
I would also like to thank the other members of the Committee for the cooperative approach which they brought to the inquiry and to acknowledge the work of the secretariat which has enabled the report to be tabled in such a timely manner.
I commend the report to the Senate.

Debate (on motion by Senator Carr) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,27,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I will go to the Notice Paper first in my remarks this evening in respect of this treaty. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which we heard so much about earlier today in another debate, has the review of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, which was referred to it on 8 December 1999. We now have as a government order of the day the introduction of the multilateral treaty with its national interest analysis on the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. I am on the treaties committee but, as yet, we have not finalised our report. So I will preface these remarks with the added remark that, at some later stage, I will seek to speak to this important multilateral treaty. Once the treaties committee has dealt with it, I will deal with it again in that forum.
If we look at the background to the treaty that has been proposed, in 1995 the estimate of global desertification indicated that 69 per cent, or some 3.5 billion hectares, of the world's dryland used for agriculture was degraded to some extent. Another study estimated that 3.3 billion hectares of rangeland—that is, something in the order of 73 per cent—showed moderate degradation or worse, along with some 457.7 million hectares or 47 per cent of rain fed dryland crop land and 14.5 million hectares or 30 per cent of irrigated drylands. That gives you some idea of the breadth and width of the problem and of the global extent and the severity of the desertification issue that I am speaking about this evening.
North America, I am told, has the highest percentage area of degraded drylands, followed by Africa, South America, Asia and Europe, and Australia is also mentioned. According to these figures, Australia's area of degraded drylands is something in the order of 357.9 million hectares, which exceeds that of South America and Europe. These figures might be thrown into some dispute but, when you hear figures of that magnitude, it is likely that there is some basis to surmise that there is a problem of land degradation in Australia. The width and breadth of it might be argued about, but the problem certainly exists.
The UN desertification convention has a slightly chequered history. It was brought into this chamber on 30 June 1994. Australia signed the convention at the signing ceremony in Paris on 14 and 15 October 1994. On 30 June 1994, Senator Chapman gave notice of a motion to refer the issue of Australia signing the desertification convention to the Senate Standing Committee on Regional and Rural Affairs. This motion was debated in the Senate on 1 September 1994, and the coalition government established a committee of inquiry on the desertification convention's call for public submissions. Senator Coulter gave notice of a motion to refer different aspects of the desertification convention to the Senate Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. This motion was debated and defeated in the Senate on 22 September 1984. We have it again. Despite earlier comments about other types of conventions, it has been an important convention, and it has re-emerged. The rationale of the convention is to encourage countries to develop strategies for dealing with and preventing desertification. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. 
Leave granted; debate adjourned. ",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification</title>,Documents,29,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-03-16,"—I participated in the inquiry into this matter. I have already dealt substantially with a lot of the issues that arose in the inquiry—the debate on the second reading amendment took place earlier this week. This evening I want to refer in particular to a number of matters that have arisen and that are worthy of report to the Senate. In respect of Mr Howard's view, I take the Senate to the Australian of Thursday, 16 March 2000, wherein it is stated:
John Howard has promised new measures to combat the impact of mandatory sentencing on young Aborigines after quashing a backbench rebellion aimed at overturning the Northern Territory laws.
The Prime Minister told the Coalition party room yesterday that he would appoint a three-person backbench committee to advise cabinet on measures such as diversionary programs and interpreters.
It is interesting to note that the report itself, at attachment A—`Government Senators Report'—provides a range of Commonwealth government programs. It talks about the National Suicide Prevention Strategy, which states:
The Commonwealth's ongoing commitment to suicide prevention is demonstrated by the Government's allocation of $39.2 million in the 1999-2000 Federal Budget ...
It also refers to a range of other programs, such as the Young Offenders Pilot Program, or YOPP,  and states:
The Commonwealth Government has contributed funding to preventative programs for juvenile offenders including the Young Offenders Pilot Program (YOPP) in the Northern Territory and Western Australia.
Without going into detail, I want to cover the range of programs that are provided, which are set out in appendix A. In addition, it provides the Job Placement, Education and Training Program, or JPET, which is a Commonwealth government program. It also talks in attachment A of `Pathways to Prevention: Developmental and Early Intervention Approaches to Crime in Australia.' It then goes on to highlight the national crime prevention strategies for young people and talks about recent achievements. 
The word belongs to the young people. In an article in the Adelaide Advertiser on 16 March 2000, Laura Kendall states:
More than 500 delegates to an international youth conference in Adelaide—including a senior United Nation official—have labelled mandatory sentencing laws unnecessary and harsh. 
In an open letter to Prime Minister John Howard, delegates from 28 countries at the First International Youth Service Models Conference condemned the laws as “counterproductive to the interests of young people and the community”. 
I understand that that open letter will be forwarded to all politicians. I look forward to receiving that letter and being in a position to be able to respond positively to it. I would prefer to have the government respond significantly positively to the recommendations provided in the report of the inquiry into the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999. We have been told in media reports that that is not going to happen. 
Support for the position that has been adopted in this report can also be found in the 17th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of August 1998. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties was highly critical of mandatory detention. At page 346 of its report, it states:
Mandatory sentencing does not take into account the child's age, the facts of the current offence, the individual circumstances of the person, consideration of an appropriate period of time or the application of judicial discretion. Mandatory detention restricts the court's capacity to ensure that the punishment is proportional to the seriousness of the offence and in relation to the rehabilitative options. These minimum sentences are in contravention of Article 37(b) of the Convention which requires that deprivation of liberty not be arbitrary and is a measure of last resort. 
In addition, there is the report of a National Inquiry into Children and the Legal Process. The human rights violations inherent in mandatory detention laws were highlighted in Seen and heard, a report produced in 1997. The report of the National Inquiry into Children and the Legal Process, undertaken jointly by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Australian Law Reform Commission, had this to say:
The Northern Territory and Western Australian laws breach a number of international human standards and common law principles. They violate the principles of proportionality which requires the facts of the offence and the circumstances of the offender to be taken into account, in accordance with article 40 of CROC. They also breach the requirement that in the case of children detention should be a last resort and for the shortest appropriate period, as required by article 37 of CROC. Mandatory detention violates a number of principles in the ICCPR including the prohibition on arbitrary detention in article 9. Both CROC and ICCPR require that sentences should be reviewable by a higher or appellate court. By definition, mandatory sentencing cannot be reviewed. 
The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child has also provided an additional comment in respect of this issue. The mandatory detention laws have also been the subject of international criticism. In 1997, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child stated in relation to Australia: 
The situation in relation to juvenile justice and the treatment of children deprived of their liberty is of concern to the Committee ... The Committee is particularly concerned by the enactment of new legislation in two States, where a high proportion of Aboriginal people live, which provides for mandatory detention and punitive measures of juveniles, thus resulting in a high representation of Aboriginal juveniles in detention. 
Where we end up is that mandatory sentencing is not a matter that provides for the care, the interest and the wellbeing of the children that we are talking about. It highlights the inequities and the disproportional effects of the legislation, especially when you view the types of crimes that are allowed to be punished under that law as against white-collar crimes or crimes of other types. 
In conclusion, it seems that the matters that I have spoken about tonight will be left in the first report which I have been involved with in this Senate. I find it disappointing. The recommendations are well supported by the evidence contained within the report. It is disappointing that the House of Representatives was unable to hear the views of its members and the matter seems to have ended quite prematurely. In my view, it is not a matter that should be truncated. The debate should not end. The debate in respect of this issue should continue. It is an issue that is not going to go away. It is an issue that should be pursued by those people who have an interest in it and those people, such as us, who have a view about the law.

It highlights the inequities and the disproportional effects of the legislation, especially when you view the types of crimes that are allowed to be punished under that law as against white-collar crimes or crimes of other types. 
In conclusion, it seems that the matters that I have spoken about tonight will be left in the first report which I have been involved with in this Senate. I find it disappointing. The recommendations are well supported by the evidence contained within the report. It is disappointing that the House of Representatives was unable to hear the views of its members and the matter seems to have ended quite prematurely. In my view, it is not a matter that should be truncated. The debate should not end. The debate in respect of this issue should continue. It is an issue that is not going to go away. It is an issue that should be pursued by those people who have an interest in it and those people, such as us, who have a view about the law.

MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CUSTOMS
SENATE QUESTION WITHOUT NOTICE
On 6 March 2000, Senator Schacht asked me as the Minister for Justice and Customs a number of questions without notice concerning fuel substitution. In my reply, I undertook to seek further information in relation to this matter.
In response to Senator Schacht's questions I provide the following material.
The 1998/99 Customs Annual Report states 551 tests were carried out on distributors, service stations and transport operators during 1998/99.
The Customs Service detected 52 cases of fuel substitution during the 1998/99 annual report period.
Three prosecutions for excise avoidance under the Fuel (Penalty Surcharges) Amendment Act were prepared.
In early 1998 the Customs Service set up inspection units to test for the presence of the marker in fuel in all States except Tasmania, which was covered by the investigation team in Victoria, to detect cases of fuel substitution.
The Customs Service leased seven trucks through DASFLEET for a period of three years. The cost of the lease was $7,445 per month ($89, 340 per annum). The one-off fit-out cost for the equipment was $134,812.
Excise responsibilities passed to the Treasury portfolio in October 1998 under the Administrative Arrangements Orders.
The current availability of these trucks is a matter which is relevant to the operation of the Australian Taxation office which is within the responsibility of the Assistant Treasurer.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2000-03-16,"—I rise tonight to pay tribute to the life and achievements of the late Mr Richard Beetham, the founding Commissioner of the former Insurance and Superannuation Commission, now the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Richard Beetham died on Remembrance Day 1999, on 11 November, aged 63. After a five-year appointment with the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, Richard did not seek a further term as commissioner and retired in October 1992 for personal reasons. His retirement came as a surprise to me and also to many in the superannuation and insurance industry.
Richard Beetham was born in Lancaster, England, in 1936. He studied at St Mary's College in Blackburn and graduated with the degree Bachelor of Economic Science with honours at the University of Hull in the United Kingdom. He settled in Australia in 1962 and studied the degree Master of Economics at the University of Adelaide. That same year, he won the Reserve Bank of Australia scholarship through the University of Adelaide, researching and preparing a thesis on the `Development of non-bank financial institutions in Australia and implications for monetary theory and policy'.
From 1964 to 1968, he worked with the Reserve Bank as an economist preparing financial analysis and forecasting with advice on macroeconomic and banking policy matters. Richard was then lured to the federal Treasury in 1968 and held the very responsible position of Senior Executive Research Officer of the Commonwealth-State Financial Relations Section. In 1969, he moved to be head of the monetary division section of Treasury and, from 1972 to 1976, he was assistant secretary of the Treasury's banking and insurance branch.
Washington DC was Richard's next appointment, where he held the position of economic minister at the Australian embassy. He also held the position of financial affairs minister in absentia to the Australian High Commission in Ottawa. Here Richard monitored economic and financial developments in the United States and Canada and represented Australia at the United Nations. In 1979, he accepted the position of First Assistant Secretary of the Financial Institutions Division of federal Treasury, where he gave policy advice and undertook administration relating to most aspects of the structure and operations of the Australian financial system. 
From 1987 to 1992, Richard Beetham was Commissioner of the Australian Insurance and Superannuation Commission. This is where I had extensive contact with him. He was responsible for the establishment and development of the ISC, which supervised life insurance, superannuation and general insurance industries. In addition, Richard provided policy advice on all matters relating to these industries and related industries. While at the ISC, he gathered around him a very enthusiastic and dedicated team of professionals. While there, this team, under Richard, developed an insurance regulatory system which was world renowned. That applause continues today. In fact it was only today at lunch that we hosted a delegation from the United Kingdom, a committee that was sent here specifically to look at retirement income issues. 
Following Richard's term with the ISC ending in 1992, he established his own firm, Richard M. Beetham Consulting, and became a consultant to Access Economics Pty Ltd. He also became Chairman of MLC Lifetime Ltd, MLC Management Ltd and Plum Financial Services Nominees, continuing his work and interest in economics, funds management and life insurance, and a director of MLC Nominees. All these firms that he worked with progressed under his leadership and direction. He was also a director of LawCover Ltd and LawCover Plus Ltd, companies providing professional indemnity cover to many Australian lawyers. The industry association representing all general insurers in Australia, the Insurance Council of Australia, also had the benefit of Richard's expertise and extensive experience, being their senior adviser, raising the industry's profile with regulators and legislators.  
Other major positions held by Richard Beetham included being a member of the review group headed by Mr Vic Martin, known as the Martin Group, which reported on the Australian financial system in 1983; a director of the board of the Primary Industry Bank of Australia from 1981 to 1986; and a member of the Australian Payments Systems Council from 1984 to 1987. He was in receipt of a Senior Executive Fellowship in the overseas study of financial systems in North America, Europe and Asia in 1984; Chairman of the Commonwealth Committee on Retirement Incomes in 1983 and 1984; Chairman of the Commonwealth Task Force on Occupational Superannuation from 1979 to 1983; and a member and Chairman of the federal Treasurer's Industry Consultative Committee on Life Insurance, General Insurance and Superannuation spanning 1975 through to 1992. 
So it can be appreciated from the very extensive lists of achievements of Richard Beetham that Australia has indeed lost a very intelligent and well-respected man, dedicated to the fields of economics, insurance and superannuation. Richard was greatly admired by all those who came into contact with him. He was a man of hard work. He was a genuine man. To quote an extract from the Australian Financial Review, `Richard Beetham was popular with bankers and insurance types because, in ACT terms, he was a relatively easygoing chap who liked a drink and a smoke and had a better than average feel for the private sector.' Indeed he had. 
I take this opportunity afforded by this adjournment debate tonight in the Senate to say farewell. I salute Richard Beetham, and at the same time I offer my deepest sympathy to his wife, Robyn, who has distinguished herself in another area of service, and to his daughters, Debra and Sally-Ann. I thank the Senate. ",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Beetham, Mr Richard</title>",Adjournment,33,1
