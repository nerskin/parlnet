"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-05-14,"—My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Does the minister recall her claims in last Saturday's Australian that the government failed to achieve a quarter of a billion dollars in supposed GST savings on pharmaceuticals because the pharmaceutical companies threatened to withdraw medicines? Can the minister clarify which companies made these alleged threats, when they were made and whether the threats were oral or in writing?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-05-14,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I note that the minister has not answered my questions about when the threats were made and whether they were oral or in writing, nor has she given a full answer as to which companies made these alleged threats. Minister, I would ask you to address those questions. Also, it seems that these threats were made some time ago. If that is the case, why did the government wait for the opposition to expose this quarter of a billion dollar bungle before your government launched an investigation into this?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-05-14,"—With regard to the GST and pharmaceutical benefits, the government did actually have detailed arrangements made with people who received savings from wholesale sales tax. That was the wholesale sales tax that Labor had in, whereby there was wholesale sales tax on advertising and wholesale sales tax on petrol, trucks et cetera, and that was fed down through the whole system. It was a ramshackle system and I think the Labor Party has now finally admitted that it is not going to support it. But the removal of the wholesale sales tax and its replacement by GST has led to cost savings for all businesses. In the 2000-01 budget, it was agreed that prices received by pharmaceutical manufacturers for their products listed on the PBS—the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—should be reduced to reflect these costs. The Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association rejected some of the price reductions and, while some individual manufacturers and some groups of manufacturers agreed to the price cuts, the rest did not, with the result that the expected savings to the budget were not achieved.
The government has no legislative power to require companies to accept price decreases for products listed on the PBS. The only way of enforcing the price reductions would have been to push harder and risk the removal from the PBS of those products where companies did not accept the adjustments proposed. Senator Bolkus knows, and would know from other health ministers, that there is bargaining on the part of the government when it is purchasing pharmaceuticals from the pharmaceutical companies, because we purchase in bulk and we drive prices fairly low—the lowest in the world. There is a point at which the companies will say that it is not worthwhile having these medications here in Australia. This would disadvantage consumers by reducing the range of subsidised medicines available to them through the PBS, and the government was not prepared to countenance this.
While the actions of the APMA are regrettable, the government has not been able to pursue the full price reductions proposed at the time. As the Treasurer said on the Sunday program on Sunday, they have argued that there are other costs—increased costs in fuel, a lowering of the dollar—which affected their prices and, therefore, they passed on the GST. They suggested that it be referred to the ACCC for investigation. The Treasurer indicated that that was appropriate and the ACCC will, no doubt, look and see where the APMA and the companies have in fact passed on the GST and there are other factors involved in keeping those prices up.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-05-14,"—The bungle was the ramshackle wholesale sales tax system that this party opposite hung onto like grim death when they knew—Keating knew—that the GST was the thing that was needed. It was a difficult decision, but we have seen that it has reduced the cost of producing exports and it has reduced the cost to businesses. Senator Bolkus asks me to explain or say exactly what companies were involved. Let me say to you that there is always a very healthy debate between the government and the drug companies when they are negotiating a price on a medication, because the government is driving the lowest price we can possibly get and the pharmaceutical companies are trying to get the highest price they can get. It is a healthy debate. Often, they will say, `If we do not get the price we want, we will not release this medication onto the Australian market.'",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,answer
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2002-05-14,"—My question is to Senator Patterson as Minister for Health and Ageing. Can the minister confirm the media reports today that the Prime Minister has axed the outrageous $5 million Commonwealth grant to a lobby group to build Wooldridge House? Eight months down the track, which part of this sleazy affair has the Prime Minister apparently now decided is `not appropriate'? Is it that the Commonwealth government is using taxpayers' money to fund the construction of a building in Canberra so that this lobby group can more assiduously lobby the government, or is it that this multimillion dollar grant to construct a commercial property will be leased out for profit or that Dr Wooldridge made this grant before the election was called and then secured a consultancy with that lobbyist shortly after the election?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Program Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2002-05-14,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I will go on asking questions and supplementary questions until we get the answer—`rave on thou dark and deep blue speakers, rave on'. Given that the Prime Minister knew about the Wooldridge House secret deal from last October, why did you do nothing about it until the details of the deal were exposed four months later? If the deal was so right when it was a secret, why is it now so wrong after the government has been sprung? Also, in response to the minister's last comments, why should taxpayers still have to pay to extract this shonky government from a deal that should never have been done—your words in reply? Please tell us again, Minister.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Program Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-05-14,"—I would have thought that Senator Crowley would have had something else to ask, but she has asked about GP House. I notice that the other side never ask about Centenary House—the absolutely sleazy deal that the Labor Party did with the property they owned in leasing it out to the National Audit Office with an increase in rent of nine per cent, when the rate of increase in rent in Canberra is two to three per cent. I think it was half a million dollars they got for rent last year—enough to fund a couple of elections over a 15-year period. They have locked this in for a 15-year period. If they have got any questions to ask about sleazy deals, then go and look at Centenary House. 
Senator Crowley asked questions about GP House. I thought I had answered enough questions on GP House to do me forever in the last session when I said that not one cent of public money had gone to GP House and not one cent to the RACGP. There was an agreement that was signed that had strict requirements that the RACGP be co-located with a number of other GP organisations, one of them being the Divisions of General Practice. They did not want to go there anyway, and I said it probably would not be on. The government has written to the RACGP and said that this agreement is a no-go, so there has been no money spent. The Prime Minister yesterday announced the budget will confirm commitments that he made earlier this year to reinstate the $5 million of funds to the Asthma Management Program and the Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program. 
The Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program was never done by Labor. They let people in rural areas languish without specialists. We have rolled out program after program throughout rural and regional Australia to give people access to specialists. It is assured that that money will be there— mind you it was never spent in the first place on GP House, but we have to keep saying that because the people on the other side do not listen. Not one cent of that $5 million has gone to the RACGP. The government decided it was not appropriate to fund GP House.  
The department has written to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners conveying this decision, and it has agreed that it is appropriate to withdraw from the agreement. The government has withdrawn from the agreement, the RACGP has withdrawn from the agreement, but Senator Crowley keeps asking questions over and over. My department has commenced negotiations with the college because there may have been some costs involved in setting up the agreement, and they need to demonstrate any costs if they are to be reimbursed.
—So there will be taxpayers' money spent?
—There will be an examination of any costs that the RACGP—
—So there will be taxpayers money spent?
—Order! Senator Evans, you are being disorderly.
—The costs will be carefully scrutinised and any costs that have been incurred will have to be demonstrated very clearly before consideration is even given to it.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Program Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-05-14,"—Senator Crowley must feel like a person who gets knocked over in the ring and stands up for another punch. The Labor Party think if they say something often enough and loud enough, and over and over, people will believe them. Let me just assure them that people do not believe them when they tell fibs over and over because this was not some sleazy underhand deal. It was an agreement negotiated. It was in the budget papers—I have forgotten which one. Just before the election it was there in the Charter of Budget Honesty, which this government put in place and which, mind you, Madam President, referred to having an intergenerational report which was to be presented by government every five years, of which I am very proud. The Treasurer tonight will outline exactly how programs, as they are going, will affect us into the future. This was never thought of by Labor: they were never worried about the future, except for spending other people's money.

Government Response to the Report On ROUGH JUSTICE? An Investigation into Allegations of Brutality in the Army's Parachute Battalion By The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.
March 2002
PART 1
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
BACKGROUND
On 28 August 2000 a decision was made by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that the Committee examine the 1998-1999, and, on its release, the 1999-2000 Annual Reports of the Department of Defence and referred this matter to the Defence Sub Committee.
Following this referral, the Committee agreed that it continue its examination of the Annual Reports of the Department of Defence 1998-99, and when tabled, 1999-2000, with specific reference to, inter alia, the conduct of Military Justice and the alleged events in 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR) concerning brutality and extra judicial procedures and illegal punishments. 
CONDUCT OF THE INVESTIGATION
The Committee advertised its intent to investigate the Australian Defence Force (ADF) Military Justice and equity systems in both national and Service newspapers. Public and private hearings were conducted between 6 October 2000 and 2 March 2001. Fifty submissions were received by the Committee, with only two submissions from soldiers who had served within 3 RAR during the period of the alleged assaults. Defence witnesses included the Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Army, as well as fifteen current and past serving members of 3 RAR. 
INVESTIGATION REPORT
The committee released its report on 11 April 2001—`ROUGH JUSTICE? An Investigation into Allegations of Brutality in the Army's Parachute Battalion'. It contains eight majority recommendations (and one minority recommendation) to be the subject of this response by Government. 
The Committee observed, as follows:
“In the course of this investigation, Committee members were made aware of activities in 3 RAR that reflected no credit on the individuals involved, and sullied the reputation of an outstanding and highly decorated Army unit. There were failures of character, command and process. In its entirety the episode was poorly handled. We are now relatively comfortable, however, that pressure by this committee and subsequent action by the Chief of the Defence Force and Chief of Army have put a process in place to correct the situation.
Those specifically responsible for the incidents have been identified, and legal processes instituted where possible. While not all cases have been finalised, closure on this specific incident is in sight. 
Additionally, the ADF is looking at how this type of incident was allowed to happen. The Burchett Audit and the investigation into the issue of command responsibility and the climate that allowed this type of incident to occur will allow lessons to be learned and identify if there are further issues to be addressed. Investigative and justice processes have already been amended as a result of lessons learned, and more reform is needed. 
Finally, the action taken by the senior leadership of Defence to raise the profile of justice and harassment combined with the intense media scrutiny should ensure that Defence personnel are aware of their rights. This will go a long way to ensuring that this type of incident does not occur again.” (Report, paras 6.37-6.40)
THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE
Significant contribution by Committee to Military Justice 
The Government considers that the Committee has played a very significant role in advancing the cause of Military Justice through its investigation of events and circumstances in 3 RAR. The Committee's conclusion is a timely reminder of the need to be vigilant in respect to Military Justice issues. The Government notes the key finding of the Committee that the allegations were confined to A Company within 3 RAR; and the Committee had no evidence that the alleged incidents within 3 RAR were common within the ADF.
Transparency within Defence of Military Justice Issues 
The Government wishes to reassure the Committee that information concerning the situation in 3 RAR that may have materially affected the recommendations of its 1999 Report into Military Justice Procedures was not knowingly withheld from the Committee. It is regretted that the Committee may have been concerned in this regard. The relevant information did not emerge during 1998 from within 3 RAR and become known to those responsible for managing Defence participation in the Committee's first inquiry into Military Justice. Nor did the situation in 3 RAR come to notice in the compilation of the Defence Annual Report. However, it is anticipated that the imminent appointment of an Inspector General of the Australian Defence Force in the first quarter of 2002 will greatly reduce the possibility of this situation from happening in the future. 
Director of Military Prosecutions 
The Government notes that the Committee was substantially divided on the matter of the appointment of a Director of Military Prosecutions (DMP), with a dissenting report appended to the main report recommending the establishment of a statutory office of the DMP. In announcing publicly the outcome of the Burchett Audit of Military Justice, on 16 August 2001 the Chief of Defence Force indicated that a DMP would be appointed. Legislation to amend the Defence Force Discipline Act will be proposed once the Chiefs of Staff Committee has considered how the DMP is to be appointed and function.
Actions Taken by Chief of Army 
The events and circumstances revealed in 3 RAR led to the Chief of Army taking a range of measures to avoid any repetition, or other occurrence of avoidance of due process in military justice procedures. 
Chief of Army's Plan for a Fair Go. In order to strengthen the equity and fairness environment within the Army, the Chief of Army issued his Plan for a Fair Go. A key element of the plan was the promulgation across the Army of his strong and clear expectations of the required standards of behaviour in the form of “Fair Go” rules. These have been supported by the establishment within Army of an additional hotline to those normally operating within Defence, for individuals to confidentially seek assistance outside of the normal command chain, if necessary. Additionally, the Plan for a Fair Go included a review of equity training, the redevelopment of equity training packages , the conduct of a baseline equity audit and two follow-up equity audits. 
Legal Proceedings. A range of legal proceedings under the Defence Force Discipline Act have been conducted. The outcome of these proceedings are found at Annex A to this Government Response.
Study of Command Aspects. As foreshadowed to the Committee, a study of the command climate and related aspects into the events in 3 RAR has been undertaken. The study was undertaken by Major General Powell, an experienced operational commander. The Report was submitted to the Deputy Chief of Army in December 2001 and its outcome is anticipated in the first quarter of 2002. The Deputy Chief of Army intends to personally brief the Committee on this report.
Actions taken by the Chief of the Defence Force 
Military Justice Stand-Down. This unprecedented measure was held on 5 February 2001 in the midst of the Committee's concern with 3 RAR matters. Its purpose was to demonstrate to the Parliament, the public, and across the ADF that the highest standards of Military Justice and behaviour were expected. It also served to assure all members of the ADF that the law is there for their protection, and that they should respect its procedures and come forward with any personal concerns.
Audit of Military Justice by Mr Burchett, QC. This was a major and unprecedented undertaking within the ADF between January-July 2001. Mr Burchett was appointed as an investigating officer under the Defence (Inquiry) Regulations. His terms of reference were essentially to determine whether there existed in the ADF a culture of systemic avoidance of Military Justice processes. The Burchett Report was released publicly on 16 August 2001 and the Defence Sub Committee was briefed on 23 August 2001. On the basis of his extensive interviews and audit of processes, and consideration of some 500 submissions, Mr Burchett reported that there was not a systemic culture of avoidance of Military Justice processes in the ADF. The Government notes that this crucial finding aligns with the prior assessment by the Committee in its Report. Mr Burchett identified a number of matters requiring follow-up investigation and appropriate action has been initiated.
Mr Burchett made an extensive range of recommendations to improve the overall operation of the Military Justice system. The Chief of the Defence Force has decided that all of these recommendations will be implemented as a discrete project, including the appointment of an Inspector General of the Australian Defence Force early in 2002 and the establishment of an Office of a Director of Military Prosecutions, once legislation has been passed. Any model for a DMP will necessarily have to be adaptable to the command environment of the Defence Force, and be viable in the context of operations. Noting these requirements, the desired outcome is an appropriate system of Military Justice, with optimal degrees of transparency and impartiality. 
Details of the Government's response to each of the Committee's recommendations follow, including a range of Military Justice initiatives pertinent to those recommendations.
PART 2
RESPONSES TO THE COMMITTEE RECOM-MEN-D-ATIONS
RECOMMENDATION 1 
The Committee recommends that educating Defence personnel of their rights and responsibilities be part of an ongoing program, commencing at recruit training. 
RESPONSE
Defence provides extensive equity and diversity training, from recruit training to Commanding Officer Designate courses. Additionally, all ADF members and Departmental staff are required to undergo annual equity and diversity refresher training. The equity and diversity workplace competencies are currently being introduced into all through-career training.
Army has completed a major review of its equity and diversity training. This review has lead to the integration of equity and diversity competencies into training packages to be delivered to officers and soldiers on their career courses. This action will be completed by August 2002. As an interim measure, equity and diversity training is to be delivered to unit commanders and Regimental Sergeant Majors for them to deliver, in turn, to officers and soldiers under their command. 
Formal equity and diversity courses have been part of Navy training since 1999. All Navy personnel must undergo such training on joining and annually thereafter. In 2001 an interim, tailored, course was introduced for senior officers. In addition, it is now mandatory that prior to consideration for appointment as Commanding Officers and Executive Officers and to most instructional appointments, Navy personnel have undergone equity training in the previous 12 months. 
Air Force conducts equity and diversity training at all levels of its leadership and management continuum, from initial entry training to senior appointments. This training is fully intregrated into broad competencies. 
A major portfolio evaluation report of Equity and Diversity in Defence will shortly be tendered to the Departmental Inspector-General. In due course once senior Defence managers have considered the evaluation report; the Committee may consider a briefing on the outcomes of this comprehensive evaluation.
RECOMMENDATION 2
The Committee recommends that officers in the direct chain of command and SNCOs responsible for the discipline system in units not be appointed as Equity Officers. The two roles cannot be adequately reconciled. 
RESPONSE
This recommendation is broadly supported. Equity Advisers are responsible for providing support, information, advice and options for resolution to ADF members who are complainants or respondents, and management on matters relating to all forms of unacceptable behaviour. 
As far as practicable, those holding command appointments are not appointed as Equity Advisers, however, the vast majority of personnel holding rank are in the direct chain of command or are responsible for discipline. The Government believes that the intention of the Committee's recommendation can be accommodated if sufficient, appropriately trained, Equity Advisers are appointed to enable all members of a unit or ship access to an Equity Adviser outside of their own direct chain of command. Army's Land Command has established, as a benchmark, a ratio of one Equity Adviser to every 50 personnel, to accommodate the number of sources of equity advice to those involved in unacceptable behaviour issues.
RECOMMENDATION 3
The Committee recommends that Army establish a pool of investigators held centrally for the conduct of larger investigations. These investigators should not be routinely drawn from outlying areas. 
RESPONSE
The Government does not support the recommendation that a pool of investigators be established and held centrally for the conduct of larger investigations. Whilst the number and complexity of major investigations conducted over the previous year would warrant serious consideration being given to the establishment of a central pool of investigators, this need has not been evident in previous years. Prior to FY 2000/2001 there was an average of only two Major Investigations Teams (MIT) formed per year for investigations in excess of several months. The composition of a MIT is dependent on the type, sensitivity and complexity of the investigation. As required, Army has drawn on the investigative effort from Navy and Air Force to form a MIT, and on occasions, sought the technical assistance and advice of the Australian Federal Police. The Government believes that the current arrangement is more flexible in the use of these scarce and valuable resources. 
The role and establishment of the 5th Military Police Company (SIB), headquartered in Canberra was examined in late 2001. At this point in time Army's preferred approach is to increase the number of more senior investigators on the staff of the 5th Military Police Company (SIB) which should enable better co-ordination and management of investigations and continue to draw more junior and specialist investigators from regional areas as required. Action is subsequently in hand to increase the number of more senior investigators of Headquarters 5th Military Police Company (SIB).
RECOMMENDATION 4 
The Committee recommends that Army investigate the feasibility of placing MPs with Federal, State and Territory Police Forces as part of their training. 
RESPONSE
The Government supports this recommendation. A Memorandum of Understanding has already been signed by Army and the Victoria Police. It is planned to enter similar agreements with other police services including the Australian Federal Police. Additionally, Army is looking to extending the range of civil police and tertiary training courses currently attended by Military Police (MP) personnel.
RECOMMENDATION 5
The Committee further recommends that Army review the conditions for reserve Military Police, with the view to better utilising the investigative skills in the Military Police Reserve units, especially for major cases.  
RESPONSE
The Government agrees with the Committee's recommendation. The Government values the contribution of Army Reserve MP's, many of whom have acquired specialist investigation skills in their civilian employment. Army is currently developing a Trade Management Plan for the Corps of Military Police, which will outline a framework for the employment of Reservists. In developing the Plan, Army will examine means to better utilise the investigative skills in MP Reserve and integrated units, especially for major cases. The Plan is due for completion in June 2002.
RECOMMENDATION 6
The Committee recommends there be a formal review of the Defence Legal Office, with terms of reference and timetable for completion, and that the review be made public. 
RESPONSE
This recommendation by the Committee arose in the context whether the Military Justice System is too slow. At issue are the formal processes which comprise the Military Justice System; and the organisational arrangements for the in house delivery of legal services.
Military Justice System
The Government fully agrees that the entire legal process surrounding the incidents at 3 RAR took far too long. A much more efficient system is required to centrally track and monitor the progress of all matters dealt with in the Military Justice System. The most efficient way to achieve this is through the establishment of a Registrar of Military Justice. This has been implemented within the office of the Judge Advocate General, whose statutory responsibility it is to report annually to Parliament on the implementation of Defence Force Discipline Act. The Registrar of Military Justice is implementing a case management system (with requisite Information Technology support) to capture all ADF inquiries and matters of Defence Force discipline. This information also will be available to the Inspector General of the ADF to support that office in ensuring compliance with due processes, timeliness, transparency and standards in military justice.
In addition, the Judge Advocate General has implemented a standard step in the conduct of more complex disciplinary proceedings in the form of Directions Hearings. All those responsible for bringing matters to trial will be required to appear before a judicial officer for the purpose of explaining what is involved, and how long it should take to conclude. This will provide an additional process stimulus to expedite all disciplinary proceedings. 
Coupled with strong recommendations by Mr Burchett for much enhanced training in military procedures (presently in the design phase through the Military Law Centre), these measures, when fully effective, should make for the more timely, streamlined and controlled administration of military justice.
Review of The Defence Legal Service
The Defence Legal Service has been undergoing a continuous program of integration and reform since the amalgamation of all in-house legal services in 1997.
In 1997 a military Director General was appointed to lead and manage the national in-house provision of legal services across Defence. A civilian General Counsel was appointed within The Defence Legal Service to provide high level legal advice across the Defence Organisation. 
Studies were conducted into the provision of legal services to all bases, commands and regions in 1997. The central office in Canberra was fundamentally reviewed in 1998-99. The roles of Reserve Legal Officers were reviewed in 2001. This important review will result in a much closer relationship between the permanent and reserve officers of The Defence Legal Service. Moreover, the Reserve officers will be more closely integrated with their respective services, ideally through appointments within major formations and force element groups. The relevant Papers from each of these studies can be made available to the Committee, should this be required. 
Finally, the incoming Director General undertook a national field survey of the entire organisation in 2001 and has made substantial internal organisational changes aimed at uniting all the legal resources available to the Defence Organisation into arguably the largest national in-house law firm in Australia. The shaping vision is set at “professional excellence”, in all aspects of performance. The Defence Legal Office was renamed The Defence Legal Service in March 2001.
The demand for in-house legal services seems to be outstripping available resources. Significantly, the Burchett Audit of Military Justice observed:
“It was frequently suggested that the Defence Force should have more lawyers because there are not enough in-house resources to meet the demand (para 180).”
Burchett recommended that the total number of legal officers and their location and organisation required in the modern Defence Force be reviewed. This recommendation will be actioned as part of the general implementation of all the Burchett recommendations in 2002, with special emphasis accorded to the geographical placement of ADF legal officers to ensure that it reflects sufficiently the demands on The Defence Legal Service nationally. 
Should the Committee require, an extensive briefing on the reform of the Defence Legal Service can readily be provided. The Government considers that these changes need to be given further time to take effect, before any further formal review is considered.
RECOMMENDATION 7
The Committee recommends that officers transferring to the Defence legal specialisation on completion of a law degree necessitate relinquishment of rank commensurate with their legal expertise and experience. 
RESPONSE
This recommendation is broadly supported. The remuneration and professional development of the legal specialisation within the ADF elements of The Defence Legal Service is based on legal competencies. Clients are entitled to expect that rank and legal skills are reflective of actual experience. The most usual form of entry to the legal specialisation will remain through undergraduate and graduate recruitment to the most junior officer ranks. 
Transfer to the legal specialisation as late as the rank of Major (or equivalent rank) would only be in exceptional circumstances. There will be some officers at this level whose command and management experience has required them to deal extensively with legal issues as a matter of course. This experience, coupled with legal training, will enhance their capacity to contribute effectively to The Defence Legal Service. It may be necessary for certain of these officers to be held longer at the Major (or equivalent rank) level to enable them to consolidate their legal experience before they are eligible for promotion. All of these considerations would be taken into account by the Career and Professional Development Committee, which has been established to regulate the professional management of officers in the Defence Legal Service.
RECOMMENDATION 8
The Committee further recommends that legal officers' selection boards have a legal officer on the panel.
RESPONSE
This is fully endorsed.
DISSENTING REPORT RECOMMEND-ATION
In light of the recurrence of issues relating to brutality and Military Justice, and noting the recommendations of the committee's previous report into Military Justice procedures in the ADF, those dissenting members now strongly recommend that the ADF establish a statutory office of the Director of Military Prosecutions, for Defence Force Magistrate trials and Courts-Martial (for criminal and quasi criminal matters).
As has been announced and advised to the Committee previously, a DMP will be established after selection of an appropriate model suitable to the ADF needs, and when the necessary legislation is in place.

Government Response
The report of the Senate Select Committee for an Inquiry into the Contract for a New Reactor at Lucas Heights “A New Research Reactor?”—May 2001
Introduction
Need for the Replacement Research Reactor: Government's Position
Without exception, the evidence to the Committee from Australia's peak scientific, educational, medical and industry bodies gave strong support to the construction of the replacement reactor. This evidence made it very clear that the replacement reactor will underpin Australia's future role in nuclear science and technology and, consequently, our capacity to reap benefits in emerging areas of advanced technology. The submission by the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee expressed this view concisely:
“The AVCC believes that Australia's possession of a modern research reactor supports our standing as a technologically sophisticated society able to play its role in the new economy.” (submission number 164).
Scientists in Australia have been contributing to research and development in nuclear science and technology since 1896, immediately after the discovery of x-rays and radioactivity. Indeed, Sir Lawrence Bragg, the first Australian-born Nobel Laureate, received (together with his father) the Nobel Prize in 1915 for work in this area of physics.
Since 1945, successive Australian Governments have sought to ensure that Australians were able to benefit from applications of nuclear science and technology and, since 1958, operation of the HIFAR nuclear research reactor and associated facilities at Lucas Heights has been central to this objective. 
The replacement nuclear research reactor will build on Australia's substantial investment in nuclear science and technology during the last 100 years. It will be a major facility for the nationally important research activities that will continue to be undertaken in Australia in a wide range of scientific disciplines. It will provide a practical base to enable young Australians to be trained in neutron science, thereby supporting the future development of Australia's scientific and industrial capabilities. The replacement reactor will also contribute to providing Australians with a first class standard of health care via reliable supply of radioisotopes for use in nuclear medicine. 
The operation of a research reactor in Australia has also enhanced Australia's capacity to participate effectively in international nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and safety matters by ensuring that Australia is able to attract, develop and maintain a broad, multi-disciplinary range of nuclear expertise. This capacity to provide government with expert scientific and technical advice across the nuclear fuel cycle enables Australia to make independent judgments about nuclear matters, both within the region and globally, that are timely and informed. It also positions Australia to contribute at a technical level to international arrangements. 
Australia's contributions to the development of the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) strengthened safeguards system, arrangements to protect the people and the environment from the potentially harmful effects of nuclear facilities, radioactive materials and radiation sources, the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty International Monitoring System, and the verification regime for a future `fissile material cut-off treaty', are salient examples where Australian technical expertise has significantly advanced Australia's security and non-proliferation interests. 
The Committee stated that it was “not convinced that Australia needs a new research reactor to make a positive contribution to nuclear disarmament”, and it found “that the justification for the new research reactor solely on national interest grounds is not strong where national interest is defined on purely `security' and non-proliferation grounds”. However, the Government does not argue, and never has argued, that the research reactor is justified solely on security and non-proliferation grounds. 
Nevertheless, the Government considers that operation of a research reactor significantly enhances Australia's capacities to contribute to international arrangements to prevent nuclear proliferation; to ensure that nuclear activities are carried out according to appropriate standards of safety and physical protection; and to evaluate and influence developments in nuclear technology. The Government considers that the level of Australia's technical nuclear expertise would decline rapidly in the absence of a domestic nuclear research reactor and, consequently, Australia's ability to achieve its nuclear policy objectives would be seriously diminished.
The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works concluded unanimously in 1999 that “A need exists to replace HIFAR with a modern research reactor.”1
In summary, the Government is firmly of the view that it is in Australia's national interest to have a modern, multi-purpose nuclear research reactor and it is proceeding with the replacement of the High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR) on this basis. The national interest is premised on the range of benefits that the research reactor offers to Australia—domestically, in the fields of science, industry, education, medicine, and the environment—and internationally, by augmenting Australia's capacity to effectively engage in international nuclear affairs. 
Response to individual recommendations from the Majority report
Recommendation	Chapter 11, p. 224
The Committee notes that the Government has failed to establish a conclusive or compelling case for the new reactor, and recommends that before the Government proceeds any further it undertake an independent public review into the need for a new nuclear reactor.
RESPONSE:  DISAGREE
The “need for a new nuclear reactor” has been subject to extensive assessment commencing with the Research Reactor Review in 1993. The Government, having closely examined the issues associated with such a major national infrastructure investment, concluded that it is in Australia's national interest to have a modern, multi-purpose nuclear research reactor. 
The Government's position has been supported by evidence provided to the Committee by Australia's peak scientific, educational, medical and industry bodies, all of which strongly supported construction of the replacement reactor. The consistent message from this wide range of bodies— which included the Australian Research Council, the Australian Academy of Science, the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, the Australian Vice Chancellors' Committee, the NSW Branch of the Australian Medical Association, the Australian New Zealand Society of Nuclear Medicine, the Australian and New Zealand Association of Physicians in Nuclear Medicine (Inc), the Institution of Engineers, Australia, the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, the Business Council of Australia and the Business/Higher Education Round Table—was that there was a demonstrated need for a replacement reactor. 
It is significant that the Minority Report highlighted the fact that the evidence to the Committee overwhelmingly supported the Government's decision to build a replacement reactor. The Minority Report also noted that the conclusions and recommendations of the Majority Report were quite inconsistent with the body of the Committee's Report.  
The Government would also emphasise that the Parliamentary Public Works Committee, which examined the replacement reactor project in 1999, unanimously concluded that there was a need to replace HIFAR with a modern research reactor. The Parliamentary Public Works Committee also unanimously concluded that the need for the replacement of HIFAR arises as a consequence of national interest considerations, research and development requirements and the need to sustain the local production of radiopharmaceuticals. 
The Chief Scientist, in his submission to the Committee said that Australia's “ability to retain world-class researchers or to attract them in the first place is not helped if a due process for approval of a world-class facility is repeatedly revisited”.
The Government considers that a compelling case has been made for proceeding with the replacement reactor. The call for a further inquiry is unnecessary and designed to serve the purposes of those opposed to the replacement reactor.
Recommendation	Summary, Part I, page 92 and Chapter 11, p. 225
The Committee recommends that before the Government proceeds any further with the proposed reactor, it undertake a thorough and comprehensive public review of funding for medical and scientific research in Australia with a view to assessing priorities including the role, if any, a research reactor would have in contributing to Australia's scientific, medical and industrial interests.
RESPONSE:  DISAGREE
As indicated in the Government's response to the previous recommendation, it is firmly of the view that the need for a replacement reactor has been clearly established and has acted accordingly in proceeding with its construction. 
The proposed “thorough and comprehensive public review of funding for medical and scientific research in Australia” is unnecessary. Undertaking such a broad review is not a normal precursor to proceeding with major national infrastructure projects. The funding requirements for medical research in Australia was subject to such a review by Mr Peter Wills in 1999 (The Virtuous Cycle) and for scientific research by the Chief Scientist, Dr Robin Batterham in 2000 (The Chance to Change). These reviews were undertaken in consultation with the medical and scientific communities and other interested parties, including the general public. The Government has responded to the reports in the 1999-2000 and 2001-02 Budgets, with substantial increases in funding. 
However, concerning the contribution that the replacement reactor would make to Australia's scientific, medical and industrial interests, the following points provide a clear indication of the extensive contribution that the replacement reactor will make in each of these areas. 
Maintenance of an indigenous neutron source is an important aspect of Australia's overall research infrastructure. The Australian Vice Chancellors' Committee stated in its submission that “A modern state of the art Australian facility supporting leading edge beam instruments and providing for a range of irradiation is essential to advance the application of science and technology to the benefit of industry, health, the environment and education within Australia.” ANSTO's HIFAR reactor is not only used by ANSTO's research staff, but also by university staff and post-graduate researchers from 36 universities in Australia and New Zealand who make extensive use of the instruments on the research reactor. 
The replacement reactor will have more instruments and higher neutron flux than HIFAR and will be able to provide a level of support for Australian science, higher education and industry that is comparable to the support enjoyed by their USA and Japanese counterparts. As an example, a cold neutron source which will be a feature of the replacement reactor. These sources are now providing the basis for many of the current advances in neutron science, especially in structural biology and in such emerging fields as nanoscience and engineering, and novel materials.
The irradiation capabilities of the existing HIFAR reactor are used to produce isotopes that have applications in most industries. Radioactive isotopes are used as sensors in process control systems for performing on-line, non-contact and non-destructive measurement and can also be used to analyse materials such as mineral ores or coal. In 1997, Access Economics identified gross economic benefits in the range of $140 million to $230 million annually from selected activities impacting on health, mining and other industries. Neutrons generated by research reactors also have particular utility in probing the structure of solids and liquids and, as indicated above, the replacement reactor will potentially underpin developments in materials science with application in emerging technology platforms such as biotechnology and nanotechnology. 
It is estimated that, on average, every Australian will have a reactor based nuclear medicine procedure in their lifetime. On the basis of Medicare data, an estimated 326,000 nuclear medicine procedures using reactor-derived isotopes were undertaken in 1996. In the USA, the use of nuclear technologies has reduced the annual number of patients treated using surgery for hyperthyroidism from 3000 to 502. The Government, together with relevant medical specialists, considers that it would be quite imprudent not to proceed with the replacement reactor as this would expose delivery of isotope based medical therapies to unacceptable risks in terms of security of supply and reliability of distribution. The President of the Australian New Zealand Society of Nuclear Medicine summed these issues up in a press release issued on 3 May 2001 “There is really no viable alternative to a local research reactor as the source of radiopharmaceuticals for medical use.”   
In short, the importance of the replacement reactor to Australia's scientific, medical and industrial interests is very clear.
Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 226 
The Committee strongly recommends that there should be full disclosure of the termination provisions of the contract signed with INVAP so the Parliament and the Australian people will know what obligations have been entered into.
RESPONSE: AGREE—THIS HAS BEEN DONE
ANSTO provided the Committee with a significant amount of material relating to the contract with INVAP. This material included all the termination provisions, which were provided in September 2000. The text of those provisions is reproduced at pages 146-148 of the Report.
Request to Auditor General for consideration—Chapter 11, page 226
The Committee requests that the Australian National Audit Office consider examining the tender and contract documents for the new reactor at Lucas Heights with a view to determining:
·	whether further investigation of the tendering process and the contract is warranted;
·	whether, during the tendering process, ANSTO ensured that there was adequate and appropriate independent verification and validation of the tenderers claims;
·	whether the cost estimate of $286.4 million for the replacement research reactor project is based on sound reasons and whether it is still accurate;
·	whether any contract provisions have been inappropriately claimed to be confidential and if so, on what grounds; and
·	whether the documents sought by the Committee and the Senate should now be made public.
RESPONSE:  THIS IS A MATTER FOR THE AUDITOR-GENERAL
This is not a matter for the Government. Rather, it is for the Auditor-General to determine whether ANAO should undertake the proposed audit. The Acting Auditor-General, Mr Ian McPhee, wrote to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources on 14 June 2001, enclosing a copy of a letter of the same date which had been sent to the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee stating: 
“I do not consider that an audit of the processes and contract by the ANAO at this time would add sufficient value to the Parliament to give it priority over our planned program, which has been determined after consulting with the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Audit.”
Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 227 
To provide assurance that the research reactor's design is under appropriate management and that the technical specifications and objectives are being met, the Committee recommends that ANSTO engage an independent expert third party to review and evaluate, periodically throughout the life of the project, the contractor's performance as measured against the specified requirements. It further recommends that such reports be made public.
RESPONSE:  DISAGREE
This is not normal practice for Commonwealth projects, and the Government considers that the services of the proposed expert are not required. Not only would appointment of such an expert constitute an unnecessary expense, it would also cut across ANSTO's accountability for management of the project and ARPANSA's licensing role, with the ambiguity as to the expert's legal position only serving to confuse the situation.
Such an independent expert third party would, in effect, be carrying out functions akin to a project manager. This responsibility has rightly been ascribed to ANSTO by the Government. ANSTO has determined the design and performance parameters for the reactor and, importantly, will be the licensee for the reactor. 
The recommendation also displays an evident disregard for the scrutiny of the project that will be undertaken by ARPANSA in determining whether the reactor meets adequate standards in relation to safety. ARPANSA has made it clear that, in relation to the construction and operating licences which are necessary prerequisites for the reactor to be brought into service, ANSTO will need to demonstrate that, as the applicant for the licence, it has a comprehensive understanding of the reactor systems and command of the various elements of the project. Furthermore, ANSTO will need to satisfy ARPANSA as to their efficacy in the circumstances 
The project is, of course, a major undertaking for ANSTO, given its cost and complexity. ANSTO has therefore taken the sensible step of augmenting its existing expertise by recruiting a project manager with extensive experience in managing large projects. 
Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 227
The Committee also recommends that the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources report immediately to Parliament and thereafter on a three monthly basis, the progress made on the design, construction and eventual operation of the new reactor at Lucas Heights. This report is to include: 
·	a full explanation of the work completed against the agreed time schedule and all payments made; 
·	an account of any delays or anticipated disruptions to the project and an explanation for such hold-ups;
·	a statement on the strategies in place to monitor and ensure that the contractor is meeting performance specifications including the findings of independent consultants engaged to assess the contractor's performance measured against required specifications; and
·	the proposed work and payment schedule for the following six months.
RESPONSE:  DISAGREE
The Government considers that reports by the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, as proposed by the Committee, are not necessary. In accordance with a recommendation made by the Parliamentary Public Works Committee when it agreed that the replacement reactor project should proceed, ANSTO is providing that Committee with reports on a six-monthly basis. Three such reports have already been provided to the Public Works Committee—in September 2000, April 2001, and September 2001 with the next report scheduled for April 2002. The most recent report covered:
·	Contract payments;
·	Expenditure to date;
·	Performance and schedule;
·	Licensing and regulatory activities;
·	Australian Industry Involvement Program; 
·	Technology transfer;
·	Risk management;
·	Management of radioactive waste; and
·	The proposed Community Right to Know Charter.
The Government considers that these reports are at the level and frequency appropriate for the replacement reactor project. 
In addition, the Government notes that ANSTO has been reporting on a six-monthly basis to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage on its compliance with his recommendations arising from the replacement reactor Environmental Impact Statement. These reports are made public, and can be inspected on ANSTO's Website.
Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 228 
The Committee recommends that ANSTO take immediate action to ensure that before it enters into any formal or legally binding undertaking, agreement or contract that all parties to that arrangement are made fully aware of ANSTO's obligation to be accountable to Parliament. 
RESPONSE:  AGREE 
The Government accepts that ANSTO, in common with all Government agencies, is accountable to Parliament. The Government considers that, generally speaking, parties to contracts with Government agencies are aware that this accountability could result in scrutiny of contractual arrangements, either through the audit function of the Australian National Audit Office or direct scrutiny by a Parliamentary Committee. However, for its part, ANSTO has sought to deal with this explicitly in the Conditions of Tender for the replacement reactor, which not only made reference to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 but also specifically canvassed the possible need to provide information to the Commonwealth Auditor-General. 
Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 228 
The Committee further recommends that any future contract entered into by ANSTO, include provisions that require contractors to keep and provide sufficient information to allow for proper Parliamentary scrutiny of the contract and its management.
RESPONSE: AGREE WITH QUALIFICATIONS 
As indicated in the response to the previous recommendation, the Government notes that ANSTO's approach to arriving at a contract for construction of the replacement reactor displayed due regard to its accountability obligations as a Government agency. The Government is confident that ANSTO will ensure that where it can be reasonably concluded that particular information associated with a contract would be material to proper evaluation of the contract and its management, the necessary steps will be taken to ensure that the information was available for that purpose. However, should the information have commercial confidentiality implications, as is the case with much of the content of the contract for the replacement reactor, consideration would also need to be given to the basis on which the information might be provided. 
The Government considers that failure to recognise and respect the rights of non-government parties to have commercially sensitive information handled appropriately could lead to perceptions of an increased level of sovereign risk associated with dealing with the Commonwealth. This might result in the objectives of the Commonwealth's procurement process being placed at risk.
Recommendation	Chapter 11, pages 228-29
The Committee recommends that, if the new research reactor project is to go ahead, the Government put in place a number of mechanisms to ensure that full and thorough public scrutiny of the proposal takes place during the licensing process. This is to ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that the construction and operation of the proposed reactor would not adversely affect the health of the community or damage the environment. At a minimum, these mechanisms must include:
·	publication of all submissions made to ARPANSA during the licensing process;
·	publication of ARPANSA's responses to concerns raised in these submissions, detailing in what way those concerns have affected the CEO's decision;
·	release of the full details of the design and the construction contract except for those items which are determined as truly commercial-in-confidence.
RESPONSE:  AGREE WITH QUALIFICATIONS
Arrangements are already in place under relevant legislation to ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that the construction and operation of the replacement reactor will not adversely affect the health of the community or damage the environment. 
The potential environmental impact of the replacement reactor was rigorously examined in accordance with the relevant legislation, the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act (1974). The Minister for the Environment and Heritage decided that there were no environmental reasons preventing the granting of Commonwealth approval for the replacement reactor. On the basis of the environmental impact assessment process, the Minister made a number of recommendations to ensure that the replacement reactor is constructed and operated in accordance with best international practice. All the recommendations were accepted by the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources. They now not only apply to the construction of the replacement reactor but, in some cases, will extend throughout the reactor's lifetime. 
Radiation health issues are now being specifically addressed via the licensing procedures of ARPANSA, under the provisions of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act(1998).
In relation to the specific recommendations that all submissions made to ARPANSA during the licensing process and that ARPANSA's responses to concerns raised in these submissions be published, the Government considers that the extent of publication of information proposed by ARPANSA is appropriate in the circumstances. 
ANSTO's construction licence application, its Preliminary Safety Analysis Report (PSAR), a detailed summary of the PSAR have already been made available to the public. The ARPANSA and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reviews of those documents, together with the outcomes of the review of the PSAR by the nuclear regulatory authority of Argentina will also be made available to the public. Formal questions and answers between ARPANSA and ANSTO/INVAP will be placed on the public record, and advice provided by the independent ARPANSA Nuclear Safety Committee will also be published.
ARPANSA's consideration of the licensing application will involve two rounds of submissions from the public, the first covering submissions on the application and related documents, and the second to allow comment on the main issues arising from the first round of submissions and from reviews of ANSTO's PSAR undertaken by ARPANSA and IAEA experts. Submissions other than those outlined in the previous paragraph, which will primarily consist of other submissions from the general public, will be available on request subject to the agreement of the submitter. 
The CEO of ARPANSA, in making his decision on the licence application, must take all submissions into account. The CEO will publish a report setting out how he did so.
Regarding the specific recommendation that full details of the design and construction contract except for those items which are determined as truly commercial-in-confidence be released, the Government notes that, in all cases where the Committee requested the text of specific provisions of the contract, ANSTO provided that material. Release of the termination provisions is a case in point. ANSTO also provided the Committee with a table of the contract's contents and a summary of the contract. The text of certain subclauses was provided in response to a question taken on notice during the Committee's hearings. 
The Government would emphasise that, by their very nature, a number of the remaining matters covered in the contract would raise commercial-in-confidence concerns from INVAP's perspective. This point was made by INVAP itself in evidence to the Committee. Consequently, the Government considers that the public interest would not be well served by a process that would effectively yield little additional information. As indicated above, all safety issues associated with design and construction of the replacement reactor will be subject to public scrutiny during ARPANSA's consideration of ANSTO's application for the construction licence. A considerable volume of material relating to the design and construction of the replacement reactor has already been released and, as noted above, further material will be made public during the licensing process. The Government considers that this body of material will provide a sound basis for ensuring that neither the health of the community nor the environment are adversely affected by construction and operation of the reactor.
Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 229 
Given that there are doubts about privilege and the powers of such an inquiry to obtain documents because the ARPANS Act is silent on these issues, the Committee recommends that the Government appoint a panel including the CEO of ARPANSA under other legislative powers to conduct the inquiry.
RESPONSE:  DISAGREE 
The ARPANS Act 1998 sets out a process for considering ANSTO's construction and operating licence applications. These licences are essential prerequisites for the operation of the replacement research reactor. The construction licence application is presently subject to consideration by ARPANSA in accordance with the requirements of its legislation, which was enacted as recently as 1998, with public consultation processes that were endorsed by Parliament as part of the legislation. 
The public consultation and submission process that ARPANSA has established in accordance with its legislation for consideration of ANSTO's application for a construction licence gives the public unprecedented direct access to the person making the decision on the application. The Government notes in this context that the purpose of the licensing application process is to provide the necessary support for a decision by the Chief Executive Officer of ARPANSA on ANSTO's licence application. The Government does not accept that a judicial inquiry represents a superior approach to arriving at a decision as to whether or not to issue a licence.
Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 229 
The Committee further recommends that, in the longer term, the Government undertake a public review of the kinds of public consultation process required in other jurisdictions and in relation to other proposals with public health and environmental implications. The object of such a review should be to determine best practice and to amend the ARPANS Act accordingly.
RESPONSE:  AGREE WITH QUALIFICATIONS
Further to the response provided to the previous recommendation, the Government would reiterate that the ARPANS Act was only enacted as recently as 1998. While the performance of the legislation will clearly be subject to scrutiny over the longer-term, the Government considers that a more specific response is unnecessary and not needed at this time.
Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 230 
The Committee recommends that the contract, and any subsequent agreements, with COGEMA for the re-processing of Australian spent fuel rods be made public. 
RESPONSE:  AGREE WITH QUALIFICATION
COGEMA provided a copy of its contract with ANSTO concerning reprocessing of spent fuel rods (except for financial details) to Greenpeace France early in 2001, at the direction of a French court. This was done on the basis that it was only to be used for the purpose of the French court proceedings. Subsequently, Greenpeace Australia provided the Committee with details from the contract without COGEMA's knowledge or agreement.  
Given the erroneous claims about the contractual relationship between ANSTO and COGEMA that followed disclosure of this information, COGEMA agreed to ANSTO's proposal that the Senate be provided with a copy of the contract and a related exchange of letters from August and September 2000 in order to clarify the situation. This information was provided in the course of the Industry, Science and Resources portfolio estimates hearing on 4 June 2001. 
The Government would, however, like to register the point that the contract contained commercially and technically sensitive information, and an express provision as to confidentiality that was binding on both parties. The Government understands that similar confidentiality provisions are contained in all COGEMA's reprocessing contracts. While the Government accepts that ANSTO has obligations to be accountable to Parliament for its handling of the reprocessing of spent fuel from Lucas Heights, due acknowledgment also needs to be given to the legitimate concerns that other parties to contracts, such as COGEMA, might have over protection of their commercial position. 
Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 230 
The Committee recommends that, in light of the growing opposition overseas, ANSTO prepare and fully cost a contingency management plan for spent fuel conditioning and disposal within Australia. This plan should fully describe the technologies to be used should Australia have to manage its spent fuel wholly within Australia. 
RESPONSE:  DISAGREE
Reactor operations commenced in HIFAR in 1958 and an initial shipment of spent fuel was shipped to the United Kingdom in 1963. Successive governments then allowed spent fuel to accumulate at Lucas Heights. 
The strategy for management of spent fuel from research reactor operations was determined by the Labor Government in 1995, in respect of the management of spent fuel rods from HIFAR. That Government announced in October 1995 that it had decided “to make full use of international opportunities” by exporting the spent fuel and that Australia would manage the long-lived intermediate waste that would arise from reprocessing. It authorised the negotiation of a contract to ship 114 spent fuel rods to the United Kingdom for reprocessing, and the return to Australia of the resulting waste. The shipment was despatched in April 1996.
A domestic conditioning option for research reactor spent fuel was fully evaluated by the Government in 1997. In the event, the Government decided against this option, announcing on 3 September 1997 that it had: 
“decided not to establish a reprocessing facility at Lucas Heights or anywhere else in Australia. 
Instead, $88 million has been set aside to remove spent nuclear fuel rods from Lucas Heights and meet the cost of reprocessing offshore.” 
Since that announcement, ANSTO has negotiated contractual arrangements with COGEMA for the reprocessing in France of spent fuel from both HIFAR and the replacement reactor, and with the US Department of Energy for the return of US-origin spent fuel. Shipments of HIFAR spent fuel were sent overseas in 1998 (USA), 1999 and 2001 (France). 
USA-sourced spent fuel rods are shipped back to the USA in accord with US nuclear non proliferation policy and the US has agreed to take back for storage all US sourced spent fuel arising from research reactor operations until May 2006 as part of that policy.
France has undertaken, via an exchange of letters at ministerial level, to facilitate the reprocessing of Australian spent fuel by COGEMA. The Government has no reason to doubt those undertakings. COGEMA is the world's largest provider of spent nuclear fuel reprocessing services. It has contracts to reprocess spent nuclear fuel with about 29 utilities from six countries. The Government notes that COGEMA has recently signed a contract with the French State Electricity Company, EDF to reprocess waste until 2015. The reprocessing of all the spent fuel produced by HIFAR over its lifetime will amount to about 0.02 percent of the annual processing capacity of the La-Hague facility.
As a contingency measure, INVAP is also contractually committed to arrange, on request, for the processing of spent fuel from the replacement reactor in a way that complies with ANSTO's requirements. That provision would be invoked if, for any reason, the COGEMA route for reprocessing becomes unavailable. However, given current circumstances, it is unlikely that this will need to be invoked.
The Government considers that these contractual arrangements, which are supported by governmental commitments from the French and Argentinian Governments, demonstrate that adequate provision has been made for the management of Australian spent fuel. A domestic contingency management plan is therefore unnecessary. 
Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 230 
The Committee recommends that the Government satisfactorily resolve the question of the safe disposal of new reactor spent fuel before approval to construct a new reactor is given.
RESPONSE:  DISAGREE
The CEO of ARPANSA has a statutory responsibility for deciding on the issuance of a licence to construct the replacement research reactor. The Government notes in this context that the CEO of ARPANSA stated on 26 October 2000 in testimony to the Inquiry that, in terms of licensing, he “would need to be satisfied that Australia will have such a store (ie for long-lived intermediate level waste) and that those arrangements are progressing in such a way that I can be satisfied that it will have such a store.” 
The Government is confident of meeting the ARPANSA CEO's requirement, which diverges from the recommendation in requiring adequate progress rather than ultimate resolution of the issue of the disposal of replacement research reactor spent fuel. The Government notes that, the first shipments of waste from the processing of spent fuel from HIFAR and from the replacement research reactor will not be returned to Australia for storage until around 2015 and 2025, respectively. 
ANSTO advised the Committee that, in accordance with Government policy, spent fuel from the replacement reactor will be managed in the first instance by processing overseas through the contractual and inter-governmental commitments referred to in the response to the previous recommendation. The long-lived intermediate level wastes that result from processing will then be managed in Australia with, and form a very small portion of, the Commonwealth's holding of this type of waste. The storage facility is needed for the management of more than 400 cubic metres of long-lived intermediate level waste that is currently held by Commonwealth agencies. The vitrified (glass) residues and compacted waste arising from both HIFAR and the replacement research reactor spent fuel will amount to an additional 46 cubic metres. ANSTO made it clear that, as was discussed in the Environmental Impact Statement for the Replacement Research Reactor, management of spent nuclear fuel from the replacement reactor will not involve direct disposal in Australia, nor reprocessing in Australia, nor indefinite storage in Australia. 
The Government has decided that the most appropriate way to manage the Commonwealth's holding of long-lived intermediate level radioactive waste is to house it in a purpose-built above-ground storage facility. The facility will be designed to accommodate the current holding of this class of waste and future arisings, which include the small amount of waste that will arise from reprocessing of spent fuel from HIFAR and the replacement research reactor.
The Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin, announced a process to establish such a store in August 2000. In February 2001, the Minister announced that the national store will be sited on Commonwealth land, and the earliest the preferred site could be announced would be late 2002. A public discussion paper on methods for choosing the site was released recently. 
Waste arising from the processing of spent fuel from the replacement research reactor will be returned to Australia from France in purpose-designed transport and storage casks as vitrified residues and compacted waste. The casks will be appropriate for storage in the national store, and will remain in this facility until a geological repository is established for the ultimate disposal of long-lived intermediate level waste. Given the amount of the Commonwealth's holding of this type of waste, and the likely rate of arisings in the foreseeable future, a geological repository cannot be justified for such waste at present.

379th REPORT OF JOINT COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT: CONTRACT MANAGEMENT IN THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC SERVICE
WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS 1-5
The 379th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit—Contract Management in the Australian Public Service—was tabled in the Parliament on 2 November 2000. The report was the conclusion of an inquiry into contract management that commenced on 5 September 1999. The key objective of the inquiry was to “analyse a range of examples in order to develop better practice approaches to contract management that can be applied across Government agencies”.
The Government notes the importance that contract management now assumes in the Australian Public Service (APS) and the enhanced benefits that it can offer. The Government is also keenly aware of the importance of transparency and accountability when managing Government contracts.  
The Government further notes that agencies remain accountable for the delivery of services, even where the service delivery is provided by the private sector. Central to the accountability principle is the need to maintain awareness of client needs and how they are being met.
It is appropriate to re-emphasise that APS agencies operate under a robust accountability framework that enables detailed scrutiny of any contracts that they may enter into. The legislative and policy framework governing APS agencies includes the:
·	Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997;
·	Financial Management and Accountability Regulations;
·	Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines;
·	Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997;
·	Chief Executive's Instructions;
·	Freedom of Information Act 1982;
·	Ombudsman Act 1976;
·	Auditor-General Act 1997;
·	Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951;
·	Public Works Committee Act 1969; and
·	Mandatory Reporting of Commonwealth Contracts.
The diversity of agency function, structure and purpose, however, poses a unique challenge for broad scale contract management reform across the APS. In this regard, the Government is aware that the positive economic benefits of contract management need not be lost through excessive or unworkable administrative requirements. With this in mind, the revised production of the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines and Best Practice Guidance—February 2002 is aiming to set workable and succinct guidance for Commonwealth agency contract management. 
Recommendation 1
That the Ombudsman Act 1976 be amended to extend the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to include all government contractors.
Response: Partially Agree
The Government agrees that the Ombudsman should have jurisdiction to investigate the actions of private sector organisations that are contracted by Commonwealth agencies to provide goods and/or services to the public and will examine options for amending the Ombudsman Act 1976. 
However, the Government considers that Government contractors who provide goods and/or services to agencies rather than to the public, should not be subject to the Ombudsman's jurisdiction as members of the public would not have sufficient interest in the actions of those contractors to warrant extending the Ombudsman's jurisdiction to them.
The Government considers that the Ombudsman should ensure that agencies are informed about investigations relating to their contractors. The level of agency involvement in particular investigations will be a matter for the Ombudsman to determine, in consultation with the agency, having regard to all the circumstances.
Recommendation 2
That all CEOs under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 should, whenever claiming commercial-in-confidence, issue a certificate stating which parts of a contract and why these parts are to be withheld.
Response: Partially Agree
In line with the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines and Best Practice Guidance—February 2002 agencies are required to record decisions and the reasons for making them, and in this context, the Government does not see any further advantage in establishing a certificate system. 
The Government supports accountability in relation to government contracts and the principle that contractual arrangements should be transparent and open to public scrutiny where possible. The Government agrees that when an agency receives a request to disclose details on any contract that it has entered into, only the actual information in the contract that can legitimately be classified as commercial-in-confidence (CIC) should be classified as CIC. The Government does not support the view that commercial information is inherently confidential. Any decision to withhold information on CIC grounds needs to be fully substantiated, fundamentally stating the reasons why such information should not be disclosed.
To assist agencies with the process, the Government will be issuing further guidance material that will better clarify how agencies should assess contracts to determine what should be classified as CIC to further enhance the existing robust accountability framework. 
As a general approach the consideration of what should be CIC is normally done by assessing whether the release of information could unreasonably disadvantage the Commonwealth or a contractor and advantage their competitors in future tender processes, for example, details of commercial strategies or fee structures, details of intellectual property and other information of significant commercial value. The case by case assessment of what is CIC is appropriate as what may be assessed as CIC will vary over the life of the contract and after the contract has expired. Any documents that are produced as part of the contract can also contain information that may be classified as CIC and these need to also be assessed when an agency receives a request to release information.
The Government has agreed in principle to the Senate Order on departmental and agency contracts of 20 June 2001, which requires:
·	information to be placed on an agency's website, including details of:
·	a list of agency contracts of $100,000 or more which have been entered into by the agency which have not been fully performed or which have been entered into during the previous 12 months;
·	the contractor and the subject matter of each contract;
·	whether each contract contains provisions requiring the parties to maintain confidentiality of any of its provisions, or whether any provisions of the contract are regarded by the parties as confidential, and a statement of the reasons for confidentiality; and
·	an estimate of the cost of complying with the order.
The Government tabled a statement that compliance with the order will be based on the following terms:
·	agencies will use the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet guidelines on the scope of public interest immunity (in Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses before Parliamentary Committees) to determine whether information regarding individual contracts will be provided;
·	agencies will not disclose information if disclosure would be contrary to the Privacy Act 1988, or to other statutory secrecy provisions, or if the Commonwealth has given an undertaking to another party that the information will not be disclosed; and
·	compliance with the Senate order will be progressive as agencies covered by the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 refine arrangements and processes to meet the new requirements. 
Under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 Chief Executives are accountable for procurement decisions, including decisions on the disclosure of information. It is the responsibility of individual agencies to implement procedures for the management of their contracts, including recording decisions relating to the disclosure of information, that best suit their individual needs.
Recommendation 3
That all agencies must establish and maintain an effective contract register.
Response: Agree in principle
The Senate order on the publication of Government agency contracts, outlined in the response to Recommendation 2, requires a list of agency contracts exceeding $100,000 in value to be placed on the agency's website. The order also requires, as part of information provided in the listing, that there is an indication whether each contract contains confidential provisions and that a statement is provided giving reasons for confidentiality.
One of the more visible aspects of the accountability framework is the mandatory reporting requirement for Commonwealth agencies to publicly gazette all contracts, (with limited exceptions such as national security), with a value of $2000 or more in the Commonwealth Purchasing and Disposals Gazette (the `Gazette'). 
The Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines and Best Practice Guidance—February 2002 (CPGs) are also a key part of this accountability framework. The CPGs outline accountability and reporting requirements that govern Commonwealth procurement, including the mandatory reporting requirement. The CPGs state at page 7:
“Accountability supports agencies' business and performance management through visibility. 
Officials, departments and agencies are answerable and accountable for any plans, actions and outcomes that involve spending public monies. Agencies should include provisions in tender documentation and contracts that alert prospective providers to the public accountability requirements of the Commonwealth, including disclosure to Parliament and its Committees. 
Chief Executives are:
·	accountable for their agency's procurement performance Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 
·	authorised to issue Chief Executive's Instructions (CEIs), which may include directions to officials involved in procuring goods and services (Financial Management and Accountability Regulations 6(1) ); and
·	responsible for ensuring adequate systems for recording decisions and reasons for making them are maintained. 
Officials with procurement duties must act in accordance with their CEIs and these Guidelines.”
The responsibility for determining how to manage contracts within an agency properly belongs to the Chief Executive. It is the responsibility of individual agencies to implement procedures for the management of their contracts that best suit their individual and special needs.
Recommendation 4
That the Auditor-General conduct a review, as part of an existing or potential performance audit, of agency performance in complying with the reporting requirements of the Gazette Publishing System (GaPS).
Response: Noted
The Government notes that the ANAO has conducted a high level audit review of GaPS as part of the audit of the use of confidentiality provisions in Commonwealth contracts and issued its finding in Report No. 38: The Use of Confidentiality Provisions in Commonwealth Contracts.
Recommendation 5
The Committee reaffirms the need for the Auditor-General to have access to contractors' premises as previously stated by the Committee in Recommendation 5 of Report 368. 
Response: Agree in principle
In 2001 Finance, in conjunction with the ANAO, developed a standard ANAO access clause with a non-mandatory application for agencies' use. This clause allows ANAO access to contractor premises. 
The Government's response to JCPAA Report No. 368 was tabled in the Parliament on 8 February 2001:
Response
“The Government recognises the importance of the Auditor-General having access to information for the performance of his statutory responsibilities to the Parliament. In some cases, this will require access by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) to the premises of a contractor.
The Government's preferred approach is not to mandate obligations, through legislative or other means, to provide the Auditor-General an automatic right of access to contractors' premises. Given the diverse range of contracts in the Commonwealth sector it is unlikely that access by the Auditor-General will be required in all circumstances. Imposing a blanket right of access regardless of the circumstances would lead to unnecessary costs in the administration of contracts and the Government considers that a case by case approach is more desirable.
Commonwealth bodies are best placed to exercise the primary responsibility of ensuring that appropriate information is available to satisfy their own and external accountability and performance monitoring functions. The most suitable mechanism for these obligations to be imposed on third parties is in the contract itself. In this regard, we note that the ANAO has developed standard access clauses for inclusion in contracts. These were forwarded to agencies in September 1997.
The Government supports Commonwealth bodies including appropriate clauses in contracts as the best and most cost-effective mechanism to facilitate access by the ANAO to a contractor's premises in appropriate circumstances.
However, the Government recognises that agencies need to give greater prominence to issues of access, and the overall quality of contracts, and believes this can be achieved through a number of avenues. Commonwealth agencies covered by the FMA Act must have regard to the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance and Administration, under the Financial Management and Accountability Regulations, in respect of the procurement of property and services.”
(Senate Hansard, 8 February 2001, p.21754).
The Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines and Best Practice Guidance—February 2002 (CPGs) emphasise the importance of agencies ensuring they are able to satisfy all relevant accountability obligations, including ANAO access to records and premises. Section 1.2 of the CPGs (Accountability and Transparency), states:
“As part of their accountability responsibilities, agencies must consider, on a case-by-case basis, including a provision in contracts to enable the Australian National Audit Office access to contractors' records and premises to carry out appropriate audits. Model access clauses have been developed for agencies to tailor and where appropriate, incorporate into relevant contracts”. 
In addition to these formal measures, the ANAO might also consider the development of an information package for agencies, which gives practical examples of best practice and illustrates the benefits to agencies in negotiating appropriate provisions with their contractors. However, as an independent agency, this is a matter for the ANAO.

Commonwealth Government Response to Lost Innocents: Righting the Record
The report of the Community Affairs References Committee on child migration
The government welcomes this report by the Community Affairs References Committee as a sensitive, comprehensive and insightful appraisal of the child migration schemes and child migrants' experiences in Australia.
The government acknowledges the Committee's concerns to give former child migrants an opportunity to “tell their story” alongside the various institutions which contributed to the Senate Inquiry. Part of coming to terms with the legacy of these schemes is acknowledging both the positive and regrettable practices of the past. The government concurs with the Committee in its hope that this will contribute to the healing process for those who have conflicting or painful memories of the schemes.
The legacy of the child migration schemes must be addressed. An important and necessary follow-on from this report is that the needs of child migrants continue to be recognised by government agencies and that they receive appropriate support and assistance, as they need it. 
In responding to this report we understand that former child migrants are not a homogenous group and their needs for support or assistance may vary considerably. Some may be happily settled and not want or need assistance, some may be living abroad, or deceased. Others may have been scarred by their experiences and have suffered long-lasting effects throughout their lives. 
The Commonwealth government's focus therefore is on practical support and assistance, with a package of key measures: notably a contribution towards a new travel fund for former child migrants; maintaining funding for family tracing and counselling services; and contributing to a memorial(s) to recognise former child migrants in the Australian community. This is in response to the Committee's strong emphasis on the importance of family tracing services, counselling and public recognition of child migrants. These are key initiatives the Commonwealth can be involved in to acknowledge its past role in the schemes.
Some recommendations are clearly directed to State governments or sending and receiving agencies. The Commonwealth Government urges State governments and other agencies involved to respond in spirit and in practice to the Committee's recommendations. The Commonwealth Government looks forward to working with these agencies cooperatively and will raise these recommendations further with State governments, as well as referring the Committee's report and this response to the UK government.
Finally, it is acknowledged that State governments, receiving agencies and a variety of archival institutions have already taken steps to support child migrants in various ways and assist them to rebuild their family histories. The government considers that this report will focus efforts to build on these positive steps, (some of which are referred to in this report), and urges all organisations involved to do so. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE COMMUNITY AFFAIRS REFERENCES COMMITTEE REPORT:
LOST INNOCENTS: RIGHTING THE RECORD
RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 1
That the Commonwealth Government urge the State and Territory Governments to undertake inquiries similar to the Queensland Forde inquiry into the treatment of all children in institutional care in their respective States and Territories; and that the Senate Social Welfare Committee's 1985 inquiry be revisited so that a national perspective may be given to the issue of children in institutional care.
Government response 
The government supports this recommendation and will bring the recommendation to the attention of the Community Services Ministers Advisory Council, acknowledging that children in institutions are the primary responsibility of the States and Territories. 
The number of children in institutional/residential care has decreased markedly from approximately 27,000 in 1954 to less than 2,000 currently. Most states and territories have phased out large institutions, with the majority of residential care now provided in small facilities caring for three to eight children.  
Recommendation 2
That British and Maltese former child migrants be treated equally in accessing any of the services currently provided or as recommended in this report, including access to travel funding.
Government response 
The government supports this recommendation and agrees that former British and Maltese child migrants should be treated equally in accessing any existing or new services proposed in this response (Refer recommendations 17 and 22). 
The government, through the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, (DIMIA) has funded the Child Migrants Trust to provide counselling and family reunification services for former child migrants since 1990. Services provided by the Trust are open to both UK and Maltese former child migrants. The Trust provides support and assistance to approximately 750 UK and Maltese clients per year.
Recommendation 3
That the Commonwealth Government establish the means to accurately determine the numbers of child migrants sent to Australia during the 20th century to assist in determining the level of support services and other assistance needed for former child migrants.
Government response 
The government considers that statistics on the numbers of child migrants sent to Australia during the 20th century are unlikely to help to determine the level of support and assistance that child migrants living in Australia today might require. Child migrants are not a homogenous group in terms of their needs—some may be happily settled and not want to be identified or need assistance, some may be living abroad, or deceased. The government's focus has been, and continues to be, on addressing needs through the provision of counselling where child migrants have presented seeking support.
In terms of providing further statistical information, DIMIA provided as accurate an estimate as possible of the numbers of child migrants to Australia in its submission to the Senate inquiry. The statistics were taken from quarterly statistical bulletins published from 1947 to 1961. After 1961 these statistics were no longer published in this format and instead were aggregated with other more general migration statistics, presumably because the numbers of child migrants had declined substantially by that stage. 
DIMIA also provided post 1961 statistics, taken from various reports to Parliament recorded in Hansard over the next decade. However these reports were intermittent and did not provide exact numbers involved. In view of this, DIMIA is unable to provide more accurate historical figures than those already provided to the committee. Future focus will therefore be on identifying levels of need for services, based on those former child migrants seeking them.
Recommendation 4
That in accordance with the `Statutes of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire', the Commonwealth Government initiate the process for Francis Paul Keaney's membership of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire to be cancelled and annulled.
Government response 
The government notes the concerns expressed by some former child migrants in relation to Francis Paul Keaney and sincerely regrets the injustices and suffering that some former child migrants may have experienced in institutional care. However the precedents for cancellation of awards of British honours are based on proven criminal offences and would generally result once due appeals processes were exhausted. The serious allegations against Francis Paul Keaney have not been tested through court or appeals processes and cannot be now that he is deceased. The award of OBE ceased with his death. As a result of this, it is not possible to pursue this recommendation.
Recommendation 5
That the Commonwealth Government continue to provide funding for at least three years directly to the Child Migrants Trust to ensure that the specialised services of tracing and counselling are provided or accessible to former child migrants living throughout Australia.
Government response 
The government supports this recommendation. The government will continue to fund the Child Migrants Trust for the next three years at an amount of $125,000 plus associated administrative costs per annum.
Recommendation 6
That the Commonwealth Government urge the British Government to continue financial resources for the National Council of Voluntary Child Care Organisations (NCVCCO) for the retention and expansion of the Child Migrant Central Information Index.
Government response 
This recommendation will be brought to the attention of the British government.
Recommendation 7
That the Commonwealth Government urge all State Governments to establish a comprehensive signposting index similar to that established by the Western Australian Government.
Government response 
The government supports this recommendation and will refer it to the Community Services Ministers Advisory Council for consideration by State and Territory governments.
Recommendation 8
That the Commonwealth Government urge all State Governments to co-operate to establish a national index of child migrants.
Government response 
The government supports this recommendation and will refer it to the Community Services Ministers Advisory Council for consideration by State and Territory governments.
Recommendation 9
That the Commonwealth Government urge State and Territory Governments to publish directories of information to assist all former residents of children's institutions to access records similar to the directories published by the New South Wales and Queensland Governments.
Government response 
The government supports this recommendation and will refer it to the Community Services Ministers Advisory Council for consideration by State and Territory governments who have not published such directories. The government notes that there are already several directories in existence:
Good British Stock: child and youth migration (Barry Coldrey, National Archives of Australia 1999), which describes records held by the National Archives of Australia about child migration and provides information about how to access them;
Connecting Kin Guide to records: a guide to help people separated from their families search for their records, (NSW Department of Community Services, 1998); and 
Missing pieces: Information to assist former residents of children's institutions to access records, (Families, Youth and Community Care Queensland, 2001). 
Recommendation 10
The Committee recommends that a national group of all receiving agencies, other relevant bodies and Commonwealth and State Governments be established to develop uniform protocols for accessing records and sharing information relevant to former child migrants, their families and descendants and to coordinate services for former child migrants.
Government response 
The National Archives of Australia will raise the issue of developing uniform protocols for accessing records, coordinating services and sharing information at future meetings of the Council of Federal and State Archives (COFSTA), a national forum of government archivists. The National Archives will also promote discussion of the recommendations of the Inquiry within the archival community, which includes government and non-government archivists, to increase understanding of the issues and ways of assisting former child migrants. 
The Archives has arranged for an article on the recommendations of the Senate Committee to be published in the Bulletin of the Australian Society of Archivists, the archival professional association. The issues will also be raised in professional seminars and workshops.
The Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000 (Commonwealth) signals the Government's commitment to the principle that an individual should be able to access records about him or herself. The legislation came into effect on 21 December 2001. It grants a right to individuals to access information about themselves held by a range of non-government organisations. Although there are some exemptions to this right of access, the Government urges non-government organisations holding records about child migrants to make them available to those migrants.
As noted in Appendix 5 of the Report, the Government recognises that much has already been done in both the government and non-government spheres to assist former child migrants to access records and services.
The Commonwealth, Queensland and New South Wales Governments have published guides describing records about child migrants held in their jurisdiction and providing information about how to access them. The Western Australian government has produced the WA Former Child Migrant Referral Index which assists child migrants to that State locate relevant records. State and Commonwealth Governments actively assist former child migrants to access records and provide, or fund, a range of other services including counselling. Many receiving agencies also facilitate access by child migrants to records (see Appendix 5 of the Report).
In view of the administrative and legislative arrangements already in place and the other initiatives outlined above, the Government does not consider it necessary to establish a national group of receiving agencies, Commonwealth and State Governments and other bodies.  
Recommendation 11
That the National Archives of Australia be provided with sufficient funding to ensure continuation of the program of digitising its records relating to child migration.
Government response
The government supports this recommendation. The National Archives has recently introduced a digitisation service for archival records held in its Canberra office and there are plans to extend the service to National Archives offices throughout Australia, enhancing the accessibility of its collection for all Australians. The Archives has a proactive digitisation program targeting records for which there is high demand. 
The National Archives has already made digital copies of 34 key files relating to Catholic institutions responsible for child migrants available, in response to a recommendation made by the WA Christian Brothers' Province Archivist in her submission to the Senate Inquiry. The National Archives guide Good British Stock: child and youth migration identifies over 400 records in the Archives collection about child migration. The Archives will investigate the number of publicly available records listed in the guide that remain to be digitised, assess priorities and arrange for these records to be considered for inclusion in its digitisation program.
Recommendation 12
That the National Archives of Australia liaise with the Genealogy and Personnel Records Section of the National Archives of Canada in relation to the technology, protocols, processes and procedures the Canadians have implemented to facilitate access to their records for former child migrants and their descendants.
Government Response 
The government supports this recommendation. The National Archives of Australia is aware of a number of the activities of the National Archives of Canada concerning access to child migration records by former child migrants and their descendants and has taken these into account in developing its own policies and procedures. To ensure that the National Archives is aware of details of the technology, protocols, processes and procedures the Canadians have implemented, the National Archives has approached the Genealogy and Personnel Records Section of the National Archives of Canada as recommended by the Senate Committee. The National Archives looks forward to receiving a response and to incorporating useful approaches into its policies and procedures.
Recommendation 13
That the Commonwealth Government provide at least three year funding to those agencies engaged in dedicated tracing in the United Kingdom to assist former child migrants to locate their families, based on applications by agencies undertaking that work.
Government response 
The government agrees that supporting former child migrants to trace and locate their families in the United Kingdom is an important and practical form of assistance. However the government already does so through its funding of the Child Migrants Trust. The government has given an undertaking to continue to fund the Trust for the next 3 years (refer recommendation 5). 
Recommendation 14
That all organisations holding records pertaining to former child migrants make these records available to former child migrants or their authorised representative immediately and unconditionally.
Government response 
The government supports this recommendation in principle. The principle of an individual accessing records about him or herself is consistent with Commonwealth, State and Territory archival, privacy and freedom of information legislation and administrative arrangements.
The Archives Act 1983 (Commonwealth) provides a legally enforceable right of access to Commonwealth records over thirty years of age. The majority of records pertaining to former child migrants have now passed the thirty year mark. Where Commonwealth records contain information that is not suitable for public release under the Archives Act (for example, sensitive personal information), access is given only to the subject of the record or their authorised representative.
Commonwealth records less than thirty years of age are generally available to the subject of the record under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Commonwealth) and the Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth).
As noted in responses to recommendations 10 and 15, amendments to the Privacy Act made by the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000 (Commonwealth) grant individuals rights of access to information about themselves held by a range of non-government organisations. The amendments commenced on 21 December 2001.
Recommendation 15
That where any organisation holds primary documents, including birth certificates, relating to any living former child migrant without their express permission, former child migrants be entitled to recover that document from the holding organisation.
Government response 
The National Archives of Australia holds many primary documents relating to the interaction of individuals with government although this is more the exception than the rule in the case of child migration records. Such records would more likely be held by those organisations that exercised the role of guardian to child migrants.
The Government notes this recommendation may have differing implications for government, non-government and community organisations holding these records, (see recommendation 14), depending on the legislative framework in which these organisations operate. Recovery of documents held by State and Territory authorities is obviously a matter of consideration for those governments. In the Commonwealth context the National Archives would, in most circumstances, consider these primary documents to be Commonwealth records and therefore would need to comply with the Archives Act 1983 to transfer ownership to another party. It would not be consistent with the Archives' role as custodian of records of archival value to do this. 
As noted in response to Recommendations 10, 14 and 16, government archives are responsible for ensuring access to such records and protecting the privacy of child migrants where needed. The Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000 (Commonwealth), which came into effect on 21 December 2001, grants individuals rights of access to information about themselves held by a range of non-government organisations. 
Recommendation 16
That all sending and receiving agencies be required to extend access to their records to descendants of former child migrants.
Government response
The Government urges all receiving agencies in Australia to continue to assist descendants of former child migrants to access records and so facilitate family tracing and reunion. The Government will convey this recommendation, together with the report, to the UK Government for the information of sending agencies in the UK.
As noted in recommendation 14, Commonwealth records held by the National Archives of Australia about child migrants are already made available to former child migrants or their authorised representatives on request. Where records sought are not suitable for public release but the applicant is the subject of the file or can demonstrate a close relationship with the subject of the file or a particular need for access, the National Archives of Australia will consider granting access to that person, subject to the protection of privacy of third parties. Similar arrangements apply to State government archival records.
In the case of non-government organisations which hold records about child migrants, the Government suggests that such organisations consider allowing access by descendants provided such disclosure does not amount to a breach of any person's privacy.
Recommendation 17
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government:
	confer automatic citizenship on all former child migrants, with provision for those who do not wish to become Australian citizens to decline automatic citizenship; and
	that a special ceremony conferring citizenship be conducted for former child migrants.
Government response 
The government does not consider that automatic conferral of Australian citizenship is always in the best interests of former child migrants. Automatic conferral could have implications, for example, for a former child migrant's existing citizenship/s as well as any legal or other claims they may have overseas.
The government will, however, examine ways to fast-track applications for grant of Australian citizenship from former child migrants, and extend to Maltese former child migrants the fee exemption currently available to British former child migrants. This fee exemption for applications for grant of Australian citizenship is currently available to British former child migrants who entered Australia from the United Kingdom between 22 September 1947 and 31 December 1967. The Government believes that this is an appropriate and symbolically important concession.
The Government will arrange special citizenship ceremonies for former child migrants as appropriate.
Recommendation 18
That the Commonwealth Government urge the United Kingdom Government to extend its contribution to the Child Migrant Support Fund for at least a further three years beyond its anticipated end in 2002.
Government response 
This recommendation will be drawn to the attention of the UK Government along with other relevant recommendations. Further funding of the Child Migrant Support Fund is a matter for the UK government to consider.
Recommendation 19
That the Child Migrant Support Fund be supplemented by funding from the Australian Government, State Governments and receiving agencies; and that this funding comprise:
(a)	a Commonwealth Government contribution of $1 million per year for three years initially;
(b)	a combined contribution from State Governments of $1 million per year for three years initially; and
(c)	a contribution from receiving agencies, and that this be funded by a levy or other means on receiving agencies not currently providing travel assistance, in proportion to the number of children placed under their care as a result of the child migration schemes during the 20th century.
Government response 
As an alternative to supplementing the Child Migrant Support Fund, the government will contribute towards a new Australian travel fund for former child migrants from the UK and Malta. Further details are provided in response to Recommendation 22.
Recommendation 20
That the eligibility criteria for access to the Child Migrant Support Fund be broadened to:
(a)	permit visits to family members and other relatives, including aunts and uncles, cousins, nephews and nieces; and for other related purposes, such as visits to family graves;
(b)	be available for all former child migrants, including the Maltese and those who may have undertaken previous visits at their own expense;
(c)	provide for two further visits but with a reduced level of assistance, limited to the payment of airfares and associated travel expenses;
(d)	provide, in exceptional circumstances, travel funding for a spouse, child or other person as an accompanying carer; and
(e)	be subject to no means-testing requirements.
Government response 
Funding will be contributed by the Government towards an Australian travel fund. Funds will also be sought from State governments. Eligibility criteria will need to be determined in the context of the total pool of funds available from all sources. Refer Recommendation 22.
Recommendation 21
That the Commonwealth Government, together with other stakeholders, undertake a review of its participation in the Child Migrant Support Fund after three years to determine the adequacy of funding from Australian sources for the fund and the extent of continuing demand for travel from former child migrants.
Government response 
The government will seek data on the usage and effectiveness of the travel fund in order to monitor the efficacy of the scheme.
Recommendation 22
That, should the Child Migrant Support Fund not be extended by the United Kingdom Government, the Commonwealth Government establish a separate Australian travel scheme to assist former child migrants to visit their country of origin, and that this scheme be funded by contributions from the Commonwealth, State Governments and receiving agencies as detailed in Recommendation 19; and that the scheme have a broad set of eligibility criteria as detailed in Recommendation 20.
Government response 
The Government supports the establishment of a new Australian travel fund and will contribute $1m per year, plus associated administrative costs, for 3 years in recognition of the importance of enabling former child migrants to return to their country of origin to re-establish connections and reunite with family members. The Commonwealth will also ask State Governments and receiving agencies to contribute to the fund.
The administration of the fund will be contracted to a suitable provider, following a competitive process. The scheme will commence in the 2002-03 financial year. Former British and Maltese child migrants who arrived under approved child migration schemes and were placed in institutional care in Australia will be eligible for the scheme. 
Recommendation 23
That, to ensure that choice in counselling services remains available to former child migrants, the Commonwealth Government urge agencies and other State Welfare Departments providing counselling services to maintain those services and expand them where necessary.
Government response 
The government supports this recommendation and will refer it to the Community Services Ministers Advisory Council for consideration by State and Territory governments. Former child migrants currently have access to counselling services available in states and territories from government and non-government counselling organisations.
Recommendation 24
That the Commonwealth and State Governments in providing funding for boarding house and supported accommodation programs recognise the housing needs and requirements of former child migrants.
Government response 
The government recognises that some former child migrants may require housing assistance. The Commonwealth provides supported accommodation and related support services to help people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to achieve the maximum degree of self reliance and independence through its Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP). SAAP's goals are to resolve crisis, re-establish family links where appropriate and re-establish the capacity of clients to live independently of SAAP. The government notes that SAAP may be an appropriate response for former child migrants in crisis situations. 
The Commonwealth provides funding for housing assistance to the States and Territories through the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement (CSHA). States and Territories are responsible for service delivery under the CSHA, and provide public and community housing as well as a range of other housing assistance. The guiding principles of the CSHA specify that:
·	priority of assistance should be provided to those with the highest needs;
·	assistance should be provided on a non-discriminatory basis; and
·	housing assistance should be responsive to the needs of consumers.
Recommendation 25
That the Department of Health and Aged Care commission a study into the aged care needs of former child migrants; and that Commonwealth funding be directed into areas of need identified in that study.
Government response 
The government will ensure that Aged Care Planning Advisory Committees and Aged Care Assessment Teams are sensitised to the needs of former child migrants. The government believes that the needs of this group are adequately catered for under the aged care planning, funding and assessment processes provided by the Department of Health and Aged Care. In view of this, the government does not consider that a study of this nature is needed. 
Recommendation 26
That the Commonwealth Government urge the British Government to ensure that former child migrants living permanently in the United Kingdom are not disadvantaged in gaining access to income support payments following termination of the Social Security Agreement with the United Kingdom.
Government Response 
The government considers that in practice there is little or no likelihood of any former child migrants being disadvantaged as a result of the termination of the Social Security Agreement. The termination of the agreement made provision that all people receiving payments under the Agreement would continue to receive those payments. The UK Government has announced that it will continue to recognise periods of residence in Australia, accrued until 6 April 2001, for the purposes of claiming contributory benefits under the (former) Agreement.
It should also be noted if a former child migrant from the UK has qualified for an age pension in Australia, he or she may return to the UK and reside there, and still be paid the Australian age pension.
Means-tested income support payments (similar to Australia's social security payments) are also available to residents of the UK. Relevant Australian income support payments continue to be payable in the UK under Australian social security law (the Agreement did not affect their payment or the payment of UK pensions in Australia).
Recommendation 27
That the Commonwealth Government provide a prospective one-off grant of $10,000 to former child migrants wishing to return permanently to the United Kingdom or Malta who can prove that they will permanently relocate in those countries.
Government response 
The government is unable to support this recommendation as it poses considerable practical difficulties in terms of establishing proof of permanent relocation and ensuring that the grant is used for its intended purpose. However, should a former child migrant wish to return to the UK or Malta to live permanently, they may be able to do so through the proposed Australian travel fund. 
Recommendation 28
That the Commonwealth and State Governments widely publicise the availability of remedial education services and associated adult education courses to child migrants and child migrant organisations.
Government response 
The government supports this recommendation and will refer the recommendation through the Ministerial Council for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs for the States and Territories to act upon.
Recommendation 29
That the Commonwealth Government urge the Attorney-General of Western Australia to urgently review the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission of Western Australia Report on Limitation and Notice of Actions with a view to bringing the Western Australian law into line with other Australian jurisdictions.
Government response 
The government supports this recommendation in principle. The Attorney-General will send a copy of the Senate Committee's report to the Attorney General of Western Australia. However any change to Western Australia limitation law is a matter for Western Australia.
Recommendation 30
That the Commonwealth Government issue a formal statement acknowledging that its predecessors' promotion of the Child Migration schemes, that resulted in the removal of so many British and Maltese children to Australia, was wrong; and that the statement express deep sorrow and regret for the psychological, social and economic harm caused to the children, and the hurt and distress suffered by the children, at the hands of those who were in charge of them, particularly the children who were victims of abuse and assault.
Government Response 
The government regrets the injustices and suffering that some child migrants may have experienced as a result of past practices in relation to child migration. The government supports the Committee's emphasis on moving forward positively to concentrate on improving support and assistance for those former child migrants who may need or want such services, as noted throughout the recommendations.
Recommendation 31
That all State Governments and receiving agencies, that have not already done so, issue formal statements similar to those issued by the Western Australian and Queensland Governments and the Catholic Church and associated religious orders to former child migrants and their families for their respective roles in the child migration schemes.
Government response 
The Commonwealth government urges State governments and receiving agencies to consider the importance of this recommendation, in recognition of the hurt and distress that may have been experienced by some former child migrants as a result of former migration and institutional practices.
Recommendation 32
That the Commonwealth and State Governments, in conjunction with the receiving agencies, provide funding for the erection of a suitable memorial or memorials commemorating former child migrants, and that the appropriate form and location(s) of such a memorial or memorials be determined by consulting widely with former child migrants and their representative organisations.
Government response 
The government supports the concept of a memorial(s) to former child migrants in commemorating the contribution child migrants have made to Australia. The Commonwealth will contribute up to a total of $100,000 towards any suitable proposals for memorials initiated by State Governments in 2002-03. This funding would be distributed equally amongst those State Governments intending to establish a memorial to child migrants, and it is envisaged that those governments would seek to involve child migrants and relevant receiving agencies in determining the form and location of any such memorial. 
Recommendation 33
That the Commonwealth Government support and promote international initiatives that facilitate the sharing of professional best practice, and that ensure uniformity of protocols relating to work with former child migrants and their families.
Government response 
The government agrees that international initiatives which facilitate the sharing of professional best practice and uniformity of protocols are important. For example, this is already being done through the National Archives' approach to the National Archives of Canada (see Recommendation 12) on archival protocols and procedures, as recommended by the Committee.

"Chapman, Grant (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)",N/A,2002-05-14,"—On behalf of the President, I present a communique from the 7th National Schools Constitutional Convention, which was held at Old Parliament House from 20 to 22 March 2002. Over 116 children attended the National Schools Constitutional Convention, and the President was very pleased to accept a communique from the students at Old Parliament House on 22 March. I propose that the communique be incorporated in the Hansard so that all senators are able to read it.
The document read as follows—
Seventh National Schools Constitutional Convention
The seventh National Schools Constitutional Convention was held in the Members Dining Room, Old Parliament House on 20-22 March 2001
One hundred and sixteen student delegates from all Australian states and territories took part in the Convention organised by state and territory education authorities with funding in 2002 provided by the Department of Education Science and Training. 
The National Schools Constitutional Conventions seek to promote understanding and informed discussion amongst young Australians about the Australian Constitution and system of government. Its three main aims are:
1.	To provide an opportunity for senior students to explore constitutional issues
2.	To encourage those students Who are informed and actively interested in the Australian system of government to pursue this interest
3.	To increase student awareness of key constitutional matters.
Student delegates from every Australian school in the catholic, government and independent education sectors are given the opportunity to participate in regional and state/territory schools constitutional conventions, where they are either selected or elected to attend the National Convention.
Student delegates were welcomed to Canberra by the Hon. Simon Corbell, MLA the ACT Minister for Education and Children's Services. As part of the Convention program, delegates toured Parliament House, attended Question Time in the House of Representatives, met with Members of Parliament at afternoon tea and attended a reception at Government House. The Hon Senator Nick Minchin welcomed student delegates to Parliament House. Students also attended an Official Dinner in the Member's Dining Room and listened to a presentation by Mr Scott Hocknull, Young Australian of the Year 2002 who was the guest speaker for the evening.
The Convention was opened by Mr Arthur Townsend, Assistant Secretary, Quality Schooling Branch, Department of Education, Science and Training on behalf of the Hon. Dr Brendan Nelson. Minister for Education, Science and Training. Mr Tony Mackay, Vice President of ACSA, chaired the Convention proceedings.
The theme for the Convention was Beyond Borders and Beliefs: Governing Australia in the 2lst Century.
Convention delegates discussed two issues:
1.	Indigenous Rights: Should Indigenous Rights be spelt out in the Australian Constitution?
2.	Human Rights: Should the Constitution require Australian governments to comply with international treaties, once Australia is a party to them?
Parliamentarians Aden Ridgeway (Australian Democrats, Marise Payne (Liberal Party) and Tania Plibersek (Australian Labor Party) participated in an introductory panel session related to the Indigenous Rights issue. Mr Peter Buckskin was also in attendance. Panel members spoke for 10 minutes and Mr Ridgeway and Mr Buckskin responded to student delegate's questions.
Professor Cheryl Saunders, AO, Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies, University of Melbourne, Mr. Tjaart Steyn, First Secretary, South African High Commission and Mr Jack Waterford, Editor-in-Chief of The Canberra Times participated in an introductory panel session related to the Human Rights issue. Panel members spoke for 10 minutes and the panel responded to student delegate's questions.
At the conclusion of the Convention, the Hon Senator Margaret Reid accepted the Communique to convey to the Prime Minister and the Commonwealth Parliament.
The conclusions of the Convention on the two issues were as follows.
Beyond Borders and Beliefs: Governing Australia in the 21st Century
Issue 1. Indigenous Rights: Should Indigenous Rights be spelt out in the Australian Constitution?
1. A clear majority of convention delegates supported the following.
·	That Section 25 be removed from the Constitution
·	That the rights of indigenous Australians should be acknowledged but not specifically protected.
·	That a preamble to the Constitution should recognise the original occupation of Australia by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their cultures.
·	That there was an over-riding need to address indigenous rights outside the Constitution through improved education, national leadership, and the promotion of public debate and collective action on these issues.
2. In response to the question `Should indigenous rights have specific protection?' the conclusions of the Convention were as follows
·	The majority of delegates considered that indigenous rights should not have specific protection within the Constitution
The reasons for the majority adopting this position included that:
·	any rights statement should apply to all Australian including all minority groups such as indigenous peoples and that the singling out of one group could be discriminatory 
·	the identification of specific rights for indigenous Australians could be divisive
·	efforts would be better directed towards addressing social inequalities faced by indigenous Australians than towards trying to protect indigenous rights
·	rights were already implied or addressed in current legislation
·	A significant minority considered that whilst basic rights for everyone should be protected, there were some rights of critical importance to indigenous Australians that should also be given specific protection.
3. In response to the question `what indigenous rights if any should have specific protection?' the conclusions of the Convention were as follows:
The significant minority who felt that some rights of indigenous Australians should be given specific protection suggested that these rights could include:
·	those pertaining to linguistic, ethnic and cultural characteristics and identities
·	the right to manage their own affairs1 and be supported in this
·	a right to claim Native Title
·	an acknowledgment of customary laws
·	an acknowledgment of traditional custodianship of land
4. In response to the question `Should specific protection of indigenous rights be provided through the Constitution and should these be justiciable?' the conclusions of the Convention were as follows:
·	The majority of delegates considered that the use of a preamble to the Constitution to give symbolic expression to indigenous rights was preferable to spelling out rights in the Constitution as being non-justiciable
·	A significant minority of delegates considered that a Treaty provided a better means for gaining expression of the rights of indigenous Australians
·	A significant minority of delegates considered that both a Treaty and a Preamble provided the best means for gaining expression of the rights of indigenous Australians
·	A significant minority of delegates considered that neither a Treaty nor a Preamble should be used as a means for gaining expression of the rights of indigenous Australians, preferring social action and legislation as the means to bringing about the required outcomes.
Issue 2. Human Rights: Should the Constitution require Australian governments to comply with international treaties, once Australia is a party to them?
1. In response to the question `Should the Constitution require the Parliament to approve some or all international treaties, before Australia finally becomes a party to them and if so what Treaties?' the conclusions of the Convention were as follows.
·	A clear majority of convention delegates supported the proposition that the Constitution require the Parliament to approve some, but not all, international treaties, before Australia finally becomes a party to them.
·	Within this clear majority the category of Treaty requiring Parliamentary approval was variously described as those relating to Human Rights and those with clear legislative and/or budgetary implications.
·	The category of Treaty to be approved by Executive Council rather than requiring Parliamentary approval was mainly described. as technical, administrative or executive2 in nature.
·	A minority view was expressed that the Executive Council should continue to approve all Treaties.
2. In response to the question `Should the Constitution provide that some or all treaties automatically come into effect once Australia is bound by them?' the conclusions of the Convention were as follows.
·	A clear majority of convention delegates supported the proposition that Treaties described as technical, administrative or executive in nature should be self executing.
·	A clear majority of convention delegates supported the proposition that Treaties relating to Human Rights and those with clear legislative/budgetary implications should
·	require Parliamentary approval and
·	simultaneously come into effect and where necessary require legislative action.
·	A significant minority view was that no Treaties should automatically come into effect, but all Treaties should be scrutinised by Parliament.
·	A minority view was that the current arrangements whereby Treaties are ratified by the Executive Council do not require any automatic legislative/Parliarnentary obligations.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-05-14,"—I move:
That the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Regulations 2001 (No. 1), as contained in Statutory Rules 2001 No. 248 and made under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, be disallowed.
These regulations are at the core of the government's expensive, bureaucratic and disenfranchising electoral enrolment witnessing regime and, accordingly, the opposition is moving to disallow them. The regulations are misguided and they are not needed. The Auditor-General has recently examined the integrity of the electoral roll. His report was released on 18 April this year. Mr Barrett found that the electoral roll is not abuser-friendly; it is more than 96 per cent accurate and is of `high integrity'. Further, he found:
 ... that internal AEC procedures to ensure roll security and to prevent tampering with roll data were robust and effective.
Australians are among the most mobile people in the world, with a high level of internal migration which translates into high levels of enrolment change. Given the normal delays in updating enrolments, a roll that is over 96 per cent accurate at any one time is a significant achievement. The Australian National Audit Office further data-matched the electoral roll to Medicare's residence records and found a more than 99 per cent match. The Electoral Commissioner, Mr Andy Becker, said in a press release on 19 April:
The report states emphatically that the electoral roll can be relied on for electoral purposes, which I believe confirms the AEC's and community's longstanding view on the reliability of the roll.
So why does Senator Abetz—after the electoral roll has received the tick of approval from no less than the Commonwealth Auditor-General—want to continue to mess around with enrolment forms? The new regime is intended to apply to all new enrolments and transfers of enrolment. It is a very big change to the enrolment system and will affect over three million people a year. An applicant for enrolment or transfer of enrolment will have to find a witness from a certain class of people, with the classes described by their employment. New enrolments will also have to show the witness a prescribed original form of ID.
To make such a change, one would think that the government would be reasonably sure that its new system would actually stop enrolment fraud and that people would not be disenfranchised. Unfortunately, the fact is that the government has ignored advice from experts that its proposed system will not stop fraud. Alarmingly, the government appears to have also ignored advice as to the disenfranchising effect of its proposed electoral enrolment scheme.
—Why do you protect rorters?
—The opposition strongly believes that the integrity of electoral enrolment can only be assured if all Australians can easily get onto the roll, if the roll is secure and if electoral fraud is deterred. These matters are equally important: enrolment has to be fair and the electoral roll has to be safe.
The opposition, of course, is moving to disallow the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Regulations for one principal reason: these regulations will not improve the integrity of the roll. In fact, they are going to have the opposite effect. They will not stop fraudulent enrolment but they will stop honest enrolment. Senator Abetz put out a statement a few weeks ago—it sank without trace of course—in which he said that this disallowance motion was being run on budget day because Labor was trying to hide from its past. 
—Exactly right.
—Senator Abetz, when the Senate only has 21 sitting days in the space of nine months—in the face of chronic chamber mismanagement from you and your colleagues—it is amazing that we get any chance at all, frankly, to debate a disallowance motion. I want to say this about the matters that Senator Abetz is interjecting about: we are not proud of the revelations of the Shepherdson inquiry—
—Well, then, do something about it.
—but we have cleaned out the rorters in Queensland. Premier Beattie did an excellent job in that and it was one reason why he was absolutely overwhelmingly re-elected last year. The fact is that Senator Abetz's regulations would not prevent the Ehrmann affair from happening again. The AEC says so. In fact, what Senator Abetz proposes will create a whole new set of problems—quite deliberate on his part. The government has trumpeted the regulations as a major weapon against enrolment fraud. The government says that requiring a person enrolling to show their ID to a witness is so logical and so simple that it is just unarguable. There are three very big holes right in the middle of this government's logic. Firstly, the AEC has no way of checking that a witness falls into the prescribed classes of witnesses. The classes of witnesses are defined by their employment and the AEC does not have a database of employment. I asked the AEC to advise on that very point, and I would like to indicate what the response of the AEC was.

—Tonight the Treasurer is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 2002-03.
Madam President, the past year has again reminded us all that world events can move dangerously and unpredictably.
Last year when the Treasurer delivered the Budget we did not know that four months later our world would change in such a devastating way. 
The terrorist attacks of 11 September shocked us all and showed that terrorism can strike even the most powerful of nations. We cannot take our security for granted. Tonight the Treasurer will announce measures to upgrade Australia's security and to secure Australia's borders.
But developments in other parts of the world do not just affect our physical security. They can affect our economic security as well. Through last year country after country fell into recession. The events of 11 September made things worse. Our trading partners—Japan, the United States and Europe— all turned down. Australia found itself in a very difficult economic environment. 
We were not untouched by the global slowdown. But tonight the Treasurer can report to the House that Australia is strong. Other countries went into recession but our economy grew.
The hard work of the last six years helped to shield our country and keep people in work. It gave us the capacity to respond swiftly with measures to stimulate the economy like the additional First Home Owners Grant. It allowed us to respond swiftly with a major contribution to the War Against Terrorism.
But we must continue strong economic policy if we want to be able to respond to the unpredictable events of the future. Strong economic policy has been the hallmark of this government. By the end of this coming financial year we will have paid off $61 billion of the Labor Government's debt. Our Budget for the year is in surplus, a surplus of $2.1 billion. 
The Budget will lay out a programme, not always easy, but fair, to sustain important health and welfare services into the future.
And this year we will fund measures to upgrade security, to secure our borders, to strengthen our defence forces and deliver all of the Government's election commitments in full, on time, on budget.
Strong defence
Madam President, last year the Treasurer announced the largest and most comprehensive upgrade of our defence capabilities for any Australian government in over 25 years. Under that plan set out in a White Paper an additional $1 billion is included in the 2002-03 defence Budget. But, the Government has added to that programme to fund the deployment of Australian troops in the War Against Terrorism.
The deployments are being carried out as part of our contributions to the US-led operation against international terrorism and the Gulf blockade in support of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. They involve around 1,100 Australian Defence Force personnel and comprise land, sea and air operations. The initial deployment includes:
·	an Australian special forces task group and other personnel participating in operations in Afghanistan against the Taliban and Al Qaida networks;
·	a naval task group of an amphibious landing ship (until mid 2002) and a frigate, and the continued presence of a guided missile frigate in the Persian Gulf to support the Multinational Maritime Interception Force; and
·	an Air Force deployment of B707 tanker aircraft to support air-to-air refuelling operations and F/A-18 aircraft deployed to Diego Garcia until mid 2002 to support air defence of coalition forces.
The composition of the deployment is subject to strategic requirements and is continuously under review.
The additional funding over the base funding and over the White Paper for this deployment in 2001-02 and 2002-03 is around $524 million.
Upgrading domestic security 
But as we have seen terror and crime can also strike at home. The Government's first responsibility is to defend our citizens and our national security assets. We must do it in a careful way hoping for the best, but preparing against the worst. In this Budget we are allocating an additional $1.3 billion over five years to upgrade security within Australia. 
Australia's airport security will be upgraded. Armed, plain clothed, Australian Protective Service officers now travel on selected flights. Additional Australian Protective Service officers provide heightened security at Australia's airports with enhanced capacity for detecting explosives.
The Budget provides an additional $539 million to the Australian Federal Police, Australian Protective Service and Australian intelligence agencies to assist in identifying potential security threats. There will be increased screening of imported goods, enhanced cooperation with overseas law enforcement agencies, and improvements in screening arriving and departing international passengers.
The Government is also investing in the development of leading edge technology that has the potential to significantly improve passport verification processes. If successfully developed, a biometric identifier could record individual features on a magnetic strip on passports and provide distinctive matching for that individual at airports and other points of entry. This will be funded by an increase in the Passport Fee.
The Government will be improving the secure communications system of the Department of Defence and taking measures to protect our critical information infrastructure from attack.
The Government will double the Australian Federal Police strike team capability, allowing for the rapid deployment of more than 200 federal agents around Australia dealing with crimes such as terrorism and politically motivated violence.
We will establish a permanent Australian Defence Force Tactical Assault Group on the east coast of Australia, to supplement the existing group on the west coast. The Tactical Assault Group is a special forces unit with specialist counter-terrorist training, including hostage recovery.
And we will establish within the Australian Defence Force a permanent Incident Response Regiment. This will be a highly trained group able to respond to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive incidents. To support our capacity to respond to such an incident—one we hope will never occur—the Government has also authorised a national stockpile of chemical antidotes and vaccines.
Securing Australia's borders
Madame President, Australia operates a substantial immigration programme which in the coming year will offer permanent migration places at a base level of 105,000 places. In addition we offer around 12,000 places under the humanitarian category for refugees. This is one of the largest offshore humanitarian programmes of any country in the world.
But to maintain the integrity of that programme humanitarian places should be reserved for those assessed as genuine refugees and those that have complied with Australia's offshore processing arrangements. The Government does not intend to allow people smugglers to determine the intake under this programme. 
Last Budget we proposed spending $1,635 million over five years on border security. The measures we have taken since, together with the measures the Treasurer is announcing tonight, will increase that expenditure to $2,872 million.
This will include $219 million to construct and maintain a purpose built Reception and Processing Centre on Christmas Island which will allow downsizing of other centres at Curtin and Woomera. The Government has allowed $455 million over the next four years for receiving and processing asylum seekers at the new facility on Christmas Island and, if necessary Cocos Island.
Madame President, the Government has decided to double National Marine Unit surveillance, it has increased Coast Watch surveillance, and it has allocated additional funding to the Australian Defence Force to patrol Australia's northern waters to deter unauthorised boat arrivals.
Madame President, it is also important to take steps to reduce the flow of unauthorised immigrants to these Australian waters. To this end, the Government has committed $75 million to fighting people smuggling and unauthorised migration through the interception of unauthorised migrants in transit countries. 
·	The Government is increasing the capacity of authorities and international organisations in transit countries to detect and intercept illegal people movement.
·	The Government is also increasing support to international organisations, such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration, for the detention, processing and subsequent removal of people in transit countries.
There is evidence that these comprehensive measures are showing results.
In August last year arrival numbers surged, with some 1,212 arriving in the first three weeks alone.
Since the introduction of the Government's strategy to secure our borders, there has been a dramatic slowdown in unauthorised arrivals. There have been no unauthorised boat arrivals to Australia since December 2001.
Intergenerational report
Madame President, tonight, as part of the Budget, the Treasurer is releasing the landmark Intergenerational Report. This is the first report of its kind and the first time any attempt has been made in the Budget to look across the generations and identify the challenges which lie ahead for our society and our governments. What challenges will our children and their children have to confront in forty years time? What shape will Australia's finances be in 2042 based on current policies? And what should we do now to prepare for the generations ahead?
One of the big changes to our society will be that the number of older people will increase, and with falling birthrates, the number of younger ones will not grow. The ratio of old to young in our society will increase.
The increase in medical science will make more and more treatments available and prolong our capacity to live longer.
Our strong Budget position means we are better placed than most other advanced societies to cope with these changes. But we must start now to put in place measures which will sustain a decent health system and aged care system into the future. If we ignore moderate changes now the challenges will only get greater, the decisions will get harder, and the solutions will slip outside our grasp.
Making the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme more sustainable
The cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is growing rapidly as medical science improves and we have a greater ability to treat more conditions. Since 1991 the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has nearly quadrupled from $1.2 billion to $4.2 billion. The Intergenerational Report projects that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme could be the most significant area of pressure in the health budget and in forty years time grow to around $60 billion in today's dollars.
So the Government is taking some small steps to help put the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on a more sustainable basis so it can deliver access to medicines at affordable prices over the longer term. These measures will ensure that consumers, industry, doctors and pharmacists all contribute to containing the rate of increase in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
From 1 August this year, co-payments for concession cardholders such as pensioners and Seniors Health cardholders will rise by $1 to $4.60 and co-payments for others will rise by $6.20 to $28.60 per prescription. While a concession cardholder will only pay $4.60 for a prescription this is only a small part of the cost of many Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines.
·	Humulin NPH, widely used in the treatment of insulin dependent diabetes costs $229.13 per prescription.
·	Avonex, a drug used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis costs $1,090.81 per prescription. A patient on this drug would normally take 13 prescriptions per year.
·	Zyban, used for the treatment of nicotine addiction, costs $238.85 per prescription. 
New drugs with high costs are coming on to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme all the time.  
Notwithstanding the cost of the prescription the co-payment will only be $4.60 for concession cardholders.
Safety net arrangements will continue to protect people who need a large number of medicines. Consistent with the current arrangements, once concession cardholders have paid for 52 Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prescriptions in the year, they will receive further Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines free for the rest of the year. Non concession cardholders who pay $874.90 in a year for their Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines will be eligible for further PBS medicines at the concessional rate for the rest of the year.
The Government is also introducing changes to ensure Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines are used appropriately.
·	Doctors will be required to provide additional information about patient eligibility when they seek approval to prescribe particular drugs.
·	The pharmaceutical industry will provide information about prescribing restrictions directly to doctors through the network of medical representatives employed by the industry.
·	The Government will undertake discussions with individual manufacturers of generic medicines to secure a price reduction for products they have listed on the PBS. This price reduction will be in return for the Government facilitating greater use of generic medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
·	The Government will also introduce further initiatives to identify and target fraud in the PBS system.
By making the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme more sustainable, the Government can continue to fund the listing of new, highly effective, but expensive medicines.
Assisting job seekers
Madam President, the Government has a policy of equipping our young in the best possible way for the workforce. That is why we invested in improving literacy and numeracy in the education system. That is why we revived the apprenticeship system. And in this Budget we will focus that further with an extra incentive of $750 to employers willing to take on a new apprentice while he or she is still at school, and a bonus of $750 to keep them after they have completed Year 12.
We will offer an incentive of $1,100 to employers to take on a new apprentice in information technology. For mature age people we will offer training assistance of up to $500 to attain basic skills in computers and information technology. One of the great barriers for mature age workers getting into the workforce is lack of computer skills. This training will be available to 11,500 people each year.
Our policy is to encourage people to get job ready so that as the growing economy creates more jobs, they have the chance to get those jobs and move into the mainstream of the Australian workforce.
The Government's Work for the Dole Scheme has been a very successful programme to develop work skills. At a cost of $81.5 million over three years we will fund 8,500 additional Work for the Dole places.
Next steps in welfare reform
Madam President, in last year's Budget the Treasurer announced a major programme to reform our welfare system called Australians Working Together.
We want to take the next steps in this programme. There are many people who are out of work and on a Disability Support Pension who have no support or encouragement to get back into employment. Since 1990, the number on Disability Support Pensions has doubled.
We want to take measures to encourage those who are capable of work, including part time work of more than 15 hours a week, to get back into the workforce. This will improve their esteem and self-reliance. At present eligibility for Disability Support Pension is assessed as the incapacity to work 30 hours per week. This will be reduced to 15 hours. Disability Support Pension rates and the means test are unchanged. 
To provide people with greater opportunity to improve their work capacity 73,000 new training and work programme places will be created for those who are currently on Disability Support Pensions. This will cost additional money, but in giving people access to these services it is expected more people will re-enter the workforce and in the longer term it will save the taxpayer. 
This new measure will apply to all new Disability Support Pension applicants from 1 July 2003. Those currently on Disability Support Pension (except those severely disabled with no work capacity or those who are within five years of Age Pension age) will be assessed under the new criteria within five years of implementation.
The Government will continue its commitment to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged citizens in our society. A new five year Commonwealth State Disability Agreement is proposed with the Commonwealth providing the States an extra $547.5 million over five years for unmet need. This Agreement funds the States and Territories to deliver Specialist disability services such as accommodation, community support and respite. This means the Commonwealth will allocate $2.7 billion to the new Agreement—$743 million more than the previous Agreement.
For their part, the States and Territories must at least match the Commonwealth's increase, including increases already announced in our disability employment services. They must also provide better accountability, quality, efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of their services. Over the same five year period the Commonwealth intends to spend another $2 billion in support of its responsibilities for employment support for people with disabilities.
Supporting Australian families
When Labor left office the home mortgage interest rate was 10½ per cent. Today it is 4¼ percentage points lower. Low interest rates have supported Australian families giving them reductions on their mortgage repayments and helping them to make ends meet. 
The First Home Owners Scheme has helped many young Australians to buy their first home. This grant which continues at $7,000 from 1 July will help thousands of young Australians buy a house for the first time. These grants are expected to total $784 million in 2002-03.
And the Government is going to introduce new measures to help those starting a family. This is in addition to the higher payments of Family Tax Benefits which were introduced back in July 2000.
One of the financial pressures facing those who are starting a family is that they generally lose their second income as the mother goes out of the workforce to have the child. Our baby bonus is going to allow mothers who are out of the workforce with their first child to claim back tax they paid while they were in the workforce. The amount they can claim is up to $2,500 per year for five years depending on the amount of tax they have paid before leaving the workforce. There is a minimum payment of $500 per year for five years for low income parents.
It is expected that around 245,000 families will benefit from this initiative in the first year with 600,000 Australian families eventually benefiting.
Madam President, we also know that access to health services is a major concern for families—particularly the families in the outer suburbs of our major cities.
That is why the Government has a plan to encourage an additional 150 doctors to work in the outer-metropolitan areas of the six State capital cities. Under this plan, doctors who agree to work in a designated outer-metropolitan area and register on an alternative pathway to achieve vocational registration will be eligible for higher Medicare rebates. Specialist trainees will be able to access Medicare provider numbers if they work in outer-metropolitan areas. In addition, doctors in the `general stream' of the GP vocational training programme will undertake a supervised placement in an outer-metropolitan area. This is an $80 million plan for more doctors for the families of the outer suburbs of our major cities.
And we want to make our public places safer for our children. So the Government will fund a strategy for the introduction of retractable needle and syringe technology into Australia. This means that exposed needles cannot be left lying around in public places or anywhere else where children are at risk from needle stick injuries. 
Health care in the regions
In the Budget two years ago the Treasurer announced a Regional Health Package designed to make a practical difference in improving health services to the regions and the bush. This year we want to add some additional practical, on the ground, services in regional Australia.
We want to build six new facilities, outside the capital cities, to improve patient access to radiation oncology services. A programme of $72.7 million over four years to do this will include training staff to international best practice to operate these local services.
Another of the services that needs improvement in rural areas is the provision for aged care. Older Australians do not want to move away from their local communities in their twilight years. This Budget has a programme to upgrade or replace high care homes in rural, remote and urban fringe areas and also includes funding to encourage more people to take up aged care nursing with 250 aged care nursing scholarships at rural and regional university campuses.
Better care for older Australians
Our Intergenerational Report shows that aged care will require increasing attention as the proportion of older people in the community increases. Again this year there are new measures—$654 million over four years—to provide better care for older Australians.
·	Subsidies for residential aged care will be increased to allow better pay rates to be offered to aged care nurses so providers can attract and retain more aged care nurses.
The Government's aged care policy is, whenever possible, to improve and expand community care services to enable older Australians to choose to stay at home and live as independently as possible in the community.
·	The Government will provide an additional 6,000 Community Aged Care Packages over four years. These packages are tailored to meet the needs of frail older Australians who want to remain in their own homes, and can do so if they receive home help, laundry, meals and bathing.
·	The Government will also provide funding to support the carers of older Australians, carers of people with dementia, and ageing carers of people with disabilities.
This Budget will also aim to improve the standard of palliative care offered in the community. Funding of $55 million over four years will be provided for better coordination between hospital and community care; improved education and further support for general practitioners and other health professionals in palliative care; and further assistance for families of people who choose to spend their final years in their home setting.
Veterans
Madame President, over the years this Government has taken major decisions to recognise the contribution made by our veterans. Tonight, we want to go further. The Government is extending eligibility for the war veterans' Gold Card (which provides comprehensive free health care) to Australian veterans aged 70 years and over who have qualifying service from post World War II conflicts.
In this Budget we are introducing twice-yearly indexation of the ceiling rate of the Income Support Supplement for War Widows. The ceiling rate will be increased by the same percentage as the age or service pension. This increase in income support for our war widows is expected to cost $85 million over four years. 
Sustainable revenues
The Budget surplus announced tonight has not required any major new tax initiatives nor an increase in the overall tax burden. The Government's tax reforms have secured the tax base, proving one of the keys to the strengthening of Australia's economic foundations. 
The Government remains committed to its tax reform strategies and will press ahead with the business tax reform agenda, including a review of international tax arrangements.
Economic outlook
The Australian economy is expected to continue its strong performance in the year ahead, with robust economic growth of around 3¾ per cent forecast for 2002-03. This is higher than forecast growth for any of the major developed (G7) economies of the world and reflects Australia's sound economic fundamentals.
Business investment is expected to grow very strongly in 2002-03, to be a key driver of overall economic growth. Household consumption is also expected to remain strong.
In line with the outlook for robust economic growth, the unemployment rate is forecast to decline gradually to 6 per cent in the June quarter of 2003. An unemployment rate below 6 per cent would be achievable over the next couple of years, provided that economic growth remains strong and progress is maintained on labour market and welfare reforms. Since the Government came to office over 900,000 jobs have been created in the Australian economy. We expect over one million jobs to have been created by Christmas.
With only moderate increases in wage costs and continued strong productivity growth, inflation is expected to be around 2¾ per cent in 2002-03 and 2½ per cent by the June quarter 2003, within the medium-term inflation target band. Largely reflecting the strength of the domestic economy, the current account deficit is expected to increase slightly to around 4 per cent of GDP, which is below the average over the 1990s.
Concluding comments
Madame President, the last year has been difficult in an uncertain world, with a global economic downturn. But Australia has emerged much stronger than comparable countries.
This Budget is designed to meet the continuing challenges of today, and to project forward so we can set ourselves a path that will address the challenges of the future.
This is a Budget to keep Australia safe, our borders secure, and to keep our economy strong.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-05-14,"—In the adjournment debate tonight I wish to speak on a matter relating to the National Gallery of Australia. But, before I do, I want to take this opportunity to pay my respects and express my condolence to the family of Ruth Cracknell, a great Australian who unfortunately passed away last night. I do not think there would be anyone on any side of politics in this chamber who would not want, at an appropriate stage over the next few days, to pay tribute to this great Australian. She was not only an outstanding actress but also an outstanding contributor to Australian society over her long distinguished life in Australian acting. Without being too provocative, I have to say that, though the Senate today paid a tribute to the passing of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, I believe that Ruth Cracknell's contribution to Australian society far outweighed the contribution by the Queen Mother, who was a citizen of another country.
I now turn to the National Gallery issue. From November 1997, Senator Kate Lundy and I, in the Senate estimates committee, had raised issues about the administration of the art gallery. Those issues dealt particularly with the operation of the airconditioning system and the complaints made by staff. It was a tedious and, at times—even for me— boring process, but it seemed to me, from the information I had received from a number of former employees of the gallery, that they had a substantial case to put to the gallery that was not being answered through the normal procedures. I am reminded, seeing Senator Boswell here, of the attitude he and I took when dealing with the COT cases of Telstra, and I took a similar one here. There seemed to be a case that only the estimates committee could raise and force some answers.
Through all of this, I placed many questions on notice. I spent hours questioning Mr Kennedy and other senior staff. At times I got answers I was not satisfied with and at times the written answers were not satisfactory, but I kept pushing on. I have to pay tribute here to former employees Brian Cropp and Bruce Ford, who quite openly provided me with information and background on many of the questions I asked.
Earlier this year, on 20 April, an article written by Alan Ramsey appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald. His Saturday column went on at great length about how I had been obsessed and unfair in questioning Mr Kennedy and asked what I was doing. He said that I had the temerity to call Dr Kennedy `Mr Kennedy', that I had made snide remarks and generally had not performed well at the estimates committee. He did have the courtesy to ring me before he published the story. I did point out to him, because he was unaware of it, that only a month earlier Comcare Australia, in an investigation into the sacking of Brian Cropp, found that the National Gallery of Australia had contravened section 76 of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1991 and recommended that procedures change in the gallery so that what happened to Mr Cropp would not happen to any other employee who had the temerity to question process and management issues to do with the health and safety of not only the staff but also the many visitors who go to our pre-eminent gallery. Mr Ramsey in his article made no mention of the fact that the Comcare investigator had found that the gallery had breached the act in the way it had forced Mr Cropp out of his job. 
I take this opportunity of the adjournment debate—the first opportunity since the article appeared—to put the record straight. I certainly will be asking further questions of the gallery at estimates in June about what they are doing to compensate Mr Cropp for being dismissed and forced out of an occupation at the gallery. For the record, I will read a section of the report. I will also seek leave at the end of my remarks to table this report, and I have checked with the various whips and they will give me leave to do so. The conclusion of the report into Mr Cropp's dismissal by the independent investigator appointed by Comcare reads:
Conclusion
All the evidence suggests that Mr Cropp would have been able to perform the duties of the fittest position as it related to the HDAC—
that is, the airconditioning system—
in a technically competent manner. The question then arises: is Mr Cropp being excluded from the position because he complained about the safety of the systems or because his conduct suggested that he may not carry out his duties objectively? Given the evidence on the other matters above, it is difficult to conclude that only Mr Cropp's objectivity was in issue.
Overall conclusions
As indicated above, in my view, the onus falls on the NGA to show that the reason Mr Cropp was unsuccessful for the position was not for the reason that he complained about the health, safety or welfare of employees at work. I do not consider that that onus has been discharged.
The report, and I will not read it all, concludes:
I conclude—
that is, the investigator—
that the NGA has contravened section 76 of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1991 by prejudicially altering Mr Cropp's position as an NGA employee by not appointing him as the recommended applicant to the permanent position with the NGA because he had complained about a matter concerning the health, safety and welfare of employees at work, namely the state of the NGA's heating, ventilation and airconditioning systems. The NGA, of course, is not subject to prosecution or penalty under the provisions of section 76 of the act.
There are then a number of recommendations made in the report to ensure that the NGA does not again act pre-emptively against Mr Cropp's activities. 
Mr Cropp is in the best traditions of a whistleblower. He was concerned about the safety and health of the employees and he was concerned about the safety and health of all the people who visit the gallery, and because of that they forced him out of the job. It is now up to the National Gallery of Australia to invite Mr Cropp back to the job he applied for or, if that is not available, to offer some other suitable recompense to Mr Cropp for the loss of his job and the indignity that he has suffered. I only hope that Mr Ramsey has the courtesy to report again, now that I am tabling these reports on Mr Cropp's dismissal. 
I also want to mention that a further Comcare report, from the end of last year, found:
The National Gallery of Australia had breached section 16 of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1991 by failing to take all reasonable practical steps to protect the health and safety at work of the employees.
So there are two breaches by the National Gallery of Australia of a Commonwealth act. If ever there is evidence that justifies the questions Senator Lundy and I asked at estimates over 3½ years, Comcare has proven that we were right. Comcare has proven that the estimates committee is the last place left standing when all other measures have been exhausted and when individuals cannot get justice.
This is a great defence of the estimates committee. Whether we are in opposition or government, the operation of the Senate estimates committee may be, in my view, the greatest thing that justifies the existence of the Senate itself. And here again I am very proud of the fact that I kept asking the questions. Mr Ramsay failed to mention that in February this year I went to the Senate estimates on Comcare and put the pressure, I have to say, on the head of Comcare. He agreed that a further broader inquiry into the management of safety and health issues at the gallery would be conducted. That inquiry is now under way, I think conducted by Mr Wray. I look forward to that report becoming available. 
Above all else, I call on the government to ask the gallery board and its director to take action to stop the mismanagement that has been going on that is affecting the reputation and standing of the pre-eminent art gallery of Australia. All of us who have asked questions at estimates have never questioned the artistic merit of the director or of the gallery board or its acquisitions policy. We have only questioned whether the management and the processes are fair to the employees and to the Australian people. I seek leave to table these two reports.

ASIO provides protective security advice to the Commonwealth Government. This includes electronic surveillance countermeasures advice and action. 
The Department of Defence is able to test equipment for unintentional electro-magnetic transmissions. In addition, technical countermeasures teams test for transmissions as part of their everyday activities. They search for any trans-missions within the radio frequency (RF) spectrum and then determine whether the signals detected are a threat to the area under test.
