"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-09-16,"—I want to make some remarks about the ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2003 and related bill following on from my colleague Senator Ridgeway, whose second reading amendment, which has gladly passed the Senate, calls on the government to allocate grants for the automotive industry based on criteria that encourage the motor industry to develop, manufacture and market vehicles which have a lesser impact on the environment and on health.
I want to draw on the evidence of the Productivity Commission statistics that came out a little while ago. Those statistics show that the automotive manufacturing industry is the most heavily government subsidised industry in this country and currently receives around $560 million of taxpayer money every year. Some of that comes from the states and some of it is provided for very good reasons. We do need an auto industry in this country, so I am not complaining about that, but I think it is a very sad situation that, with all that industry assistance, we do not do anything by way of encouraging the production of vehicles that are energy efficient or which operate on clean alternative fuels.
The Democrats have for some time been critical of the fact that governments, both state and federal, have not leaned more on the auto industry to produce those cars. In fact, in a sense we have gone in the opposite direction. The industry tells me that Australians are not interested in fuel efficiency. This happened when I went to see the Holden E Commodore a couple of years ago. The engineers proudly showed me this hybrid petrol-electric vehicle which could have been put on the production line within a fairly short time frame and which would not have cost all that much in changes to the production line, but they are not going to produce it because, they say, Australians are not interested in fuel efficiency. That vehicle is being used as a demonstration model for component parts and is being taken around the world and shown to numerous people. So, instead of us producing this vehicle in this country, it is just there as some sort of showpiece.
The reason for this is partly that our petrol is still relatively cheap by OECD standards—I am sure many people will disagree with that, but it is the case that this government stopped indexing petrol taxes a couple of years ago—and that our vehicles are not promoted for their fuel efficiency ratings. I did a quick web site search of Ford, Holden and Toyota yesterday, looking for fuel efficiency data—cars are required to have a fuel efficiency rating on them at the point of sale—but in fact I could not find anything at all from Holden or Toyota. Ford has a kind of cost-saving calculator, if you like, for its dedicated LPG utes. But, for all the need to cut greenhouse emissions and to cut toxic emissions from vehicles, we have not managed to get it across to the manufacturers that this ought to be something that they use as an argument to sell their vehicles. In fact, the efficiency does not appear anywhere. It is very difficult to find out how many litres you need to drive 100 kilometres, which is the measure we use for efficiency. So it is very disappointing. Our auto industry, particularly in comparison with industries in other countries, is way behind the eight ball in promoting fuel efficient vehicles and in developing and manufacturing them. 
I think people are interested in more environmentally sound vehicles, but there does need to be leadership. We do need to have encouragement for many of them to go down that path. Yesterday Senator Minchin asked why we were interested in environment and not focused on safety, for instance. Nobody could disagree with the argument that we should be focused on safety, but we have made enormous gains in safety over the last two decades. Airbags have saved countless lives, better roads have saved lives and cutting down on drink-driving has saved lives. We have put an enormous effort into road safety, but we have done practically nothing about fuel efficiency. Whilst it is very good for our economy and for the thousands of Australian workers who are employed in the auto industry, and whilst it is good that millions of dollars are generated in exports every year, this is very short term if we do not look at fuel efficiency and alternative fuels in particular, because other countries are doing it. Australia is way behind the eight ball if it is going to sit back and say, `Our niche market is to manufacture very large cars for export to the Middle East, and we do not need to worry about fuel efficiency.'
It is time that the government, when allocating money to industry, applied some sort of criteria. Otherwise we are essentially handing over a blank cheque to industry in the hope that they will stay in this country for the sake of jobs. We believe that those criteria should not only require industry to be environmentally and socially responsible but also encourage industries to be innovative and to develop as a world leader in whatever field it is that they are working in. 
I think most Australians are well aware of the environmental impacts that result from pollution from cars. Every litre of fuel from a conventional motor produces 2.438 kilograms of carbon dioxide. Whilst that does not sound an awful lot, when you consider that three tanks of unleaded petrol produces a quarter of a tonne of CO2 the contribution from the average household towards greenhouse gas emissions from auto transport alone is very significant. We know that our cities suffer enormously from the exhausts from vehicles and we have in this country one of the highest asthma rates in the world for children under the age of 12. That is a symptom of the degree to which our air is clean or not clean. I do not think it is good policy to just accept that cars pollute and let that be the end of it. Auto manufacturers have developed a number of prototype models, as I just said, to demonstrate that cleaner cars are possible to manufacture, but all too often those cars do not make it to the showroom floor—they are not available to people.
I have a Toyota Prius as my electorate car and that achieves an efficiency rating, on very short trips for most of the time, of 5.4 litres per hundred kilometres. That is roughly a third to a half of what another car that size would produce. Before this car I had a car that used compressed natural gas, but I did not get another because it was almost impossible to refuel that vehicle. There are so few refuelling stations around—there was only one in Melbourne that I could access—that it was not convenient. While we do not have the refuelling sites we will not have people buying these cars and there will be no encouragement for the auto manufacturers to make them. We really have to look at the whole cycle and make sure that those facilities are available.
As I said earlier, the E Commodore is a hybrid vehicle. It is a bigger vehicle than the Toyota Prius but it can cut emissions by more than half that of a normal Commodore and still have the same performance level. That car remains a prototype. It is a great piece of engineering and a great idea but it is sitting there because we do not put pressure on Holden or any other auto manufacturer to go into production. I am sure they do not necessarily want to do that, and maybe there are other incentives governments should offer. For instance, they could use their purchasing power to say that 20 per cent of government fleets would purchase this vehicle. I think that would be a very good incentive for getting those cars off the production line. There are many ways in which we could use the tax system in order to encourage people to buy such vehicles. So rather than just having a bucket of money that goes to keeping those auto companies in this country we ought to be looking at more innovative ways of making sure that what they make is in our interests. 
A couple of the ideas that we could adopt are flexible registration charges for low emission vehicles, particularly for the corporate sector, and mandating that large companies of a certain size and operating in certain urban areas acquire minimum numbers of low emission vehicles. We could, as I said, establish government purchasing policy to require the acquisition of efficient vehicles by government departments. We could mandate large fuel companies to install minimum quotas of bowsers distributing alternative fuel at petrol stations—just to make sure that consumers like me do not get discouraged because there is only one refuelling place and it is in an awkward location for me personally. We could also look at implementing rebates for individuals who choose to purchase these efficient vehicles—similar to the rebates offered by state governments for the installation of solar hot-water systems. 
They are just some of the ideas that we could adopt and I strongly encourage the government to act on Senator Ridgeway's second reading amendment. I hope the government do not just put it aside as being some loopy idea that the Democrats might have in this place but that they really take on this issue of fuel efficiency in our cars and make sure that our industry is gearing up to be much cleaner, with cars in this country producing much lower greenhouse emissions.",SENATE,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-16,"—I move the amendment now circulated for the Australian Greens which is an amendment to—
 (Senator Watson)—Your amendment is to the second bill, not the first bill which we are debating at the moment.
—Thank you. I will flag that and I will follow on from what Senator Allison has just been telling us. The Greens have this amendment, which I flagged last night, coming down the line to the next bill which is complementary to this one. It is to ensure that the taxation on—
—I rise on a point of order. We are being treated to these extraordinary remarks on a second reading speech delivered in a committee stage on a bill. It is now proposed that we discuss a foreshadowed amendment on another bill. I propose that if that is the view being put to us we actually deal with the bill before the chair. Then we can raise these matters directly relating to the amendment in the appropriate place.
—The Senate is dealing with a bill and Senator Brown has deferred his comments in relation to the amendment but he still wishes to speak to the bill before the chair.
—There is no amendment before the chair. 
—There is a question before the chair, which Senator Brown is entitled to respond to.
—I remind the honourable Senator Carr that we are in committee. We are past the second reading and we are now in committee. That might help him to sort it out. Now we have that straight, I will continue. There is very great concern amongst people who are looking at the automobile industry and its impact on the environment. It is a major producer of greenhouse gases and carcinogens—that is, cancer causing agents—in the great cities of the world, including the Australian cities. Their concern is that much more be done to reduce the pollution coming from motor vehicles. But there is a contradiction here between the public impulse to buy bigger and more gas guzzling vehicles and the public wish that vehicles be leaner, cleaner and not a greater impediment to the environment. Opinion polls show that in the United States and I guess it is exactly the same here.
Senator Allison has been putting forward to the committee—and I hope the government was listening—a series of measures which ought to be taken up by the government in the absence of any real indication from this government that it understands the environmental impact nearly as well as the public in Australia does. I look forward to a response from the minister to the proposals Senator Allison has put forward and to the definitive proposal I have brought forward to the committee today and which I notice Senator Carr will be considering between now and when it is properly debated during the presentation of the next bill.",SENATE,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2003-09-16,"—I will respond briefly. As I understand it, we are dealing with the ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2003 and not with the Customs Tariff Amendment (ACIS) Bill 2003 to which Senator Brown has proposed an amendment. Dealing with the first bill, the ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2003, I do not have a lot to add to the remarks I made last night in my second reading contribution with respect to the second reading amendment moved by the Democrats in relation to environmental matters. I take the opportunity, however, to rebut some of the rather negative comments about the Australian car industry. I think it has done an enormous amount to produce more environmentally friendly fuel efficient vehicles in recent years. It should be applauded for the steps it has taken to produce much more fuel efficient vehicles rather than be criticised. 
I pick up the point Senator Brown made about the public's attitude. The point is that an industry like this must be responsive to consumers. That is how capitalism works. You produce products which the consumer wants and if consumers want to buy fuel efficient vehicles there are plenty available for sale and they can purchase them and there is no disincentive to that activity whatsoever. If the public want to buy these vehicles then there are plenty on the market for them to purchase.
I point out that, by the substantial reduction in tax we have brought about in relation to motor vehicles by removing the wholesale sales tax and replacing it with the GST, motor vehicles are now much cheaper and more affordable. There is no doubt, and it ought to be recognised, that new motor vehicles are infinitely more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly than old vehicles. One of the problems in Australia has been the age of the motor vehicle fleet. Everyone understands that older vehicles going back 10, 15 or 20 years are much more fuel inefficient than modern vehicles. The newer the fleet, the less fuel inefficiency and the greater the fuel efficiency; so the more people we can get into newer vehicles the better it is for the environment. 
That is why, if I may foreshadow some remarks I might make in relation to Senator Brown's amendment, making cars more expensive, which is what Senator Brown wants to do, is completely contrary to the interests of ensuring more fuel efficient vehicles on our roads. The newer vehicles are so much more fuel efficient, using much better engine technology and much lighter materials, that we want to do everything we can to encourage Australians to be in newer, more fuel efficient vehicles. That is one of the reasons we foreshadow our rejection of the forthcoming amendment. I do want to acknowledge how much the car industry has done in this country to improve the fuel efficiency of its vehicles, working closely with the government. Everything we can do to enable Australians to have newer vehicles which are not only more fuel efficient but a lot safer will produce the objectives the Democrats and the Greens quite properly see. It is obviously a good objective to have much more fuel efficient vehicles on the road. We want to work with the industry but at the end of the day it is a matter for consumers. If they want to buy those vehicles there are plenty on the market for them to buy and the industry will be responsive to that demand.",SENATE,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-09-16,"—I do not want to delay this debate but I do need to respond to Senator Minchin. It is not the case that you can buy in this country a hybrid vehicle—petrol-electric vehicle—which has been manufactured here. The Toyota Prius comes from Japan. We do not have vehicles made in this country that are easily purchasable by consumers. A consumer may wish to have a very fuel efficient car. I am not just talking here about engine technology—of course engine technology right around the world has improved energy efficiency; there is no question about that. But the advances are marginal. They are not huge leaps forward, like a 50 per cent or more saving on a car that is otherwise not of that technology. We are talking here about massive leaps in efficiency.
As I said earlier, I had a quick look at web sites last night and had a look at differences in different countries. The US has the Energy Policy Act 1999 that requires federal, state and fuel provider fleets to acquire alternative fuelled vehicles. The result of that is that when you look at the General Motors web site you can see that there are dozens of cars on the market just for natural gas, for instance. I counted 12 vehicles that roll off the production line that run on natural gas. They are both more fuel efficient and cleaner than other vehicles. If you look at ethanol, General Motors Holden makes six vehicles that run on ethanol. That is a mix of 85 per cent ethanol. We do not do that in this country and it is not because consumers have collectively said to themselves, `We do not want to buy fuel efficient vehicles.' It is because we do not have government leadership that encourages the manufacture of them here. It is pure and simple. You cannot blame consumers and say, `Consumers want to buy big cars, big gas guzzlers—they are not interested in fuel efficiency,' if you do not ask them and if you do not give them choices. This government is supposed to be about choices. We hear a lot about choice and how important that is for consumers, but consumers are not being given the choice. I drive my Prius gladly; I love this car and feel proud that it is saving fossil fuels and that it is good for the environment—but it is a very expensive car. It is $40,000 before on-road costs.
Ordinary people do not have that choice—that is equivalent to an expensive, medium-size car by any measure—whereas if we were manufacturing them here, if Holden had its ECOmmodore on the production line, it would be within the reach of ordinary Australians. So I do not think Senator Minchin can say that it is consumers who are driving the move to stay with big cars and they still are. Plenty of people are buying small cars—that is true—and cars are, generally speaking, getting more fuel efficient, but they are also using more energy with electronic windows and various airconditioning and other comforts and features in cars. Those all use up energy. So it is not quite as clear-cut as he is suggesting. So we really need to look at the incentives that are offered in other countries in order to provide that leadership to shift people to vehicles which are in everybody's interest for them to drive. 
Bill agreed to.

These amendments increase the tariff on off-road four-wheel drives coming into the country—sports utility vehicles, as they are called in the United States—to 15 per cent, the same as other passenger cars coming into Australia. Most of these vehicles come into the country, although some are being produced here now. The problem is that they are the new and exciting edge of motor vehicle transport but they have much more of an impact on the environment than the cars that Senator Allison has just been talking about. Environmentally, they are shockers: they are gas guzzlers and quite dangerous as far as pedestrians and small cars, if they are in a smash, are concerned—although the figures have yet to come in on the relative impact on road safety of the big bumper-bar-led four-wheel drives that we are seeing so much in the cities now. It is worth noting that of the people who buy them only 10 per cent do get to go off road. The intention as an off-road vehicle has been lost in the glamour of the advertising of these lucrative sales items for the big car companies.
It is interesting to see exactly what is driving the switch to the off-road vehicles. I notice that Arnold Schwarzenegger has five and Mike Tyson has four. I am indebted to Gary Young, writing in the Age on Monday, 19 May for his reference to Harper's Magazine in the United States. The article in the Age states:
... as pick-up trucks and off-road vehicles shed some of their redneck image and started to become popular with suburban professionals, the car industry saw its chance. “Detroit marketers began to identify a new class of driver ... a pleasure-seeking, self-oriented man or woman who liked to drive fast, cared deeply about a car's appearance, had an above-average fear of road dangers (including crime), and wasn't exactly eager to advertise his or her married status.” At the root of it was sex.
It is interesting that this has led to quite a controversy in the United States, with people lined up on both sides. These vehicles have been branded the `axles of evil' and they are ticketed in their millions and attracting bumper stickers from the owners in retaliation to environmental bumper stickers in the United States, saying, for example, `As a matter of fact, I do own the road,' and `I'm changing the environment. Ask me how.' Evangelist Jerry Falwell was much upset by the evangelical environment network, which launched a campaign asking, `What would Jesus drive?' That brought a tirade back to them, some pointing out that he had 12 disciples, so it would be a Humvee—it would be a big one! Evangelist Jerry Falwell, who believes that global warming does not exist because `God would not let that happen', is in favour of these vehicles. 
Without divine guidance on the matter here today, though, we have got to use our commonsense. Commonsense says that these vehicles are, quite contrary to what Senator Minchin was saying, gas guzzlers and polluters. The bigger of these vehicles use 20 litres per 100 kilometres compared to the average car using half that. Senator Allison was pointing out that her environmentally efficient car uses half that again—down to five litres per 100 kilometres, a quarter of what the big gas guzzlers use. Yet the government is saying, `We will import these at a 10 per cent reduction. Actually, it is a two-thirds reduction in the tariff: instead of 15 per cent, we will allow it at five per cent.' In the old days that was so that there would not be a tariff on farmers and people out in the bush who use these off the road genuinely as part of their business. My amendments cover them and allow them to keep that advantage.
But now 90 per cent of people do not even go off road in these vehicles. Whether it is Nissan, Toyota or Mitsubishi, they are being pushed on the television. As an environmentalist, I might say that some of the ads they have are absolutely appalling—ripping up, in particular, the arid and the alpine wild country of Australia as an example of what not to do if you really care for this country. Some of the advertising agencies show mud spattered all over these vehicles after they have been through pristine rivers and creeks and across snowfields and out onto the edges of sandstone valleys. That is an absolutely appalling indictment of the advertisers and the car makers, who should hang their heads in shame at wishing to rip up the Australian wilderness, and wildlife underneath, in this fashion.
Let's have some fairness here. If people are going to buy these gas guzzlers they will pollute the environment almost in equal inefficiency—that is, the more gas you burn, the more you pollute the environment, the worse it is for global warming and the worse it is in terms of the air breathed in by citizens in big cities. I might add that there is not much escape if you go to diesel because that brings out the cancer-causing particles. One estimate I saw some years ago was that, for example, 300 people a year in Melbourne were getting cancer from the exhaust of diesel vehicles. It is 10,000 people a year in the UK. Let them not get a tax break. Let the taxpayers not be funding the four-wheel drive vehicles. If people want to pay for them, then certainly let them pay for them, but let the incentive go to the more environmentally sound passenger cars that we are more used to and that most people buy, and not to the big polluters.
It is, as I said, an enormous debate that is occurring around the world but, as Senator Allison said, in this country there is apparently a complete absence of recognition by the government that it is actually giving a tax break to an environmental nasty. If you are going to give a tax break in the year 2003, you give it to those vehicles which have the environmental edge. I ask: does the minister believe in global warming? Does he think it is happening? I ask: does the minister think it is smart to be giving city folk a tax break on vehicles like this as against much more environmentally sound vehicles? If you were looking at a $50,000 vehicle, there is a $5,000 tax break over and above what you would get if you were buying a conventional sedan. Finally, I would like to know what the minister thinks about the 25 per cent tax barrier that the United States has got, as far as Australian produced vehicles of this ilk are concerned? Does he not think that Australia should at least catch up by going in the same direction? ",SENATE,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2003-09-16,"—I would like to place on record that the government will oppose these amendments. We do so for a variety of reasons. Could I first point out that this package of bills has been developed in very close consultation with the Australian car industry and they are designed to ensure a robust future for our industry and those who work in it. And I would make the point, particularly for the benefit of the opposition, that the Australian car industry did not seek these amendments. This was not part of what you might call the log of claims made by the Australian car industry on the government as to the future Australian car industry plan. They did not seek a tariff increase on the importation of four-wheel drive vehicles. So, in agreeing to this, we would be doing something that the industry itself has not sought from the government.
Secondly, I would refute the proposition, which is not based on fact, that we are talking about a whole bunch of gas guzzling vehicles. I do not think Senator Brown is aware of the nature of the four-wheel drive vehicles that are imported and sold in this country. I would point out to Senator Brown that the top-selling four-wheel drive in the last calendar year, 2002, was the Honda CRV. This is a 2½ litre four-cylinder car which actually uses less fuel than the Australian-made passenger cars which are typically bought by Australian families. It uses less fuel and it is the top-selling car. Seventy-five per cent of the classification `sports utility vehicles' that are sold here, which are four-wheel drives, are compact or medium-sized vehicles. It is a myth to suggest that every four-wheel drive sold in this country is a Toyota Land Cruiser or a Nissan Patrol, or whatever other vehicle Senator Brown may have in mind. Indeed, if he is genuinely concerned about seeing more fuel efficient or fewer gas guzzling cars, he would be promoting the sale of small- and medium-sized four-wheel drive vehicles because they use less fuel than Australian-made six-cylinder and eight-cylinder family cars. So I do not understand what this amendment is about at all.
I also make the point in passing that there are many Australians who have as much love for the Australian bush and the Australian environment as Senator Brown, and the best way and probably the only way that they can experience and enjoy it is by seeing it in a four-wheel drive vehicle. Indeed, in July I took my 12-year-old son up the Strzelecki Track in South Australia to show him the wonder and beauty of the Cooper Creek, which is one of the most magnificent pieces of Australian bush and Australian environment. You can only go up the Strzelecki Track in a four-wheel drive, which we did. When I got to Innamincka there were lots of ordinary Australians who love the Australian bush and the Australian environment in four-wheel drives because that is the only way they can experience it and enjoy it and express their love for the Australian bush.
Senator Brown's proposition that is before us means that those Australians who love the environment just as much as he does should pay anything up to $5,000 more in tax on the vehicle they buy. What he is proposing is a 10 per cent increase in tax on the four-wheel drive vehicles that Australians need if they are to experience the wonders that Australia has to offer. So Australian families under Senator Brown will pay $3,000, $4,000 or $5,000 more in tax on the vehicles that they need to enjoy the Australian environment. That is the message that should come out today: that the Greens in the guise of Senator Brown are proposing to tax Australians another 10 per cent on their vehicles—$3,000, $4,000 or $5,000—if they want to enjoy the Australian environment by going to areas, like I did in July, that you cannot get to without a four-wheel drive. So we strongly reject these amendments. 
In terms of the differential in tariff, under this package of measures, that will be gradually phased out by the alignment of the tariff on four-wheel drives and passenger motor vehicles. I would remind Senator Brown of what I said last night—that is, the whole tariff regime was established to protect the infant Australian car industry from imports for a certain period of time until it could get on its feet. Four-wheel drives were not included in that, because the Australian industry has not made four-wheel drives. It is only latterly, now, that they are looking at the question of producing four-wheel drives but doing so clearly on the basis of the existing regime of tariff—that is, a five per cent tariff for that industry. They believe that they can successfully and commercially produce four-wheel drives at that level of tariff. They have not sought, as I said at the outset, any increase in that tariff assistance, so we strongly reject these proposed amendments.
 (Senator Watson)—Senator Brown, I have raised the question of the constitutionality of your amendments. The advice that I have received is that your amendments would have the effect of increasing taxation. The Senate may not do by way of amendment that which it may not do by way of initiating its own bill. This has the effect of that. Section 53 of the Constitution, Senator Brown, prevents a bill imposing taxation being initiated by the Senate. That is the effect if your amendments were to be successful. The increase in taxation is the same as the imposition of tax and therefore, Senator Brown, as a result, your amendments would be unconstitutional. I suggest that you do not proceed with them.",SENATE,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-16,"—That is not my advice, Mr Temporary Chairman, and I suggest that you take advice.
—I have.
—I suggest that you take advice from the President on the matter before you declare the procedure as improper. We are dealing with a tariff here rather than a tax as such. I would be quite happy to move that the Senate await a ruling on that before we proceed.
—I have given you a ruling, Senator Brown, referring to Odgers' Australian Senate Practice, chapter 13 `Financial Legislation' and we have had that checked by two independent authorities from the Clerk's office.
—I disagree with the ruling and I will therefore write such.
—Very well, Senator Brown. I am telling you the consequences of your amendment but you can proceed if you want to.
—I certainly will, but I am flagging a disagreement with your ruling until we have further advice on it. Let me go back to Senator Minchin's statement of `the Greens in the guise of Senator Brown'. I am here as a Green and I accept Senator Minchin as a government and Liberal Party senator and I hope he gets the same respect from across the chamber. When it comes to families, what he was talking about is bunkum. I referred to the fact that only some 10 per cent of people do get off the road in their vehicles, so we are dealing with the 90 per cent of people whom he did not meet at Innamincka. I also want to draw his attention to the fact that, even if you do take all the four-wheel drives into account, 80 per cent of Australians are buying conventional sedans. They are families and they are the people that this government is punishing with an extra $5,000 impost. That is the way that it goes. This government is penalising families because it is not giving them the same tariff break when it comes to imported— 
—Yes. Senator Minchin is caught by his own argument there. He is penalising families that do not have four-wheel drive vehicles—which is most of them. I would have thought that he would have thought better than that. When it comes to the car industry, I advise him to consult with them as to whether they think they would do better making four-wheel drives in Australia with a five per cent tariff on imported vehicles than they would with a 15 per cent tariff on imported vehicles, which is what this move would mean. Of course, that is nonsense. It would be in the interests of the Australian car industry to have this tariff matter fixed up. It will help to protect jobs. It will help to protect the industry itself and, as I have indicated, it will certainly help the environment at least while we are in this phase where most of these vehicles are being imported.",SENATE,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-09-16,"—The opposition will not be supporting these proposals. I want to indicate to Senator Brown the reasons for that. I draw his attention to the note that he gave me—and I appreciate him providing me with the advice that he has been given from the Parliamentary Library. It said, `This amendment can be achieved but it is very complex because of the style used in the customs tariff.'
—All I can do is read from the advice I have been given by Senator Brown and I do appreciate the courtesy that he has extended to me. I trust that he will continue that courtesy by letting me finish reading the advice.
—I'm protecting the library. There is a note on it.
—I see. Let me just say that a note has been provided to me that indicates that this amendment can be achieved but it is very complex because of the style used in the customs tariff. It says, `It may be possible to draft a simple but rough global amendment but that can lead to uncertainty,' and so it goes on. It strikes me, on the basis of the material that Senator Brown has provided, that there are serious questions raised about the appropriateness of this amendment. Further, given the advice from the clerks in regard to the legality of the proposed amendments, I would put a view to the Senate that this is not the appropriate time or place to pursue that.
I would like to address some of the political issues involved. They go to the appropriateness of these amendments outside the technical requirements. There is no doubt that this package has been put together with considerable consultation within the industry. There are, in my view, mixed feelings about the effectiveness of this package and I indicated those concerns in my remarks in the second reading debate. The opposition is not satisfied with this package but we do recognise that there is widespread support within the industry for the adoption of these measures as they are. We were concerned specifically about the relationship between the tariff reduction and the industry assistance and we are not satisfied with the government's assurances on that score. What we are satisfied with though is that the major manufacturers, including the component manufacturers—people that employ 30,000 Australians—have put a strong view to us on this. 
Furthermore, the representative of those 30,000 Australians, the union, has also put a view to us. While not accepting the tariff reduction, it has indicated to us that the financial support provided to the industry in regard to the ACIS component is worthy of support. Clearly, there is within that, despite the differences, an element of consensus about the need for industry assistance for this particular industry. I want to emphasise this. The employment of 30,000 Australians on a relatively high wage, by and large, in highly skilled jobs is something that the Labor opposition strongly supports.
This is an industry of great strategic importance to the economy and to our society. I suggest, Senator Brown, if there had been an opportunity perhaps to spend some more time with workers in the industry, you might actually appreciate a bit more some of their concerns about these questions. I do not share Senator Minchin's view about the nature of the capitalist economy in this matter, because clearly this is an example where, without this industry assistance, there would be a very strong example of market failure. That is why we are doing this.
Without the assistance that we are providing here, I think the industry itself may well be in serious difficulty. There has been substantial change in the industry, and this industry assistance package is seeking to shape that behaviour—a measure that we also support. What we do not support, however, are willy-nilly propositions that come up late in the day without proper discussion and without proper examination of the impacts on the industry as a whole. The economics of this industry are very, very important to us and they are very, very important to 30,000 Australians who get direct employment in this industry. I also suggest they are very important to a whole range of other industries that rely upon the success of this industry.
This industry is doing extremely well at the moment. There is no doubt about that. I say that that is a product of the Button plan of some years ago. This is the fruition of that plan. But the fact remains that, by industry standards, the industry is going through prosperous times. It has to be acknowledged that the sports utility vehicle component of the market is growing—increasing at six per cent or thereabouts per annum, as I understand it. Recently, on visits to Ford and Holden in Melbourne, I was given the benefit of a briefing on the market research that both those companies are producing. One of the reasons they are putting to me for the increase in this particular component of the industry is that it actually caters to social need—a perception of social need, it may well be argued. Nonetheless, for a large number of Australian families, these particular vehicles are said to be very important. It may be that many of them do not actually leave the road. The fact is that they are not always bought to leave the road. They are bought for a whole lot of other reasons to do with people's perceptions about the benefits of those vehicles, including their perceptions about safety, their perceptions about the capacity to actually see the road, their perceptions about mobility, their perceptions about getting the kids to and from the football, the netball or the soccer and their perceptions about the convenience of these vehicles. The reason they are one of the fastest growing segments of the market is that they do meet people's views of where they see themselves.
Equally, it is said that people are a bit embarrassed about driving these vehicles, so there is a movement away towards different styles of vehicles that do these particular jobs. With that in mind, the local manufacturers are now putting onto the market an Australian made SUV. I understand that Holden, if they have not released it already, are about to release theirs. Ford are releasing theirs—the Territory, I think it is called—and I have had the privilege of actually having a look over it. It is a very, very good vehicle, and it has been specially designed. I think at Ford in Melbourne they have 600 design engineers. They are using that skill for export capacity, and they have come up with a vehicle which they believe will be very popular here. It is constructed in Australia by Australian engineers and with Australian innovative techniques. It is designed to meet a particular need in this country and to be of great export value. It strikes me that, in those circumstances, with the industrial planning that has gone into the construction of that vehicle and the market planning that has gone into that vehicle on these premises, it is not for us to intervene at this stage in the debate, willy-nilly, without consultation either with workers in the industry or with management in the industry, and to propose changes such as we are seeing here today. 
I trust that the vehicle industry does do well. I do think that there have been considerable improvements in its fuel efficiency, its safety record and its capacity to actually meet the needs of Australians in a whole range of areas. I trust that it continues to do well, but it will not do well if we, in a knee-jerk way, propose amendments of doubtful constitutional validity, of dubious legal capacity and, finally, which simply do not meet the economics of the industry as it currently exists. For those reasons, I think this is perhaps a bridge too far, Senator Brown. While I appreciate the benefits of doing these particular jobs on a broadcast day and explaining the great benefits of the green credentials of the Greens, as the Democrats have done, it is not a good way to intervene in industry policy.",SENATE,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2003-09-16,"—I will not take up a lot of time. I just want to express the view of the Democrats to the amendments put forward by Senator Brown. People may recall that last night during the second reading debate I made it clear that the Democrats support the continuation of the ACIS scheme and the accompanying bill. We want to make clear through our amendment that we are seeking to look at ways of having the industry invest in environmentally sound research and development, and we are seeking some support, particularly from the government, to ensure that those investments continue to occur by leadership from government. I am at a loss to understand some of the logic of what it is that Senator Brown's amendments are trying to achieve, certainly from the perspective of looking at environmental outcomes. It becomes a little bit difficult when you put forward amendments that not only talk about increasing tax but look at the question of making concessions for farmers. What does that achieve at the end of the day?
It seems the only thing that is being achieved is that perhaps we are applying a tariff to sex, as Senator Brown originally spoke about, but from the notes that were provided by Senator Brown to the crossbench senators and the opposition it was made very clear that it was very complex to be putting forward these types of amendments and that they would be put forward in a rough, global amendment that could lead to uncertainty. Then, of course, there was the uncertainty in relation to specified industries such as agriculture and mining. We understand that, given the size and nature of the Australian industry, much of what may be sought will happen abroad as opposed to here. Quite frankly, at the end of the day, if we are talking about trying to deal with four-wheel drives themselves and their production, it is really a question of comparing their full impact with at least the larger family sedans that are also being produced in terms of their fuel efficiency and their effect upon the environment. 
This issue was not brought forward by industry or environmental groups during the Productivity Commission inquiry. Under the circumstances, the Democrats thought that it was appropriate that the bill be sent off to a committee for inquiry, and it was dealt with appropriately. The industry made it clear that they supported the passage of the bills. There was no call from industry to adjust the tariffs on four-wheel drive vehicles, and we accept their reasons for not doing so. One would have thought that, if there were an increase in tariffs, it would have been lucrative for them and it would have protected Australian industry. But they did not seem to express that concern. In the submissions that were received, no views were put forward by environmental groups about this issue. Having said that, the issue of same treatment of tariffs on vehicles has been Democrat policy for many years.
I agree with the broader proposition that Senator Brown has put forward. For that reason alone we will support the Greens amendments, but I do want to raise the issue of the way they were brought forward. I believe they were ill thought out. There has not been enough comparative research done on fuel efficiency and harm to the environment with respect to other types of vehicles that are produced domestically. There is also the issue of constitutionality, which was raised by the chair. We accept that, and it does raise some perplexing problems.",SENATE,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-16,"—It has been an interesting debate, and I thank all those who have taken part. I note that the amendments do not have the support of the majority of the chamber, particularly the government and the opposition, so I will not proceed with them. I seek leave to withdraw the amendments.
Leave granted.
—I will come back on this matter. It is not good enough for the chamber to call the debate short at this point for the reasons that Senator Ridgeway, Senator Carr and Senator Minchin have given. This is an important matter. We are talking about a major slice of the vehicle industry in Australia. Senator Minchin has at least said: `I do what the car industry asks of me. If they don't mention something, I don't know about it or I'm not going to support it.' As Senator Carr said, that is the way the government proceeds. But we have to be able to think for ourselves about what is good for Australians and Australia in this matter. The proposal by the Greens would have given parity to the average car buyer in Australia and there would have been no disadvantage to people who buy imported four-wheel drives. That is the first thing.
The second thing is that logically—it does not matter which side of the chamber you are sitting on—it must be advantageous to the industry in Australia to have 15 per cent protection, albeit diminishing according to the formula for other passenger vehicles, rather than the five per cent impost on imported vehicles. That absolutely assists the industry with respect to jobs and vehicles made in Australia. There is no logic that says otherwise. It is good for jobs in the Australian industry, and it is also good for the environment. Senator Minchin was quite wrong when he said that four-wheel drive vehicles in Australia are more energy efficient than the sedans that Australians will buy as an alternative. In the main, that is not the case in Australia, it is not the case in the United States and it is not the case anywhere in the world. Senator Minchin should go back and look at the books on that matter. 
The Greens are prepared to get into this debate. We do know what we are talking about. We have seen the world literature on this. We have taken into consideration what is good for the Australian industry as well as for the Australian environment. That is why this amendment has been moved. Next time we come back with an amendment like this I hope the various spokespeople will be a little more informed. I am sure there will be some comment from the industry, and I can guarantee you that it will not be negative.
Bill agreed to.
ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2003 and Customs Tariff Amendment (ACIS) Bill 2003 reported without amendment; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-16,"—The opposition is ready and willing to proceed with this package of bills: the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003, the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 and the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003. However, we do have a second reading amendment. If that is not ready by the time I conclude my speech, then I will ask one of my colleagues to move it later in the debate. 
This is the fourth time that the Senate has debated these bills, and we have to give the Liberal government full marks for persistence, if nothing else. The first of these bills reduces the superannuation surcharge tax rate on high-income earners. That is an inequitable measure, even in the government's own terms. The second bill introduces the low-income earner co-contribution scheme—a scheme not without problems. Nonetheless, it has considerably greater merit than an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners. Labor supports the co-contribution measures, subject to certain amendments, but Labor does not support the exclusive tax cut for high-income earners, the so-called surcharge. The tax reduction would benefit only a relatively small number of working Australians—less than five per cent and a relatively well-off group.  
I deal firstly with the reduction in the superannuation surcharge tax rate. The initial tax reduction was proposed to be 15 per cent, down to 10.5 per cent over three years. Amendments will be moved in the committee stage to vary that from 15 per cent to 12.5 per cent. Nevertheless, even with the change this is a highly inequitable tax reduction, which provides an exclusive tax cut to less than five per cent of Australian workers—that is, those with incomes greater than $94,691 taxable income, with the highest tax reduction going to those earning more than $114,981. If your income is less than $94,691, there is no tax cut. Yet this is the same Liberal government, which now wants to reduce the so-called surcharge tax, that introduced it in 1996 on of all grounds that of equity. Of course, in introducing that surcharge tax the Liberal government blatantly broke their 1996 election promise not to introduce any new taxes or increase existing taxes. In February 1996, Mr Howard, on behalf of the Liberal Party, promised:
We are not going to increase existing taxes and we're not going to introduce new ones.
That was a straightforward promise, which the Liberal government broke just six months later by announcing a new tax on superannuation, the so-called surcharge applying to higher income earners. As I mentioned earlier, when introducing the surcharge tax, the Liberal government justified it as an equity measure—a fairness measure. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, in his budget speech on 20 August 1996, stated:
The measures I am announcing tonight are designed to make superannuation fairer. 
A major deficiency of the current system is that tax benefits for superannuation are overwhelmingly biased in favour of high income earners. For a person on the top tax rate, superannuation is a 33 percentage point tax concession while a person earning $20,000 receives a 5 percentage point tax concession. High income earners can take added advantage through salary sacrifice arrangements that are not available to lower income earners. 
The Government is remedying this situation. 
	...	...	...
For high income earners the superannuation contributions will still be highly concessional but are more in line with concessions to middle and low income earners.
Mr Costello went even further in his support for this measure when he announced a `one and all' in his Budget speech on 27 August 1996 by stating:
... the point I'd like to make is that on Budget night the first Treasurer in history—me—stood up and put a surcharge in respect to high income earners and applied it to himself and every other politician, you know, we're the good guys in relation to this.
Yet now, along with other high-income earners the Treasurer and his colleagues, including Senator Coonan who will deal with this bill, will benefit substantially from this exclusive tax cut to the tune of at least $1,000 for each individual member of parliament and tens of thousands of dollars over their parliamentary careers. This is because of the type of defined benefit fund that politicians enjoy. I make the point: I did not make politicians' superannuation the issue with respect to the surcharge tax; Mr Costello did when he boasted about how he was applying it to himself when he introduced it. Yet here today we have the government proposing an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners which benefits all politicians. I now call on government members who plan to speak on this bill to disclose the individual benefit they will receive from this exclusive tax cut.  
As I said earlier, Labor opposes an exclusive tax cut on superannuation. Hopefully, there will be no benefit to any parliamentarian as a result of this proposal—or any other high-income earner for that matter. I am sure those who are following this debate will want to know if the government will rule out this outrageous windfall that is now going to be passed on to members of parliament. If there is one aspect of the surcharge tax that was inequitable, it was and remains the administrative costs—costs that are spread across all fund members regardless of their level of income. The surcharge is unacceptably expensive to implement. Some funds have incurred costs of up to 30 per cent of the contributions collected. Although the administration expenses are now considerably less, they remain a burden on all fund members regardless of their income level. But the legislation to reduce the rate of the surcharge tax does absolutely nothing to redress the administrative inefficiency of the tax. It is reasonable to expect that the implementation of a reduction in the surcharge tax rate each year for each individual surchargeable member will actually increase the administrative inefficiencies of the tax.
Labor, in a positive way, has put forward a much more equitable alteration to this exclusive tax cut. Labor would instead cut the contributions tax—a tax which applies to all fund members regardless of income level. This is the best way to deliver higher retirement incomes to millions of working Australians; it is not giving a selective reduction to higher income earners, which is the Liberal Party's approach. Mr Costello believes it is impossible to cut the contributions tax burden. He said in a radio interview on 22 October 2001:
It's pretty complicated. The taxing of contributions on the way in started back in the mid eighties ... and I think now that it's started that's going to always be with us ... So it's still better to put money into superannuation, than to take it as income. But that system having commenced 15 years ago would be incredibly complicated to unravel now.
Here is the arrogant Treasurer, Mr Costello, saying he cannot do it. It is very simple: you remove 15 and you put in 13 as the contributions tax, as Labor has suggested. Perhaps Mr Costello could explain why it is so complicated to reduce a universal contributions tax but not a selective tax, the so-called superannuation surcharge.
—I can't believe what I'm hearing!
—Surely it is more complicated and expensive to reduce a selective tax than a universal one. We do have an opportunity in considering these bills to implement a fairer proposal—
—The greatest backflip in Australian history.
—which will improve the budget and boost all Australians' retirement savings.
—You should resign.
—But this chance will be lost if the Liberal government gets away with these unfair tax cuts.
—You wanted to abolish the lot! You voted to abolish the lot.
—As I have said, Labor's proposal to reduce the superannuation contributions tax would earn many thousands of dollars for retirement incomes, and it is economically responsible. 
—You voted to abolish the whole tax.
 (Senator Cook)—Order! Senator Kemp.
—I acknowledge the constant interjections of Senator Kemp on this point. Yes, the Labor Party did oppose the surcharge tax when it was introduced because you broke your election promise not to introduce new taxes. You whacked in a new one six months later. Now, seven years later, in light of the very tight budget circumstances—including a deficit in the last financial year—Labor in a responsible manner has examined the most reasonable way to reduce the massive tax burden on superannuation for all Australians. The way to address the massive tax burden on Australians' superannuation in today's economic and fiscal climate is not to have an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners but rather to adopt Labor's alternative, which is a modest tax cut on all Australians' superannuation.
—You don't believe in anything.
—Senator Kemp might like to know, as the failed former Assistant Treasurer, that when this government was elected in 1996 the total tax burden on superannuation contributions was $1.6 billion. Where is the tax level on superannuation contributions today? It is over $5½ billion. Labor's proposal in respect of a modest tax cut for all Australians is the fairest approach in today's world.
—What is the reason for that? Why don't you explain the reason for that?
—The government has already tried to discredit Labor's plans to provide a tax reduction to millions of working Australians. It questioned the costings, accusing Labor of getting the figures wrong. The Liberal government's alternative costings of Labor's proposal were subsequently proven wrong at budget estimates. Labor did not get its figures wrong, but the Liberal government did. What is more, the Liberal government will not allow Treasury to release their later costs and publicly correct the record to show that Labor's proposals are affordable.
I now turn to the co-contributions measure. The current co-contribution offered in this bill—albeit amended in the package that we will consider in committee—is a pale imitation of much more extensive and universal co-contribution arrangements proposed by the Labor government in May 1995 in its Savings for our future statement.
—Which you then dropped in subsequent elections.
—Those proposals included the government matching contributions of up to three per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings. I take the interjection. It was not the Labor Party that dropped the additional three per cent co-contribution proposals, which would have cost $4.5 billion over three years; it was the Liberal government and the current Treasurer, Mr Costello, who dropped universal government contributions into superannuation. He dropped it in 1997. Again, he claimed it was impossible to implement. Apparently when it suits the Treasurer it is just too hard to implement changes. It is just too hard with super; it is too hard to implement a universal tax cut and too hard to implement universal government contributions to superannuation. And that was after the current Treasurer, Mr Costello, had in 1995 committed an incoming Liberal government to implementing the Labor Party's co-contribution proposals.
The inquiries of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation into these bills heard many submissions that raised concerns in relation to the effectiveness and equity of the proposed co-contributions scheme that we are considering today, the access to the co-contribution by particular groups of persons and the administrative costs of the proposal. The Labor Party is particularly concerned about one issue raised in submissions to the committee. Many submissions pointed out that the proposed co-contribution arrangements leave considerable scope for abuse. It was highlighted that comparatively well-off people will make contributions in respect of family members in part-time employment or no employment to access the tax concessions available—that is, for this group of people the co-contributions arrangement could operate as a tax minimisation measure. 
The ability of a single- or low-income sole breadwinner in or below the salary target range—and the maximum level of benefit is payable at an income of $27,500—to contribute $1,000 in superannuation after paying the mortgage and food, health and education costs is extraordinarily limited. The take-up at that level of income and below will be very low, and that is a matter we will further test in the committee stages of the bill. Evidence given to the committee suggested that it was most unlikely that many of those in the target income range could raise that extra money to make the contributions necessary to attract government matching.
—What happened to Mr FitzGerald's evidence?
—I was referring to people on a single income of $27,500, Senator Cherry; not to joint incomes of $27,500 and higher. The number of people estimated to receive the full $1,000 is only 75,000, as revealed in the evidence from the peak superannuation body, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, ASFA. This is from a total pool of 4.4 million people with incomes of less than, as originally proposed, $32,500. Increasing the income threshold to $40,000, which is what is under consideration in the revised package, will increase the number. Again, we will be interested to see what the figures are. Senator Coonan tried to convince the Labor opposition in respect of these two measures that the surcharge tax reduction and the co-contribution scheme were due to the government's desire to `highlight the fact that the government's superannuation initiatives are designed as a balanced set of initiatives'. Accordingly, the justification for debating the two measures together is to show the balance.
What we have here is a blatant political stunt, undoubtedly aimed at trying to justify the Liberals' exclusive, unfair tax cut for higher income earners, to pretend that high-income earners need that measure and to link it to the co-contributions. This is misleading rhetoric. If the Liberal government were serious about helping those most in need of assistance in accumulating a retirement nest egg, they would have maintained Labor's proposed three per cent co-contribution scheme and they certainly would not have attached it to and watered down the co-contribution arrangements to an exclusive surcharge tax reduction. The Labor Party nonetheless support the revised superannuation co-contributions for low-income earners, albeit with the reservations that we have expressed, but we will require the government to closely monitor and report to the parliament on the outcome of the operation of the co-contribution arrangements to see who actually benefits from this particular measure. We think that is a particularly important part of the consideration in the committee stage.
In my concluding overall remarks on this legislation, let me summarise the position in respect of these two bills. We have a Liberal-Democrat deal, somewhat similar to the GST approach. With respect to the co-contribution for low-income earners: they have to find an additional $1,000 from their disposable income to contribute into super to receive $1,000 from the government. We do not know the exact numbers yet, but it is likely to be a very small proportion of the millions of Australians on low incomes who can actually find $1,000. At the other end of the income scale, those earning more than $94,600 all get a tax cut. Most people at the highest income level of $115,000 to $116,000 are guaranteed a $1,000 tax cut for doing nothing. So, high-income earners get $1,000 for doing nothing; low-income earners, if they can find an extra $1,000 to put into superannuation, after meeting the family commitments—mortgage, health, education—will get $1,000 from the government. That is not an equitable approach. 
The other point about this package that I would highlight is: what is in this package for middle Australia—those earning between $40,000 and approximately $95,000? Not one cent! No co-contribution; no tax cut. Not one cent for the 2½ million middle-income Australians. Aren't the 2½ million middle-income Australians deserving of either a tax cut or an additional incentive to contribute to superannuation? Don't they save as well? Don't they need additional superannuation for their retirement incomes? This is a very exclusive tax cut on the one hand that is weighted against low-income earners because of their lack of disposable income. Labor's proposal for a universal tax cut is the best approach.

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-09-16,"—The superannuation bills we are discussing today have been discussed once by the Senate and will be discussed again when we move into committee. The Democrats will be supporting the bills on this occasion. We do so because of the very substantial amendments, which have been circulated by the government. The key bill in this particular package that has attracted our attention is the government's proposal for a co-contribution for low-income workers in respect of their superannuation. I agree with Senator Sherry that this measure was originally introduced by the government during the election campaign as cover for a very large cut in the surcharge. However, in the course of the evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation it became quite clear that the government had almost stumbled on what was an exceptionally good policy measure. It is a very good policy measure because it has the real potential to encourage low-income earners to save more and to engage in a savings culture. From that point of view, the Democrats suddenly became moderately enthusiastic about it.
Our concern with the balance in the government's proposals was always that they were proposing to put two-thirds of the funding of their package into the high-income earners surcharge cut but only one-third into the funding for the low-income earners co-contribution. We always felt that was the wrong way round and would need to be amended. I am pleased to give credit to Senator Coonan in this regard, because eventually the government agreed to changes to the package to re-weight it in favour of low-income earners. The result is that the co-contribution will now be extended to a much wider category of people and the benefits of the surcharge cut will be significantly reduced. I should note for the record that the Democrats would have preferred to have seen the smallest possible cut, or even no cut, to the surcharge at this stage.
—It was an election promise.
—We accept that it was an election promise, Senator Kemp. We accept also that at the end of the day you have to compromise on these matters—the government is putting together these measures as a package and, from that point of view, we are prepared to support these bills. However, I note that the timing is ironically a significant positive.  
In the last year, voluntary contributions to superannuation in this country fell by $3.8 billion. A lot of that contribution cut actually came from high-income earners because of, to some extent, a response to the market conditions of superannuation funds. But a lot of the money that previously went into superannuation from high-income earners is now flowing into more speculative investments, particularly our overheated property market. Now is ironically a very good time in the economic cycle to provide a real incentive, even to high-income earners, to put more of their money back into longer term investments rather than short-term speculative investments. There is some economic gain in looking at the surcharge at this point in time.
I also point out that the proposed cuts to the surcharge are less in each of the next four years than the growth in the surcharge in each of those four years. The entire funding for this particular cut to the surcharge comes from bracket creep on the surcharge itself. From that point of view, we are achieving an outcome that the superannuation industry has spoken about for some time—achieving cuts in superannuation taxes from the estimated growth on those superannuation taxes.
Returning to the low-income earners' co-contribution, I advise the Senate of some of the very significant changes which were made in the agreements reached between the Democrats and Senator Coonan, and the number of people who will be affected. According to the ABS, 1.7 million workers earn under $20,000 a year and as such were eligible for the government's original proposal of a $1,000 co-contribution. By raising the threshold from $20,000 to $27,500, an extra one million workers will become eligible for the co-contribution—2.7 million people will now be eligible for the full co-contribution. The number of workers who will be eligible for a partial contribution has also risen. Under the government's original proposal, a total of 3.5 million workers would have been eligible for a full or partial contribution. Under the new amendments, which will take the income test up to $40,000, 4.6 million workers will be eligible for the co-contribution. Contrary to Senator Sherry's view that this is not very substantial, 60 per cent of the work force will now be eligible for the co-contribution. 
It was very surprising to hear the Labor Party saying in here that we should provide more benefits for the middle and upper income brackets—for everybody, as they say. But if there is a limited budget and limited resources, I unashamedly say the benefits should go to low-income earners first and foremost. The 60 per cent of people earning less than $40,000 a year in my view should be the principal beneficiaries. If we had gone down the Labor Party's route of a two per cent cut across the board, it is worth noting that there would have been a two per cent cut to everybody—low-income earners and high-income earners alike. High-income earners—the people whom Senator Sherry was complaining about with respect to the surcharge—would have received a two per cent cut in their contributions tax. Under our proposal, yes, they get 2.5 per cent. 
The difference is very small, but the big difference is at the bottom end. We are putting the vast bulk of the money into the bottom end. They get a lot more out of this proposal than they would have under the Labor Party's policy. And they get it if they are prepared to save, and that is the key thing. Australia's national savings rate has fallen, according to the most recent figures I have seen, to zero per cent. Our voluntary contributions to superannuation, as I said, fell by $3.8 billion last year. We need to encourage people to save in this country. We need to do that. We need to encourage a savings culture whereby people are encouraged to put away for tomorrow. That is what the co-contribution is all about. That is why I am so enthusiastic about it. That is why I have been prepared to talk to government over the course of the last year to try to extend it to as many people as is politically possible to encourage people to save.  
How many people will pick it up? That is the sixty-four million dollar question. I am sure, as Senator Sherry pointed out, we will tease this out when we get to the committee stage. But Treasury estimates that the number of people who will pick up the co-contribution will rise under the revised package from 350,000 to 540,000 people. That I think is a very significant group. But Treasury in my view has underestimated the pick-up rate, and this came out in evidence that we received during the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation inquiry into this particular measure. Evidence given by Dr Vince FitzGerald—the most eminent expert on savings in this country, from research he had done for IFSA—clearly indicated that the pick-up rate is likely to be much higher than estimated. In fact the pick-up rate he estimated is around 50 per cent higher than that estimated by Treasury. That suggests that as many as 800,000 people will benefit from the package we are putting up here today. Because the actual total expenditure is not capped, if the actual pick-up rate ends up being higher than estimated by Treasury or Dr Vince FitzGerald, we could see even more people picking up benefits.
It is worth noting, for example, that a worker on $35,000 a year is still eligible for a co-contribution of around $400. That is still a substantial boost to their superannuation. If they put away $8 a week over the course of their working life, the government will double it. That significantly adds to what they ultimately end up with. This is a very significant gain for the lower middle income area, where the real savings are likely to occur.
In the time I have left, I want to point very briefly to some of the likely beneficiaries of these particular changes. A key group, who I think will pick up the co-contribution and run with it quite significantly, will be older workers—workers over 40. Their children have possibly already left home and are off their hands. They are starting to think about retirement. They want to get ready for retirement and get their finances in order. They are likely to be in a position where they have a bit of extra money to put away. If they put away up to $20 a week, they could increase their final superannuation payment over 15 years by $45,000. That is very significant for older workers approaching retirement, particularly when you consider that the average superannuation balance for that group at the moment is just $56,000.
Another group who will benefit from this change, quite significantly in my view, will be women returning to the work force. Many women return to the work force as part-time workers. As a result they will probably be eligible for the full co-contribution. A constant complaint I hear from women returning to the work force is that they have lost time because of their child rearing years and are significantly behind with their superannuation. These changes allow them to catch up, and that is a huge benefit which we will talk about in more detail later.
Part-time and casual workers who are prepared to save will also benefit from these changes. Again that is significant given that this is by far the fastest growing segment of our work force. But the key thing is that 60 per cent of workers earn less than $40,000 a year, and they will benefit from this change right across the board. It is something that we really need to recognise in this place as a very significant and positive proposal. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-09-16,"—My question is to Senator Vanstone, Minister for Family and Community Services. Can the minister explain why, when the current broadband consultation has indicated that there are issues with quality, a lack of affordability and poor access to child care, the government has refused to make additional funding available? Why is the government preparing to cut family day care to patch over gaping holes elsewhere in the child-care system?

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-09-16,"—I ask a supplementary question. Given the minister's stated view that women need `greater certainty of child-care availability', why is the government creating further uncertainty and failing to act on a chronic shortage of child-care places until after Christmas? Is it the case that the minister for children's services has indicated to some child-care support services that their Commonwealth funding will be extended for only six months? Minister, if you were going to guarantee funding to child-care support services, why wouldn't you fund these organisations for the normal 12 months?

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2003-09-16,"—I thank the senator for her question because it invites me to remind senators that, in the last six years of this government, we have spent, I think, something like 70 per cent more in real terms on child care than the previous government did in their last six years in office. That is relevant in a climate where there was a $10 billion black hole that had to be filled and where difficult decisions had to be made. Nonetheless, the government, in recognition of the desire of women to re-enter the work force, whether it is in a full- or part-time capacity, has very significantly extended child care.
The government has committed a record $8 billion over the next four years to child care and, of that, $190 million each year will directly support services through the child-care support broadband. The redevelopment will examine all aspects of child-care support broadband to determine how support to child-care services can be improved. Redevelopment will ensure better use of available resources to meet the needs of children. We remain committed to supporting family day care as one of the range of child-care choices available to Australian families. No decision has been made, and any decisions will be made in the context of the government's commitment to improving work and family.
I think that makes the picture very clear. I will just repeat for the benefit of Senator Collins that there has been a record allocation of $8 billion over four years—more than $7 million in the first six years in office, which is over 70 per cent more in real terms than in Labor's last six years in office. Fee increases for centres have halved, with an average increase of 4.3 per cent per annum since 1996, compared with an average increase of 8.5 per cent under Labor. Child-care fees have increased by only 5.3 per cent since June 2000. The CPI has increased by 12 per cent over the same time. This means the cost of child care has increased far less than general prices. Child-care benefits have been provided, with very substantial increases in assistance for most families. It was boosted by indexation of three per cent on 7 July 2003. Child-care benefits subsidise around 70 per cent of the total cost of child care to low-income families and, as a matter of interest, a family earning $50,000 a year with one child in full-time care now pays about $380 less out of their pockets a year for child-care fees than they would have in June 2000.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Family Services: Child Care</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer

I could, however, be made deaf by people shouting at me through a microphone. It is very clear that women want a greater use of child care. Why do you imagine we have increased the provision of child care as substantially as we have and will continue to provide appropriate levels of child care?
For those who cannot see, the senator is now gesticulating in a childlike fashion and pointing to some article that I wrote some time ago. She might think this is primary school, I do not know. But the real question that needs to be answered is: why didn't Labor increase spending on child care, like we have? Why didn't Labor ensure that child-care prices went down, like we have?

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-09-16,"—I seek leave to incorporate further details of an answer I gave to Senator Carr yesterday on the allegations against Professor Bruce Hall. 
Leave granted. 
The document read as follows—
SENATOR CARR—My question without notice is to Senator Patterson, the Minister for Health and Ageing. Can the minister now confirm that the NHMRC was informed of the allegations of scientific fraud against Professor Hall in November 2001? Can the minister also confirm that these allegations were verified by the January 2003 report of a former Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Gerard Brennan? Can the minister also confirm that Sir Gerard Brennan's review committee of eminent scientists concluded that these tests, reported by Professor Hall for his NHMRC grant, did not take place? He said that Professor Hall published `a material ... falsehood' and authorised the publication of the abstract with `intent to deceive' and `with reckless disregard for the truth'. Given that it has now been two years since the NHMRC and your department have been aware of these allegations, what action have you taken to recover moneys fraudulently claimed by Professor Hall as part of his NHMRC grant?
SENATOR PATTERSON—I thank the honourable member for his question.
As far as I understand, the Brennan Report, which was established as an independent inquiry by the University of New South Wales (UNSW) to investigate complaints of scientific fraud against Professor Hall, examines information in relation to Project Grant ID 209656, which would have commenced funding in 2002.
Dr Clara He raised concerns in relation to this grant in mid-December 2001 and the NHMRC took immediate action to suspend Project Grant ID 209656. Upon receipt of Dr He's allegations the NHMRC immediately raised concerns with the University and suspended payment of the grant, pending investigation. No funds have been released for this grant.
I have not seen the Brennan Report, however, I understand that:
Professor Hall stated and presented a material or significant falsehood in reckless disregard of the truth in the grant application 209656.
I understand that the NHMRC is currently negotiating with UNSW over the extent of access to the Brennan Report. It is anticipated the NHMRC will refer the matter to the Department for appropriate action shortly.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer (Senator Coonan) to questions without notice asked by Senators Sherry, Buckland and Wong today relating to superannuation.
It was an extraordinary performance by Senator Coonan in the Senate today in response to the important questions of superannuation that were posed by the Labor opposition. Before I get to the issue of who wants to be a millionaire—the predictions made by Senator Ian Campbell—the minister, on her way through, took a swipe at so-called captive commentators. She criticised Ms Hayes, Mr Wood and Alan Kohler. What I found extraordinary was that she actually criticised her own colleague Senator Watson. Senator Watson is the Liberal Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and she bagged her own colleague because of the quite correct and unanimous observations and criticisms made by Senator Watson of Senator Coonan. Senator Watson criticised Senator Coonan. I raise today the issue of the claims by Senator Campbell, who incidentally is the longest-serving parliamentary secretary in the history of the Australian parliament—
—Sorry? I didn't hear that.
—He is the longest-serving parliamentary secretary; 7½ years. He claimed last Wednesday:
What happens to that person who is on $27,000 a year who starts saving and getting a hand from the government is that, by the end of their working life, when they are 65, they could have over $1 million in superannuation savings ...
That was the comment on the public record—and it was reported over the wire service and by some other media outlets—where Senator Ian Campbell predicted that the government's low-income earner co-contribution would turn Australians into millionaires. This is a grossly irresponsible claim because it is simply not correct. I posed this important question to Senator Coonan today. I asked her to confirm the prediction that Australians would become millionaires in today's dollar values as a result of the low-income earners co-contribution; I asked her whether she would confirm Senator Ian Campbell's prediction. Of course, she would not. I know why she would not, and that is that it is virtually impossible. I know of no scenario where an Australian could become a millionaire in today's dollar values as a result of the $1,000 co-contribution. I know of no circumstance. They would have to have an extraordinarily high return over 40 years and have no fees or charges. It is just not going to happen. That Australians could become millionaires was a grossly misleading comment and prediction—and it was grossly misleading financial advice—from Senator Ian Campbell to low-income earning Australians. Who wants to be a millionaire? It was an Eddie type of prediction from Senator Ian Campbell.
But that was not the first irresponsible and grossly misleading statement made by not just Senator Ian Campbell but other ministers on behalf of the Liberal government in respect of superannuation matters. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, prior to the last election projected that there would be 470,000 children's superannuation accounts. How many have been opened? About 500. The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer predicted that there would be $325 million collected from a new tax on temporary Australian residents. How much has been collected? About $15 million. At current rates there will be a $250 million shortfall. I understand why Senator Watson is sensitive, but to his credit Senator Watson criticised his own minister over her portability regulations. He criticised his own minister. 
—That's what he's angry about! It's your assertion.
—It is there in black and white, Senator McGauran. You read the unanimous report signed off by Senator Watson, the chair, which criticises Senator Coonan over the regulations on portability. Now we have the prediction from Senator Ian Campbell that Australians will become millionaires as a result of the government's co-contribution. That is a grossly irresponsible prediction from Senator Ian Campbell. He should have been made to apologise and retract that misleading statement, but Senator Coonan is so weak that she would not pull him into line and require him to retract the statement. She would not pull him into line. The statement that Australians would become millionaires was grossly misleading and untrue. If it were not so serious, it would be funny!

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-09-16,"—Perhaps the only correct statement that has come from Senator Sherry today is that Senator Ian Campbell has been parliamentary secretary for 7½ years. Yes, it is true. But Senator Ian Campbell reminds me, Senator Sherry, that in that time he has not seen one instance of a policy from the Australian Labor Party. In that time, there has been no policy from the Australian Labor Party. There has been much misreading or selectivity and taking out of context in relation to a number of matters raised today. Senator Buckland raised the issue of lump sums. I draw the attention of Senator Buckland to issues that he signed off on and that he apparently wants to walk away from. Senator Sherry has already walked away from the concept of portability, which is another matter. The report of the committee is important. With respect to transitional arrangements—which you, Senator Buckland, seem conveniently to ignore—the report reads:
The Committee majority recognise that any move to mandate the purchasing of complying annuities on retirement would need to be accompanied by transitional arrangements over a long period of time.
There is no immediacy, as you and some of the newspaper correspondents attempt to infer there is. The report goes on:
In the short-term, the Committee majority do not believe that such people—
that is, low-income savers—
should be disadvantaged by being forced to purchase a complying annuity.
Where is the strength of your argument? It continues:
However, in the long-term, the Committee majority believe that measures must be taken to reverse the practice of using all superannuation savings—
when the balance accumulates to a significant amount—
to pay off consumer debt.
The report goes on to say:
... the Committee majority believe that the Government should consider placing a minimum threshold on the purchase of a complying annuity, below which individuals would not be compelled to purchase an annuity and could instead take a lump sum payment. Again, this could be a transitional arrangement which could be revisited in the long term as the superannuation system matures. 
I cannot see how there could be such a misreading by Labor commentators of a valuable report, particularly by Labor commentators who have signed off on it. It is in black and white, and I am quoting from it today. The report does recognise the option of:
... a continuation of the current complex tax and social security rules, which have resulted in insufficient incentives for retirees to take up income streams or for life offices to offer such products. In the Committee's opinion—
unanimously—
the present retirement income stream arrangements are complex, not easily understood and have resulted in—
the committee believing—
that people are being disadvantaged in their retirement through the complex interaction between the superannuation and tax/social security systems.
We are trying to find a better world for people to save and to get a better mix and match. The committee drew attention to the fact that Australia is one of only two countries in the world with mandatory, individual superannuation accounts that allow members access to their whole balance when they retire. We are saying that in the long term, when the balances come up as a result of a generational change, there should be some mandating of a portion of the balance. The Labor Party have completely ignored or misconstrued the reading. How they can honestly stand up in this place and make such statements is absolutely astounding. It is a disgrace to the Labor Party and a disgrace to those members of the committee who have not properly represented what is in the report. If the committee system is going to degenerate into this, the whole standing of the Senate committee system will fall into disrepute. We need honest reporting of what is actually in committee reports.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Superannuation</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-09-16,"—I rise to take note of answers given by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer in question time today. What the minister demonstrated today is a frightening lack of understanding of superannuation policy and the pressing issues facing superannuation policy in Australia. Not only does this minister fail to grasp the key issues in the area of superannuation but she appears to suffer from some sort of ideological tunnel vision, where any reasoned criticism of her policy—what there is of it—is dismissed as some sort of Labor Party and industry fund conspiracy. It is unfortunate that the minister in the Howard government who has responsibility for this important area of superannuation, which will define Australians' retirement incomes in years to come, suffers from such tunnel vision.
Even the minister's own party colleagues are able to see sense. There was a unanimous recommendation from the superannuation committee to not apply the portability regulations to active accounts. I do not think that is a misrepresentation of your position, Senator Watson. In fact, I congratulate you as chair of that committee on putting good policy and good sense above party politics and, in the discussion of the portability regulations, making the very clear point that in their current form those regulations could lead to an increase, not a decrease, in the number of superannuation accounts in Australia. That is something we all agree is a problem. The point was made by the committee that this issue of portability out of active accounts is more properly dealt with in choice-of-fund legislation, which would allow scrutiny by the Senate and issues of consumer protection and efficiency to be addressed. Thank goodness for the committee and that the chair and deputy chair, Senators Watson and Sherry, can provide some reasoned debate and policy in the context of a minister who simply fails to grasp some of the primary issues in superannuation at this moment. 
I want to turn briefly to the issue of exit fees. I asked the minister a question on that issue and again the minister simply failed to grasp the nettle on it. The Senate committee and other commentators have commented on the barrier to portability that is posed by outrageous exit fees—that is, fees that are charged simply for taking your money out of one account and putting it into another. I cited some of the examples to the minister in my question: a balance of $5,939 which would be hit with a fee of around $5,620 and a balance of $1,287 which would cop a fee of $1,195. I think any layperson, any Australian worker, would say those sorts of fees are unreasonable and they clearly constitute a barrier to taking your money out.
If the minister were serious about portability, if she were serious about actually encouraging people to consolidate their accounts and ensuring they are not financially penalised for doing so, she would do something about exit fees of the sort that I have described. But today again in question time we saw this minister simply refuse to concede that it is an issue at all. She does not think these sorts of exit fees are an issue. With a wave of her hand she airily dismisses exit fees as being a minor problem, as being only a problem in relation to older funds. I make the point that I agree with her in one respect: some of the industry funds certainly have far better practices when it comes to exit fees. But this minister simply brushes away examples of outrageous and exorbitant exit fees that would be applied to the superannuation funds of Australian workers. She says the market will sort it out. My question to the minister is: how many Australian workers' savings will be diminished while you wait for the market to sort this issue out? If this minister were serious about the consolidation of Australian superannuation funds, she would deal with the issue of exit fees. She would regulate those fees and ensure, as the Senate committee recommended, that those fees are limited to the reasonable costs of processing the transactions and any rollover costs associated with it.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Superannuation</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,speech
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2003-09-16,"—We have had a number of attempts by the Labor Party in the Senate today to raise issues in relation to superannuation. All of them failed and they failed basically because the Labor Party have, as in so many areas, completely failed to develop any policy with regard to retirement incomes in the important area of superannuation. That is the first point that needs to be made. The second point that needs to be made is that, in terms of their involvement in debate on superannuation, the Labor Party are forever doing the bidding of the union funds. They are not interested in consumers; they are not interested in people trying to save for their retirement. They are purely interested in serving the interests of the union funds, which are of course largely operated by the union organisations they represent.
Senator Sherry tried to lampoon the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Ian Campbell, because Senator Campbell apparently said that the government's superannuation co-contribution scheme for low-income earners will result in people becoming millionaires. Well, that is true. How do we define millionaires at any particular time? Generally a millionaire is someone who has assets in excess of a million dollars. The data has been prepared not by Senator Campbell or by the government but by the Financial Planning Association. They have done calculations, and have laid out the basis of their calculations, which clearly show that someone 25 years of age today will have, if they retire at 65 years of age having made contributions under the government's co-contribution scheme, retirement benefits worth a lump sum amount of $1.202579 million. 
Certainly that is $1 million 40 years hence. But we talk about millionaires today being people who have assets of a million dollars or more; we do not talk about them being people who had assets of a million dollars or more 20 years ago. We talk about it in current dollar terms, and that is exactly what Senator Campbell correctly did on the basis of the information and the evidence provided by the Financial Planning Association. That reinforces the great value that the government's superannuation co-contribution scheme has for low-income earners who make their own small contributions which will be supported dollar for dollar by the government. So let us have none of this nonsense from the Labor Party that Senator Campbell is somehow misrepresenting the situation. 
The other issue that has been raised is the portability of superannuation benefits between funds. Again in marked contrast to the Labor Party, the government believes that workers should have the freedom to decide who is going to manage their superannuation—the funds they are saving for their retirement. They should have the right to move their benefits from one fund to another. That is why the government has introduced regulations to give effect to that policy. Portability will allow members to consolidate their superannuation benefits in one account should they wish to do so. It will also allow members of accumulation funds and fully defined benefit funds to transfer benefits from their current superannuation fund to a fund of their own choice. It will also benefit Australians by creating greater competition in the superannuation industry, placing downward pressure on fees and charges and leading to more responsive investment strategies by trustees. 
Another issue that the Labor Party raised in its questions today was the issue of fees and charges. The best way to ensure we have low levels of fees and charges is by having the maximum amount of competition in the financial services industry, in particular in the provision of superannuation investments. That is exactly what will be achieved as a result of the introduction of portability by this government's regulations because, when consumers have the right to place their funds where they want them, they will be able to do it on the basis of where they will get the best investment return at the lowest cost in fees and charges. Again, by not supporting the government's regulations, the Labor Party is indeed working directly against the interests of consumers and directly against the interests of low-income earners who want to take up the opportunity to save for their retirement and to maximise their retirement benefits.
The government generally also supports choice of superannuation funds, but the introduction of portability is not a backdoor method for introducing funds, contrary to what ASFA has claimed. We do remain committed to that, but that is quite a separate issue. The fact that it is a separate issue is reinforced by the fact that, under the regulations for portability, portability will only be provided once a year. That addresses the concern that it will be used as a backdoor method for introducing choice of funds. It is also important to recognise that portability exists on a voluntary basis.

The practice of lump sums at retirement needs to be kept in place, but government members tend to have the view that perhaps all of that money should be put into an annuity or some other form of savings to help workers later on. But when you look at low-paid workers there is no benefit for them. For instance, if low-paid workers who are on $20,000 were to invest that amount of money as a pension, they might be able to get $1,200 a year, or $23 a week.  
The minister seems to be making high-income earners her priority: those who earn $100,000 or more, those who might be able to live off an annuity and those who do not need to retire debt that they have accumulated during their working life—something that they have a right to do. They have been putting money aside so that when they go into retirement they will be debt free and able to survive the rigours of their later years.
In responding to my question, the minister said a very curious thing. When I asked her about the annuity and the partial or full ban on lump sum superannuation payouts, she said that the government are looking at and considering their position in relation to the committee report, which I thought was a good report overall; it has assisted the debate on superannuation in this country quite considerably. She said that they are reviewing it. The curious thing she said was that the abolition of lump sums—to use my choice of words; preventing people taking part or all of their superannuation as a lump sum—is something to be considered. Those were her words: `something to be considered'. That worries me because it seems that in the overall picture that is what the government are going to be all about—considering ways to prevent the lower paid workers in our community from benefiting from their savings to retire their debt as they go into their years of retirement.
The Labor Party support the choice of taking a lump sum as a pension. But, in our view, there have to be real incentives from the government to allow Australians to make an informed choice about retirement income options. They should not just throw people to the wolves who see a quick buck in selling products to them and investing their money so that they can pick up the fees and charges and do very nicely out of it. Such people are ready to capitalise on those who are not educated in the area of superannuation or in financial matters and who are unable to plan for their later years.
The committee spoke a lot about education, and that is contained in the report. There needs to be very real education programs so people know what they will be doing upon retirement. They need to know that they can securely invest their money, if that is what they want to do, and live off the capital that they have accumulated over their working lives. (Time expired)
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Superannuation</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-09-16,"—I table a document entitled TGA report on information and advertising associated with products tested, created or manufactured using human embryos or human embryonic stem cells. I seek leave to incorporate a statement by Senator Patterson, the Minister for Health and Ageing, in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read asfollows—
In May 2003 Senator Harradine proposed moving amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act to require that where human embryos or human embryonic stem cells have been used in the manufacture, creation or testing of any therapeutic good, a statement to this effect must be included in the Product Information (PI) and Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) that accompany the therapeutic good and in any advertising about the therapeutic good.
In proposing these amendments Senator Harradine sought to ensure that consumers with ethical concerns about the use of human embryos or human embryonic stem cells in pharmaceutical goods have information on whether particular pharmaceuticals are manufactured or tested using human embryos or human embryonic stem cells. 
In response to Senator Harradine's proposed amendments, I undertook to review the issue, consult with industry and provide a report to the Senate on the regulatory options available to address Senator Harradine's concerns.
Today I would like to table a Report reflecting the investigations undertaken by the Therapeutic Goods Administration following consultation with the medicines and device industry associations, with scientists who have specialist knowledge of embryonic stem cell research, and with scientists and medical experts in evaluation and regulation of therapeutic goods within the TGA. 
As reflected in the TGA Report there are a number of aspects of Senator Harradine's original proposal which pose difficulties in terms of implementation. However, my Parliamentary Secretary, Ms Worth, and Senator Harradine have discussed these issues at length and I am very pleased that a way forward appears to have been identified that balances the needs of consumers and the pharmaceutical industry.  
It is proposed that the Therapeutic Goods Regulations be amended to require that where a therapeutic good is manufactured (or tested in the course of manufacture) using human embryos or human embryonic stem cells (or materials sourced from human embryos or human embryonic stem cells), notification to this effect is included in the PI and the CMI associated with the good.
It is also proposed that these requirements in the Regulations be supplemented by requirements in the Australian Guidelines for the Registration of Drugs to require that where information is provided to the TGA (as part of an application for registration of a prescription medicine) that refers to the use of human embryos, human embryonic stem cells (or materials sourced from human embryos or human embryonic stem cells) in research undertaken in the development of the medicine, then the PI and CMI should provide a statement to this effect.
In order to minimise the impact on pharmaceutical manufacturers it is proposed that:
	the requirements take effect from 1 July 2004, giving manufacturers sufficient time to gather relevant information in order to comply with the new regulatory requirements;
	the requirements do not have any retrospective effect in relation to goods that are currently on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods; and
	the changes are reflected in the TG Regulations in the clearest and most efficient way by relying on existing definitions in the legislation and existing requirements relating to CMIs and PIs.
I believe that these proposed changes address Senator Harradine's concerns and will ensure that consumers have information available to them regarding medicines manufactured (and tested) using human embryos, human embryonic stem cells and other material sourced from a human embryo or human embryonic stem cell. 
I propose tabling the amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations late in October.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Tabling</title>,Documents,17,1,speech

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-09-16,"—Before question time I was speaking on these superannuation bills, in particular on the importance of the measures that have been negotiated on the co-contribution. I did want to note for the record a couple of the comments from some of the industry bodies who have been commenting on these bills. The executive director of the Investment and Financial Services Association, Mr Richard Gilbert, said in his statement welcoming this package of measures:
Lower to middle income earners are the big winners after negotiations on the Superannuation Co-contribution Bill and the Surcharge Reduction initiative ... reached a successful conclusion.
“ ... the Democrats have brokered a compromise with the Government that is perhaps the most significant breakthrough in superannuation tax in 15 years,” he said.
Ms Philippa Smith from ASFA also put out a statement on the same day, and she said:
Retirement savings for lower income earners could be boosted by as much as 70%, if they take advantage of the new co-contribution arrangements announced by the government ...
“We are delighted to see that common sense has triumphed on these superannuation measures, originally mooted by the government at the time of their re-election in 2001 ...
So there is some very strong industry support for these measures, which we believe will significantly improve the attractiveness of superannuation as a savings vehicle. Before I conclude, I want to respond to a couple of the points made by Senator Sherry in his speech. As I said in my comments earlier, I would have preferred to have seen as small a cut as possible to the surcharge, and we have managed to minimise it as much as we can within this political environment. I will point out, though, before I am accused of providing huge tax cuts for the rich, that the tax cut that is involved here is one-quarter of the tax cut that Labor ticked off when the government halved the capital gains tax in 1999. It was a very significant reduction for high-income earners, for which Labor got nothing in return—nothing whatsoever, no concessions, no compromises, no nothing. Significantly, it is roughly the same size as the tax cut that again Labor supported for this category when it ticked off the tax cuts flowing out of this year's budget.
Finally, as I said earlier, Labor have already offered that group a two per cent tax cut, compared with the 2½ per cent that is in this package, by their proposal to provide the same tax cut across the board. From that point of view, Senator Sherry's contribution to the debate has been a little cute without necessarily recognising the benefits in this particular package. I agree with Senator Sherry, though, that the co-contribution is just a start. Senator Sherry did make the point—and it is a good point—that the government co-contribution proposed by the Keating government back in 1996 was much more substantial and much more wide ranging than this measure, but I hope this measure grows over time. If there is a demand for it—and the figures will be collected—and if the industry can get behind it and promote it as an encouragement for people to save, I hope this will become one of the most popular measures in superannuation law, at which point we can come back to this place and argue with some confidence to get the measure expanded further up the income scale and to get the co-contribution increased. We have to start somewhere, and I reckon $920 million over four years for low-income earners is a pretty good place to start. I think it is a very positive move. I commend this package of bills to the Senate. ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-09-16,"—I rise to speak on the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003. At the end of my speech I will move, on behalf of the opposition, the second reading amendment that has been circulated in the chamber, on sheet No. 2991 revised. Honourable senators might recall that that was not ready to be moved when the shadow minister, Senator Sherry, was speaking.
This bill is one of a package of bills presented by the government after agreement with the Democrats. It demonstrates yet again the failure by this government to properly deal with the central issue in superannuation in Australia, and that is the adequacy of retirement savings for low- and middle-income Australians. It is well documented that the present level of retirement savings of low- and middle-income Australians is simply insufficient to meet most of their needs for the sort of lifestyle they wish to have in retirement. A government that was serious about addressing this issue would look at a range of reforms in the superannuation sector to ensure that working Australians—not high-income Australians, but working Australians—and their families have reasonable and adequate retirement incomes later in their lives. This is important from many perspectives, but from one policy perspective—that is, the demographic trends in Australia—it is particularly important. We know that the Australian population is ageing and that an increasing percentage of the Australian population will, over time, be above what we now regard as normal retirement age. If we are to deal with this demographic trend without undermining the retirement incomes of this group of Australians, we have to increase their retirement savings. This is most important in respect of low- and middle-income earners.
The government's response to this important issue is the bill that is currently before the Senate: the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003. This is a grossly inequitable piece of legislation. It is grossly unfair. It provides an exclusive tax cut for high-income Australians that starts when you earn over $94,691 a year, and you get the most benefit if you earn over $114,981 a year. Many Australians and their families can only dream of those incomes. This government has ensured that a tax cut is directed specifically at those high-income earners. This demonstrates that this government has the wrong priorities. It ought to be trying to lift the adequacy of the retirement savings of low- and middle-income families. It ought to be looking at alleviating the tax burden on the superannuation contributions for those low- and middle-income earners in order to address this adequacy issue. Instead, this government's priority is a tax cut for high-income earners—for people earning well over $94,000 a year, with the most benefit for those earning over $114,000. We know the government's priority is to reduce tax on high-income earners.
One thing that is clear about this legislation and its accompanying legislation on co-contributions is that there is one group of Australians who will get no benefit whatsoever out of the government's package nor out of the deal that has been done by the Australian Democrats with the government—that is, any Australian family earning between $40,000 and $94,000 a year. They gain no benefit whatsoever from this legislation. At one point in this debate I heard one of the Democrat senators having a go at the Labor Party, asking why we are championing middle Australia when we should be championing working-class Australia. 
—Good question.
—Senator Cherry, I will explain it to you if you have not understood it. We will support the co-contributions legislation—the bills that are in this package—but we think it is a very small and a very inadequate step to deal with the issue of retirement savings for low-income Australians. It ought not be presented—as the Democrats seemed to try—as some saviour for low-income Australians. The evidence that was presented of the estimated take-up rate, along with people's anecdotal knowledge of low-income families, would suggest that the benefit will be very marginal indeed. If you are a single-income family earning less than $27,000 a year, what chance do you have to save $1,000 after health, education and living expenses in order to get the co-contribution?
But more importantly, perhaps the Democrat senators who are supporting this legislation can explain why they have agreed to an income tax reduction for high-income earners at the same time as they have supported a package which does absolutely nothing for any Australians earning between $40,000 and $94,691. When you consider the issue of the adequacy of retirement savings in this country, it seems remarkable that you would come to the Senate with a policy that completely ignores Australian families earning those sorts of incomes.
—We have to start somewhere.
—I can tell you where I think we should not start: we should not start with a tax cut for people who are earning over $94,000 a year. If the best the Australian Democrats can do is assist this government in putting in place a tax cut with some deal that they try and hold up on the issue of low-income earners as providing balance to that tax cut, I think the Democrat senators have some way to go before they can actually say that they negotiated a reasonable outcome for poor and middle-income Australians in this country.
The co-contribution, which has been introduced at the same time as this legislation, is an attempt by the government to try and soften the blow of what most Australians would see as an unfair tax cut given to Australians who, frankly, probably do not need it—that is, people earning over $100,000 a year. The government tries to dress up the tax cut for wealthy Australians by saying, `We are going to have a co-contributions scheme as well. If you save $1,000, we will put $1,000 into your account.' For many Australian families on the sorts of incomes that we are looking at, that is great in theory but will mean very little in practice. For many Australian families, those earning $20,000 to $25,000 a year on a single income, the prospect of saving $1,000 after all the expenses that they have is highly unlikely. What we have in the package before the Senate is a guaranteed tax cut for those at the upper ends of the salary scale with a possible co-contribution for poorer, low-income Australians if they can manage to save $1,000 out of their family's budget.
Senator Cherry spoke of the administration costs of the surcharge tax. Some of the things which are not detailed in the regulatory impact statement with this legislation are precisely what the costs of dealing with the alterations to the surcharge will be and how they will be passed on to fund members. I want to comment briefly on the amount of tax that this government is now reaping from superannuation savings. When this government was elected in 1996, around $1.6 billion in taxation from superannuation contributions was received by the Commonwealth. Taxes have now reached a record level of $5 billion. In an environment of fiscal discipline, as we keep being told by this government, it may be the case that additional government contributions for low-income earners is beyond the short-term ability of this government to deliver. 
I make the point again that an additional three per cent contribution for low-income earners was part of the Keating Labor government's policy, which did not require any co-contribution but which was a genuine attempt to deal with the retirement incomes of low-income Australians. But in these times when the government say, `We do not have enough money to make a three per cent contribution,' despite the fact that they indicated that they would do so, one would have thought that one of the ways they could try and deal with the issue of adequacy—that is, the amount of money saved by low- and middle-income Australians—would be to reduce the contributions tax for all Australians, particularly for those on low and middle incomes. Instead, what we have is a government that is prepared to reduce the taxation levied on high-income earners. People earning over $114,000 a year will be the primary beneficiaries of this; people earning between $40,000 and $94,000 will not receive one cent of benefit from this package. At the same time, we have the government cynically introducing legislation requiring from low-income earners a co-contribution when its own figures make it clear that the take-up rate will not be great and that it will be extremely difficult for many families on single incomes in particular to save the amount required in order to gain co-contribution.
The Labor Party's second reading amendment, which I will move shortly, goes to the heart of the issue that we say is problematic with this legislation—that it is completely unbalanced and skewed towards the interests of high-income earners by providing them with a guaranteed tax cut. It completely ignores Australians on middle incomes between $40,000 and $94,000. We also consider that there is questionable benefit in the co-contribution legislation which accompanies this.
We will be supporting the co-contribution because we think it is a small but necessary improvement in addressing the issue of retirement savings of low-income Australians, but the opposition's view is that the government could do significantly better than this in terms of policy to address retirement incomes of low-income Australians. I move:
	At the end of the motion, add:
“But the Senate notes that although these Bills together provide;
	(a)	an exclusive tax benefit to those earning more than $94,691; and
	(b)	a contingent benefit to those earning less than $40,000pa, provided of course that those lower income earners meet the contingency, finding $1,000 to contribute;
but the Bills provide absolutely no benefit to the many working Australians earning between $40,000 and $94,691.
because of this, the Senate is of the view;
	(c)	that the bill should be withdrawn by the Government because the proposed surcharge tax reduction to high-income earners is an exclusive tax cut to those earning greater than $94,691 from 1 July 2003, with the greatest benefit going to those on an income greater than $114,981, with the result that it assists only the highest 5% of income earners; and 
	(d)	that the Bill should be redrafted to cut the contributions tax for all Australians, a fairer approach, particularly at a time of negative returns, to boost the retirement income for all Australians and assist the Nation in preparing for the ageing of the population”.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-09-16,"—The Senate is debating, in amended form, two bills that were an important package of the superannuation changes that were put to the people by the Liberal coalition before the last election. The measures were popularly received and contributed to the significant election win by the Howard government. I note that the ALP supports with some degree of qualification the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003 and the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003, but it rejects the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003. I remind the Senate that earlier today Senator Kemp stated that this rejection was the greatest U-turn in the history of the parliament by the ALP and, in particular, by Senator Sherry. We all recall the early days when Senator Sherry harangued the Senate about the problems and inequities of the surcharge. Yet now, at the first opportunity we have to establish a measure to reduce that surcharge in part, he rejects that measure.
The alternative suggested by the ALP of transferring the reduction from the existing 15 per cent surcharge to a 13 per cent contribution tax does not make sense. There is a huge black hole in Senator Sherry's argument, because for a person on $110,000 per year the saving is only $150. That saving, multiplied by the limited number of people—we acknowledge—who are going to benefit from this, compared with a two point per cent contribution covering a much greater number, does not make arithmetic sense. There is a big black hole created by the Labor Party in terms of the arithmetic.
I remind the Senate that an income of $110,000 per year includes termination benefits and FBT, so it is more than a salary. One of the inequities of the surcharge tax is that it does impact on some middle-income earners. A couple of days ago I indicated that I met with members of the Police Federation, who were very concerned that a number of their people who had particular illness problems because of the nature of their employment had sought early retirement only to be caught by this surcharge. They are not regarded as people on higher incomes but, because of the impact of fringe benefits and termination benefits, their income is grossed up and they suddenly become subject to the surcharge. Here we have an opportunity as a first step, albeit a small step, to make this change and it is rejected by the ALP. 
I recall the time when this surcharge, or surtax, was introduced. It was introduced for a specific purpose: after the 1996 election we found a $10 billion black hole in the ALP's calculations in terms of budget deficit, and that had to be funded. Lots of people said, `This is just a short-term measure.' Unfortunately this short-term measure has gone on for a while. But, at the first opportunity that we have to reduce the surcharge, the bills are knocked back by the ALP.
You were talking about the huge benefits to high-income earners, Senator Sherry. I remind you that the saving is about $150 in the first year. It could be a lot less for a lot of other people. Senator Sherry, in rejecting this, you and all of your parliamentary colleagues, as people who are in defined benefit funds, have the advantage of the surcharge being capped at 15 per cent. But if you are outside the Commonwealth Public Service and the like, if you are in a defined benefit fund, you are not necessarily paying a surcharge of 15 per cent; you could be paying, for a successful fund, 20 per cent. Yet you are denying these very people an opportunity of some small reduction in the surcharge. I think it is time you looked at the equity of this issue. You had more commonsense five or six years ago than you are showing at the present time. We have particular problems with this surcharge and we must send a message to the electorate at large that this has got to be, over time, taken away. 
I remind the Senate that it was Mr Keating, when he was Treasurer, who introduced the concept of a contribution tax. In modern-day thinking, practically all the commentators are saying, `This was wrong. We should move back to the original position of taxing the end benefits.' Therefore, it is very difficult for a government—and particularly for the Treasurer, Mr Costello—to suddenly forgo revenue of $900 million, which the surcharge raises annually, in one measure. So it was agreed in the proposition put to the Australian people that it should be progressively reduced. The first stanza was that it would be reduced progressively. As a result of the historic agreement with the Australian Democrats, that surcharge was reduced quite significantly. But there is still a message out there that we should go further, and there is a commitment to do so.
For the first year, 2003-04, the maximum rate is 14.5 per cent. Of course, that rate can be higher for people who belong to successful defined benefit funds. For the year 2005 and subsequent years, the rate becomes 12.5 per cent. We are not talking of massive tax savings to the rich. Senator Sherry, where is the inequity in these people paying tax—overall, in terms of the benefit—of between 46 and 64 per cent? That is what we are talking about. We are talking about pretty high taxes. Admittedly, they are the higher-income earners but, when the marginal tax rate for ordinary income is in the order of 48 per cent, why should superannuation be taxed much more heavily than the maximum on ordinary savings—up to 64 per cent for some people; between 48 per cent and 64 per cent. Even the tax on income from capital gains is a lot less. Where is the equity, in the Labor Party's vocabulary, of taxing people who have savings—admittedly the higher-income earners—of between 48 and 64 per cent? It is just not right.
As a result of a Senate committee inquiry, our attention has been drawn to the big savings gap between what people will have in 40 years time and their expected lifestyle. ISFA, in conjunction with Rice Walker, conducted some studies which showed that that gap was of the order of $600 billion. It is immaterial whether it is $500 billion or $700 billion. The point is that it is a very significant figure. What we have to do is move to encourage more retirement savings in Australia. We have already seen that there has been a dropping off of voluntary contributions, and the surcharge is certainly a contributing factor. Why would higher-income earners want to put money into superannuation when they are taxed at the sort of prohibitive marginal rates that are now on the books? In terms of equity, it has to be changed, and it has to be reduced.
The other very good measure is the co-contribution. I thank Senator John Cherry, who is a member of our superannuation committee, for entering meaningful discussions with the government to make this possible and allow this bill to proceed. Contributions and savings will significantly increase as a result of the incentives proposed by the co-contribution bill. It particularly targets the lower-income earners in society. If people who have incomes of up to $27,500 deposit $1,000 into a superannuation account, the government will pay a co-contribution of $1,000 into that account. If they cannot afford $1,000 but they put in $400, they will receive $400. For those who have incomes in excess of $27,500, it tapers off—to $40,000; at $40,000, there is no co-contribution. 
I believe that is one of the best investments on the market. It has low risk, it has a very high return and it is not speculative in nature. Over time, I believe that there will be a very significant take-up. Initially over half a million people will be directly affected. I think that figure will grow substantially. Lower-income earners are being told, `We'll make contributions.' More and more people are seeing the need to increase their level of savings for their retirement. People recognise that, even in 40 years time, at nine per cent, without something extra they will have a shortfall in terms of their expectations and living standards. 
And I put this to the Senate: how do we know that in 30 or 40 years time the Australian economy will be as robust as it is now? It is certainly going along very nicely, but if it is put in the hands of such irresponsible people as certain spokesmen of recent times we may not be in that fortunate position. I hate to suggest that, if the hands of those at the controls of government are not as responsible as they are at the present time, we may have to go down the track of a lot of countries in Europe which have to reduce retirement benefits. This is the situation where it really hurts.
There is no doubt about it. The measures this Commonwealth government has introduced will significantly improve people's retirement incomes. It is true that they might not meet people's expectations, but to meet people's expectations there also has to be some saving on their part. As a result of the age pension, the incentives that the Commonwealth government has provided and the superannuation guarantee, people are going to have a better standard of living than they would have had had these additional measures not been introduced.
It is a breath of fresh air to have such a measure. In fact, it is one of the most creative of the measures that have been suggested by the Liberal-National coalition in terms of lifting the levels of savings, particularly for lower-income earners. For example, moneys can be paid into the accounts of mothers who have had to take time out from the work force and then come back to the work force; they can get significant benefits out of this.
I commend the bills to the Senate. They will certainly increase the level of savings in this country and contribute very significantly to people's welfare when they retire. As earlier spokesmen have said, when this matter was put to a Senate committee there was overwhelming support for the concept of the co-contribution. Vince FitzGerald believed that overwhelming support would continue even if the contribution by the government was only 50 per cent of the contribution people made—50 per cent of every dollar they put in. But that is not the measure. The point is that it is a breakthrough in terms of philosophy and methodology. It is groundbreaking. It is going to be very significant in terms of the level of savings. There has always been a problem of how to creatively get those at the lower end of the spectrum of wage-earners in society to build up their superannuation accounts. Every contribution is going to be significant.
Like many other senators, I am grieved when people come to me and say, for example, that their sight is failing, they have an eye problem and it would take about $1,500 to $2,000 for an operation, they are not in Medibank and they have been told to wait 15 months to two years for an operation. Their standard of living during that period deteriorates because they cannot read or socialise and yet, if they had some money in the bank in the form of retirement savings, they could have the operation. 
We are living longer, and the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has indicated various measures which can be undertaken to make retirement savings much more attractive. We can make them much more attractive—because at the present time they are not all that attractive—by changing the format of complying pensions and annuities. At the same time, if we follow the recommendations of the Senate committee report—many of whose issues have been very much maligned in the Senate today and earlier—we will have complying annuities and pensions which are much more attractive to the providers. There will be a re-entry of the providers into the market, and they will certainly be much more attractive to the retirees themselves. This is what we must have. We must have a mix of lump sum, complying pensions, annuities, allocated pensions et cetera, as well as other investments. It is by getting the most desirable mix that people's incomes in retirement are going to be adequate to meet their important needs.
So, savings is an important issue. It must not be underestimated, and the superannuation committee have spent a lot of time on it. I notice the next contributor to this debate is going to be Senator Hogg, a very valuable contributor with experience within industry who recognises the need for savings and the need to protect those savings. I still think the challenge is out there. We have had an adverse report from APRA about the supervision that is being offered over superannuation accounts in Australia, and the challenge is now to APRA to lift their game and ensure that there is adequate, comprehensive audit and surveillance of people's superannuation savings, because we cannot afford for it to fail.
On the other hand, retirees must also plan to save more than they really think may be necessary. Why do I say that? Because there will always be occasions, over a 40-year period, when you get negative returns. A lot of superannuation funds factor these in as one in seven or one in eight years. When you retire you must also take account of a particular market slump if you are heavily into equities or, in particular, into property. That is why we have said superannuation funds themselves must provide better education to assist their members throughout the accumulation phase, but particularly before they retire because often they receive this big lump sum, they are out of the work force and they do need guidance. If we could have a move towards accumulation sums, so that some of these funds could provide income streams, I think we would have an improved superannuation system in this country.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-09-16,"—Having listened to Senator Watson speak on the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003, the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003 and the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003, I must acknowledge that Senator Watson, as a long-term Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, is probably far and away the most knowledgeable person on superannuation on the other side of the chamber. Having said that, when one looks at the issue of superannuation, it really gets to the heart of the third plank that I outlined in my original speech in this chamber about giving people dignity in retirement. I will lead on later to just where the shortfall in superannuation will be in giving people the dignity that they would expect. There is a difference, I will acknowledge, between expectations and what actually can be achieved but, having said that, let us look first at the initiative in the co-contribution. 
The co-contribution is going to be available to a maximum of $1,000 where an employee contributes $1,000 over 12 months to a superannuation fund or RSA. That maximum is going to apply to people who earn less than $27,500. Therein lies one of the fundamental problems of this government initiative. Whilst it is welcome, and it is targeting low-income people, it is targeting people who have the least capacity to contribute in their own right. I know that from being a long-term trade union official. The figure quoted there is getting close to the figure that a number of people earn in the retail industry and the fast food industry, where I have vast experience and know that many of these people live from hand to mouth. They do not have a great deal of discretionary income available to them to salt into something such as a co-contribution.
Whilst it appears attractive on the surface, the first issue that I must raise about the co-contribution is that, even if these people can afford to contribute the maximum of $1,000 and receive the maximum $1,000 contribution from the government, that in reality will be $850, if I read the legislation correctly, because that $1,000 will be subject to the contributions tax. That is something that has not been clarified to date in spite of the inquiries that I have made. You shake your head, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, but you should not be participating in the debate from the chair. Having said that, though, I have asked sources to clarify that. If it can be clarified in this debate, it will be helpful indeed. But if that is true then it is not the boon that it is made out to be. And if the $1,000 that the person pays in themselves—and that the government pays—is subject to the contributions tax then how is it going to be exempt from the contributions tax? Where in the legislation is it exempt from the contributions tax? Even if the $1,000 is put into the account in full, the fact of life is that, for many of those people, $1,000—which does not sound a great deal to many people—is $20 a week out of discretionary income and $20 which many of them would not have.
If one looks at the sliding scale, as was indicated by an earlier speaker, it cuts out at $40,000. Those people are on a weekly income of about $800 per week. Whilst they may well have a greater capacity to pay, because of the sliding scale from the $27,500 per annum income up to the $40,000, they will not attract anywhere near the same benefit as those who earn less than the $27,500.
—It is an after-tax contribution.
—Now that you are interjecting from your spot, Senator Watson, if it is an after-tax contribution it has not been made clear and has not been obvious to date. If that is the case, it is still but a mere bandaid in giving people a decent retirement benefit. Those people who have had a cursory look at this could come to the conclusion that this is something that will benefit those who are in a partnership where one of the partners is a high-income earner and the other earns less than $27,500. Of course, in that set of circumstances, it will be quite easy for $1,000 to be contributed on behalf of the lower income earner. But where the household income is only at a level of $27,500—and that was the point made by Senator Wong—then those people are going to struggle greatly to make a contribution anywhere near $1,000 and get the benefit of it.
As I understand it, and this is something else that needs to be clarified for me, the money, once placed in the superannuation fund, is preserved, as are all superannuation funds. I have no problem with that, but I do not know if the public understands that. I do not know if the public understands that these funds, once placed and once having attracted the benefit, are preserved. I am not saying that it is improper; I am just saying that there may well be confusion out there and that some people will see it as an opportunity to salt away some money for a time of need and then apply to get hold of it. You know and I know the difficulties— 
—It's not a bank account.
—That is right. I take that interjection from Senator Watson. It is not a bank account, but I just hope the public understands that. This effort, on the part of the government, is not about giving people access to a facility whereby they will be able to get a co-contribution and then, at some later stage, access it. There is no explanation that I can find, in relation to this bill, of the impact on the adequacy of the investment for the retirement of the superannuant.
—Just one measure.
—Yes, but there is no projection as to how that will pan out for the individual in the longer term. There is obviously a cost to the government of this initiative, and I do not believe that the initiative will be taken up with the force that the government is hoping for at this stage. It would be interesting to see if there is a model floating around which shows what impact this will have on pensions in the longer term. That would be interesting indeed, but I do not think it is available at this stage. 
I recall when we were looking at the adequacy of superannuation, and I was then a member of the superannuation committee, we did get a fair deal of modelling of what the benefits would be under certain circumstances, and a range of circumstances were covered. I am not going to go into them in this debate, but we did see the impact that making different changes in the superannuation mix had and how that would benefit individuals in the longer term. From my reading of the information that is around, that is not available. I would suspect, from what I am going to mention in a moment from an earlier report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, that the benefit is not going to impact greatly on the retirement benefit that is available for these people when they do reach retiring age. 
On that note, I am going to look briefly at the report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation entitled Superannuation and standards of living in retirement. It is a report on the adequacy of tax arrangements for superannuation and related policy, and it is dated December 2002. There are some interesting statements on page 140 in the report, where the committee looks at the modelling that was done by Treasury. At 12.30, the report says:
Treasury's modelling of retirement incomes reinforces the Committee's concern. As noted, Treasury's modelling using standard assumptions indicates that a single male aged 65, retiring in 2032 following 40 years in the workforce at 1.5 times AWOTE will draw 82 per cent of the age pension.
The report goes on:
For a single male in the same situation drawing exactly AWOTE, Treasury's modelling indicates that he will draw 90 per cent of the age pension.
That was the modelling that was done in that instance. The report, at 12.31, goes on:
By 2050, with a mature superannuation system, it is expected that the proportion of people aged 65 and over not receiving the pension will rise to around 25 per cent, and of those that do receive the pension, only about one third will receive the full rate.
The question that I have posed is: how will this initiative of the co-contribution impact, given what we have heard in terms of modelling that was done by Treasury, in terms of one and 1.5 times AWOTE? If my recollection is correct, we looked at 0.75 of average weekly ordinary time earnings as well. 
—But, Senator Watson, that has not been supplied this time around. It would be handy to see the impact of this measure and just how much it really will bite. The advisers might have it there, but to my knowledge it certainly has not been made available at this stage. The committee report went on to say:
However, in the Committee's view, to reduce pressure on the age pension, through a heightened emphasis on individual self-reliance, the Government should continue to strive for universal and adequate superannuation coverage for all Australians including employees, the self-employed and non-working people, with a focus on assisting low and middle income earners.
I think that that had it right, but I do not think that the prescription we have been handed up in this bill has got it right. Whilst it is laudable—and the co-contribution is there—and whilst it is targeted at people who are earning in round figures less than $550 a week, as I say, for many of those people the capacity even to start to maximise the return out of the co-contribution is going to be very limited indeed. So the expectations that the government have built around this cause some concern.
The other issue that I want to raise very briefly before I get onto the surcharge is about the indexation of the threshold. Again, this is not clear in what I have read to date in the bill. As I understand it, the threshold of $27,500 will not be indexed until the 2007-08 year. That is when the intention is to move the rate from $27,500. I am not sure what the indexation will be at that time or what it will take the rate to, but if one projects even a three per cent movement in salaries over that period of time then the way I read the initiative of the government at this stage—and I stand to be corrected—is that there will be people slipping down the schedule in the period between now and when the threshold is indexed in the 2007-08 year.
If that is correct—and I have to say that I am basing it on a three per cent increase in wages each year—it means that someone who is currently able to receive the maximum of $1,000, for example, on a salary of just less than $27,500 would move to a salary of roughly $28,000, which would see their co-contribution fall from $1,000 to $960. If the same three per cent applies in the 2004-05 year—if I am interpreting the bill correctly—their co-contribution will fall to roughly $880, then to $800 and then to $720. That is for someone who was just within the maximum limits to start off with. If that is not the case, what protection will there be in the bill for those people, to ensure that their rate of co-contribution is protected in the period between now and 2007-08, when I understand that the rate will be changed?
Of course, it affects those at the other end of the scale—let us say those earning around the $36,000 mark. If the scenario that I have painted there is correct, some of those people will fall off the co-contribution scale by 2007-08. If that is not the case then that needs to be cleared up. But all the inquiries that I have made to date have not had an answer that indicates that what I am saying is incorrect. So, whilst it is an effort on the part of the government to address the issue of long-term superannuation to give people security in their retirement, it falls well short of the mark in achieving what needs to be achieved in this area. A massive government commitment indeed will be needed to fund pensions in the longer term. Any action that can be taken now to alleviate that need is welcome. But, whilst this is an attempt on the part of the government to do so, it certainly does not go far enough.
I turn to the surcharge. One has to say that that is a very disappointing action by the government. As my colleague Senator Sherry has already indicated, the surcharge was a complex tax in the first instance. As Senator Sherry said, we opposed it because it broke the promises of the government. It took the government a long time even to admit that the surcharge was a tax. It took them a great deal of difficulty to come to grips with that. But, now that the government have gone down that path—now that we know that it is a tax—I must say that, in my view, it is a tax that targets people with the greatest capacity to pay. I know that that is not the government philosophy; it is the philosophy that I and my colleagues believe in: that those with the greatest capacity to pay should pay the greatest amount of taxation. It was a bungling tax that was put in place in the first instance—as you know, Senator Watson. It was a tax that was very complex. It was going to be very costly to collect and it was going to be costly to the funds. 
—But it was costly to all the people in the fund; therefore, reducing it and giving those people who are at the lower end of the income scale no benefit whatsoever, and giving those in the middle in particular absolutely no result out of this package, leaves a lot to be desired indeed. Senator Watson knows that when we did some of the modelling—and I am glad Senator Watson is here because he is helping me in this and it is always good to have his help—and looked at the adequacy of superannuation, we saw how the issue of contributions tax could be addressed to ensure that the accumulation that was coming to the superannuants was working to their benefit. The proposal that has been put forward in the second reading amendment by Senator Nick Sherry is commendable indeed because he advocates that there should be a cut in the contributions tax without specifying the amount.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-16,"—I am very pleased indeed to be able to sum up this debate on some landmark superannuation legislation to deliver some real and significant benefits to a wide range of Australians trying to save for their retirement. The government first foreshadowed the superannuation co-contribution for low-income earners and the surcharge rate reduction measures in its pre-election superannuation policy statement, A Better Superannuation System. The Prime Minister announced this policy on 5 November 2001, almost two years ago. The statement was designed to provide greater incentives for voluntary superannuation contributions and to make superannuation relatively more attractive compared with other forms of non-concession taxed savings. It also included measures to remove inequities in the system to improve security of superannuation benefits, to broaden the availability of superannuation to more Australians and to promote the value of lifelong saving. 
Among the measures to provide greater incentives for voluntary contributions was the government's superannuation co-contribution scheme. The government recognised that more incentives were needed for low-income earners to increase their level of voluntary superannuation saving, thereby achieving greater self-reliance in retirement. The scheme will replace the previous $100 low-income earner superannuation contribution tax offset. Another component of this package of measures was the proposal to reduce the maximum superannuation contribution and termination payment surcharge rates to encourage those who can afford to save for their retirement to do so and thereby take pressure off the future age pension system. 
As I announced on 7 September 2003, the government negotiated an agreement with the Australian Democrats to enable passage of both these measures, following the failure of the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003 to obtain a second reading in the Senate on 24 June this year. Savings generated from the smaller reduction in the superannuation surcharge rates will be applied to the co-contribution measure, thereby enabling the government to extend the parameters of the co-contribution scheme. The changes mean that the total pool of money spent on the co-contribution and surcharge rate reduction measures is now applied in favour of low-income earners in the proportion of 66 per cent to 34 per cent over the budget years 2004-05 to 2007-08.  
I foreshadow that in the committee stage I will move amendments to these bills to give effect to this agreement. In passing, I do commend the Democrats for the constructive approach that they have taken towards ensuring that the government can deliver these very important measures to Australians saving for their retirement. The co-contribution amendments will mean that people earning up to $40,000 will now qualify for a co-contribution if they make eligible personal superannuation contributions. This measure is a significantly greater incentive than the current tax offset it is replacing, which phased out on an income of $31,000, and will be a direct injection into the retirement savings of this category of people. 
In addition, the thresholds will be indexed from the 2007-08 income year onwards to maintain the relative target group of the measure. The co-contribution amendments also provide for the measure to now apply to eligible personal superannuation contributions made on or after 1 July 2003. Further to this, the date that superannuation providers must give statements for the purposes of the co-contribution will be prescribed in regulations to enable the government to provide industry groups with time to implement the necessary alterations to their systems. 
Finally, the co-contribution amendments also provide for additional reporting to the parliament on a quarterly and annual basis. These reports will cover the operation of the co-contribution measure, including details about the recipients and payments made. The surcharge rate reduction amendments will provide for a smaller reduction in the superannuation surcharge rates. Rather than reductions of 1.5 per cent per year for three years, the maximum surcharge rates will now be reduced by half a per cent in the first year and by one per cent in each of the two subsequent financial years. The reduction in the surcharge rates will also be delayed. Consequently, the reductions will commence from 1 July 2003. Together, these measures—that is, the revised co-contribution and surcharge measures—are significant steps in improving the availability and the attractiveness of superannuation. The measures remove some of the disincentive of the extra charge facing those who are able to save more for their retirement and will no doubt do so, and it will significantly boost the savings of lower income earners. I do commend these bills to the Senate. Whilst I seek the support of the Senate for the requests for amendments and the amendments in the committee, I note that the Labor Party will be opposing some of the amendments.
In the time left to me in my summing-up speech, I want to deal with some of the points raised by earlier speakers. The first point I wish to deal with was made by Senator Sherry. He said that reducing the surcharge rate is inequitable and provides an exclusive tax cut—which I think is what he said—to high-income earners. One of the main themes of the government's superannuation policy statement, A Better Superannuation System—launched during the election—was to make superannuation more attractive and to encourage all Australians, no matter what their income, to save for their retirement. The government's measure to reduce the superannuation surcharge is indeed a modest reduction in the charge over and above the tax that affected Australians pay on their superannuation. The surcharge rate reduction will go towards removing the disincentive facing employees who have the ability to save for their own retirement. This will—and is designed to—take the pressure off the pension system as our population ages so that those who really need it will be able to avail themselves of it. 
When you consider whether or not it is equitable to reduce the superannuation surcharge, a measure the government introduced—and, Senator Sherry said, boasted about—it is important to point out that, due to the budget surplus resulting from the economic and other good management of the government, the government can reduce a disincentive facing employees who have the ability to save for their retirement. It is no secret that I would have liked to have reduced the superannuation surcharge much more—and I think Senator Cherry said that he would have preferred to have not reduced it—but politics is all about compromise and about getting outcomes that are ultimately to the benefit of the Australian people. I feel very confident that we got that with this measure.
The next point dealt with by Senator Sherry, I think, was that parliamentarians will benefit from the surcharge reduction. Senator Sherry well knows that members and senators are treated no differently from other taxpayers and that parliamentarians also pay the charge over and above the tax that everyone pays. If the measure is criticised on that ground, there is absolutely no need for any parliamentarian—from the other side or, indeed, in the other place—to accept this reduction. I throw out this challenge to each and every one of you who criticises it: stand up, identify yourselves and say that you are going to give it back and that you will not accept it. I am very surprised that the Labor Party would oppose this modest cut. With all the sound and fury at the time the surcharge was introduced, it seems quite extraordinary that there is now a backflip—a U-turn—and that even a modest cut is opposed. The surcharge reduction is just part of a package of measures that quite rightly includes a generous government co-contribution of up to $1,000 per year that is available only to lower- to middle-income earners. That is why the package is fair.
I think Senator Wong said that only those taxpayers earning more than $94,000 will benefit from the surcharge reduction. I wish to take issue with that because it shows some misunderstanding of how the surcharge works. The surcharge thresholds relate to an individual's adjusted taxable income. The ATI—or adjusted taxable income—is a combination of taxable income, surchargeable contributions and reportable fringe benefits. Consequently, an affected individual's income could be significantly less than $94,691 but the individual could still be subject to the surcharge. I think Senator Cherry said that one concern about this is that the people who pay the surcharge are not all from the big end of town; some who pay the surcharge get tipped into doing so by circumstances. They may have had an interrupted work pattern, and that particularly affects women and part-time workers, or they might have been retrenched, got another job and tried very hard to save for their retirement but run up against the surcharge. That is not a desirable outcome. It is important that this is on the record so that those listening to this debate know that at least the Democrats and the government are concerned to try and alleviate some of the burden from that category of person facing the surcharge. 
Senator Wong also said that in her view it would be difficult—and, if I heard correctly, she said extremely difficult—for families to save any money so as to qualify for the co-contribution. It is hard to take this as a serious criticism. To assume that somehow or other those on low incomes are too poor to really count and to qualify for the co-contribution is very patronising. The government want to help ordinary workers save for their retirement. We think this is an honourable aim. We think it is important that those on low incomes are treated with some dignity and are given the opportunity to make what contribution they can to their own retirement, to their own savings, and that they should be given some assistance to do this.
The co-contribution measure provides an opportunity for low-income earners to take advantage of greater incentives than those that currently exist—and I have already explained the measure it is replacing—to improve their self-reliance in retirement by saving through superannuation. If they start early, they will do very well out of the co-contribution. Even if they are some way into what one might call their superannuation life—their time of making contributions to superannuation—every bit helps. Once again, it will mean they can have a better outcome than they would have if they were relying on the pension alone. As I have said, the government think this is important. Our estimate is that 540,000 low-income earners will receive a co-contribution in 2004-05. It is not only the government's view that this is a very positive thing; the Investment and Financial Services Association says that the co-contribution is likely to produce a significant increase in the number of people making voluntary contributions, and the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia—ASFA—claims that the measure has the potential to boost retirement savings for people on lower incomes. Indeed, they showed us some very high figures with respect to how retirement income could be enhanced by the co-contribution.
Senator Wong also spoke about the inadequacy of retirement savings. I must say I am completely taken aback that Senator Wong can stand in this place, suggest that retirement savings are inadequate and then suggest that the attempts of the government—and indeed, the Democrats—to increase savings should be opposed. It is more like a co-contradiction than a co-contribution. The co-contribution will provide a significant increase in the savings of lower-income earners and the modest surcharge reduction will encourage those who can afford to save for their retirement to do so. That is as it should be. Both of these measures are costed and on the table. It is up to the Senate now to recognise this package and to support these measures.
Senator Sherry also talked about wealthy households being able to use the co-contribution as a tax minimisation vehicle, which would be an important point if it were not jumping at shadows. The co-contribution is not a tax break; it is a contribution to retirement savings. There is also no evidence to support any assertion that only wealthy households will benefit from the co-contribution. Indeed, there is no evidence to suggest that the co-contribution will somehow become a tax minimisation vehicle. If there is some evidence, bring it forward. There is no evidence at all, so far as I can tell, that it is likely to be abused.
The co-contribution was said by Senator Hogg to be subject to contributions tax—at least he raised that question, which to a large extent proves that Senator Hogg is just spouting a speech rather than looking at the proposed legislation. Neither the original undeducted contribution nor the government co-contribution will be subject to the contributions tax. If Senator Hogg is listening, or if he cares to go back to the Hansard, I draw his attention to items 4 to 6 of schedule 1 part 1 of the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003, where he will find his answer. It indicates that those opposite have probably given this legislation a cursory look, or it would have been pretty obvious. Senator Hogg also wondered whether co-contributions are preserved. Of course, co-contributions mirror the treatment of the eligible personal superannuation contributions that they match. All personal contributions since 1 July 1999 are preserved until retirement and so are co-contributions. 
Some of the speeches made on the other side took what I would describe as a pretty churlish approach to a landmark agreement that is capable of delivering super benefits to Australians. It is surprising that these measures, which are overwhelmingly in the interests of a broad range of Australians, are opposed at all. Then again, we have to understand that superannuation and everything to do with it seems to excite opposition. The measures that are being brought forward in these bills have been welcomed generally in the community. They are overdue; they should have been delivered earlier than they have been. In the circumstances, it is incumbent on the Senate to support them.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-09-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I rise this evening to take note of the report of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. It comes at a most opportune time, of course, given the fact that in the last week we have seen one of the most comprehensive bungles by the federal government in the way that it treats some of its Defence Force members. I refer particularly to those 580 Army personnel around this country who are employed as combat clerks and storemen at bases around Australia. It has suddenly been discovered that the Defence Force are going to do something fairly negative about the level of pay that these personnel have been receiving for the last four years.
I take this opportunity to look at what the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal does throughout the year. While this is in no way a criticism of the tribunal—as I can see by its membership and the clarity and comprehensive nature of its report that it undertakes its tasks in a most professional manner—I am interested to learn that, in the introduction to this report, one of the functions of the tribunal is set out as being:
... to inquire into and make determinations in respect of prescribed matters that have been referred to the Tribunal.
The report says that, under section 58KD of the act under which the tribunal operates:
The Tribunal may, in making a determination, give effect to any agreement reached between the Minister, acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the Chief of the Defence Force, acting on behalf of the members of the Australian Defence Force, in relation to a matter to which the determination relates.
I also note that the report outlines the work the tribunal have done through the year and the matters that have been brought before them and dealt with over the period covered by this report.
It is interesting to note what is missing from the report—that is, what is missing not through any fault of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal but what is missing from the Australian Defence Force. The Defence Force have not bothered in the last 12 months to refer to the remuneration tribunal a matter relating to 580 combat clerks and storemen. I suspect that, if I went back three or four years and looked at the three reports published prior to this period of reporting—July 2002 to June 2003—I would probably find that this matter had not been referred to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal in that time, either. This alleged overpayment—as the Defence Force would determine it is, for want of a better word—came about because four years ago an agreement was entered into that provided for these Army personnel to be paid at pay group level 4. By and large, most of them have been paid at pay group level 4. They were going to be trained, or have been trained, as riflemen; they have skills over and above those of combat clerks and storemen. I understand that in the Army combat clerks and storemen are usually paid at pay group level 3, so this was probably an exceptional group of employees. But there is no doubt there was an agreement struck for this group of employees that they would be paid at pay group level 4. 
Four years later, the Army had a look at this and said: `Whoops. We can't actually do this anymore because the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal hasn't sanctioned it, and it hasn't been sanctioned in law.' It could have been rectified. I found out tonight that the minute this agreement was entered into—four years ago—the agreement could have been sent off to the tribunal for it to investigate and probably agree to. This matter could well and truly have been rectified by the Army many years ago. In response to a memo from me that was actioned by the Army, the Major General said:
I expect there will be a degree of concern and emotion over this issue.
The issue is this: the Army want to have pay group level 4 storemen and clerks paid at level 3 from the end of November and 1 December. That is without rhyme or reason; it is just because they have decided that is the case. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2003-09-16,"—Tomorrow we celebrate an important beginning for many Australians, for tomorrow is Australian Citizenship Day. As befitting such an occasion, it is a day we reflect upon sensitive issues of national symbolism. Recently the Hon. Gary Hardgrave, Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, released the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code. It is a valuable document and I congratulate the minister on his initiative. Among its many provisions, the code states that `there is great value in incorporating appropriate Indigenous elements into citizenship ceremonies'. It goes on to encourage the organisers of citizenship ceremonies to incorporate into proceedings such elements as a `Welcome to Country' ceremony which: 
... enhances awareness and understanding by new citizens ... of Indigenous culture and heritage and the status of Indigenous people as the first Australians.
The code also stipulates that the officer presiding over the citizenship ceremony:
... should publicly acknowledge the traditional inhabitants of the land where the citizenship ceremony is taking place.
The formula recommended in the code for presentation at citizenship ceremonies is expressed this way:
I recognise the living culture of the xxx people and the unique contribution they make to the life of the xxx region.
This is the code's recommendation; however, as we all know, the reality is very different. The formula I always hear at citizenship and other ceremonies is something like: `I acknowledge the XY peoples, the traditional owners of this land.' I believe it is right and it is proper to acknowledge and recognise the Indigenous contribution to Australia. However, in my opinion this formula, commonly used at citizenship and other ceremonies, is deficient. It is deficient for two main reasons: firstly, instead of uniting all of us, it perpetuates the segregation of Australians into two categories; and, secondly, in itself it is insufficient in that it fails to acknowledge the great debt we owe to other Australians who built this country.
Bruce Woodley, of the group the Seekers, writes in his famous song I Am Australian that `we are one, but we are many'. Unfortunately, for many on the Left we are not one; we are two—there are Indigenous Australians and then there is the rest. Indigenous Australians are the real and authentic Australians, while the rest of us are interlopers and uninvited guests. This is not a healthy world view to promote at citizenship ceremonies. Just when our nation is welcoming its new citizens and should be saying to them that they now belong to Australia and Australia belongs to them—that they own its institutions, its democracy, its rights of citizenship—we are reminding them that they do not and cannot really own this country: their title is defective; their ownership is somehow contingent upon someone else's. It is as if our new citizens are at best merely tenants in their new home and, at worst, tourists. Citizenship should entail a sense of ownership but this sort of statement fosters division.
This formulation feeds on the Left's signature polemic: its culture of resentment and its embracing of victimhood. Everyone, in the lexicon of the Left, is either a victim or an oppressor. For the Left, Australian history is the story of exploitation, racism, sexism and imperialism. Equality, or even fairness, is not at the heart of the contemporary bourgeois Left; rather, it is guilt and self-loathing. When the Prime Minister recently addressed the Liberal Party National Convention in Adelaide, he spoke about the loathsome `self-appointed cultural dieticians' that have prescribed what Australians must feel about themselves. While I have no doubt about the sincerity and good intentions of many of those who at citizenship ceremonies acknowledge the traditional owners of the land, I equally have no doubt that often this sort of statement is delivered by cultural dieticians with the intention of force feeding us guilt and self-loathing.
From the day new citizens swear allegiance to this country, they are invited to accept the claim that Australia's history is simply one of the expropriation of land, racism, sexism and every other evil characteristic imaginable. It makes you think: why would anyone want to migrate to such a country? Yet in this culture war there are those who do not subscribe to the black armband view of Australian history. For those of us—the mainstream—who do not form our opinion based on fashionable broadsheets and trendy broadcasters or spend our time preaching indignation and resentment, the story of Australia is seemingly more prosaic yet in fact far more moving. We believe that the Australian story is one of great achievement and that despite some shortcomings we are among the most egalitarian, fair and prosperous societies on earth. So when at citizenship ceremonies we acknowledge Indigenous Australians let us also acknowledge those men and women who tamed our harsh continent and, in doing so, brought into being one of the world's oldest democracies and most successful multicultural nations. 
This is not about downplaying the role of Aboriginal Australians but about celebrating in a much more inclusive manner the contribution all our ancestors of whatever race, creed or colour have made to building our country, regardless of whether they have lived here for 1,000 years or only for a few. Our new citizens should learn not only about the importance of Indigenous Australian history, as considerable and unique as it is, but also about the great debt we owe to all those who built our country—whether they be convicts, pioneering men and women, the Anzacs or the migrants who flocked to this country after World War II. So when we recognise the undisputed and valuable contribution of Indigenous Australians to our history, our culture and our society let us also add words such as these: `I would also like to acknowledge our debt and gratitude to all our forebears: the men and women of all races and religions who through their courage, hard work and determination made Australia one of the freest, fairest and most prosperous countries on earth.'
I know that the Left—the divisive, guilt-ridden, self-loathing, intolerant Left—will not like this. Recently, Mr Keating described those who rejoice in our national achievement as `lickspittles', `tintookies' and reactionaries with `tiny, timorous hearts'. And of course he did all of this before an adoring chorus of swingers and trendies like Phillip Adams, Pat Dodson, Bill Kelty and Robert Manne. Mr Keating said that he and his ilk will win the culture war. Let us disappoint him. Let us amend the Australian citizenship ceremonies code to add a more inclusive and positive recognition of the Australian achievement.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Citizenship Day</title>,Adjournment,27,1,speech

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2003-09-16,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
This answer is based on advice from Telstra and is substantively the same as the Telstra response to Question on Notice 123 from the Budget Estimates Hearings in May 2003.
(1)	Telstra has monitored the Australian Telecommunications Network (ATN) Inquiry by having staff present at Inquiry hearings. Telstra has attempted to minimise the cost of this by using local staff as much as possible, supported by staff from its corporate and government relations groups, as required. Telstra has advised that its decision to monitor the Inquiry by having staff present at the hearings reflects the company's concern to ensure that any relevant public interest and customer issues arising out of individual hearings can, if possible, be dealt with by the company on the day. 
(2)	Of the 18 hearings held to date, Telstra has given evidence at 5 of the hearings, and had at least one staff member present at 12 others. 
(3)	As outlined in the answer to part (1) above, Telstra has monitored the Inquiry through using a combination of local staff supported by other staff as required. Leaving aside the hearings at which Telstra has appeared as a witness, around 15 staff have attended at least one of the other hearings. Whilst some staff have been to more than one hearing, no single staff member has been in attendance at more than half of the hearings. Therefore it is not clear which staff member the Senator's question refers to.  
(4)	See answer to part (3) above.
(5)	See answer to part (3) above.
(6)	See answer to part (3) above.
(7)	On the assumption that this question relates to the individual staff member being referred to by the Senator, see answer to part (3) above.  
(8)	See answer to part (3) above.
(9)	See answer to part (3) above. 
(10)	(a) Telstra staff in attendance at individual hearings will generally provide feedback on the proceedings. (b) Feedback on individual hearings is generally given to relevant staff in Telstra's Corporate and Government Relations group so that they can progress any customer or service issues raised.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra: Australian Telecommunications Network Inquiry</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,29,1,answer
