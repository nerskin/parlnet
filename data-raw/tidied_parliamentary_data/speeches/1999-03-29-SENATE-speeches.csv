"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-29,"—I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
""but the Senate affirms the resolution passed by the Constitutional Convention in February 1998, which called on the Government to convene a further Constitutional Convention preceded by extensive community consultation if the November 1999 referendum is successful, in the following terms:
(1)	 That this Convention resolves that, if a republican system of government should be introduced by a referendum, at a date being not less than three years or more than five years thereafter the Commonwealth Government should convene a further Constitutional Convention.
(2)	 That two-thirds of such Convention should be directly elected by the people.
(3)	 That the agenda of such Convention would be to:
	 (i)	 review the operation and effectiveness of any republican system of government introduced by a constitutional referendum;
	 (ii)	 address any other matter related to the operation of our system of government under republican arrangements, including:
		 (a)	 the role of the three tiers of government;
		 (b)	 the rights and responsibilities of citizenship;
		 (c)	 whether the Commonwealth should have an environment power;
		 (d)	 the system of governance and proportional representation;
		 (e)	 whether the mechanism for constitutional change should be altered;
		 (f)	 constitutional aspects of indigenous reconciliation;
		 (g)	 equal representation of women and men in parliament; and
		 (h)	 ways to better involve people in the political process.
(4)	 That the Convention be preceded by an extensive and properly resourced community consultation process, to commence within 
 twelve months of the passage of a referendum to establish a republic in which ideas and responses on the above matters would be actively sought by the Government and Parliament."".
When the Senate last considered the Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill, I was, as I mentioned at the time, getting up a head of steam over this issue. It is sad in a way that, again, the debate on the bill is being tucked in just before lunchtime. The outcome might be that the average person in Australia, who we know shares an interest in the future and the Constitution, will not know that this legislation is being debated. On Thursday it was tucked in just before lunchtime and again on Monday it has been tucked in just before lunchtime. This means that people in the wider community are not hearing what we are saying on this very important issue.
When the debate was interrupted last week, I was talking about part of the contribution by Ms Christine Milne during the Constitutional Convention, Christine being one of the selected representatives during that debate. She was the selected representative for the Australian Greens in Tasmania. Christine supported the motion put forward by the Reverend Tim Costello which was very widely supported in the Constitutional Convention. That amendment was to provide a wider debate. I said I would get back to that amendment. It was that the convention resolve that, if a republican system of government should be introduced by referendum at a date being not less than three years or more than five years thereafter, the Commonwealth government should convene a further Constitutional Convention.
The amendment looked at the effectiveness of a republican system, addressed matters in relation to the system of government and stated that it be preceded—this, to me, was one of the most important issues—by an extensive and properly resourced community consultation process to commence within 12 months of the passage of a referendum to establish a republic in which ideas and responses on the above matters  should be actively sought by the government and parliament. 
I would like to see, in the process of passing this bill—and it is clear that there is support in the chamber for its passing—the chamber honouring that decision that was widely supported in the Constitutional Convention. Should the referendum prove that the Australian public are prepared at this stage to support the model that has been presented to them, I would like them to have a knowledge of the other elements, flawed though they might be, that came up through the Constitutional Convention. In this case I would like the decision made by the convention to look at the further process to be honoured.
This means that even though many of us were very disappointed at the way the Constitutional Convention was set up, somehow we should not allow the government to simply pick and choose what they think they would use out of the Constitutional Convention and not take it more widely to the people at this stage, which I think would be the appropriate thing to do before we went to a referendum. But that is by the by: it seems I have been overruled on this issue. However, if what we are having is `the model', without further refinement, debate and without consultation going to the community, the very least we need to do is to honour the further process that was set up and widely supported within the Constitutional Convention that, within five years, we start a process that makes sure the community has an involvement and that we start to consider the other elements of the Constitution.
If there is no support in the wider community to make sure that our Constitution matches our aspirations, then this will not go any further. If the community says, `We are totally happy with the Constitution that was put together more than 100 years ago, absolutely thrilled, and, although it is flawed, we'll just go along with it and maybe put a few bandaids on it,' then there is nothing that we need to worry about. But if we have a positive referendum, I am sure the wider community is expecting that there will be further discussions and that government funds—that is, taxpayers' money, their money—will be used to allow them to participate in this process. However well designed a 
 Constitutional Convention is—and the last Constitutional Convention was not well designed—it must have the benefit of information from the wider community. In my opinion, it is the wrong thing to do to go to the community with the final question and say, `Take it or leave it.'
There is something more that I should say about this second reading amendment. During the Constitutional Convention there was a further amendment moved by a Mr Elliott which looked at including the roles of the three tiers of government; the rights and responsibilities of citizenship; whether the Commonwealth should have an environment power, the system of governance and proportional representation; whether the mechanism for constitutional change should be altered; constitutional aspects of indigenous reconciliation; equal representation of women and men in parliament; and ways to better involve people in the political process. That was added by Mr Elliott and seconded by Cath Moore, who was the only elected Green representative to the Constitutional Convention. I will quote from Cath Moore's contribution at that stage. She was asked whether she wished to second the motion and she said:
Yes. I am one of those people who were elected to this Convention on a broad platform, and I welcome this amendment. This is not an exhaustive list; it is merely the beginning of some suggestions that we are putting to a group or a series of groups to take out into the community for community consultation. That is what we are on about, and that is what I hope people will support today.
To the people who are afraid of constitutional reform, I say: please be part of the process because, if you believe in the Constitution as it is, it is up to you to get into the community and argue to keep it as it is. But there are others of us who want to see it broadened so that it encompasses some of the things that we have highlighted during this Convention as being important in a move towards a democratic nation, whether or not that nation be a republic.
Those words were supported. The motion by Reverend Costello gained support, with the amendment by Mr Elliott. There is a concern that somehow or other with this whole move—which was strongly supported and, as I have mentioned before, the majority of candidates for the Constitutional Convention 
 were people on a maximalist platform—there is some honouring of the desire within the community of Australia to talk about the other issues in our model for democracy.
If the government is really interested in the outcomes of the Constitutional Convention which they set up, one would think they would honour that proposal. I do not know what their feelings are on that issue. I am grateful that the indications from the Labor Party are that they are prepared to support this, as are the Australian Democrats. At this stage, I am obviously unaware what Senator Harradine's position will be on this, but it is absolutely important. If we hear a negative response from the government on this issue, then you would have to wonder about whether or not this process is simply one to make a sideshow of the preamble, throw something to the community which is, in many respects, considered to be an unsatisfactory model and then say, `This is your only chance. This is all you get.' I obviously believe the process should be much better but if people believed there was a chance to further discuss the issues of a republic, then we may have some semblance of credibility in relation to the government on this issue.
If the government is saying, `We are going to put this referendum to you, take it or leave it, and by the way, the other elements of further community consultation are not part of the package,' then we would have to say, `This is a farce.' I guess that might achieve the government's aim in talking people into not supporting the first model because it is quite clear that those people who believe that a change to a republic—any change, any model—will eventually lead to the positive aspects of constitutional reform may discover that this first step might not be the one to take. It might be very attractive to the government not to leave people with that feeling that there will be further community consultation—some community consultation, not further—and that people will have a chance to put their views.
We have all sorts of inquiries in this place. What would be wrong—shock, horror!—with asking people to put in submissions about the Constitution? I know it would be a big pro 
 cess, but constitutional change is a big process. It does need to be properly funded. It does need to take time. That is not an overnight proposal; it is up to five years. I would be very interested to see what the government would say in not supporting that proposal. By the way, that vote in the Constitutional Convention supporting the motion by Reverend Costello plus the amendment was 102 in favour, 16 against and 32 abstentions. I do not think anyone could claim that this was not a very clear vote of support.
There is general concern about the commitment of the government to the process of moving towards a republic. I have mentioned the desire for people to talk about broader constitutional reform. But I believe we also need to cover the possibility of the referendum vote not being successful because of the bad process, because it has been put as a take it or leave it matter and because it is a compromise of a compromise. I know there are many people who believe this is not the right process. Because of the potential for that vote on an unsatisfactory model to be lost, I believe the people of Australia need to have a chance to be able to say in the not too distant future, `Okay, not this model but let's look further.'
I will also put by way of a third reading amendment a proposal that there should be a threshold question in a plebiscite on the issue of whether Australians wish to move towards a republic at the time of the next federal election. You choose those kinds of times to save the taxpayer money. I do not know of many people who do not want that threshold issue to be debated. Ideally, for many people, that issue should have been considered first.
I have looked at ways of trying to include that proposal in the  Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 , but it is very difficult within the wording of the bill. Perhaps the government wrote it like that—who knows. However, if the current model—the compromise of the compromise of the compromise—is not considered by people in Australia to be good enough, the process is not considered to be good enough and needs further work or a number of people either do not like it or feel it needs further work, there must be a way, if 
 the government was honest, of being able to work out whether or not in general the community wished to move in that direction.
I now turn to the opposition, who have indicated to me that they will not support this proposal. I will be really interested to find out from the Labor Party why this is the case because, quite frankly, I know there are many people who would otherwise vote Labor who think there should be this threshold question. I know it was Labor's preference that the question be asked first. But, given that that is not the case, I see no reason why, if this model does not get support within the Australian community, we cannot commit to the proposition that we will look further and at least ask in a plebiscite whether or not the community of Australia wants to move in that direction. And then whoever is in government would be able to take the necessary steps to make sure that a proper process takes place. I have run out of time but I really think these are key issues. The Labor Party has to think carefully about their position and who they are representing on this issue.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-03-29,"—I rise to debate the Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 1999  on behalf of the Australian Democrats as their spokesperson on republic issues. I begin by indicating our support for the amendments that have been mooted by Senator Margetts on behalf of the Greens (WA). The Democrats have long argued both in the lead-up to the Constitutional Convention and in recent days with the preamble being released by the Prime Minister that there is a need for great deal of community involvement and consultation in the process of constitutional reform.
I am very pleased to hear Mr Elliott's name mentioned in this place. Mr Mike Elliott MLC is the Leader of the Australian Democrats in my home state of South Australia. It is not surprising to me to hear that he was responsible for that amendment to the motion at the Constitutional Convention, looking at a broader area of debate and reform discussion as we move to, hopefully, the next Constitu 
 tional Convention—something that the Democrats support.
It gives me pleasure to speak for the first time we have had legislation that relates to the republican referendum that will be taking place in Australia later on this year. I stand here as a member of the Yes Committee that has been recently formed and I am an ardent republican, as indeed is my whole party. The Democrats long ago balloted and committed themselves as a party to supporting the change to an Australian head of state. We all look forward to being involved in what is a broad-ranging and inclusive debate as we head not only to the next millennium but also towards November and hopefully a successful result.
I welcome the changes contained in this legislation, which are primarily to facilitate the dissemination of the cases for and against an Australian head of state and, of course, to put the question of the new preamble to our Constitution to referendum. This legislation provides for the questions relating to the transition to a republic and the insertion of a new preamble to be posed on separate ballot papers. The Democrats consider that an important step in ensuring that these issues are dealt with properly and separately and are not confused at the ballot box. I think most people agree with that notion.
Both these issues are intensely important and have great political and symbolic value. I think all steps should be taken to ensure they are treated as separate issues. I also note that this bill rectifies an error in the legislation relating to the folding of postal ballots. It replaces an original stipulation where ballot papers had to be folded to conceal candidates' names. I understand that has now been changed to conceal the vote, which seems quite appropriate.
In particular, I welcome on behalf of the Democrats the provision which enables the cases for and against the change to a republic, as well as a preamble, to be put on the Internet. Access to information on these  issues through as many avenues as possible is something we support. We hope it will lead to a most inclusive and informed debate. For those people in regional and remote areas, younger 
 people and members of the broader community, the Internet is becoming an increasingly important channel and source of information.
In the 12 months to November last year, more than four million Australian adults accessed the Internet—approximately one-third of the adult population, which is actually a 49 per cent increase from February 1998. People will note that the Internet was one of the largest sources of information for those members of the community wanting to be informed about the goings on at the Constitutional Convention. Delegates were flooded with email. People accessed the site—I think it was the ABC web site—that provided ongoing information about the Constitutional Convention. That is exciting.
I hope that some of the excitement, some of the elation and some of the vigorous debate that was part of the Constitutional Convention in February last year will be recaptured as we head towards November and the referendum. I hope that we will see people talking about this issue in the community in pubs, clubs and schools—you name it. I have already put on record my affection for Mark Warren's slogan—`Put the pub back into republic'—because it is not just a debate for politicians or the elite. It is a debate that has to take place in our community at every grassroots level. So I hope that we will recapture some of that excitement—and the community was excited. Regardless of their political or constitutional views, people were engaged in this debate. I thought it was a good sign and, for that reason, the Democrats support one of the amendments moved today that relates to that.
We are on record many times as acknowledging some of the flaws, not of the model that arose from the Constitutional Convention but of the Constitutional Convention itself—the original notion that people should be half elected, half appointed. We put on record very early our concerns about that democratic make-up. However, I believe that, in the end, the Constitutional Convention was a very broad, very representative chamber. Certainly I found it far more representative than the current make-up of the federal parliamentary chambers, and I do not think anyone here would disagree with me. When it came to not 
 only representation of different ages, backgrounds and views but also indigenous and non-indigenous representation, it was exciting for that very reason, and I would like to see that replicated in the form of another Constitutional Convention in future years.
Cutting the frayed apron strings tying us to the UK is very much the first step in asserting our unique national identity. The transition to a republic and, of course, the insertion—hopefully—of a new preamble into our Constitution symbolise our development from a colonial outpost to a truly independent nation which acknowledges its full history and, I hope, the legitimate position of the traditional owners of this country.
Over the past 100 years, and in the last decade in particular, Australians have engaged in a wide-ranging and passionate debate over our identity and our future. This has canvassed issues such as the degree to which our future lies in Asia, how to cope with globalisation and reform of our social and economic institutions. In my opinion, all of these issues and more are encompassed by the republic debate. While some have denigrated the republican debate as a somewhat second order issue, one more to do with symbols than with political and economic decisions, I do not think the importance of symbols in our self-perception can be underestimated. I believe it is a crucial issue, and it is a crucial time to be considering this change, as we move closer to the centenary of Federation and the new millennium.
Over the course of the century, we have seen massive changes—radical changes—in policy. We have seen the abandonment of a white Australia policy and opened our shores to waves upon waves of new Australians. We have discarded terra nullius and recognised the need for reconciliation between Australia's indigenous and non-indigenous people. We have adopted universal suffrage and we have rejected discrimination on the basis of race, disability, gender, age and sexuality—not quite enough when it comes to sexuality, but we have got a private member's bill to deal with that issue. It is important that the outdated and discarded symbols and institutions that 
 we have are replaced with ones more appropriate to our needs as a mature nation.
The passage of this legislation enabling the referendum through parliament will afford opportunities to scrutinise various problems that may exist with the model. One of the primary concerns that the Democrats have with the model in its current form is the diminution of the role of the Senate. It is something that I put on record very strongly at the Constitutional Convention, and it is something that Senator Andrew Murray and other Democrat senators have put on record. If, through the combined efforts of the range of republicans, the referendum is successful and we achieve a republic, I hope that we will adhere to the commitment made at the Constitutional Convention to a second Constitutional Convention—a sequel of ConCon or `son of ConCon'—to review the operation of the model and to address further issues of wide constitutional change. I hope that this second Constitutional Convention will be just as important, if not more important, than the original, because this will give us an opportunity to evaluate alternatives, remedy the flaws and look towards greater, broader constitutional reform. This referendum is a vital part of a process to achieve a Constitution that truly reflects the state of the Australian nation.
Another equally important part of this process is incorporating a more expansive representative preamble into our Constitution which, hopefully, recognises the values that underpin the society that we have come to be and wish to remain, and which recognises the original owners and occupants of this land. The recognition of civil values such as representative parliamentary democracy, the rule of law, equality before the law, cultural diversity and respect for the environment are hardly radical in the context of today's society, and they are certainly worth protecting and enshrining in our Constitution.
We are already a signatory to a number of international treaties giving effect to these enduring and inalienable rights, and we should not be afraid to recognise them in our Constitution, even if we persist with the clause that nullifies their legal effect. So, if 
 people are really scared about putting some of these words in, that is a fall-back to reassure them.
I acknowledge that drafting a preamble is a very difficult task. It involves determining the common vision and the values of a nation and expressing them in a way that has the potential to make us feel proud, inspired and wanting to celebrate that vision. If ever there was a document that should engage as many Australians as possible in its drafting—a document that most Australians should feel proud about and have a role in creating—it is the preamble. But the preamble released last week by the Prime Minister can only be considered a draft, surely. We cannot be expected to go to a referendum with a preamble written by the Prime Minister and one or two of his mates. That is unacceptable and I suggest the majority of the community believes that too.
We do welcome the Prime Minister's offer for some community comment up until 30 April, and my leader, Senator Meg Lees, has written to the Prime Minister taking him up on that invitation. But it is not enough. We have got to ensure that this process is given back to the people and that Australians have an opportunity. I do not know what the Prime Minister's mailbag has looked like in the last few days but, in speaking to other members, all of our mail has been on this issue—Australians having ideas, making suggestions, expressing their concerns and wanting a say. The Prime Minister should be statesmanlike enough to recognise that and to at least involve them, if not incorporate their views. We recognise that the legislative timetable on this issue is extremely tight but we would like to see greater enthusiasm from government members for people to have a say.
Criticising sectors of the community as `narrow, petty, short-sighted' is absolutely outrageous. That is something we heard on record from the Prime Minister last week. A preamble is of little worth unless it is inclusive and resonant. Women, indigenous representatives and members of the ethnic community were among the first to criticise the draft released. Refusing to `placate special 
 interest groups' is not what the process of drafting a preamble is about.
The lack of full recognition of the ongoing rights of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders is a serious omission. Their place in the preamble should be about more than simply an acknowledgment of their continuing culture. Honouring their culture is one thing, but recognising their ongoing rights and custodianship of this land is more than appropriate. The Prime Minister began his second term with a commitment to reconciliation. A refusal on his part to consider greater recognition of the rights and status of Australia's indigenous people will see him once again miss out on a great opportunity for achieving meaningful reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.
Similarly, he should be wary of assuming that words that might come easily to him and might resonate with people of his generation will be as acceptable to everyone in our uniquely diverse Australian community. Everyone acknowledges that the use of the term `mateship' has drawn criticism. I acknowledge it is a colloquial term that has been included to evoke the camaraderie—if you like—that has come to define this nation and the relationships among Australians. However, it is a blokey term. It is one which is not popularly used by women, indigenous people or young people, and it has struck a jarring note. I put on record that people disagree with that view and they are entitled to do so. The people who have expressed concern about those words—certainly to my office—have particularly been women, young people and indigenous Australians. It has struck too much of a jarring note to be considered for inclusion.
I draw the Senate's attention to the article by Adele Horin in the Sydney Morning Herald over the weekend, who talks about the distinction between friendship and mateship. It is quite a persuasive article. One of the best aspects of this article is the sentence: `Language matters.' Indeed it does. Language is powerful. It is symbolic. The Prime Minister knows this, otherwise he would not have used certain words and not others—certain words that he may have considered to be a rebuke 
 to political correctness. He acknowledges the value and importance of words.
It is important for us in this chamber to recognise that language evolves. Language changes, too. Words take on different meanings. Words that were relevant maybe decades or even a century ago may not be used today or may have different definitions or evoke different feelings and ideas, depending on who is using them and who is hearing them. So let us not pretend that language does not matter. Language also has the ability to inspire, and that is what we should be seeking to do with the use of language in a preamble.
Perhaps most strange was the Prime Minister's claim of the rebuke to political correctness. In the past, this government has decided that certain values and aspirations are politically correct, thus discrediting reconciliation, feminism, protection of the environment and immigration. I do not even know if multiculturalism is still a word that is utilised by government or not. I remember that at one stage it was considered not appropriate by some members of government. So we do acknowledge that language changes; language has power. It is symbolic.
However, all these values were recognised at the Constitutional Convention by delegates of all persuasions and from a diverse range of backgrounds. They all considered them as worthy of inclusion in the preamble. The Constitutional Convention recommended references to federalism, the rule of law, cultural diversity, the unique land and environment of this country, equality of all before the law, gender equality and the continuing rights of Australia's indigenous people. None of these has really found expression in the Prime Minister's draft preamble.
Talking to the SBS Insight program last Thursday evening, Dr Brendan Nelson MP made the following, quite remarkable, statement:
Perhaps we are choosing the wrong vehicle through which to achieve the things that we all aspire to be. Perhaps in fact we need an Australian declaration of values, beliefs and national aspirations, and the preamble of the Constitution may not be the right place to do that. 

This misunderstands the nature of a preamble, which should be about recognising the shared values, rights and aspirations of our nation. Rather than rebuking fashion, it would be far better to recognise the continuing, inalienable and universal rights that are the true protection for us all against prejudice. These are rights that have already been recognised. We have actually bound ourselves by them in declarations in international treaties such as the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights.
Our vision in framing a new preamble should be bold and broad, covering the elements of our way of life and society which we cherish, such as our rich ethnic, cultural and spiritual diversity, our unique and fragile environment, the rule of law and the equality of all before it. The founders of our nation were not timid in their vision, nor should we be at the turn of the next century. The Prime Minister should be commended—and I do put this on record—for putting the question of a new preamble to the people. It is a bold move, a positive move of constitutional reform, appropriate to our move to a new millennium and the celebration of our nation's centenary.
However, the Prime Minister's part in this process is largely over. Having presented his version, it is now time to hand over this process to all Australians. Only by seeking comments from all Australians will we be able to discover what our common vision is and what our common values are, and to enunciate them in a form likely to gain sufficient support at referendum. Australians may not take up this challenge. I note that one senator suggested last week that the whole process was pretty dull. I am not sure who that is a reflection on. Nevertheless, whether the process was dull or not, some people might not be interested in this debate. But if people are, let us give them the opportunity to have a say; they must be given that opportunity. It is the Australian people who will ultimately decide whether the draft preamble is acceptable.
The reaction to this early draft suggests much change is required if we are to secure a yes vote. But like many people, I am excit 
 ed by this process. I am cautiously optimistic that we are going to see an amended version of that preamble go to referendum, partly as a result of modifications suggested by the people and other legislators and decided by the parliament. I am looking forward to a vigorous debate and discussion. I am cautiously optimistic that we will resolve our differences over words and principles to give form to our vision of a truly independent nation and that our words will sing.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-03-29,"—I want to commend the previous two speakers, Senator Margetts and Senator Stott Despoja, for the positive contribution they have made to this all important debate on the Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. It is a debate about the direction of Australian democracy and the direction and cohesion that we as a people, as a republic, take as we go into the next millennium. It is also about the process that we undertake to ensure that the best comes of this historic opportunity to redesign the Australia that we are all so committed to and proud of.
Hovering above all of this is an impending feeling that there will be failure, that the process is not proceeding correctly. In this chamber last year I held strongly that, at the outset, there ought to have been a referendum asking the people of Australia whether or not they wanted a republic. The question ought to have been, in essence, whether or not we wanted a foreign head of state to remain as the head of state of this country. I have no doubt that such a referendum would have passed. The people of Australia would have wanted a republic. From there we ought to have been proceeding, through vigorous public debate, to the form of that republic and what else we might do about a Constitution which is showing shortcomings a century after it was devised by the men who took on that task.
That is why I will be supporting Senator Margetts's amendment at the end of proceedings on this legislation that, if the referenda fail at the end of this year because of the shortcomings in the process, there nevertheless be another referendum putting the simple question to the people of Australia about a 
 republic—a plebiscite. If the referenda do fail I feel that, under those circumstances, the people of Australia will nevertheless want it to be known that the time has come for Australia to become a republic.
I will also be supporting Senator Margetts's excellent amendment calling for the findings of the Constitutional Convention to be implemented. This is an important matter. A year ago we were debating the set-up of that Constitutional Convention, and there was great criticism not only about the form of voting for delegates to the Constitutional Convention but also about the fact that the government was loading the convention. I maintain that all delegates to that convention ought to have been elected. Nevertheless, the convention proceeded and I might add, and you will remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I changed my vote in this chamber, along with Senator Harradine, to ensure that the convention did proceed.
What we are now witnessing, however, is selectivity as to the outcomes of that convention as far as the government is concerned. We are not seeing the full outcome of that convention, as expressed by a diverse group of people getting together and coming to an agreement with a great deal of heartache, being followed up by the government. That was inherently the Prime Minister's promise, and that is what we should now be seeing.
Senator Margetts has brought forward a second reading  amendment which would put into effect the outcomes that the people who were at the Constitutional Convention required if they were going to give assent to the procedure now being undertaken towards a republic. These are important matters. Not least was the requirement that, in the event that a republic were voted in, there be a second Constitutional Convention  where, after a maximum taking of opinion, debate and dissemination of information to foster that debate, the people of Australia would have a say in the changes to the Constitution. These changes could relate to important things, like the role of the three tiers of government, the rights and responsibilities of citizens—we do not have a bill of rights in this country—and 
 whether the government should have an environment power.
You know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that we are seeing legislation before this parliament at the moment that removes a huge amount of the environmental powers and obligations to international treaties from the federal government and puts them back to the states. So we have a government that is actually going against the spirit of an aggregation of environment power, a power and responsibility of the Commonwealth when it comes to issues of national importance like the forests, the environmental ethos of the indigenous people of this country, our global responsibilities on issues such as global warming and our need to ensure that we reverse the degradation of the environment of this wonderful land of ours in the coming century.
The delegates at the Constitutional Convention wanted further discussion involving the people of Australia about the system of government and proportional representation; in other words, a fairer system of democracy in this nation—that we should catch up with the rest of the world and more advanced, more representative forms of government. Other issues for discussion are: whether the mechanism for constitutional change should be altered—largely, whether people should have more say; constitutional aspects of indigenous reconciliation; equal representation of women and men in parliament, an important debate which has been raging for decades in Europe and which is a very good one for us to take up in this country; and ways to better involve people in the political process.
The motion that called for that second Constitutional Convention was put forward by Mr Tim Costello and seconded by the then Tasmanian Greens leader, Christine Milne. It is important that we honour that outcome of the convention because it was known by, in particular, the government and the Labor Party that, without that motion succeeding, the outcomes of the Constitutional Convention would not have occurred—the yes vote would not have been there.
I will be seeking from both the government and the opposition during the committee stage 
 of this debate a renewal of commitment to those outcomes at the Constitutional Convention. I do not want to be part of a process which welshes on the commitment made at that convention by all parties, including the government, to a further Constitutional Convention aimed at implementation of the outcomes of ongoing public debate about the direction in which our nation should be headed.
That brings me to the matter of the preamble itself. The Prime Minister has arrogated, with some very limited advice, the business of writing a preamble. I can understand his excitement about that. I can understand that he wanted to be remembered as the inspiration for a key piece of national identity in terms of the constitution. But it was very likely to fail in anybody's hands and, in this Prime Minister's hands, it has failed.
The preamble that he has released does not excite the imagination or the passion of Australians as a whole. It has excited more division than it has excited cohesion. It has clear shortcomings which ought not to have had the Prime Minister's imprimatur. It would have been a much better process to have established a means of enabling representatives of the community to have an input into a preamble and, as other speakers have suggested, to have at least opened up the opportunity for there to be a number of preambles that could go to the people. That would not have been too difficult.
A couple of decades ago, the people had a choice of national anthem. I must say it was a surprise; I thought Waltzing Matilda would have got up. But it was the very words of Waltzing Matilda—not the magic of the melody—that was thought inappropriate by the voters, who gave us Advance Australia Fair instead. That was a judicious vote by Australians at that plebiscite. As Senator Stott Despoja says, the power of words is almightily important in these matters when we think of ourselves as a people and as a nation. That would have been a better way to go. I would advise the Prime Minister to reconsider now while there is time.
I have noted the numerous preambles that have been in the press and elsewhere in the 
 time since the Prime Minister released his preamble. In my opinion—and it is no better than that of anybody else—the majority of those preambles are superior to that which the Prime Minister has released. I am charmed, to say the least, by the inordinate clarity of thinking of young Australians in this matter. On a number of occasions I have seen preambles coming from high school children in Australia which have the magic that we are seeking and which have the feeling that we are seeking.
I do not know whether it is because, as we get older, we tend to get harder and tend to lose the beauty of language and commitment, and the feeling of oneness and direction which seems to be so well evoked by these young scribes; but I would feel much safer if a number of them were brought together and told to polish some of the work—although it does not need polishing—to find a common result. That could be put out with the Prime Minister's preamble in the referendum. I would bet my boots that the young people's preamble would win out in those circumstances.
I endorse wholly the feeling of frustration that the Prime Minister's preamble does not do more than `honour' the culture and long-time relationship with Australia of the indigenous people of this country. That is not the stuff of reconciliation, let alone the stuff of true, abiding and full recognition of the phenomenal contribution that the indigenous people of Australia make to us all as a nation. It does not recognise theirs as the fundamental culture that marks us out in this world, let alone their sovereign rights as the indigenous people who pre-dated the coming  of the rest of us in this wonderful community. Their relationship with the land is such an important talisman. It is a relationship we need to re-establish if we are going to avoid going into the next century with the degradation of the environment that has been catastrophic in the two centuries since non-indigenous people arrived in this country.
The Constitutional Convention called on the writers of the preamble to acknowledge that environment. They said that the preamble should have an `affirmation of respect for our 
 unique land and environment'. What did the Prime Minister do with that? Rather than an affirmation of respect for our unique land and environment, he came up with these words:
Our vast island continent has helped to shape the destiny of our Commonwealth and the spirit of its people.
He came up with a comment on history. The Prime Minister apparently does not have a relationship with or love of the land itself—our vast open spaces; our magnificent river systems; our wonderful coastlines; our grand forests, including the tallest forests in the Southern Hemisphere, and rainforests; and our unique wildlife, which is as diverse as the environments of this country it inhabits.
There is no feeling of that in here; it is absent. It is not only an opportunity missed but it is an opportunity denied because the Prime Minister, and sadly those few who were helping advise him, apparently do not have that connection, that passion, which I think is central to this nation's feeling of difference from the rest of the world as well as its feeling of pride in itself. And no-one could go beyond the passion of the indigenous people and their spiritual relationship with the land in measuring that passion. But you only have to look at the post-invasion poetry and song and history of this country to know how important that heart relationship we all have with the land is. To have it missing, to have it denied by the Prime Minister's preamble, even after the call of the Constitutional Convention to make sure it was specifically there, is not good enough. It is a failure to rise to the occasion. It is actually an indication that, for whatever reasons, the prime ministerial leadership in this country is not consonant with the feelings of the people of this country as a whole.
I will go to the second last sentence of the Prime Minister's preamble. There is a lot more I could say about it. The sentence says:
Australia's democratic and federal system of government exists under law to preserve and protect all Australians in an equal dignity which may never be infringed by prejudice or fashion or ideology nor invoked against achievement.
Come again? Ask the average punter, myself included, what that means. I dare to say: ask 
 the Prime Minister what that means. If there is going to be one thing that should be basic to constructing a preamble, it is clear, unambiguous language; clear, unambiguous English.
Let me deconstruct part of this sentence. Is the Prime Minister really meaning that under law Australians have an equal dignity which may never be invoked against achievement? That is what this says. So is our dignity on the altar of achievement seekers? Does the dignity of our people as a whole have to be sacrificed to those who want to achieve their ends by knocking down forests, by ripping up national parks, by riding across the top of indigenous people's wishes or by overlooking the interests of minorities? Is that really what the ethos of this country is? That is what the Prime Minister is saying here, if you ask me.
I am not going to sign off on such a poorly written sentence which, if dissected, has such a dastardly outcome. It is almost incredible that that sentence could have been forthcoming from the Prime Minister's office as an offering as to what might inspire Australians. Again we see the blinkered vision of the Prime Minister. He means well. He wants to see this nation united under his vision. But, because of his vision, he comes up with a tract for division.
We have a long way to go in this debate. I hope the Prime Minister will be able to take a greater reference back to the Australian people, back to the Constitutional Convention and even to the wider field of view there is in this place before we are saddled with that sort of preamble.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I rise to speak on this bill, the Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 . The basic purpose of this bill is to provide a more flexible arrangement for the expenditure of funds in the education program to the Australian public other than what is normally provided for in the normal referendum legislation, which is to fund a yes case and a no case to be circulated during the last period leading up to polling day. We in the opposition have no objection to the arrangements in this bill as far as that funding arrangement is concerned. As I understand it, 
 the proposals came out of recommendations from the Constitutional Convention held some 14 months ago, and very successfully, in the Old Parliament House here in Canberra.
I rise to speak on this bill as a person who has had a particular interest, even before I was a senator, in the issue of whether Australia should be a republic. As far as modesty permits me, I say that one of the facts I am proud of in my political life is that I moved the resolution at the 1991 national conference of the Labor Party committing the Labor Party to a policy to achieve a republic in Australia by the centenary of Federation, 1 January 2001. In those first years after 1991 I took on, with several others, the responsibility of publicly promoting that desirable change. Of course, I was delighted when the Australian Republican Movement was established and I became a founding member.
I was particularly delighted when Mr Keating, in coming to the prime ministership at the end of 1991, immediately began promoting the need for Australia to become a republic and to have its own constitutional identity without equivocation or confusion. Mr Keating has to be given great credit for advancing the republican cause like no other person has in Australia's history. Just as Sir Henry Parkes was considered the father of Federation for the work he did in the 1890s, Paul Keating will certainly be recognised as the father of the republic when it is achieved in the near future.
The case is unarguable that we need to have an Australian head of state in our republic. It seems to me that most Australians now agree when you ask them, `Do you think we should have a citizen of our own as our head of state?' If you ask them that or whether it should be a citizen of another country, the answer—by nearly two-thirds of the Australian people—is for an Australian head of state. When the question is asked, `Should you have a republic?' the numbers are less because the republic has different connotations in different people's minds. But there is no doubt that any sensible Australian wants to have the honour of having one of their own—or, as Paul Keating said, `one of us'—as our president and as our head of state.
It is amazing that some people say, `We have a de facto republic anyway because the Governor-General is the head of state.' If you read the Constitution—of which I have a copy here signed by Sir William Deane, the Governor-General, on my swearing in as a senator for my present term on 20 August 1966—it is quite clear the Governor-General is not our head of state. He represents the present Queen of the United Kingdom, as her representative in Australia. I think it is one of the great fictions that the monarchists have used to say, `We don't need to change the Constitution—we are a republic in all but name.' If we are one in all but name, why not make it clear that we are a republic and have an Australian citizen as the head of state?
Some people say that, in constitutional and in recognition terms, it does not matter. It does matter. It is demeaning. In recent times we have had examples of how demeaning it is not to have our own citizen as our head of state. For example, in the early part of this decade Bill Hayden, as the Governor-General, visited France to be part of the commemorations—I think on the 75th anniversary—of those awful battles in which tens of thousands of young Australians died in the First World War on the Somme. He was going there to pay tribute to that contribution to the defence of France in the First World War. But what did the French government do? They treated him as a low level official. He was accorded no recognition of a head of state.
Some junior clerk, I understand, from the French government met him at the airport. He was given no recognition as head of state because the French government said quite rightly, `You are not the head of state. You only represent the head of state.' I find that particularly demeaning in view of the fact that there are 40,000 dead Australians lying in France who over 3½ years heroically defended French sovereignty from German invasion.
We have another example with Mr Hayden. He was planning a visit to Kazakhstan, one of the new central republics formed out of the break-up of the old Soviet Union. When a notice was sent to the Kazakhstan government that he wanted to visit, they said, `Who is Bill 
 Hayden, the Governor-General?' and someone said, `He represents the Queen of the United Kingdom as Australia's head of state.' So the Kazakhstan government sent a note to the British Ambassador in Kazakhstan: `Can you find out whether the Queen agrees that Bill Hayden visit this state as her representative to our country?' So the British Ambassador had the privilege of passing a message back to the Kazakhstan government saying, `We think it is all right for Bill Hayden to visit.' Is that the sort of business that we want to continue with? This is absolutely demeaning to Australia.
Someone has said—and Gough Whitlam made this change in 1973—that we have the Queen now being called `the Queen of Australia'. She is only the Queen of Australia when she is in Australia. She can never be the Queen of Australia anywhere else in the world. And the future heir to the throne, Prince Charles—as the next King of the United Kingdom and our head of state—is now on the public record as saying he supports the agricultural policy of the European Community. That policy absolutely discriminates against Australian farmers. How can we put up with having the next head of state of Australia going around saying, `I favour French, Belgian and German farmers ahead of Australian farmers'?
It is an extraordinary position to be in. Any country with self-confidence in what it wants would say, `Never. No. Let's get rid of this fiction,' and whenever I again here somebody saying, `We really have a republic already. We do not need to bother about it because the Governor-General is our head of state,' that will be a fiction that has to be hit right on the head. The monarchists and their fellow travellers on this are just making a deliberately confusing statement to defend a system that only a third, at the most, of Australians now support.
I have to say that the Queen has been absolutely impeccable on this issue. She has said it is a matter for the Australian people to decide and that, if they decide to have a republic, she will respect that. But put it around the other way: we now have a head of state whom only 30 per cent of Australians 
 support. Even if the referendum was unfortunately lost later this year, how could you go on having a head of state whom only 30 per cent of the people support clearly and positively? So I make it clear here that the fiction has to come to an end and that, for those of us who have argued for change since the late 1980s and early 1990s, the time has come for this referendum.
The next argument is about the minimalist approach versus a wider constitutional change. I have never argued that in this case we should have wider constitutional change because I do not want to confuse the argument—it is tough enough now to get constitutional change in Australia. But I want to make it clear that many of the other suggestions for constitutional change that this debate has created I want dealt with over the next decade, because the Constitution and many areas of managing and governing Australia are deficient for the 21st century.
On this issue I support the Constitutional Convention and what I would call—as have others—the minimalist approach, where the parliament, by a two-thirds majority, selects our head of state. That change is a minimal one to the Constitution. But do not let it be said that I do not want to support other constitutional change; I want to do it at a digestible level with which the Australian people are comfortable.
I also have to believe that, if we get the minimalist approach through to change to a republic, that will be a major positive psychological change for the Australian people. They will therefore be able to look more sensibly at other changes that we need, knowing that we have changed to a republic but  the country has not come to an end and there has not been an end to our democracy, and that it will strengthen our democracy.
The arguments for an appointed president versus an elected president are overwhelmingly in favour of an appointed president. If you have an elected president, you will get a politician. You will get either a Liberal Party or a Labor Party politician, because those parties are the only two organisations that can run an election campaign across Australia to get a majority vote to get somebody elected, 
 and they are the only ones who will have the money and the resources.
The public want to have an elected president because they do not want a politician; but, ironically, that is what they will get. Having an appointed president from a joint sitting of the parliament, with two-thirds from both sides, means the appointment of a partisan politician will not occur, because one of the major parties will say no. That will give us a non-partisan, non-politician president; and there are many excellent people in our community who, I am sure, would fill the president's position with distinction and with great pride for all of Australia.
I want to refer now to the present Prime Minister's role. Just as Paul Keating will be termed through the ages as the `father of the republic', John Howard will be remembered only as one of the few people who have done everything possible to stop the republic occurring. He makes no bones about the fact that he is a monarchist. He has sought every possible way to interfere with the process and argue against it.
His sudden conversion to finding a new preamble is only because he has suddenly realised that, come the referendum, he will be in the position of saying no. He as Prime Minister will put himself in the lame duck position of saying no. How can he get out of this? Let us have thrown onto the field of play another idea which he can say yes to. Therefore, let us have a new preamble, something the Constitutional Convention did recommend. But he wanted to draft it himself, and what a terrible mess he made of it last week. It is a preamble that in a negative way describes every one of John Howard's prejudices about what he thinks our society should be.
Can anyone imagine any student from our high schools, our universities, our primary schools or anywhere else going off and trying to learn his preamble by heart to be able to quote it? Not on your nelly! It is impossible to learn by heart, unless you spend hours and hours. There is no rhyme or rhythm, no `magic' to it, as Senator Brown said. There is no poetry to it. There is no memorable phrase—other than in the negative about what 
 you would not want. Fancy trying to remember the word `fashion'. I thought that he must have consulted Carla Zampatti, the spouse of the former Liberal member for North Sydney. How long will the word `fashion' last down the ages? This is his code for saying, `I do not want political correctness written into the Constitution.' And neither should political correctness be written into the Constitution: it should be a positive affirmation of how we see ourselves as people.
But John Howard could not get even that right. One can imagine him sitting there, scratching lines out, finding words that meet all of his prejudices about what he thinks there is in Australia. The only thing that he did not put into the preamble was the word `incentivation'. When he was leader back in the late 1980s, he invented a campaign slogan of `incentivation' which lasted all of a day before it was laughed off the stage. There was one other phrase that he did not put in, and I was waiting to see a mention of the white picket fence in front of everybody's home being in the preamble, because that is about the level of his vision of what he wants for Australia.
He did not have those words in but he had all of his other prejudices written in. As a result, this preamble has been roundly condemned. As Senator Brown and other speakers, such as Senator Bolkus the other day, said: ordinary Australians have, off their own bat, made a much better effort of drafting a potential preamble than this Prime Minister could ever do and has ever done. The only way that he is going to save himself from complete humiliation is to quietly withdraw this suggestion.
He ought to take note from his great mentor that he always looks to, Sir Robert Menzies. In 1966, Sir Robert Menzies proposed that our new decimal currency be called a `royal'. He announced this with great fanfare. Everybody laughed at him. Everybody fell on top of him within a week, and Sir Robert had to reluctantly admit that, although `dollar' was an American word, it was the only one that Australians were going to cop for their new decimal currency; and so he quietly withdrew the suggestion of the royal. I suggest to John 
 Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia, that he should quietly withdraw the preamble, go to a proper consultation with all Australians and get a decent preamble.
On the preamble issue, Mr Acting Deputy President Hogg, I want to say that there is one area of it that I have a strong view about. I do not think reference to a religious figure, the phrase `almighty God' or `God', should be used in the preamble. Our Australian community is a secular state, guaranteeing the right of religious freedom—whatever religion it is—for all of our citizens. They have the complete right to their religion, if they so choose it. About 25 per cent of the community—and I am one of them—do not choose to support a form of organised religion or a spiritual being.
I absolutely respect the right of others to have a different view; but, as soon as you suggest that you should put one form of religion or one definition of God into a preamble of the Constitution, I think we move away from a commitment to absolute freedom of religion: you are trying to predict what the religion should be. I note in the Constitution, drafted in the preamble, there was mention 100 years ago of the phrase `almighty God'. I think they made a mistake even then. But time has moved on and, in the next century, I would hope that with a new preamble people would understand that not mentioning almighty God would not mean that we are against freedom of  religion but that it is in fact enhancing freedom of religion. This bill, as I said in my opening remarks, is just the beginning of other bills that will come in, in preparation for the holding of the referendum.
—What is your response to our third reading amendment? You haven't said anything about it.
—Our spokesman will respond to your amendment. I am not the spokesman for the Labor Party on this bill in the Senate; Senator Bolkus is, and he will respond accordingly. I agree with the thrust of this bill in making a more flexible arrangement for funding for the coming referendum campaign. I believe that it is the start of a process that will lead to a referendum being 
 carried in about November this year to establish an Australian republic.
I look forward to that republic being established, a president—an outstanding Australian citizen—being appointed by a two-thirds majority of this parliament. I still look forward to the first official function of the new president of the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic being the declaring open of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. That would be a much more appropriate person than the suggestion of John Howard, who is trying to grab the opening of the Olympic Games for himself, because he is jammed and does not want to have to invite the Queen to do it as our head of state. Australians want an Australian to open the Olympic Games; they want our head of state to do it, not John Howard, not the Queen. I look forward to the opportunity to see that occur with the successful carriage of the referendum in November of this year.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—The Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 1999  that is before the Senate deals with matters that are ancillary to the question of Australia becoming a republic. It deals with public funding for a public education exercise, the public funding of the yes and no cases, and also the two separate questions to be asked—one in relation to the republic and one in relation to the preamble.
These are very important matters indeed, and I thank senators from the minor parties and the opposition for their contribution. I did not really detect any opposition to those matters that I have just mentioned. But there was a great deal said on the preamble and generally the question of a republic. Those matters are best left for other legislation which will be coming before the Senate in due course.
In relation to the Greens' second reading amendment, this government undertook to pick up the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention held last year and to follow that through. The Constitutional Convention came up with a model for a republic, and that model will be put forward in legislation. Although it was not in the 
 terms of reference of the Constitutional Convention the question of a preamble was also raised at that convention, and there was a recommendation that a preamble be considered as well. The government decided to take that on board and accordingly there is now the second question of whether or not we have that preamble.
The government has stood by its undertaking to take up the suggested model put by the Constitutional Convention and has gone even further to take up the question of a preamble. Indeed, the question of holding a referendum was part of the government's platform for the last election and it is therefore appropriate that the government honour that undertaking.
The government is not persuaded to support the Greens' second reading amendment. The question is one which pre-empts the outcome of the referendum and is best resolved after the referendum has been held. The government is of the view that it has stood by its undertaking to the Australian people in relation to the recommendation made by the Constitutional Convention and that this question of any further action is one which is best resolved after the result of the referendum is known.
I can also foreshadow that the government is not persuaded to support the further amendment, which is of course a separate one moved by the Greens, that there be a plebiscite at the next election. The government would say that that is really superfluous to the referendum being held this year. The referendum being held this year will cost in excess of $60 million and if one were to have a plebiscite at the time of the next election, one which would have an appropriate mail-out, there would be a cost of $8 million to $9 million.
Leaving the cost of it aside, there will be a full debate this year on the question of whether Australia becomes a republic or not. There will be a public education campaign. No doubt there will be parliamentary scrutiny by way of parliamentary debate and parliamentary committee, the yes and no cases will be sent out by the AEC, and also there will be the two respective arguments being 
 pursued by the yes and no cases. So the government is of a view that this whole year will see the question of Australia becoming a republic being fully debated and that a plebiscite to be held in the future is a matter which is not appropriate to be determined at this point in time. As with the previous amendment moved by the Greens, it is a question best determined once we know the outcome of the referendum in November.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-29,"—by leave—I have sheet 1297 and sheet 1298 before me. With respect to 1298, which is an amendment calling on the government to hold another plebiscite in case this one does not succeed, the opposition's view is that we will cross that bridge when we get to it. We are more committed to ensuring that this first referendum is successful. In terms of any policy we would adopt in case it is not successful, we will announce that at an appropriate time after this referendum.
Given the events in South Australia over the last two or three days, we should be a little more optimistic about the success of this proposal. The ARM in South Australia is regrouping and that could enhance the opportunity of the proposal. In fact, and I did not know this, it is regrouping to such an extent that  Senator Schacht has been elected to the committee of the ARM, so our confidence has strengthened with respect to the proposal before the people later in November.
With respect to Senator Margetts's first amendment, on sheet 1297, we are committed to an ongoing process of constitutional reform, and that amendment is one that we can support and do support. It is one that commits the parliament and the nation to continuing consultation and continuing amendments to our Constitution. We have tried to change it on a number of occasions and have not been successful. But it is my personal view that the thing that we need to do, to lay the ground work for constitutional reform in this country, is to develop a culture of accepting change and the need for change and for people not to be afraid of changing the Constitution. I think Senator Margetts's 
 proposal goes a little way towards that and we support the amendment on sheet 1297.
Amendment agreed to.

Is it the case that the Australia New Zealand Food Authority recently sent a letter to all health ministers suggesting that there were an estimated 500 products available in Australia that contained GMO ingredients? Is it also the case that this letter stated that ANZFA had received only seven applications for approval under standard A18 as `substantially equivalent' as of 17 March?

Can he guarantee for the Senate that we will see no delay in the date of effect of the introduction of A18 so that that will not be changed from 13 May; it will actually go ahead as planned? Am I to understand from the minister's answer that he will ensure that any products that are not assessed by the commencement of standard A18 will be removed from the shelves, so any unapproved products will actually be removed from shelves? Thirdly, will the minister clarify whether he is stating that products that have been approved overseas will be available for sale in Australia, or can he guarantee that they will have to be approved by independent Australian assessment before they are approved for sale in Australia?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Genetically Modified Food</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-03-29,"—I thank Senator Stott Despoja for her question. It is the first substantial question we have had from the opposition the whole afternoon. There is a fair amount of meat in the question, but at least it gives us food for thought. Senator Stott Despoja was referring to the fact that food commodities using gene technology have been 
 in the marketplace overseas since 1992 and currently there are over 50 such commodities approved for food use worldwide. On 30 July 1998 health ministers, in their capacity as the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council, approved standard A18 to regulate the sale of foods produced using gene technology. This standard will come into effect nine months after the date of gazettal, on 13 May 1999. Senator Stott Despoja's question really should be asked after 13 May 1999 because the standard has not come into effect yet. Premising a question on the results after the standard comes into effect is not appropriate.
Once the standard takes effect it will be illegal to send any food produced using gene technology unless it has been assessed as being safe by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority and approved by health ministers. The enforcement of the standard is the responsibility of state and territory health authorities. The pre-market approval requirement of the standard has been widely publicised in the media and in ANZFA publications, and the implications of the standard have been known by industry bodies and food companies in both Australia and New Zealand since the notification of a draft standard was announced in February 1997.
ANZFA has received six applications relating to foods derived from genetically modified crops, and public notification of these six applications was published on 28 October last year. ANZFA has completed the safety assessment of the first two of these six applications and has found that two commodities—one being herbicide tolerant soya bean and the other insect resistant cottonseed—meet safety requirements for food. These two are the principal genetically modified food commodities that are currently in the marketplace in Australia and have been in use by manufacturers for several years. A recommendation to the Food Standards Council on the regulation of these commodities is expected in April. The council is then to decide whether to approve these foods for continued use in the food supply.
Being aware that many imported foods may not be covered by these six applications, 
 ANZFA as a matter of urgency has notified food industry bodies, especially the owners of the original genetically modified commodity, in Australia, New Zealand and overseas of the need to submit applications for assessment. The minister is most concerned that, due to inaction on the part of the owners of these genetically modified commodities, many food importers and manufacturers in Australia and New Zealand may be damaged once the standard is enforced as of 13 May. If on 13 May, when the standard comes into force, ANZFA has before it applications that have yet to be fully assessed, health ministers will need to determine whether transitional arrangements are justified so as not to disrupt the marketplace.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Genetically Modified Food</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-03-29,"—I can guarantee that ministers would not accept any transitional arrangement for foods which were known to pose a risk to public health and safety. That will be the bottom line, and I will certainly guarantee that. But the evaluation of the safety of genetically modified foods is the responsibility of the food authority, and it undertakes evaluations in accordance with internationally accepted best practice risk assessment principles.

 effects which may arise from the modification.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Genetically Modified Food</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1999-03-29,"—On the last day that we had question time, Senator Woodley asked me about  some fumes in the cabins of BAe 146s and mentioned a particular incident. I have discussed the matter with Mr Anderson, the minister. I am advised that the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has not received any notification with respect to the alleged incident which Senator Woodley said occurred on a BAe 146 flight from Perth to Kununurra. Mr Anderson has asked BASI to contact Senator Woodley's office to obtain details of the alleged incident, and I understand that has been done.
I can assure Senator Woodley and all senators, as I did on Thursday, that both the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation will take swift action to address problems that might arise. At this stage both CASA and BASI are continuing investigations into this issue, and CASA is working proactively with the Federal Aviation Administration in the US and our airlines to understand better these issues.

 disallowance of the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Regulations 1998 (No. 2), as contained in Statutory Rules 1998 No. 260 and made under the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act 1989. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard  the committee's correspondence concerning the regulations.
Leave granted.
The correspondence read as follows—

The Hon Michael Wooldridge MP
Minister for Health and Aged Care
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Regulations 1998 (No.2), Statutory Rules 1998 No.260, which will enable the lodgement of an application for the Secretary to declare that the applicant's turnover is of low volume and low value.
New subregulation 4C(3) obliges the Secretary to either accept or reject an application for a person to be registered as having a low volume/low value turnover as soon as practicable, but does not provide a time limit within which a decision must be made. The Committee notes that new r.4D permits the Secretary to delegate the power to consider such applications to any officer in the Department.
The interests of applicants for such declarations may be better protected if subregulation 4C(3) were to provide instead that any application in relation to which the applicant had not been advised of a decision within, say 28 days, would be deemed to have been refused. This would trigger the applicant's right to independent review of that decision and provide a clear time frame from the outset.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice.
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator O'Chee
Thank you for your letter of 2 December 1998 to Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Dr Michael Wooldridge, concerning the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Regulations 1998 (No. 2) , Statutory Rules 1998 No. 260. As Parliamentary Secretary with executive responsibility for the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), I am responding on behalf of the Government. I apologise for the delay in responding.
Your Committee has noted that new subregulation 4C(3) obliges the Secretary of the Department of Health and Aged Care to either accept or reject an application for a person to be registered as having a low volume and low value turnover as soon as practicable, but does not provide a time limit within which a decision must be made. Your Committee has suggested that, in the interests of the applicants, subregulation 4C(3) should provide that if an applicant has not been advised of a decision within 28 days then the application would be deemed to have been refused.
I agree that the applicants' interests would be better protected by the inclusion of a clear time frame in subregulation 4C(3), however to allow a proper assessment of each application a period of 40 days is considered a more appropriate time frame.
The relevant amendments to subregulation 4C(3) will be made in the near future.
Yours sincerely

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-03-29,"—On behalf of Senator Cooney, I present report No. 20 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties entitled Two treaties tabled on 26 May 1998, the Bougainville Peace Monitoring Group Protocol and Treaties tabled on 11 November 1998 , together with submissions, Hansard  record of proceedings and minutes.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—On behalf of Senator Cooney, I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate Senator Cooney's tabling statement in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
In all, this report considers eight treaties covering a wide range of subjects, including:
.	 the destruction of anti-personnel mines;
.	 the Bougainville peace monitoring group; and
.	 economic cooperation with Indonesia.
In each case the committee has concluded that it is in Australia's national interest to ratify the proposed treaties.
In the time available to me, I will comment briefly on the major elements of the report.
The Treaties Committee is strongly supportive of the Convention on the Prohibition and Destruction 
 of Anti-personnel Mines.  The Convention is an historic step towards the aim of a total global ban on anti-personal mines. The Australian Government's commitment to the Convention is to be applauded. As is the passage, by this parliament, of the Anti-personnel Mines Convention Act 1998—which implements in Australian law the obligations imposed by the Convention.
Our report makes two recommendations aimed at continuing the momentum towards a global ban on anti-personnel mines:
.	 first, that the Minister for Defence formulate principles to guide the retention of mines for defence training purposes, so as to clarify the process and timeframe for the destruction of those mines not required for training purposes; and
.	 second, that, in appropriate international fora, the Australian Government put a strong position against the development of replacement weapons technologies which have indiscriminate and inhumane effects similar to those possessed by anti-personnel mines.
The committee also strongly supports the Bougainville Peace Monitoring Group Protocol.
Australia has played a significant role in the Bougainville peace process:
.	 by facilitating truce and ceasefire discussions between the warring parties;
.	 by contributing around 250 civilian and unarmed Defence Force personnel to the work of the Peace Monitoring Group; and
.	 by sponsoring a substantial and growing aid program.
Given the scale and nature of the devastation caused by the conflict, there is much work to be done to restore even the most basic community services to those living on Bougainville. Australia's aid program will continue to play a crucial role in re-establishing services and infrastructure; in building new systems of administration; and in restoring a functioning economy.
The third major treaty considered in Report 20 is the Development Cooperation Agreement with Indonesia.
This Agreement is intended to provide a generic legal framework for Australia's development cooperation program with Indonesia. It is a usefully document, which will simplify the project development processes for both governments and for the non-government organisations commissioned to run aid projects in Indonesia.
The Agreement is important not only for what it provides, but because it signals that, at a time of great social and political upheaval in Indonesia, Australia is committed to building structures to 
 support a continuing and cooperative relationship with one of its nearest neighbours.
I would finally like to refer to the proposed Amendment to the Health Services Agreement with the United Kingdom.
While we support the amendment, and acknowledge that reciprocal medical treatment agreements are of considerable benefit to Australians travelling overseas, we are concerned about the adequacy of the costing information upon which such agreements are based. In this, as in previous cases, we were not provided with sufficient information to assess whether both parties to the agreement would be exposed to similar costs.
We have recommended that, when negotiating such agreements in future, the Department of Health and Aged Care undertake a more rigorous assessment of the likely costs, to both parties, of the agreement.
In conclusion, I thank all those who have contributed our reviews. These contributions are important and help promote greater transparency in the treaty-making process.
I commend the report to the Senate.

The report read as follows—
INTERIM REPORT
Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 1998
Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1998

Background
On Wednesday 24 March 1999, the Senate Selection of Bills Committee tabled its 4th Report of 1999, recommending that the above two bills be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report. The proposed date of a public hearing was Friday 26 March, and the proposed date of a report was Monday 29th March. The Committee did not proceed with a hearing on 26 March. It is now tabling an interim report in order to meet the requirement to report on 29 March.
Issues
The Committee met briefly on 25 March to note the reference and to determine available dates to hold public hearings. It also agreed to make an interim report, rather than simply request an extension of time, in order to note two linked issues: the process of referring bills and the other commitments of Committees.
Referral of bills
The Committee believes it is important for the selection of bills committee to ensure that all potential references are advised to Committee chairs in order for advice to be given about possible reporting dates.
The Committee also believes it is important for proposed dates of hearings and reports to be 
 examined before being accepted.  Even if the Legal and Constitutional Committee had no other work, it would have been impossible for it to contact all twenty three proposed witnesses, obtain submissions, advise the departments concerned, determine who would give evidence, and hold a hearing within such a limited timeframe. Other resources are also required such as Hansard services.
To write a report based on a hearing called at such short notice would also be difficult, because any additional comments or dissenting report could only be drafted after the Chair's draft was ready. This would require all involved staff to work all weekend. It would also mean that Hansard would be under pressure to provide a transcript, also over the weekend. It is sometimes necessary to provide reports under these circumstances, but no reason has been given why this would be necessary in this instance.
Other work of committees
The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee is currently examining three migration bills and finalising a report on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998.  This last bill is of considerable significance and the Committee has given it priority so that a report can be tabled this week. This has meant that committee members have been involved in writing comments during the last week and over the past weekend, and the Committee Secretariat was not in a position to take on additional work for this new reference.
It is also worth noting that such short reporting deadlines do not inspire confidence in the fairness of Senate processes.  Some of the organisations that wish to give evidence have stated that they were also surprised at the short time recommended, and would be pleased to see more time devoted to the matter.
Request 
The Committee respectfully requests that the Senate, through the Selection of Bills Committee, reconsider the suggested hearing and reporting dates, and do so in consultation with the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee.
Suggested Dates
Given other commitments, the Committee suggests that any hearings be held during the week beginning 12 April 1999, and the report be tabled on 19 April 1999. This allows time for submissions to be made and for appropriate consideration of the issues, even though there is limited time for the production of a transcript.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-29,"—When we were last considering this bill before question time today, the minister's response was fairly limited or scratchy, from my point of view, in relation to why the government was actually spending more on what in effect was the no case. Senator Ellison indicated that half of $15 million would go to each of the yes and no campaigns, first of all saying that this was an education campaign which was not about presenting a case. Then the response goes on to admit that half of the $15 million would go to the yes/no advertising campaigns. This ignores the fact that in relation to the yes/no advertising campaigns, according to the explanatory memorandum and according to Senator Ellison, the people putting those together would be chosen somehow neutrally from those people attending the Constitutional Convention. Quite clearly, just about everybody admits that that was a very narrow process. The reality is that it was as controlled as it could be. So if you choose people from the same original process and then say, `We want you to continue with this narrow process,' you are indeed simply continuing that process. So even the yes/no debate is nobbled in that situation.
I would like further information on spending that $4.5 million on basically explaining such things as the current Constitution. How much of that money will go on explaining the current Constitution and in what form will it explain the current Constitution? Why could that not be considered to be a case for the status quo?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—Just to reiterate and clarify what I said earlier and 
 make it absolutely clear, we have $19.5 million, $15 million of which is to go on the yes and no case arguments. That is a separate and discrete campaign where there will be two different points of view put forward. The public education campaign makes up the remaining $4.5 million. That will deal with three aspects: information on the current system that is in place; information as to the process of referendum; and information as to what the actual question will be when the people of Australia go to the referendum in November. That is in relation to the $4.5 million only. They are the three aspects of the expenditure.
It has not been determined as yet how that will be divided up in funds. The education campaign in that regard will not advance a yes or no case, it will not advance the merits of keeping the status quo; it will simply be a question of providing information and education to the people of Australia. In doing that, the referendum steering group, which comprises the Attorney-General and me, which will be overseeing this will have a panel of experts advising it. That panel of experts is soon to be made up and as yet has not been determined. They will be advising us in relation to the wording used and the information that will be provided.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-29,"—I have a further question on that. The minister still has not explained why the information on the current system, that is, our current Constitution, is not part of the $7.5 million for the no case. We have had this Constitution for over a hundred years. Could the minister explain why a separate amount of money—he is not even telling us how much it will be—is actually going to be expended on talking about a Constitution we have had for over a hundred years, basically explaining—if you like, promoting—the current system? Why is this not part of the no case?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—There is nothing whatsoever to exclude the no case or the yes case promoting the merits of the status quo or otherwise in their advertising campaigns, which will be funded by the $15 million. There is nothing at all to stop them 
 from doing that if they see fit. But the government does believe it has a responsibility to provide at the outset a neutral campaign of education and information for the people of Australia as to what the current system entails. You simply have to travel around Australia to realise that people do have other things on their mind than the make-up of the parliament and the constitutional system of this country, and the government thinks that it is appropriate that, when the people of Australia come to determine what the position will be, they have a neutral campaign of information.
But there is nothing to stop the yes or no case using the funds allocated to them to provide information as to the current system; nothing at all. The government saw its duty as providing independently of that a neutral campaign of education and information. It would be, I think, irresponsible of the government simply to move towards a referendum without providing the people of Australia with any education or any information at all.

While Senator Margetts works out other questioning, can I ask you whether the funding of the no case will go to funding of the no case for the preamble. I know you suggest that there is another piece of legislation, but we are talking about funding for the referendum to be held in November.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-29,"—Sure, but the question was a bit broader than that and it used this legislation and this part of the committee discussion as a peg to hang itself on. The question is: has a decision been taken to fund a no case on the preamble? Secondly, in respect of this legislation in terms of the no case on the referendum, has a decision been taken as to who would constitute an eligible person for funding for the no case?

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—There has been no decision on funding for the preamble either for the yes or no cases, respectively. It is the decision of the government that there will be only public funding available for the yes and no case provisions which relate to the republic only, so there will be no funding for the question of the preamble. I think that renders the second part of your question obsolete.
As far as the funding for the republic goes, the funding will only be to those yes and no committees. There will be no division of the $7½ million on either side between the respective interest groups. It will go to the committee to deal with as it sees fit, and there will be certain guidelines as to how that is done. When I say `guidelines', I mean `accountability'. They will have to spend the money on their case for the republic. They cannot spend it on something completely different, for instance, and arrangements are being put in place for there to be supervision 
 as to the expenditure for accountability purposes. But the yes and no case committees will have a discretion as to how they spend it. On advertising or what form the advertisements will take they will have a discretion.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-29,"—So there will be no separate funding for the no case on the preamble. You would accept, however, that the interest groups that would be opposed to the preamble would be quite different from the interest groups that might be opposed to the republic question. Can you explain why decisions have been taken not to recognise that difference in constituencies and not to provide funding for the no case on the preamble?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—For a start, the government has taken a view that the question of whether Australia becomes a republic or not is one which is best advanced by there being a yes and no case. It is apparent that there will be people voting against the legislation in the parliament and they of course will have carriage of the no case when the AEC distributes that. For the yes case, similarly those members of the House of Representatives and senators would have the responsibility for the carriage of the yes case which the AEC will be responsible for sending out.
The government is not aware at this stage of anyone who would be voting no in relation to the preamble, although it is a free vote on the coalition side. I can say to Senator Bolkus that the government's decision has been that only the republic question should be funded. The terms of reference for the Constitutional Convention were to look at whether Australia should become a republic or not, and in the terms of reference no mention was made of a preamble. The preamble was something which came about during the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention, and the government believes that it is the republic question which should be funded. The preamble is a separate question, as you pointed out, and we have indicated that we will have two separate ballots to give those 
 people who want to campaign for one and not the other that opportunity.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-29,"—You have got to be joking! You started off by saying that the government is not aware of anyone who will vote against the preamble. Isn't it fairer to say that you are not aware of anyone who is going to vote for it apart from the Prime Minister, his wife, Professor Blainey, and possibly Les Murray—but maybe not? There is a very strong body of opinion in the community and this parliament that the preamble does us no service as a nation and does the Prime Minister no service as a Prime Minister, so you have to acknowledge that the chances of there being a no case on the preamble are pretty big at this stage.
I find it quite amazing that you are prepared to fund a no case for one of the referenda but are not prepared to fund a no case in respect of the preamble. I would have thought that there were some legal obligations on the government to provide resources for a no case in respect of either referendum proposal. Have you taken legal advice to ascertain whether in fact you can deny funding for a no case on the preamble?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—There are two aspects to that question. I will deal with the latter one first. If there is a no vote against the legislation—if we can put it that way—in relation to the preamble, then of course those members and senators who vote against that will be free to write a no case which the AEC then sends out, as it normally would with any other referendum.
The first part of your question is whether there is any liability for additional funding. There is not any liability, as such, for additional funding. It is a choice of the government of the day as to whether this funding should be employed or not, and the government has made a decision that funding should be used only for the question of the republic. With respect to people voting against the preamble, from what you say, Senator Bolkus, I can take it that the opposition opposes a preamble and will be voting against it. Is that the case?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I can answer that question both in brief and at a bit of length, and I need to do both, in fact. We have some important concerns with the preamble. Like every other interest group commentator in the country, we think it is a shambles. As a consequence, we will be trying to find ways, through the mechanisms of this parliament and Senate, to develop a preamble which is more in tune with the nation's aspirations and not with the Prime Minister's prejudices. That will be our immediate objective over the next few weeks in this place and through whatever committee might be charged with responsibility for the preamble.
I have to say to you that it is not just in here and it is not just in Canberra but it is across the country that people think that the preamble is something that the Prime Minister probably concocted in a bad dream and that they have got to live with it. The other thing that needs to be put on the record is that the Constitutional Convention, charged with the issue of the republic, also deemed—as probably most lawyers in the country would expect them to—that a preamble was an important concomitant to the deliberations of that convention.
The purpose of a preamble in legislation is essentially to provide the context through which the legislation can be read and should be interpreted. The view of the Constitutional Convention was that, in a situation where we were going to be confronted with a proposition for Australia to become a republic, there was a need to have a preamble which was appropriate to the new, independent status of the nation. As I say, most lawyers see the purpose of a preamble being to reflect the legislation that the preamble is an antecedent passage to; and it is no different in respect of a constitution and no different in respect of a constitution which changes from a monarchy to a republic.
It is quite bizarre that the Prime Minister has taken the view that he can treat the preamble as something separate, that as far as he is concerned there is a need for a new preamble to the Constitution, though that preamble need have nothing to do with 
 Australia moving towards the independent status of a republic. That is why we think the two issues are in many respects interwoven, and that is why it was the view of the Constitutional Convention last year that the two issues were interwoven and needed to be addressed together.
Going back to your previous answer, when you said that there would be no money made available and no provisions for the no case for the preamble, but that members of parliament would be able to prepare a no case to be distributed to the electorate in the normal non-referendum mechanisms that are available to this parliament, don't you think it is a bit undemocratic that you are providing resources for your side of parliament, for those who have been long-time supporters of the Prime Minister and his attachment to the monarchy?
You are providing money for them to run the no case in respect of the republic, to oppose Australia becoming a republic, but you are not prepared to provide resources for those who are opposed to this shambles of a preamble to pursue their case legitimately in the democratic debate across the nation in the lead-up to this referendum. You are prepared to give money to your long-term mates, but you are not prepared to give money to those who are arguing—very cogently, I must say—against the preamble that the Prime Minister has put together in the darkness of his lodge at Kirribilli.
—What! Come on!
—Where else did he do it? He found himself up at Anzac Parade, Reid, at the War Memorial and, like a furtive peddler of pornography, he went up to Professor Blainey, gave him a little envelope—
—Order! Senator Bolkus, would you like to withdraw that reflection on the Prime Minister, please?
—What reflection in particular?
—Senator Bolkus, just withdraw the reflection, and address the chair and not respond to interjections.
—I withdraw the reflection. Madam Chair, it is not a 
 democratic course of action to take, in terms of public consultation, to put a document in an envelope, hand it to Professor Blainey, put in his pocket and say to him, `Have a look at this and give me a ring about it later on.' That was the degree of public consultation that took place with respect to the development of this preamble. Senator Natasha Stott Despoja might laugh about it, and the Greens might as well, but that is as far as it went. No-one here was consulted. Les Murray might have been consulted, but we now about that.
—Apparently Christopher Pearson got a go.
—I do not know whether Christopher Pearson would have got a go. Then again, that reflects probably the earlier comment that I was making, the one that I withdrew. But the extent of the consultation was a blank envelope given to Professor Blainey at the War Memorial, with a whisper saying, `Have a look at this and let me know what you think of it.' That is as far as it got. For a document that has been concocted in secrecy, basically, with a coterie of mates, you are prepared to say, `We are not going to fund the case against it,' whereas you are prepared to allocate public funds in respect of the other important aspect of the referendum. Isn't that undemocratic?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—No, it isn't. Can I say that the way that the government has devised this is to give Australians the maximum choice. If you were to combine the two questions of the republic and the preamble, you might deprive those people who want to vote no to a republic but yes to the preamble of a combination of votes; so we are saying that there are two distinct issues there. One is a republic and one is a preamble. You might not want the republic but you might want the preamble; you have that choice. You might want both; you have that choice. You might not want both; you still have that choice. In fact, you might want the republic without the preamble, and you can still have that choice because the two questions are separated.
As I mentioned earlier, the preamble was never mentioned in the terms of reference for the Constitutional Convention; a republic was. The republic has been the issue here all along. In 1988, there was no public funding for the referendum then and that was an important referendum, but there has been no referendum quite like the question of whether Australia should become a republic. That is such an important question that the government believes it requires public funding for both sides, in order for there to be a full ventilation of debate. 	Comments about the Prime Minister in the darkness of the Lodge and the pejorative terms that are being used will do neither side any good in the debate of this matter. It certainly has been the desire of all the commentators and those concerned that this debate should be conducted in a mature manner. It certainly is the desire of the government that it be conducted in a mature manner, one which Australians by and large can understand, one which is not full of vindictive language or malice, but one which is based on reason and cogent argument. It is in the interests of the country and in the interests of all concerned that this debate be conducted in that way.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-29,"—Minister, picking up your last point, do you not think the Australian public would be offended by the fact that you are providing resources for one no case and not the other?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—We are providing for one yes case and not the other. It is pretty even-handed. We have provided money for the yes case, and that is not a question of providing funding for the Prime Minister's mates, as you say, Senator Bolkus. There are people in the case whom I am sure the Prime Minister would not count as being in his circle of friends. But I can say to you that in the approach to the yes and no case on the question of whether Australia becomes a republic we are being even-handed. We have divided the money evenly. We are funding both sides to put forward their arguments.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-29,"—You are providing money for the no 
 case the Prime Minister supports, but you are not providing money for the no case the Prime Minister does not support. Is that not the most offensive aspect of this funding decision?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—I repeat that we are providing money for the yes case for the republic, and the Prime Minister has stated that that is not a position he holds. So you can twist it as much as you like, but the fact remains that we are providing equal funding for the republic question. One of the groups receiving the funding is those people who do not share the Prime Minister's view. You could not be more even-handed than that.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-03-29,"—I agree with the comments about this debate needing to be mature and considerate.
—You had better sit down then.
—Order, Senator Ferguson! You should not be interjecting, least of all when you are not in your place.
—One of the problems with that is that, first of all, it needs to be bipartisan and the government's mirth at the moment and that silly interjection indicate that apparently the leader of the government in this debate was not sincere when he said that. But let me not be distracted by that. The question is about the maturity of the process itself whereby the Prime Minister took unto himself the business of drawing up the preamble. That is quite an untoward reflection on the talent and enormous capability there is of a collective of Australians to do that job better than any single person.
I am sure that, if the government had been in the position where, for example, Gough Whitlam, had decided to do this, it would have brought the house down over it. But here we have the Prime Minister,  John Howard, doing it, and the government is trying to defend it. But the exercise has failed. That is manifest by the division it has caused in the community and the protest there is about the failure of this preamble from the Prime Minister's office to live up to the 
 expectations of Australians that they would have a preamble which is memorable, which gives rise to pride, and which is something that Australians at school could learn and feel good about. This does not meet that high promise.
That being said, where do we go from here? I do not believe the Prime Minister's preamble as it stands is going to be the one put at the referendum, and changes have to be made in the next little while to ensure that there is a different option for the people of Australia. That being the case, I wonder if the government has been discussing this matter and can enlighten this committee as to what course of action is to be taken to give an alternative which is not going to be divisive but is going to be acceptable to the voters.
One of those alternatives, if the Prime Minister wants to stick with his proposed preamble, is to allow for an alternative or a number of alternatives to be put forward so that people have a choice. I said earlier that I have read some remarkably good proposed preambles coming from the pens of high school young people in Australia. I think a bringing together of them, for example, would come up with a succinct, poetic and uplifting preamble which many Australians would want to vote for.
This was not too difficult with the plebiscite over the national anthem. Three alternatives were put forward there. Not only is the talent available in Australia to come up with an alternative, but already alternatives have been penned which ought to be there so that the critics of the Prime Minister's version have a choice to make. The question is: is the government going to entertain the idea of putting a number of preambles forward so that the people can make a choice? If it is not, or while it is considering that, to what degree is the government determined that the only question to be put to the people of Australia will be the preamble as coming from the Prime Minister a week or two ago?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—The situation with the multiple choice is one which is just not possible with the legislation and the way we conduct a referendum. If you 
 were to have multiple preambles, then you would have to have a question for each one; you would not be able to ask voters to select which one they liked. You could do that by way of a plebiscite or a national poll, as you mention in relation to the national song, but you could not do that by way of referendum.
Apart from that, there is another difficulty—that if you gave multiple choices by way of a referendum it would be difficult to achieve the constitutional majority that would be required. If you had three preambles, for instance, and you offered the people of Australia a choice as to which one they preferred you could end up with an even vote of one-third for each preamble. That would make life very difficult indeed, because you would end up with nothing. So in a practical sense you have to put to the people of Australia a preamble requiring the answer yes or no.
In relation to the other matters you raise, Senator Brown, the preamble will be the subject of legislation—as will any other amendment to the Constitution—and it will be the subject of the usual course of debate, both in the other place and in this chamber, and it is anticipated that there will be a parliamentary committee process which will closely examine all of those proposed amendments.
The government does not for one minute shy away from that process. As Senator Brown knows, having participated in a number of committees, the parliamentary committee process is a very good one indeed. People will be invited to give evidence. They will have the opportunity to give evidence on what they think of the proposed constitutional amendments, and the preamble will form part of that. For people to say that there will be no chance for scrutiny is totally false. There will be parliamentary debate and a committee process whereby people will have the chance to have an input. The government is of the view that that is only appropriate.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-03-29,"—I thank Senator Ellison for that. It is an important debate and I am sure we are all thinking about it as it goes along. Having taken out the option of a plebiscite, it be 
 comes incumbent upon us, and particularly the government, to come up with a preamble that people are going to vote for, otherwise we will have been in a time and money wasting exercise. We all want to see a preamble that is going to be highly accepted by the Australian people.
The government is saying that, if there are to be changes to the Prime Minister's proposal, they ought to come from a committee process and then, presumably, from a debate in the two houses of parliament. This is new ground. The government's thinking here is that the public ought to be ready to feed its thinking on the preamble into a committee and then to follow through the debate consequent upon that committee's deliberations.
Has the government given thought to encouraging Australians to be alert to what is going to be a concentrated timetable for this process? If people are able to feed their ideas into a committee—if this is the only option available to us—the parliament will then be prepared for the ensuing debate. I am sure it will be a difficult job for that committee to determine its findings. I would not be surprised if it puts for consideration to the parliament a number of different findings—dissenting reports and so on—for its consideration.
At the end of that process, the government is going to bring in here a single preamble—it is going to be a single preamble; we have established that much. To what degree does the government anticipate that the two houses of parliament, debating this and having been charged with the responsibility of coming up with a conclusion, will be able to determine the final words of the preamble? I can see that this is going to be a very tortuous, complicated and potentially unsatisfactory direction to go.
I put to the government that the net be thrown wider to people in our community—even to a selection process. A number of people could be selected and they could then get together and come up with a preamble that is an alternative to the Prime Minister's and put that to the committee. That would be listening to what Australians have to say. 
 There needs to be some order in this process. Australians are going to want a preamble that they all feel good about. I, for one, am prepared to forgive some things in order that others are there. There has to be give and take in this. I think Australians, at large, have an enormous repository of goodwill towards us finding a conclusion.
The government has to be big enough to throw open the process, with a very short timetable, so that a committee of citizens is able to say, `We have sifted through all of this and here is our recommendation to the parliament.' I am a little worried that the sifting of an enormous input coming to us from the populace is to be left to a parliamentary committee and that, consequent upon that, there is a debate, potentially along political lines, in the two houses of parliament.
I put it to the Prime Minister that, beyond Les Murray, he ought to try again with a group of citizens. It is better for us, as a parliament, to make a determination and nominate people. We can, by agreement, get a group of people together to write a preamble. They would know the basic ground rules, which would have come from the Constitutional Convention. It is better for us to get together a collective of wise and tried and true Australians to do this job for us than for us to try to do the job ourselves. I am trying to be very constructive in this, but I think if we leave it to ourselves, as politicians, we are going to come up with something manifestly poorer than if, instead of choosing the words, we choose others to write the words for us.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—I mentioned earlier that there was $4.5 million for a public education campaign. One of the aspects of that campaign will be to let the people of Australia know what the process will be. That of course will involve a question of consultation and public scrutiny via parliamentary debate and a parliamentary committee. We will be advising and informing the people of Australia as to the process in that first phase of public education and information.
I believe that will address Senator Brown's concerns about letting people know what is happening and how the whole process is being conducted. Can I say that, in any event, there has been extensive discussion on this preamble. It has been out in the public domain with the draft bills. It is not normal that the government of the day introduces a bill in a draft form and releases it for discussion. We have done that in relation to those other amendments.
We have released into the public domain draft legislation, and a preamble, which is the subject of great discussion across this country. You merely have to pick up any newspaper to see the attention that this is getting. So, in the first phase, I would suggest that a good deal of information has already been imparted from the nation's press in relation to what people think.
On the question of the preamble itself, no matter what preamble is put to the people, there will be differing views as to the wording. You will never settle upon a wording which will satisfy all Australians. Anyone who thinks that that can be achieved must have the assistance of the Archangel Gabriel, because I can tell you that it is just not feasible. We are putting up a model for the republic which was suggested by the Constitutional Convention and already on the republican side of the debate you have people saying, `This is not the model we should have.' Even if we put up a direct election model, people would still say, `I think you should have the other model.' No matter what is put up in this referendum, there will be differing points of view.
I think that the government has a duty to put to the people something to which they can answer yes or no in relation to the republic and yes or no in relation to the preamble. What we have a duty to do is to give due process to this, which we are doing. Public education is the first thing. The second is the parliamentary debate and parliamentary committee scrutiny. Added to that you have the next phase of yes and no arguments in relation to the republic and, finally, the dissemination of the yes and no cases by the AEC. That is sent to every elector in this 
 country. I think that is a pretty extensive process which is going to cover the next eight months or thereabouts. I say to Senator Brown that this is perhaps one of the most expansive processes embarked upon by government since Federation.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-03-29,"—I similarly have concerns about the preamble debate. I am not going to put them on record here because I did that at the second reading stage. I have a series of questions, through the chair, to the minister. I acknowledge that the Prime Minister has invited a number of community groups and of course members of parliament, including the leader of my party, Senator Meg Lees, to make comments and provide feedback to him about the preamble by 30 April. I am not suggesting for a moment that I think that is sufficient: I think it should be much broader. But on that issue, can the minister outline to the chamber what process will take place? Will we see a tabled report in the parliament which will look at the feedback that the Prime Minister received? Will he put a series of recommendations to the parliament? Will he indeed share with us at all the finding or the reports from that community feedback? Can we get some idea of what process will be pursued?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—That is a somewhat informal process. The government will take on board all the feedback it gets. At this stage it is not envisaged making a formal report on that. However, that is something that has not been determined at this stage. This process is an informal process of picking up public opinion and feedback. Of course, if there is anything that needs to be implemented by way of some amendment, if there is a flaw in the legislation, the government will take it on board. At this stage it  is an informal process and there has been no determination of any report being delivered to the parliament.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-03-29,"—I thank the minister for that response. In relation to the $4.5 
 million neutral education campaign, I know that Senator Margetts has pursued some questions on this and might pick it up again. In particular, I ask the minister, through the chair: what role do you envisage, if any, for the AEC in that process, and the steering committee to which you referred? How many members will be on the committee and how will they be determined? What will be the selection process for that steering committee to which you referred earlier in the committee stage?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—In relation to the last question, that is a matter which is under consideration by the government. I am unable to tell you at this stage. It is being considered. That is the advisory panel: it is not the steering committee. The steering committee has been set up for some time and has representation from the Prime Minister's office. The Attorney-General is on it, as well as myself and other officials. But it is the advisory panel that we are dealing with. That panel will be one that will look at the wording and the substance of the information which will go to the community and of course will play an important role in ensuring the neutrality of that information campaign. The AEC will not have a role in that public education campaign. That is something which is quite different to the yes and no cases which the AEC will be dealing with. The AEC will send out the final yes and no cases, but the public education program will not be run by the AEC.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-03-29,"—I acknowledge my mistake about the advisory panel. That is what I meant to refer to. I am curious about the idea that the AEC would not have a role in that education process. I wonder what that means. Does that mean that we would have a public education campaign along the same lines of, say, the government's promotional work on the Common Youth allowance or, dare I say it, the GST or the new tax system campaign? Are we looking at a $4.5 million taxpayer funded promotional campaign? My initial understanding, when you referred to a 
 neutral education campaign, was that we would see booklets, explanatory information and advertisements on television. This, presumably, was to be organised or monitored in some way by the AEC. Clearly, that does not sound like it will be the case—that it will be signed off on by the advisory panel. Can you give me a sense of the promotional information, even if it is early stages? Are we looking at promotional campaigns that are comparable with other campaigns used to promote government policy or legislative change, for example?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—The campaign dealing with public education will not be espousing one view or the other. The role of the AEC is simply to see that things get out to the electors—that they receive the yes and no cases. The AEC has never been involved in drafting any sort of argument or proposition. The AEC has always been the conduit to the people—that is, the parliamentarians draft the yes and no cases and the AEC is the effective conduit by which that gets to the people of Australia. The AEC has never had a role in actually drafting the argument or in an educational sense—and this is a substantial educational campaign. The AEC has not extended to that. What we would be doing is saying to the people at large, `You have a system—a Westminster style of government—where you have two houses of parliament. You have a Senate and a House of Representatives. You have a Governor-General and a Prime Minister.' We would be outlining simply the system of government that we have.
Prior to the Constitutional Convention a booklet was sent out in relation to the system of government, the republic and the Constitutional Convention. I thought that was a reasonable publication. There was a challenge to it in the courts, which was overturned. But I think it was accepted by and large. I do not see how this part of the campaign is controversial. It simply outlines the process—that there will be these bills introduced which will have these amendments; parliamentary scrutiny; the question of the yes and no cases—and the 
 AEC will send it out. That would be the manner of it. As to the question to be put, it will simply outline: `This is the question that you will be getting. Do you want a president appointed by two-thirds of the members of parliament?' That is put in rough terms. Of course, it will be couched in terms much better than I could muster. But that will be the gist of it. It will be a neutral campaign of education.
The government thought that it needed to be contrasted by funding two separate cases—yes and no. That will be a bit more adversarial, of course, because one will be espousing one point of view and one the other. I believe, Senator Stott Despoja, that you are on the yes case and will be contributing to that debate.
But the AEC really has a completely different role. It is the conduit of information to the people. It also, I might say, will be working overtime to get people on the rolls. It will be working to get young people especially. I was very pleased recently to see, at the orientation day at the University of Western Australia, a stall set up by the AEC to get young people onto the roll, which I think is a very good idea. We have a program with the Victorian government whereby young people who get a drivers licence are contacted by the AEC to make sure they get on the roll. We are exploring this with other states. We are very keen to see that as many people as possible get a chance to vote at the referendum in November.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-03-29,"—I have a couple more brief questions. I understand the point about the AEC. When you talk about an education campaign that educates people about the process of the referendum, clearly that is the role that the AEC often fulfils. You have just articulated some of the examples: mobilising people so that they register to vote and explaining to people the actual mechanics of voting. That is why we have those wonderful ads that have people playing hop scotch or whatever the particular campaign flavour might be. I am not suggesting this is controversial, but when we use words like 
 `education' and `a neutral campaign', obviously it is very hard for anything that is involved in politics to be value neutral. Obviously people are going to be curious about the role of this education campaign.
I was just trying to ascertain whether or not it was just educating people about the actual process—what ballot papers you have to fill in, by when you have to get to the vote and at what time you are going to have to register. Clearly that is a role for the AEC. You have actually answered one query in that they will have that role in the campaign. But the actual $4.5 million will be spent differently and for a different education purpose.
I have a couple more queries. Firstly, I acknowledge your strong support today on behalf of the government for the preamble. Certainly that is something we have sensed from members on the government side—strong support for the preamble that has been drafted by the Prime Minister. I am wondering if you are able to confirm to the Senate whether that vote in the parliament will be a conscience vote for the government or whether members will be bound to vote for that preamble. Senator Calvert is nodding. My understanding is that it will be a conscience vote, which to me seems a bit odd, considering the strong support we are being told about that seems to be coming from government. Perhaps you could answer or put on record as to why that is a conscience vote?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—The Prime Minister has indicated that the questions of whether Australia becomes a republic and whether we amend the Constitution to include this preamble will both be free votes for the members of the coalition. I believe that view is taken because of the rather unusual nature of the question being asked. When I say `unusual', I do not think we have had too many referendums this century where we have talked about Australia becoming a republic. It is the first time since Federation that we have gone to the people of Australia and said, `Do you want to become a republic? Do you want this preamble included in the Constitution?' It is the view of the coalition that this is something which 
 is not just in the realm of policy, which you would determine in relation to health or industrial relations. It is something which is quite different. For those reasons it has been decided that the members of the coalition will have a free vote.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-03-29,"—This is my final question. We have talked a bit today about the need for broader, more extensive community consultation. We have acknowledged that the Prime Minister has said that he would accept community feedback until 30 April. I am a bit disappointed that we cannot actually suggest that there will be anything more than an informal process—that is, that we will not be seeing anything tabled or any formal feedback from the Prime Minister at the end of those deliberations, ruminations or what have you.
Given that this inadequate and minimal level of community consultation and feedback has taken place, does this mean the Prime Minister is going to consider modifications to his draft preamble—his final version of the preamble but I think we should consider it as a draft—so that we will be able to have a constructive and positive debate in this Senate chamber? Are we going to see a Prime Minister who is willing to take on some changes to his draft preamble so that hopefully we can achieve something that more appropriately and honestly reflects the values and visions of the community? If that is not the case, will the government reject any amendments proposed or, in fact, moved successfully in this place; is that the bottom line?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—It is very difficult for the government to say what it will do in relation to proposed amendments until we see those proposed amendments. It is just impossible for me to say, `We're not going to accept anything at all,' when we just do not know what people might come up with. That is a question which I cannot answer. As to your comment about tabling the feedback received, I note your concerns, 
 Senator Stott Despoja, and I will take that up with the task force.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-29,"—I listened to Senator Ellison's response to my questions relating to the so-called neutral education program, the $4.5 million, where he suggested that it will outline the system of government which we have. In the lead-up to the Constitutional Convention, one of the pieces of information that was funded was something similar—it was entitled `Describe in plain English how the existing constitutional system operates, identifying the arguments for and against change'. I do not know whether Senator Ellison is suggesting we have something different from that. If the government was suggesting this as part of the neutral education program—if it really was an education program—would it include, for instance, information on the elements of a Constitution, what generally goes to make up a Constitution, the issues involved and what parts of the Constitution are being considered for changing at this stage, and so on?
I believe that Senator Ellison has actually argued our case by saying that part of this $4.5 million is going to outline the system of government which we have. In the meantime, I have looked at the actual decision in the communique from the Constitutional Convention which stated:
That prior to the referendum being put to the people the Government undertake a public education program directed to the constitutional and other issues relevant to the referendum.
It does not say `some substitute for a general civics program', which would be best done separate from a referendum. Senator Ellison said he has taken this from the decision of the Constitutional Convention. The communique said `a public education program directed to the constitutional and other issues relevant to the referendum'. It does not say, `Explain to the people the system of government which we have.' I suppose some of that might be included. In reality, the decision was asking for people to be given an explan ation of the constitutional issues relevant to the referendum, not `This is our system, isn't it wonderful?' 
I am really quite shocked that the government is saying that they are prepared to promote the current system of government by putting it out in the public arena—I do not know how you would put it out without promoting it in some way; it is like putting out stuff during an election campaign—explaining what is in the current system of government when, quite frankly, if that is the government's choice then that should be part of their campaign to keep the system as it is. That should be part of the $7½ million and perhaps that extra $4.5 million should be spent on actual community involvement.
Perhaps Senator Ellison could also explain whether public education programs will have some interaction involved with them. What does a public education program mean? Does it just consist of giving people information—that is, the old bucket and spade approach of education—or does it involve people being involved in workshops where they can ask questions and have them answered in a real public education program? Are there going to be any publicly funded community consultations that involve people being able to speak and be listened to?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—It is quite clear from the communique of the Constitutional Convention that it envisaged that part of the public education program would involve informing Australians as to what the current system is, because it says that the education should particularly involve `constitutional and other issues relevant to the referendum'. The starting point has to be to tell the people of Australia, `This is our current system.' I think Senator Margetts might have misunderstood me when she said that what we would be doing is saying, `This is our current system, and how wonderful it is.' The second part will not form part of the public education program. That will be argued in the yes and no debate. What we will be saying simply to the people of Australia is: `This is the current system.'
Before you ask people to change, before you ask people to vote for something new, I think it is only responsible that you tell them what is there in place now. You tell them 
 without saying whether it is bad or good; you simply say in a dispassionate manner that this is the current system of government. I think Australians want to be reminded as to the system of government that we currently have. They are going to say, `There is a suggestion that we should change but I want to know firstly what we are changing. What do we have at the moment?' I think that is a fair question and one which should be fairly answered.
The question of whether it is wonderful or not is left to the yes and no committees, and we are funding them $7½ million each. They will both take that up, no doubt, and they have the discretion as to how they will run their campaigns. But I would imagine it would involve them saying, on the one hand, `This is a great system; why change it?' and, on the other hand, `It is a great system but this is better.' Without pre-empting their arguments, that is how I imagine it would run.
The question of public education must entail information as to what the current system is. As to whether it involves interaction, certainly there will be dissemination of information. People will be able to make inquiries and will be given information. There will be advertising of some sort. I will certainly take on board your concerns, Senator Margetts,  about the question of workshops, but there has been no decision as yet that that will be part of the campaign.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-29,"—I ask the minister: would it not therefore be appropriate, if this is a neutral information campaign, to also give some neutral information to the community—as part of this $4.5 million—about republics? If it is not about promoting and if it is about a neutral campaign, should not part of this $4.5 million be neutral information about republics?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—Certainly one aspect of it will be to advise the people of Australia as to the question that will be put to them in November, and that is the question of whether Australia becomes a republic. The question of republics in general 
 is perhaps one which would invite a good deal of subjective assessment, and I would suggest to Senator Margetts that she would be treading on pretty dangerous territory in looking at the different republics across the world. From an education and information point of view, I think if you were to pick one republic and not another you would have complaint. To go through all of them and provide a commentary on the sorts of republics you could have could well confuse people.
Apart from the preamble, people will be asked two questions in November. The question on the republic will be: `Do you want Australia to become a republic in this form?' That will be only one question, which will be answered yes or no. It will not be: `Do you want one like Germany?', `Do you want one like America?' or `Do you want a South American model?' It will not be that at all. It will just be putting the one question to them, and I think it is very important that the people of Australia, in this public education phase, are reminded of what that question will be and what it entails.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-29,"—I thank the minister, who has narrowed it down to exactly the point I am about to make. I am now suggesting to the minister that information about the model that is being proposed is therefore appropriate in this neutral education campaign. I may not think it is a great model, but is it envisaged that this neutral education campaign will not just be about the system of government we have? Will there be information and a clear explanation about the model that is being proposed, without involving a yes or no?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—Excuse my exasperation, but I mentioned earlier that there were three aspects: (1) the current system, (2) the proposed model—that is, the model that is to be put to the people, and (3) the procedure. It has always been the  case that we would have the model being part of that public education program. We will also have the procedure; that is, there will be a referendum. It will be put to you only after legislation has been passed. This legislation 
 will have to be debated in the houses of parliament, and it will be the subject of scrutiny via a parliamentary committee. So we will have the current system, the proposed model and the procedure by which the referendum will be conducted. This is, of course, quite separate to the question of how you mark your ballot paper. That is something for the AEC and is not part of the public education program that I am talking about. That will be dealt with quite separately by the AEC.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I can understand Senator Margetts's concerns about this. We are talking about a government that will give $7½ million to each side of the campaign but will then spend $4½ million extra on essentially propping up, promoting and making the public more aware of, in their own way, the current system. So, at the end of the day, you will have $12 million spent putting forward and promoting the status quo and $7½ million spent on the other side of the case. That is something that we are concerned about, particularly since the government's interest in promoting the current constitutional system is a newborn one.
When I was minister for immigration not all that long ago, I started a program of ensuring that new citizens got a copy of the Australian Constitution. It did not cost us much, but it was something which I felt was an important bit of information for people to receive on becoming citizens. One of the first things the government did on taking office was to stop that program. So you have to be a bit cynical about the government's motivations here, and it is a cynicism that I think the community has as well.
If you are going to spend $4½ million on basically explaining, as you say, in a neutral way—but promoting is probably the best way of putting it—the current constitutional system, that of course will have, and you know it will have, the impact of basically shoring up support for,  through better understanding, the current system.
I would like to ask you some questions about this neutral campaign, Minister. Can you tell us when it will run? Will it run at the same time as the referendum campaign, or is 
 it intended to run sometime earlier than November this year? Has a decision been taken as to whether and when it will start?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—Firstly, dealing with the question of the $4.5 million education campaign being one which is to prop up the current system, I totally reject that. It will be an unbiased campaign. Senator Bolkus said that it is aimed at shoring up support for the current system by making people better understand the current system. God forbid that we would ever have the people of Australia better understanding the current system! I would have thought it highly desirable that the people of Australia understand fully their own system. I think, quite frankly, it is a highly desirable goal, and it is one which the government aspires to.
If you believe the system should be changed, then obviously you believe there are flaws in the current system and, if there are those flaws, no doubt they will be self-evident in that public education campaign and people will pick it up. This campaign is not designed one way or another to promote a yes or no position. It is simply putting the Australian people in the picture, and that is a fair enough proposal.
In relation to the timetable, you have heard mention made that we are looking for feedback on the draft bills by the end of April. We would be looking to introduce the legislation in May and with the introduction of the legislation there would be a low-level aspect of the public education campaign. That would grow, and in September I would imagine it would be at its peak. During the passage of the bills from the other place to the Senate, no doubt there will be committee scrutiny. A reference to a joint parliamentary committee is one that has been anticipated so that both houses are involved. The bills would then be back in the Senate in August for debate. We would then look to the normal process of the AEC fulfilling its requirements of sending out yes and no cases in the interim period between then and the referendum.
At that stage we would be looking at September-October for the more robust part of the campaign—where the yes and no cases 
 most probably would be in full flight with their respective campaigns. Finally, the voters of Australia would receive the yes and no case from the AEC before they vote in November. That is a rough timetable, as best we can describe it, but it will require cooperation from people. I ask you to bear that in mind, because we aim to have this referendum in November—some eight months away—and those procedures have to be gone through before we arrive at the referendum.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I am sure you did not misunderstand me earlier on, and I think it is important that Australians understand their Constitution. That is why I took the decision to make it available and to present it to new citizens. I think the promotion of a greater understanding of the Constitution should be part of civics education rather than being under the guise of a campaign here.
You may have misunderstood my question. I am concerned about this neutral campaign. You mention that it will run at a low level up to September, but I would like to know when it will actually run—when it will start. If it were at a low level, when would the low level finish, what would constitute the low level, and when would it go into a higher level?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—We would envisage in the first instance that the dissemination of literature would be roughly at the same time as the introduction of the bills. I said that would be in May. That is relatively low level. You then build it up, because we have limited funds available. The other thing is that you do not want to hit the peak of information at too early a point, because there is a school of thought that perhaps it is best to reach the peak closer to the referendum rather than months out from the referendum.
The education process is very important to help people make up their minds. If you were to have a flurry of education, activity, advertising and the like now, and then it dropped off, you might well find that that disadvantages people. It is much better to have a campaign which runs for a period of time right up to the referendum, with perhaps 
 a peak of information much closer to the referendum, because I think it is fair to say that people will turn their minds more to the referendum when the time arrives.
I can assure you that the majority of Australians—men and women in their daily lives out there—are not thinking constantly about the republic at the moment. They have a lot of other things on their plates to think about, and it is my bet that the majority of Australians will look at this closer to the event. I am not saying that people will not be looking at it now, but I am saying that if you were to run a campaign with education information now, you could well miss the boat because you would miss those people who will only turn their minds to the referendum and what it all means much closer to the event. I think it is commonsense that you increase the output of the campaign much closer to the referendum.
It is what we have learnt as political parties in campaigning for any manner of things—that you build it up until the day of reckoning when people make a decision. It is commonsense. If you believe we should spend the $4.5 million now—use it all up next week and have nothing thereafter—I think people would say that is foolish. A sensible approach is to have an information campaign which runs over months and then reaches its peak of output closer to the referendum.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-29,"—This is an outrage. You are fiddling the books to apply $12 million to those on the no side or associated with it. You are talking about a campaign. We started with a neutral educative program and now it has become a campaign, Minister.
Senator Ellison interjecting—
—No, you just referred to it as a campaign. Let us try to get some details. I have to say to you that my family is not in town this week, so I can spend all night on this. Let us try to get some details on this. You said that in the first part, starting in May, you will be talking about literature. What literature are we talking about and to whom will it be targeted? When will that first part of the campaign, the literature part, stop?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—I would envisage that you would have the literature side of the campaign existing throughout the intervening period. It stands to reason that, if you have a publication which is simple to read and easily understood, you would have it available for all Australians during the intervening period. So that is pretty clear.
I also correct you, Senator Bolkus, on one thing. I have referred to this as a public education campaign. The word `campaign' is no recent invention on my part nor on the part of the task force. It is something which is a campaign; it is in a campaign form to educate people, to inform them. The word `campaign' has no sinister connotation about it. It is a campaign to inform and educate. I have mentioned that it will be neutral, and it will be.
The question of the sorts of advertising that are employed, be it electronic or print, is another aspect of the information campaign. The wording has not yet been settled. Our advisory panel, which is yet to be set up, will advise the task force to ensure that we do get it right. Really, to say what form it will take in detail in the future would be presumptuous of me indeed because we will be seeking the advice of this panel, so I cannot give you the detail of it. If I did that, it would be outrageous. You do not have a dog and bark yourself. The fact is that we will have an advisory panel and we will take advice from it in relation to format, wording and substance. So I cannot give you that detail at this point in time but, as soon as we are able, it will be made public.
I reject comprehensively the question of this being an attempt to fiddle the books. It is an open, transparent process. It is one which involves informing people, as only we should do, in the lead-up to a referendum—a very important one. When it comes to the yes and the no cases, we have funded them equally. There are some people who might say that including an explanation of the proposed model is perhaps giving an advantage to the republicans. That is something which could be argued. So your argument that this is a one- 
sided attempt to promote the current system falls to the ground because we will also be telling people what the proposed model entails—the better the understanding, the better the situation. I think everyone agrees, Senator Bolkus, that increased understanding in this situation can only benefit the country.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—I mentioned earlier that the Attorney-General is on the task force; he is the chair of it. I am on it. There is representation from the Prime Minister's office and, from time to time, we have representation from the AEC.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-29,"—I would certainly be very interested to know who is on these steering committees or task forces. To assist the committee, I have just looked up in the Macquarie Dictionary  the meaning of the word `campaign'. It says:
. . . 1. the military operations of an army in the field during one season or enterprise. 2. any course of aggressive activities for some special purpose: a sales campaign . 3. the competition by rival political candidates and organisations for public office . . . 
It does not say anything about `neutral'. So the reality is that a campaign means selling something. You are selling something, promoting something—putting a viewpoint. To me, a neutral campaign seems to cancel itself out.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—I think that definition fits entirely what I have been saying. It is a special purpose which is pursued aggressively. The special purpose here is to inform the people of Australia. If we are regarded as doing it somewhat aggressively then perhaps I should apologise, but I can tell you that our resolution is none the less. Our special purpose is to provide a neutral education and information campaign or program for the people of Australia. If you want us to use the word `program', Senator Margetts, maybe that will make you feel happier.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-29,"—Given that you say that this information may start going out in May, and given that it is now the end of March, there is only one month in the interim. I would think that even to print information of that scale to distribute to the people of Australia or to find out ways of putting it out would take some time. How long would it take to print information for all households in Australia if you did choose direct mail? It beggars belief that with one month before this education campaign is due to start we actually have no idea of the format it is going to take or what is going to be in it.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—I did not say this would commence precisely on 1 May. I said it would be in the month of May and that gives you some latitude. The whole extent of the information, how it is disseminated and its form will not be decided necessarily by the beginning of May. In the first instance there may well be a booklet, a letter or something else. That will only be a first step and one which, I would have thought, we have more than enough time to distil. When one looks at when the legislation might be introduced into the parliament, that gives us in excess of a month to get that together. I do not see that, on day one, you would rush out and send your booklet to everyone in the country.

I would like to know, first of all, from what budget the Newspoll comes, because the funding and so on has not gone through yet. From what budget does the Newspoll come, and why will we not see not just the results but what questions were asked and what kind of sample was used? Are you suggesting that whatever committees in whatever process comes about will have the knowledge or ownership of that information and that we as the parliament will not get to see what you have asked and the answers unless those committees choose to give them out?

The next thing is the question of what was asked and the result. That normally is what is revealed in relation to research. What is the use of knowing that 80 per cent of people thought that there should not be a republic when you do not know what is asked? I would envisage that you would get all that research and, if you want a copy of it, you can have it. Primarily it is something which we as a government are relying on so that we can cater for the needs of the Australian 
 people in informing them. Secondly, we thought it might be of use to the yes and no committees in their arguments. But it is also freely available. There is no concealment of this. Can I also tell you that it comes out of the $4.5 million.
If we are going to have an education campaign, it would be foolish not to have some sort of research as to what people know or do not know. Once you know that, you can meet the needs of the people. So the research will be made public and our education campaign will be assisted greatly by this research.

I am not aware of any other funds being expended from the $4.5 million, but I will take that on notice and give you those details. In relation to other polls, I am not aware of any other polling being done for this specific purpose by the government. I think the Centenary of Federation did some polling of its own accord in relation to what people understood in relation to the current system of government and the question of a republic, but that certainly was nothing that I was involved with.

Perhaps if I could put it this way, Senator Bolkus: a lot does depend on the advice we get from the advisory panel. If we find that we have a literature campaign which is doing very well, there might not be the need to increase awareness through electronic media, but that is a decision which will have to be made at the time.

My recollection is that Newspoll tends to come up with results that are shown state by state, excluding Tasmania—and I certainly stand to be corrected on that. I just wonder if the poll on this occasion is being done with the demographics of the average Australian in mind or whether it is actually being done to find out what people in different states and territories think. They are quite different things.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—I can 
 say to Senator Brown that we certainly want to know the statistics on a state by state basis. That is something that we will be getting, including for the territories and, of course, Tasmania. That is important.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-03-29,"—That is interesting, Chair, because it raises the question of the potential for different levels of campaigning in different states and territories, as a result of the outcome of that poll. I wonder if the government has thought down the line as to what it has in mind there. Is it going to concentrate effort in New South Wales or Tasmania or Western Australia according to the outcome of that poll? And is it therefore looking for the degree of awareness in different states as against each other? If so, why? Is it looking with a view to the constitutional requirement that you have to win in a number of states as well as overall? If not, what were the parameters that the government set in the tendering process, which Newspoll has won, to get this information?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—Perhaps I can put it this way. At the outset, let me make it clear that this polling is in no way designed to achieve any result insofar as the referendum on the republic goes. It is not designed to achieve a majority constitution or otherwise. It is looking at what people know about the current system. `Do you know what the constitution is? Do you know what the Senate is? Do you know what the House of Representatives is?'—questions which go to people's knowledge of the current system.
It may be helpful on a state by state basis to know what the level of understanding is. It may be that some states differ from others. It would certainly be the intention of the Commonwealth government that there be a uniform understanding of the current system, the proposed model and the procedure across Australia and that there be no variation from one state to another. It may well be helpful, of course, to the yes and the no cases, as to where certain understandings lie or do not lie. But that is up to them. If they want to campaign in one state or another, that is up to them. 
The government wants to achieve a uniform result, as much as is possible, across the country. There may be differing factors in different states which might need to be addressed: who knows? I do not know what the results will reveal. Certainly, you might have in one state a level of understanding which is quite different from that in another, although I would be surprised: I would imagine that you would find it was pretty uniform across the country—but I stand to be corrected.
There is certainly no desire, Senator Brown, to use that information as a means of achieving some sort of majority at the referendum. It is for other people to embark upon the yes and no cases, not the government. I think it is helpful to know where the understandings and misunderstandings lie, and that is why this research is so important; and making it public will assist everyone.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-03-29,"—I understand that. I brought up my previous question because Newspoll usually does not recognise Tasmania. It prints results for states right across the country but not for Tasmania. I do not know whether Newspoll does not know that Tasmania is part of the Commonwealth, or whether people are frightened of plane or ferry travel, but Newspoll regularly gives us results for  issues right across the country but leaves out one of the founding states.
I am pleased to hear that on this occasion you will be giving results for Tasmania. There may be a problem there: if the polling is done on a population basis, Tasmania, with a smaller populace, will have fewer people being interviewed and therefore the results may not be quite as reliable. But the intent of this poll is obviously a good one. I can tell you that Tasmanians will be interested to see what the results are. I would predict at the outset that Tasmanians are going to come out tops in this poll because, with its different electoral system, people down there are very literate on political and constitutional matters; but let us see.
I want to come back to the question of the request by the Constitutional Convention that, in the event of a republic being established 
 consequent upon these elections, there be another Constitutional Convention to look at other matters—including the rights and responsibilities of Australians, the environment, indigenous peoples' recognition, and so on—in the Constitution itself. I would remind the committee that the request to the convention that another convention follow the establishment of a republic was essential to that convention coming to an agreement at all. We would not be here without that condition having been agreed upon. The government was quite obviously involved in that commitment being made.
The opposition today has indicated that it stands by that commitment and has supported the amendment that Senator Margetts moved earlier. But, as I recollect, the government said that it did not support that amendment, even though the amendment was carried. I am wanting to know why the government did not support that amendment and whether this is an indication of breach of faith from its position in the Constitutional Convention.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—The Prime Minister never undertook to have this further convention as suggested by the Constitutional Convention. The Prime Minister did undertake that there would be a referendum and that the question of Australia becoming a republic would be put. He said that that was on the condition of us being re-elected. But he did not go any further to give any undertaking in relation to this convention. I point out that if the republic gets up it will come into play in 2001. This parliament will come to an end some time, no doubt, in 2001—maybe 2002, and for us to be making decisions now as to what future parliaments should be doing is unwise. I also think it is unwise for us to be making commitments at this stage before we know the result of the referendum. I think it is something which can be canvassed adequately enough once the referendum has been dealt with when we know which way Australia is heading.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-03-29,"—I cannot accept that. The government was very heavily represented through its nominees at the Constitutional Convention, and we all 
 know that an enormous amount of goodwill and good faith was required, particularly in the final days of that convention, to get the result that we are now dealing with in this Senate. What the minister is indicating is that the Prime Minister made no commitment as to what the convention would come up with—and I can understand that. But inherent in the very tough negotiations within that convention was the belief that government representatives there would bring back the strength of feeling that was required and the commitment made by people who otherwise would not have allowed the outcome to be the way it was that there would be another convention down the line.
If I can refresh the Senate's mind on this, there was a very strong feeling at the Constitutional Convention that it ought to go much further than just changing the section of the Constitution which would bring in a president. There was a feeling that there should be major changes to the Constitution to bring it into line with constitutions enjoyed by other countries and to bring it into line with the thinking of Australia at the end of the 20th century. At the end, there was only a resolution of this matter by those people who wanted far greater changes to the Constitution by a commitment from those who did not want those changes that this would be recommended as being dealt with by a consequent Constitutional Convention.
I do not think the matter is resolved by the Prime Minister saying he is not interested in it or he is not in favour of it. He placed a great deal of power, trust, deliberation and responsibility on that convention. These things are two-way. It is incumbent upon the Prime Minister to show good faith with the outcome of that convention and to understand that outcomes from Constitutional Conventions are rarely easy and that the points of view expressed by a convention should be taken seriously. Is the Prime Minister taking those things seriously? If the Prime Minister is making the decision here and not the government, that in itself is a remarkable factor, because the Prime Minister is not the fount of all wisdom when it comes to things constitutional for this country.
Here we have a clear request from a Constitutional Convention made up of people right across the country but with a large number of them appointed by the government—that is, the Prime Minister. The inference I get from what the minister says is that the Prime Minister does not give a damn about that. That is not good enough. The convention made a very specific request that there be another convention post-referendum. That was an essential part of the outcome. You cannot divorce the other outcomes from that. The Prime Minister cannot be selective about this—at least he cannot be selective without him and the government giving good reasoning back to those people who worked so hard in the convention and had, I think, enormous public participation in their representation at that convention,
This is not a minor matter. It is hugely important. It is going to even shape the way in which some participants of that convention who are opinion makers take a role in trying to get this nation to a consensus by referendum time—at least trying to get a referendum outcome that is dinkum. It is not good enough for the Prime Minister to say, `Oh well, I've got the components I want. The decision by that  convention to seek another convention after these referendums can go hang.' I would like to hear from the minister that that is not the situation—that the government is serious about taking all the recommendations of the convention. If it has dropped the one about there being another convention to look at further changes to the Constitution, then it ought to provide this Senate, the people who were at that convention and the people of Australia with a good explanation.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-03-29,"—I thought it would be appropriate to remind the minister of those members of the government who voted for the motion at the Constitutional Convention to which Senator Margetts and Senator Brown have referred. They included Kevin Andrews, Treasurer Peter Costello, Mrs Chris Gallus, Minister Robert Hill, Minister Jocelyn Newman, and the Attorney-General, Daryl 
 Williams. So it is quite a diverse bunch of government members of parliament, I would suggest. In addition, Rob Borbidge, Chief Minister Kate Carnell, Peter Collins, Jeff Kennett, John Olsen and Shane Stone voted for the motion—certainly reflecting a broad range of opinion if you read that in conjunction with the list of the many other delegates.
I think it would be quite interesting to find out why those members of the government have opposed the amendments. Certainly those ministers represented in this chamber—that is, Senator Newman and Senator Hill—should put on record why they have blatantly contradicted a position that they took just over a year ago. I think it is a little sad. I suggest that the rationale that they do not want to commit future governments to certain positions is a little spurious, given that that is what we do all of the time in this place. I would have thought implementing a new taxation system was essentially committing a new government to a different taxation process. That is our job, of course.
It reflects adversely on those members that they took a stance at the Constitutional Convention that was in line with a majority of delegates; they supported a very good motion, and amended to be even more valuable, and yet these members—ministers, no less—have completely undermined and contradicted the position that they took a year or so ago. That is very sad. I ask that the minister asks his colleagues, specifically his colleagues in this place, and certainly any of those frontbench members to whom I referred, to outline their change of opinion.
Given that on a number of other areas to do with the bills to alter the Constitution it is mooted that they will be free votes, I wonder why that vote was not a free vote for members in this place.
Senator Margetts interjecting—
—Indeed, I accept that interjection, and maybe that is why we did not go to a division.
—Senator Stott Despoja, the rest of us did not hear that interjection. If 
 you could share it with us, we would appreciate that. Certainly, Hansard would.
—Senator Margetts interjected that perhaps that is why we did not go to a division. I hope I did not misrepresent her interjection. I do not mean to be facetious about this issue.
When these members went to the Constitutional Convention they were entrusted with a degree of responsibility and, I think, privilege. Those of us who attended in an appointed capacity were entrusted with a great deal of responsibility and faith by our parties, the parliament and the community. I think it is pretty outrageous that those people have just completely contradicted a position that they held previously. No wonder people are cynical about politicians. At a minimum, I would expect those ministers to explain their position and put on the record their change of heart. I certainly suggest that the minister draw the questioning in this place to the attention of those honourable members in both houses, because the least that we deserve is an explanation.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech

I have circulated an amendment to the motion that the report of the committee be adopted. I will be speaking to that in a while but I will not have a chance to question the minister at that stage. When we get to the point of asking the public of Australia—hopefully, by the next election they will have the chance to put it in a plebiscite—whether they want to move towards a republic, the basic question that a lot of people have expressed an interest in, will your members have a conscience vote on that question?",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech

There is an amendment circulated in my name to which I will speak when we get to the point in this debate that the report of the committee be adopted. Because I will not have an opportunity then of asking questions of the minister, I am asking the question now, considering that the minister said that these are issues upon which his party has a free vote. Will the members of the coalition have a free vote on the question that I will be putting tonight—that is, if the referendum fails, will the community of Australia have a chance to express their views one way or the other, in a plebiscite, as to whether they want to advance to a republic? That is a very clear question.
My amendment is seeking to give people another chance, if this inadequately put together proposal fails. If it fails, will the coalition side of politics give its members the chance to vote freely on this issue? This is not a mechanical issue. This is about whether the people of Australia will have a chance—at the next election, so it is not binding a future government—to express in a plebiscite whether they wish to move towards a republic.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-03-29,"—The opposition supports the Financial Management Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 . It will pave the way for the introduction of an accrual accounting system in the government. As I do not wish to delay the passage of this bill, I will be brief. I thank the government for briefing my office, and I understand the bill has five key proposals.
Firstly, it is proposed that the current fund accounting arrangements be abolished and replaced with accrual accounting arrangements for government agencies. The proposed accrual accounting system will recognise the financial effects of transactions and events, not just the financial flow of cash. The opposition agrees that accrual accounting, as well as related changes to procedures in the management of public accounts, would help in reducing administrative and system costs. The proposed accrual accounting  system will also provide agencies with greater independence in managing their funds.
Secondly, special accounts are intended to be established within the Consolidated Revenue Fund, with the replacement of the Reserved Money Fund and Commercial Activities Fund. This would remove unnecessary transactions between accounts.
Thirdly, the Treasurer will be given the power to invest public moneys. I am aware that this is effectively an extension of the Treasurer's current powers available to him under the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve Act 1955. Fourthly, it is proposed that the Minister for Finance and Administration will have to prepare monthly financial statements and that the statements must be in the form that is consistent with the budget estimates for the financial year. Fifthly, it is proposed that in the course of the transition—that is, for the period 1999-2000—the finance minister need only prepare quarterly statements as opposed to the required monthly schedule. This proposal is reasonable on the grounds that agencies may not have fully adapted their systems to the new regime in the immediate short term.
The opposition supports the change to the accrual accounting standard as it would introduce a level of transparency in identify 
 ing outcomes and the true costs of delivering outputs. On the impact of accrual accounting on budget proceedings for 1999-2000, I am so far encouraged that the government has been prepared to discuss issues to ensure the readability of upcoming budget papers and accounts. In particular, the government has indicated that it would endeavour to provide a basis on which previous budget papers could be compared with the 1999-2000 version. Other issues are being sorted out between the opposition and the government on the budget process. I encourage the government to continue its helpful approach.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-29,—The Democrats support the Financial Management Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 .,SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-29,"—I rise today to talk about the Financial Management Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 . This is a very important issue because it changes how we will be reading and hearing about the way governments organise their budgets. Just a few days ago, the government held a seminar about how this might work in a budget context. Quite a few MPs were there, mostly from the non-government side—Labor and Greens parliamentarians and their staffers. It does seem that there are quite a lot of questions that are still to be asked and answered, and there are still a lot of unknowns.
One concern that I have is that, while it has the potential for greater accountability, it also has the potential to be a little reductionist—although it depends how it is organised, and it depends how it is reported. The potential for good or bad is what worries us at the moment. This bill attempts to bring the legislative framework provided by the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 into line with the accrual financial framework that will begin on 1 July 1999.
The move to an integrated accrual budgeting resource management and financial reporting framework was recommended by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its reports Nos 338 and 341 of November 1995 and by the National Commission of Audit in its report of June 1996. The primary change 
 made by the bill is to repeal the provisions dealing with fund accounting while retaining the essential features of the funds and the ability to hypothecate money for specified purposes through provisions to establish special accounts within the consolidated revenue fund—the CRF.
The Greens have a number of concerns about this bill. Some of these are specifically to do with the provisions of the bill itself, some arise in the context of accrual accounting as a framework, and some arise from the broader issues of the kinds of indicators we are looking at to determine public policy in this country.
Let us look at the reporting requirements. The Greens have concerns about the less rigorous reporting requirements in this bill. The reduction in reporting requirements allows the minister to publicise the Commonwealth financial transactions every quarter rather than every month. We acknowledge that this arrangement can last for only 12 months at the most. However, this issue is important for transparency. Not only is it important for transparency, but it is also important when we struggle—and every year we struggle—to work out what has happened between one year and another. It is especially so at this time of change and we really need more, not less, transparency while we are trying to track massive changes in accounting systems, although the government acknowledges this will be difficult to track. We understand that the government acknowledges there will be difficulties, but we do believe that it is possible.
We have been given assurances that this is a backup provision only—a contingency plan. We are advised by the department and by the office of the parliamentary secretary, Mr Slipper, that it is the intention for the minister to report under section 54 of the Financial Management Act on a monthly basis unless it is impossible in a practical sense to do so. We are advised that Senator Ellison will clarify this intention, and we will be seeking such a clarification on the record during the committee stage of the bill or perhaps during the final second reading contribution.
In addition, the Greens are concerned that departments may be left underfunded during this changeover period to accrual accounting. While the government recognise that there may be troubles with gathering data for reporting, they are not acknowledging the possibility of extra start-up costs for departments. It seems that there is little doubt the start-up costs will be an issue. It may require more staff—certainly, updated software—and other system changes. Advice we were given at the seminar indicates that a lot of the information that is normally available during Senate reports will be available again. This would indicate that probably there is going to be more information provided in the reports, and surely this may mean more people involved. It certainly may mean more work for those people interpreting that data.
The Joint Committee of Public Accounts, report No. 338 Accrual accounting: a cultural change, August 1995, pages 48 to 51 and the National Commission of Audit Report to the Commonwealth government of June 1996, especially pages 229 to 232, are relevant, especially this sentence:
The initial cost of the move to full accrual accounting should not be underestimated, particularly the differential impact of the changes on smaller departments and agencies.
The government appears to have rejected the JCPA's August 1995 recommendation that supplementary funding be provided to agencies to help them redevelop their financial management systems to facilitate the move to full accrual accounting.
Mr Slipper's office has assured us there will be a review of all departments and specifically their funding arrangements. Consequently, the Greens seek clarification that the departments' resources and their abilities to deal with the accrual accounting framework will be a highly relevant consideration during the review of the financial position of departments as part of the budget process this year. We would hate to think that they would be required to find those resources somehow by other means.
I move now to issues relating to the more general concerns with the accrual accounting framework. From our point of view, there are 
 unknown ramifications. In general, the change to the accrual accounting system will have a number of positives for transparency in management of the Public Service. The system will provide a more comprehensive basis for making managerial decisions as it gives a more accurate outline of all the resources used by the department. It changes the management focus from one primarily on cash flows and fund balances to one that focuses on all resource flows and assets and liabilities.
There certainly was a case to be made that the Public Service was much too process oriented and too little outcome oriented. However, honourable senators will realise that in Senate estimates when people asked about outcomes there were a whole range of outcomes that were sought. I am not sure whether or not this range of outcomes that the community believes are important has been gathered. We will get to that later.
What is the cost of this move? It is fair to say that many of the holes and the problems in the accrual accounting framework have not yet been realised. It is likely that the full ramifications of the proposed changes are not yet fully comprehended by those who will be affected by them. They may well be much worse than expected. The Greens have a number of concerns already. Anecdotal reports suggest that the implementation timetable may be somewhat ambitious for many of the departments. Indeed, this is suggested by the Department of Finance and Administration themselves, as they are concerned that it will be difficult to meet the usual monthly reporting requirements.
I will also be keeping a watching brief to see that the focus on outcomes does not swamp important procedural issues, such as consultation in actually devising outcomes and outputs and consultation in pursuing programs and initiatives. You may recall that one of the first processes, got together by COAG to work out benchmarks, was on schools. I have mentioned this before in this chamber. A whole bunch of Treasury officials got together to decide on what were good outcomes and benchmarks in schools. The only thing they forgot was that perhaps this 
 was not the best way. They were not actually the right, qualified people to work out what were good school education benchmarks.
On that particular occasion, a group of concerned parents contacted the Greens (WA). It seems that they provided information to the wider community. They were allowed—it was not advertised—to make submissions to this process. We do not really know exactly what happened in this process. What we do know is that the process did not continue in the same manner as was proposed in the beginning. Here we are with a huge leap of faith that somehow or other outcomes can be devised out of thin air without so much as a process—any visible process—by which opinions are sought as to what are good outcomes in a whole range of programs.
The Greens have general concerns with the whole thrust of so-called reform that accrual accounting is based on. `Reform' as a word means a change for the better. The then Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquired into this issue. They said that one of the underlying reasons for the Financial Management Improvement Program (FMIP) was to:
. . . encourage contestability or market competition to influence the way in which goods and services are provided—
and later—
Accrual accounting can be characterised as being one element of the various commercial reforms which have been introduced into the Australian Public Service.
The Greens have major concerns with the immense business focus. While it provides some benefits, it can drastically cut public interest corners. When you are looking at a situation where, in effect, you are treating every department and program as if it has to stand on its own feet, as if it is a business system, then basically what you are doing is putting to those departments that they are going to have to raise revenue or sell assets, or basically come to their own account's defence.
I do not think that is necessarily the way to run a federal government. It might be. I am not even sure it is the way to run a business—that every part of the business has to stand on its own feet. There are very good 
 reasons why businesses support or even subsidise one element of their business. It could be public relations. Who said that public relations had to necessarily, or at least initially, bear its own fruit? However, there are very good reasons why some elements of a business should be supported at one stage and not at others. The very reason that government activities are supported is that there is an understanding by the wider community that governments are expected to do those things which the private sector generally will not, or will not do particularly well. It is inappropriate to consider that each of those programs has to run as if it is a business. Here we have a giant leap of change on the assumption that this is what everybody wants. I am not sure that that is the case with the Australian community.
The Greens do have major concerns with this immense business focus. While it provides some benefits, as I say, it can cut public interest corners. The national competition policy is linked to this issue. Basically what we are seeing is that our accounts systems in relation to budgets are going to link into the 1995 national competition policy. Honourable senators would realise that, for the first time since 1995, we are actually looking into the national competition policy to see what the impacts are. I find it extraordinary that we are actually now leaping into putting accrual accounting to match this national competition policy before we know what the impacts of the national competition policy are. We are looking here at the short term and at price over some broad public interest concerns. Any time you say that, someone will say, `Oh, you can always put the other issues into contracts.' The reality is we have not trained people to put those kinds of things into contracts. We cannot pre-think of all of those issues which are not within the price mechanisms and are not within the market mechanisms. The kind of glib responses you usually get, when you are talking about issues other than simply price and bottom line, do not make many people feel terribly relaxed and at ease.
It is necessary to realise that government departments and government business enter 
 prises are more than businesses—much more. They exist to administer government policy and government policy has, at its heart, public interest. If it has not, one would wonder why. It is not about highest profit and lowest cost. So it is not always appropriate to try to overlay business considerations on government departments. The goals of profit maximisation are rarely appropriate in the public realm. This should always be at the forefront of our minds.
There are broader issues. An accrual accounting system will generally always seek to measure the full costs of a particular transaction, task or process. It does so by using benchmarks or standards. Despite the concern expressed, the Greens believe this is a step in the right direction in some areas. Measurement of the full costs of any given transaction, program or decision is extremely useful from a managerial and transparency perspective.
What are the full costs? I would argue—as would many people in the community—that, for instance, when the government claim that their ANTS package has benefits for the community, you cannot know that unless you have looked at things like the environmental costs, the social costs and the health costs of such major policy decisions. The government will generally say, `Sorry, that is about the environment not about the main issue, which is dollars.' That shows a flawed understanding of what full costs and benefits should be about.
The Greens would like to see this principle of accrual accounting extended further to include, as many other countries have done, environmental accounting systems. We would like to see these kinds of accounts integrated into the national accounts and the budgetary process so that the value of our natural resources is as transparent as the value of the capital stocks in the Defence Force. I hasten to add that that is not necessarily particularly transparent.
The economy and the natural environment interact at many points, and these interactions raise analytical questions. The nation's wealth includes natural resources, such as oil and gas reserves and timber, that are used in produc 
 tion. At what rate are these resources being used? What does it mean if you get a certain amount of so-called profit but you have run down your resources?
The income of producers in the mineral industries includes a return to the drilling rigs, mining equipment, and other structures and equipment engaged in production, as well as a return to the mineral. What share is attributable to the mineral? Economic activity adds to the proved stock of natural resources by exploration and technological innovation. How much of the use of natural resources in production has been offset by these additions?
Households, governments and businesses all make expenditures to maintain or restore the environment. What share of their spending is for the environment? The economy disposes of wastes into the air and water, and the resulting degradation of the environment imposes costs, such as lower timber yields and fish harvests, higher cleaning costs and maybe even costs to human lives. What are these costs? Which sectors bear them?
The answers to questions such as these about the interaction of the economy and the environment are often based on partial and sometimes even inconsistent information, suggesting the need to identify and quantify the interactions within a systematic framework as a basis for more informed analysis and decision making. The United Kingdom, Canada, many Scandinavian countries and the United States have already implemented these systems in a sophisticated manner. We should be following the lead, and substantial groundwork should be done in these countries.
We have already gone some way to providing the basis for getting environmental accounts up and running. In 1995 the ALP government of the time allocated $3.5 million to enable the Australian Bureau of Statistics to develop environmental and resource statistics linked to the national accounts. As noted in the press release associated with the announcement:
This move was to allow for the development of an integrated framework which links the measurement of economic activity to changes in the environment and the country's resource base . . . It also extends to assessments of possible policy issues such as 
 regulations, charges and incentives impacting on the environment.
The ABS has already issued some extremely useful publications that attempt to put forward both qualitative and quantitative assessments of Australia's natural assets. In particular, in June 1996 Australians and the Environment  was released. Also, the ABS has released three documents related to satellite accounts: the energy account, the minerals account and the fish account. The water account is due out later this year. The forest account and the wastes account are being prepared.
The 1996 Saving our Natural Heritage coalition policy document indicated that the development of green accounts would have priority in the ABS forward work program. So where are they? In addition, I note with interest that on 9 September 1996 the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, responded to a question on notice about the green accounting process by saying that a progress review of achievements was scheduled for the latter part of the 1998-99 financial year. I will be waiting with bated breath for that report.
The ABS has already gone a long way down the track to providing a basis for the ability to engage actively and rigorously in environmental accounting. What is needed now is commitment to using in a positive and integrated manner the excellent information provided by the ABS. The government has already made the right noises. The government now needs the political will to look beyond the narrow budget and national account indicators and to see things holistically. The Greens will be supporting the passage of this bill but will seek clarification during the committee stage with regard to the issues raised previously in my speech.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-03-29,"—Hopefully I can allay some of the concerns of the Greens in this reply. In relation to the reporting requirements, the publishing of the report once a month will occur in that transitional period only if it is possible. If it is not possible, then it will be quarterly. It is only for that transitional period of 12 months that there is the possibility of quarterly reporting. 
 Thereafter it will be fixed on a monthly basis. That really takes care of the question asked by the Greens in relation to reporting. The only possibility of the quarterly reporting is during that 12-month transitional period.
In relation to underresourcing, I can tell the Senate that the government will ensure that departments are adequately resourced to ensure the efficient delivery of programs under the accrual management resource framework. That is a commitment by the government. It is the government's view that the funding question here is not an issue. It will not be an impediment to implementation.
In relation to the question of environmental aspects, questions of natural resources being included in accrual accounting, it is true that the ABS has come a long way in relation to this. The matter was first raised in 1995, as Senator Margetts pointed out. The World Bank at that time had also looked at this very question. I can undertake to Senator Margetts to take this up with the Minister for Finance and Administration. At this stage I do not think we are in a position to commit either way in relation to what we can do with that now, but I will certainly take it up with the Minister for Finance and Administration. I thank members of the minor parties and the opposition for their support, and I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-03-29,"—I am moving the following request for amendments to the bill on behalf of the government: amendment No. 5 excludes benefits relating to entertainment, facility leasing, expenses and remote area housing from fringe benefits reporting measures contained in the bill—
—Minister, I understand that they are not requests; they are in fact 
 amendments. The running sheet that I have has you seeking leave to move amendments Nos 1 to 4 and Nos 6 to 15 together. Is that correct or have we had a change?
—I am seeking to move amendment 5, amendments 1 to 4, amendments 6 to 13 and  amendments 14 and 15. I am speaking to them separately.
—Which way are you wanting to move them? Do you want to move amendment 5 first?
—I will move amendment 5 first. But I think that, unless people wish to have the amendments taken separately, I will move them together. If people wish to have them taken separately, I will move them separately.
—Amendment 5 has to be dealt with separately from the rest of them because there is an opposition amendment to your amendment 5.
—Right.
—So do you wish to deal with amendments 1 to 4 and 6 to 15, by leave, together and get them out of the way?
—Sorry, I am just seeking advice. I think there is a technical issue here which I might seek some further advice on. I have now had those discussions and the desire is that we move No. 5 first because there are some amendments to 5 that the Labor Party is moving. So with the leave of the Senate I will seek to move 5 first.
—You do not need leave. So you will move government amendment No. 5 on sheet DT219.
—I move amendment No. 5:
(5)	 Schedule 1, page 5 (lines 16 to 23), omit subsection (3), substitute:
What is an  excluded fringe benefit ?
	 (3)	 An  excluded fringe benefit  is a fringe benefit:
		 (a)	 constituted by the provision of meal entertainment (as defined in section 37AD, whether or not the employer has elected that Division 9A of Part III apply to the employer); or
		 (b)	 that is a car parking fringe benefit (see subsection 136(1)); or 

		 (c)	 whose taxable value is wholly or partly attributable to entertainment facility leasing expenses; or
		 (d)	 that is a remote area housing fringe benefit (see subsection 136(1)); or
		 (e)	 whose taxable value is worked out under section 59 (about remote area residential fuel); or
		 (f)	 whose taxable value is reduced under section 60 (about remote area housing); or
		 (g)	 that is an amortised fringe benefit (see subsection 136(1)); or
		 (h)	 that is a reducible fringe benefit (see subsection 136(1)); or
		 (i)	 that is a benefit prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.
This amendment excludes benefits relating to entertainment facility leasing expenses and remote area housing from the fringe benefits reporting measure contained in the bill.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I have an amendment standing in my name to amendment No. 5, which is to admit and substitute the words that have been circulated in the chamber under my name. I move:
At the end of subsection (3), add:
	 ; or (j)	 that relates to occasional travel to a major population centre in Australia provided to employees and family members resident in a location that is not in or adjacent to an eligible urban area; or
		 (k)	 that relates to freight costs for foodstuffs provided to employees resident in a location that is not in or adjacent to an eligible urban area.
I so move, acknowledging Senator Trish Crossin's interests in this matter. This concerns an issue of the fringe benefits tax and its application to remote Australia. No better example of remote Australia can be found than in the remoter regions of both the Territory represented by Senator Crossin and the state represented by me. That is not to say that that is the limit of remote Australia; clearly there are parts of remote Australia in other states, such as in Queensland and New South Wales.
We believe that the provision, as it is currently drawn, is drawn too tightly. In the debate that will come on amendments Nos 1 to 4 and Nos 6 to 13, the opposition will be indicating support for those government amendments. We believe that those amendments are essentially technical in nature and are required to make this bill more understandable and able to function more effectively. But, with respect to amendment No. 5, the amendment that I have moved will improve, I believe, the position that the government advances in order to clean up this bill before it goes for royal assent—assuming, of course, its carriage in this chamber.
My amendment seeks to protect the interests of people, as I have said, who are living in remote areas, people who live in communities such as Aboriginal communities—but not exclusively Aboriginal communities: there are other workers in remote and regional Australia, and workers in the mining industry come to mind. The amendments will ensure that certain fringe benefits paid to compensate employees in remote areas will be not fixed with a financial penalty under this legislation. The two additional benefits to be freed are a benefit in relation to occasional travel to a major population centre in Australia provided to employees and family members resident in a location that is not in, or adjacent to, an eligible urban area and, in subclause (k), a benefit in relation to freight costs for foodstuffs provided to employees resident in a location that is not in, or adjacent to, an eligible urban area. They are the two additional benefits to be freed under this amendment.
I could speak at some length on this matter, but I want to make these key points as to why the opposition believes this amendment is necessary. People who live in these localities are important Australians and need to be recognised as such. They are Australians who contribute to the overall need to develop and provide points of community within areas that most Australians do not want to go and live in. Their living conditions are not equal to those in urban Australia and, indeed, even in regions of Australia that might be regarded as farming or other areas where there are considerable locations of population. In other 
 words, they have special needs; and to treat those people as if those needs do not apply and as if they are the same as everyone else is to treat them unfairly and unequally.
The amendment that I have moved addresses in part, I believe, that imbalance. That means to say that occasionally these people need to be able to travel from their remote locations to capital cities, either to provide contact with their family or to provide relief from the hardships of their regional location. It also is the case that, in areas of regional Australia, the cost of food is high and freight costs are one of those input costs that ensure that foodstuff prices are much higher than you will find in capital cities.
I know that the government may respond that they have a tax package which will reduce some parts of the freight costs but, even so, it will not reduce all of them; and the disparity between remote location prices and the prices of the same goods in the capital cities will remain. And it will remain very high because, in most cases, a monopoly rent is extracted by the carriers of food from city to remote locations. Usually this is not a competitive market: there is only one carrier and the market is charged what it will bear rather than the most competitive price. As a consequence, there is a higher cost of living in these locations than would otherwise be the case, and any change to the tax law under the government's upcoming GST bills will not remove that but will in many cases—according to evidence given to the Senate committee on the GST—exacerbate it.
But that is not the debate before the chamber. The debate before the chamber is the fringe benefits reporting bill. This is a bill that we support and we see the need for, and it is part of the overall tax package. Taking it separately from the tax package, we support the measures that are made, but only if this amendment is accepted.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I have to apologise for a very croaky voice this evening. I would like to speak to this amendment because, as my colleague Senator Cook said, it really goes not only to fringe benefits reporting but also to being able to recruit and maintain people 
 who work in remote areas. It specifically came to my attention when we had a look at the range of people employed in the Northern Territory Public Service. The kinds of people we are talking about are nurses, Aboriginal health workers, teachers, Aboriginal assistant teachers, police, police aides, and the people who provide the sort of critical infrastructure in those communities that would not be there if it were not for public servants.
These entitlements are not in fact part of a salary package. They are not part of an attempt by these people to opt out of any tax payment or avoid any responsibility they have in the social security system. They have been brought about mainly because they are allowances and conditions of service that are paid to these people as cash in kind. The Northern Territory government pays the fringe benefits tax. I am talking about the amendment to (j) regarding occasional travel.
In the Northern Territory, places of isolation and remoteness are generally in one of three or four categories. The special category to which this amendment would not apply includes Adelaide River, Batchelor, Jabiru, Pine Creek and Yulara. They currently get only the rental rebate, so there is a provision in this bill to include those people. People living in those areas do not get particular isolated fares and do not get assistance with food, so they may not be covered by this.
Category 1 in the Northern Territory includes people who live at Elliott, Mataranka, Newcastle Waters, Tennant Creek or Ti Tree. Category 2 includes places which are a little bit more remote, such as Harts Range or Imanpa, Neutral Junction, Wallace Rockhole, Stirling, Milikapiti. Category 3 includes places which are quite remote: Docker River, Milingimbi, Numbulwar, Ngukurr, Ramingining, Wadeye (Port Keats), Willowra, Yuendumu. I have a list here of the way in which those communities have been categorised for reasons of remoteness.
If you live in category 1, 2 or 3, then you are currently entitled to two sorts of benefits: one is fares out of isolated areas—and we call them FOIL fares. The fares entitle these people and their families who are resident in remote localities to paid travel—either by air, 
 or by motor vehicle at 49c a kilometre—to Alice Springs or Darwin two or three times a year, depending on their location. So the benefit is specifically designed to assist these people to get out of these isolated communities two or three times a year.
I think people need to understand why this was negotiated and why it holds such a special place in attracting and maintaining these people. It is very hard to work in a place like Docker River if there is no incentive to get out to Alice Springs a couple of times a year. The Northern Territory government used to provide these people with tickets or a way out; they now pay that up as cash.
The freight on foodstuffs also applies to these people. From 1 October 1996, there was a provision to subsidise these people for freight on foodstuffs—they were reimbursed on production of receipts. There are currently different categories for this. If you have dependants, you are entitled to have 23 kilos of freight of your food paid for. There is an additional 12 kilos for each dependant. There is a further incentive of another eight kilos if you are in particular remote communities.
So this amendment maintains the benefits for those people in remote communities. These two benefits were always negotiated to attract and recruit but, more importantly, to maintain these people in isolated areas. In closing, I repeat that it is not an attempt on the part of these people to move out of any obligation in relation to social security payments or to diminish their responsibility in payment of tax. It is an amendment to this bill that allows these people to maintain these two benefits, which are well in excess of $1,000 in relation to fringe benefits that are paid to them, without them appearing on their group certificate, because it is a recognition by the government that their expertise is needed to maintain the infrastructure in these communities.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-03-29,"—The government does not see the need for this amendment moved by the opposition, as we think it in some way detracts from the policy objec tive of preventing salary packaging to avoid income threshold limits. I note the remarks by Senator 
 Crossin. She was very careful to state that she did not see this as in any way an attempt to avoid the appropriate limits on payments for social security and various surcharges—I think I am summarising correctly—but saw it as the maintenance of a benefit which is important to people in that area.
The opposition at first moved a wide-ranging amendment which the government could not support. The revised draft is much tighter and we have been advised that there are no significant revenue implications to the amendment. We would prefer this amendment not to proceed but, in discussions with the non-government parties, we have agreed not to oppose this amendment, noting the strong support that Senator Cook and others have given to the general thrust of the bill before the chamber.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-29,"—The Greens (WA) had some questions on the amendment, and still had some questions after Senator Cook's contribution, but Senator Crossin, with great effort—I understand how she feels; I remember doing that once—has explained some of the questions that we had. They include the kinds of groups in the community we are talking about, the kinds of jobs we are talking about and also how you would disaggregate it. I understand that it is an issue of dealing with receipts. We wondered how this fitted into people's packages, how it was paid and so on. I can now see a little about how the process works. The question I need to ask the government is: is it containable or is there the potential that other states might take this on?

We are now talking about amendments 1 to 4. Six to 13 are consequential amendments resulting from this change to the measure. Amendments 14 and 15 remove the requirement for employers to issue early group certificates in certain circumstances where an employee will have a fringe benefits amount shown on their group certificate. Together, these amendments will further simplify the fringe benefits reporting measure and will significantly reduce compliance costs for employers.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I support amendments 1 to 4 and 6 to 13. That leaves aside amendments 14 and 15, which I oppose. I support the ones that I have indicated backing for on the basis that essentially, as explained by the minister, they are technical and necessary amendments to make the bill read properly. Amendments 14 and 15 deal with the issuance of group certificates. From my recollection, these are amendments that, if carried, would mean that the rules would be changed and that workers severing their employment with an employer would not, as is currently required, be required to be provided with a group certificate within two weeks of that severance but would be provided with a group certificate at the end of the year—and not all employees would be in that situation.
Before I go on, I do not think a case has been made out for why the current system should be changed. In fact, a case can be made out that this will impose greater red tape on business and inconvenience workers considerably. Where workers are involved in a downsizing or have left or are in companies where there is a high turnover of staff, the normal thing is for those workers, when they go on their way, to receive their group certificate so that they are in a position, at the end of year, to properly report their income. If this clause were to go ahead, they would have to wait until the end of the year to receive their group certificate.
If there is any large-scale downsizing, that means that it imposes extra burdens on the employer as well as on the workers. As I said, 
 far from simplifying the task for business, this will make the current system more complex. If the amendments succeed, there will be two classes of employees who have different rights to obtain group certificates. Those with fringe benefits will still get their group certificates within two weeks, if they leave work, and those without fringe benefits will have to wait until the end of the year. Differentiating between the two classes just makes life for employers more complicated, and unnecessarily so.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-03-29,"—Senator Cook raised a number of issues. In responding to the matters that he raised, I may, hopefully, have a chance to persuade other non-government members in the chamber.
To calculate an employee's reportable fringe benefits amount for a group certificate at an earlier date would, frankly, in our view, require employers to have much more complex and expensive record keeping systems in place. Further, where car fringe benefits are calculated under the statutory formula method, it will be difficult, although not impossible, to calculate an employee's reportable fringe benefits amount for a group certificate at a date earlier than 30 March. This is because the car statutory formula method requires the employer to know the odometer reading of the car at 31 March.
To avoid these problems and to minimise employer compliance costs, the government 
 proposes that the requirement to issue group certificates early not apply in cases where there is a reportable fringe benefits amount to be shown on the group certificate. Employees who receive fringe benefits with a taxable value of less than $1,000 will not be affected by the measure. It is estimated that there will be very few employees who receive reportable fringe benefits who will need an early group certificate as generally only employees who are departing overseas permanently are entitled to an early assessment of yearly income.
The case that we are putting to the chamber is one where we are trying to minimise compliance costs. This is obviously a very important change that we are bringing forward. The general principles of the change were, I think, supported by both the major parties at the last election. In all these cases there is always a balance to be struck. We think that this is a fair and reasonable balance. We hope that senators will support the government's position.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-29,"—Through the chair, I ask the minister a few questions. The Labor Party have raised some real problems and we have to look at this from two perspectives. One is from the employer's perspective, and the difficulties with compliance and systems, and the other is from the employee's perspective. Dealing firstly with the employee, one of the benefits of the present system, as I understand it, is that an employee can get their group certificate relatively quickly after leaving someone's employ. There are categories of employees whose advice of their movements—their own personal household management—is less than wonderful. In other words, they may move and not let the former employer know where they have moved to, so they might have difficulty in receiving these forms by post. In turn, there is the danger that if too large a gap exists between the arrival of the group certificate and the ending of employment, the employer—particularly small businesses—may have gone broke, closed or sold their business. These are practical difficulties.
When I looked at the government's amendment I was somewhat concerned about the use 
 of the words `calendar year'. Notionally, if I read this correctly—perhaps the minister will advise me if I do not—the amendment states:
The employer must give the employee 2 copies of the completed form no later than 14 July in the calendar year after the calendar year in which the employee ceased to be employed by the employer.
To me that means that somebody could be fired on 14 January 1998 and only get their group certificate on 14 July 1999. I am surprised that we have not used the words `financial year', `the calendar year following the financial year', or something of that sort. That is a plain reading of it, as I see it. Frankly, it makes me nervous about the effect on employers and employees. I would also suggest to the minister that if his own advice is inadequate in this area, because we have many of these tax bills still to come before us we can always revisit this if it can be better worded later.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-03-29,"—I think that some of the arguments that Senator Murray made rather cogently put the case for the amendment we have moved. I thought he expressed them rather well. Of course, I will not query that. I have sought advice on the matters that Senator Murray raised. I am not sure whether the correct person is present in the chamber—because the discussion has gone a bit further—but we understand that, from a practical perspective, the employee would receive the group certificate by 14 July in the same year. If that is a matter of concern to Senator Murray, I will seek further advice and provide that to him at a later date.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-29,"—I advise the minister that that is not how I read the amendment.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-03-29,"—In order to be practical and to expedite this, what the minister has said is that a precious small number of people will be affected by the measure and it does add an extra degree of complication. I would put those two arguments and say, `Why don't you just drop it?' Or you could do what has been suggested by the Democrats and put it on the backburner until it is better sorted out—probably outside of this chamber in some cross-party discussion. The two arguments I would put are that there are so few people affected and it adds an extra degree of difficulty. At the same time, if the minister is hampered in answering questions by the lack of the right adviser, that complicates this debate a little further. Perhaps it would be wise to accept the advice of the Democrats on this.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-29,"—I am also having some difficulties with this amendment. I had difficulty understanding the arguments of Senator Cook initially, certainly in terms of the complexity and considering there were so few people involved. I think most people expect to get their group certificates at the end of the financial year. I have been in that situation when doing part-time jobs. I certainly did not get those group certificates until the end of the financial year. Most people's expectation is that they will get their group certificates and any fringe benefit notation at the end of the financial year, but I would draw the minister's attention to the example of a person who lost their job in January 1998. This would mean they would not get their group certificate until July 1999 and that is the only way I can read this. I do not think that it is a matter which we can get back to later; it has to be sorted out or we have to have a commitment that we are going to deal with it at another hour or in another bill. I do not think we can sort it out any other way.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech

[section 221H—group certificates]
The reason I have moved these amendments together is, if they fall over, the other amendments that follow will consequentially fall over. So that is the way to do it.
These amendments to  A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998  seek to include superannuation contributions made by employers on group certificates. I spoke at length on this in my speech during the second reading debate but I will briefly recap the 
 arguments. The intention is simple, that group certificates show the full value of the remuneration package provided by employers. This will have several advantages. First, it would allow employees to see at a glance exactly how much their remuneration is worth. That would help to improve the standing of superannuation for employees as something real and practical and we think do wonders for its attractiveness.
Secondly, it would allow the superannuation high income earners surcharge to be collected based on group certificates rather than from funds. This was the unanimous recommendation to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation at the time that the surcharge tax was introduced and that recommendation was from business, the unions and superannuation industry groups. It would dramatically reduce compliance costs for superannuation funds and ensure that no-one misses the surcharge net and that no-one is inadvertently caught up in it. I must stress that we have not moved to change the surcharge in this bill to do this.
What we are proposing is that we provide the mechanism whereby it can be done later. Since group certificates are to be changed anyway for fringe benefits, it is the logical time to simultaneously add superannuation into the group certificates so that the collection mechanism for the surcharge can be revisited later.
Thirdly and most importantly, it will allow superannuation to be added into the means test for other benefits. This will ensure that salary packaging attention does not just move from fringe benefits back to superannuation. The Democrats—and this view is shared by unions, business and superannuation industry groups—believe that the total salary of fringe benefits, superannuation and actual remuneration should be shown on group certificates.
The government has already acknowledged that it is entirely appropriate that super contributions should be included in the means test for the 15 per cent high income earners superannuation tax surcharge. But that does not apply to the other superannuation rebates such as the spouse's contribution threshold; nor does it apply to the other tax surcharge on 
 the high income earners from the 1996 budget, which was the Medicare surcharge; nor does it apply to social security benefits.
There are still considerable benefits for high income earners to salary package, using superannuation to get access to other benefits and rebates which they should not have access to. The measure that we have put forward has the potential to increase the savings from cracking down on salary packaging from the $270 million proposed by the government to possibly twice that amount. That is not something to be lightly dismissed. It is for that reason that I commend the amendments to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-03-29,"—Amendments Nos 1 to 12 and 14 to 27 to A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998  and the amendments to A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 1998  proposed by the Australian Democrats seek to have employers' superannuation contributions reported on employee group certificates and be included in the base calculations for various income tests. The government rejects these amendments because, firstly, superannuation contributions made to a complying superannuation fund are exempt from fringe benefits tax. Therefore, the inclusion of these payments on group certificates would be inconsistent with the exclusion of other FBT exempt benefits from the reporting requirements.
Secondly, employers' superannuation contributions are already taken into account when calculating an employee's liability for superannuation surcharge.  This means that employees are unable to avoid paying the superannuation surcharge by swapping their gross salary for employer superannuation contributions. Therefore, amendments Nos 26 and 27 to A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998 are not only incorrect but also effectively include employers' superannuation contributions twice in the calculation of adjusted income for surcharge purposes.
The time and cost which would be expended by employers to report superannuation contributions on group certificates would be 
 significantly greater than the time and cost which would be expended by employers to report fringe benefits. In particular, employers are generally not in a position to know the detail of superannuation contributions attributed to employees who are members of defined benefits superannuation funds and therefore could not comply with these amendments. The requirement to record reportable fringe benefits on group certificates would not apply to all employers and employees, because not all employees receive fringe benefits. However, to include superannuation contributions on employee group certificates would generally impact on all employers and employees, including employees on low income as a result of the superannuation guarantee arrangements.
Superannuation funds are required to provide the Australian Taxation Office with surcharge information by 31 October following the financial year. This does not align with the general requirement for employers to issue employees with their group certificates by 14 July following the financial year. There is an error in amendments Nos 4 and 5 to A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998. When an employee leaves employment between 1 April and 30 June in any year, the amendment requires the reportable superannuation contribution for the next year of income to be included on the group certificate. This is not logical as the employee has already left their employment before the next year of income starts. 	Amendments Nos 14 to 25 to A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998—
—Order! Minister, I think you are moving on to other amendments.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I have had a look at these amendments and had a bit of a think about what Senator Murray has said. I understand where he is coming from. If I apprehend correctly what he has said, he is concerned that these bills, which deal with fringe benefits tax, cut off any avenue for avoidance or evasion. It is out of that quarter that he approaches this legislation and focuses on superannuation as a possible means of tax minimisation in a sense which would be unfair. I understand that motivation. In fact, I join Senator Murray in the motivation. But, looking at these amendments, I am not sure that I can support them.
The first thing I should say about superannuation is that we see it principally as deferred income and therefore addressing issues of living standards after retirement or after the age of 55 and also addressing issues of national savings. I am sure Senator Murray sees it in those terms too, but I think it is necessary to get that on the record.
Secondly, according to the schedule, super goes up to a maximum of nine per cent of salary by 2002. If these amendments go ahead, then workers would lose more of their social security benefits as their superannuation went up. I do not think that is what is intended but I think that is what the effect is. I do not want to delay this but I would not mind if Senator Murray just addressed that question. If that were the application of the amendment, then I am afraid I would have to support the government in this and would do so.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-29,"—A couple of key points have emerged here. One is whether we are going to consider a review of income taxation as being part of this total tax reform process. It is the Democrats' view that income tax has to be viewed holistically; in other words, the actual money you receive at the end of the month plus all fringe benefits and any other benefits such as superannuation. There are, as you know, a number of fringe benefits still left out of those which are going to appear in the fringe benefits box. What we are inclined towards is a very transparent and open system whereby salary packaging essentially becomes 
 a thing of the past. What you see is what you actually get. That is the principled approach we take to it.
The second theme was emphasised by Senator Cook in his earlier remarks, which is that there are people, particularly in the higher income areas, who are using salary packaging—or fringe benefits and superannuation—to minimise their tax. The result is that the tax burden on those who pay their full way is naturally increased. It lessens the ability of the system to cope.
The third area which you have raised is notionally a problem, but it really relates far more to our whole system whereby working people who put in a good day's work are not appropriately remunerated and have to skive and scrimp and find other ways in which to advance their wage. That is not universally true, but it is certainly true of some sectors and some industries.
We would say that if somebody was achieving a nine per cent superannuation benefit but the taxation consequence of adding that to their salary pushed their disposable income below a living wage, that is clearly an unacceptable outcome. But the problem is not with evaluating the superannuation as part of the package. The problem is how much they are actually getting as a living wage. If superannuation and fringe benefits were added to salary, many more Australians would be excluded from the benefits they get from the social security system. We think that is desirable, because if people who are not entitled to do so access the social security system, it makes it much harder for the disadvantaged and low income people. What we have been concerned about is that the government have been hammering away at the people at the bottom, whereas if they attacked more of the people at the means tested end, we could get somewhere with this.
If, as a result of my earlier remarks and the construction of the amendments, the Labor Party have some sympathy but still have some concerns, I would suggest to you, Senator Cook—since we are in the middle of reviewing a total package and there will be other opportunities within the total package of some 29 bills—that perhaps you would come back 
 to the Democrats and say what you do or do not like, and we could pursue this again at a later stage.
To the government I say: you are starting to pursue the principle that we need to look at, which is that a person's total package needs to be evaluated for taxation purposes and at the interface of means testing with the social security system. This means that, in our view, at some time you have to address the issue of superannuation and how it is recorded in terms of a person's total salary package. The group certificate would provide the tax office with a single piece of paper which is the vehicle for saying, `This is the entire salary package that this person is getting'—salary plus fringe benefits plus superannuation. We are saying, simply put, that you have only gone part of the distance on this.
In the same way that I have made the offer to the Labor Party, I make the offer to the government: if the principle and the prospects which we are outlining attract you, there are opportunities over the next few months, in dealing with the overall tax package, of addressing our particular concern. I personally have difficulty in understanding why, as a principle, it would be objectionable to pursue.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech

Perhaps I heard that from the government; I did not necessarily hear that from the opposition.

[section 106Q—repayment test]
This is a very important amendment which seeks to undo some of the damage done by the HECS changes in the 1996 budget. We include it in our amendments because of our desire to highlight that tax reform should be about improving the progressivity of the tax system—that means ensuring that high in 
 come earners are made to pay their fair share while the tax burden is lifted on low income earners.
The rises in graduate taxes in 1996 were the most regressive move on tax made by this government. If tax reform proceeds without some relief for very low income earners now facing punitive rates of tax, then we will have failed as a parliament and as a Senate to do the best we could by low income earners.
The original theory of the HECS repayment was that graduates should pay a portion of the above median income that they earn, recognising that university education has contributed to that. That fundamental underpinning of fairness, of tax equity, was undone by the 1996 HECS changes. The repayment threshold was reduced from $28,200, or 82 per cent of average weekly earnings, to $20,700, which is now around 53 per cent of average weekly earnings. By any measure, someone earning half of average weekly earnings is not a high or even a modest income earner; he or she is a low income earner. Yet this government increased the tax paid by low income earners who have had some higher education by $621 a year, which is a weekly tax increase of around 20 per cent. For someone on average weekly earnings of around $38,000 a year, the HECS changes increased the tax paid by $2,325 a year, or 25 per cent.
The Medicare levy is not payable for a couple without children who are earning less than $22,594. Under our proposal it would not be payable for any  income less than $24,450, which is the taxable income at which the low income earner's rebate finally phases out. Beyond that, the Medicare levy exemption adds on $2,100 for each additional dependent child. The additional family assistance means test adds on $3,000, from $24,350 rising to $28,200 from July next year. At present, a family with three children is exempt from the Medicare levy on incomes less than $28,984 but is eligible for additional family assistance right up to $30,350.
From June next year, they will be eligible for family assistance right up to $34,200 a year. So, even with the Medicare levy exemption, a lot of families and around one in nine individual taxpayers who are regarded as low 
 income earners by the rest of the tax and social security system are caught up in what is supposed to be an above average income earner's HECS tax surcharge. The Medicare levy exemption picks up only 70,000-odd of the 929,000 taxpayers eligible for the low income earner's tax rebate, so there is a clear need for further movement in this area.
As an interim measure, to start reducing what is a grossly unfair impost on those who are clearly low income earners, the Democrats are proposing some measures to take effect with this bill to exclude from HECS repayments those people who are clearly recognised as low income earners. They include those taxpayers who receive the low income earner's tax rebate, which cuts out at $24,450, and those who receive additional family assistance, which commences cutting out at around $23,000. This is only an interim measure but, given that this bill will require employers to change their tax repayments to the HECS scheme, it strikes us as a logical time to do it. I commend the amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-03-29,"—Amendment No. 13, proposed by the Australian Democrats, seeks to raise the threshold which determines when a person is required to make a compulsory repayment under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. The government rejects this amendment. The A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998  closes the loophole which allows taxpayers to defer their HECS repayments through aggressive salary repackaging. This is done by adding reportable fringe benefits to the HECS threshold amount. The proposed amendment effectively defeats the bill's intention by basing the threshold on the low income earner's rebate, which does not include in its income test any reportable fringe benefits. Basing the threshold on certain social security payments will have a similar but lesser effect. We do not propose to support the amendment moved by the Democrats.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-03-29,"—The amendment to subsection 106Q(7) of the Higher Education 
 Funding Act 1998 deals with the repayment threshold for Higher Education Contribution Scheme debts. In 1996 the coalition lowered the repayment threshold from average weekly earnings to $20,700. After indexation, this amount is now $21,334. However, people who are entitled to pay no Medicare levy or a reduced amount of Medicare levy are exempted from HECS repayments. This means that certain people who have or had a spouse are not required to make HECS repayments if their family income is below $24,425 and they have no dependent children or students, and up to $35,777 for five children. The family income limits are higher for additional children.
My understanding of the Democrats amendment is that it seeks to make further changes to the threshold using the same principle—that is, exempting from HECS repayments some people whose income is over the base repayment threshold but who are entitled to certain tax rebates or social security payments. I note that, while the amendments before us refer to `additional family payment', under the Social Security Act there is nothing called `additional family payment'. I therefore assume that what is meant here is the maximum level of family allowance.
The opposition's views on the coalition government's changes to HECS are well known. At last year's election, Labor committed itself to raising the repayment threshold by $1,000 each year from the year 2000. Labor remains committed to the reform of HECS, as outlined in the speech on 16 March by the Leader of the Opposition. A policy review process was set in train following the election, and consideration of changes to HECS will be part of that process. In the meantime, we are not prepared to support random changes to HECS until the opposition has completed its own policy review process on the issue of HECS and higher education more generally.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-03-29,"—I said that I would seek some further matters to put before the chamber in the light of the questions that Senator Murray asked. I said, as I looked around to my left, that we obviously needed some additional advice on the matters that Senator Murray raised. I have now obtained that advice, which I will relay to the chamber. This measure will greatly assist employers in minimising their compliance costs. This is a very vital aspect. If these amendments do not pass, employers will need to have systems in place in two days time, on 1 April, to issue early group certificates. I think everyone in this chamber would recognise that that is an impossibility and would be seen to be quite unreasonable.
In my previous answer, I think I indicated a qualification that I needed to seek additional advice—that the preliminary advice was uncertain. Nonetheless, I relayed that to the chamber and agreed to seek confirmation of the advice. Because of the complexity of the question—an appropriate question, nonetheless—it was appropriate that we should provide appropriate advice. Senator Murray, I can now confirm that if an employee leaves employment after 1 April in a year, they may not receive their group certificate until 14 July the following year. I think that was the point you were making. However, I am advised that in fact there are very few employees who actually request early group certificates. My understanding is that this is not a usual circumstance. But as I said, in the drafting of this bill, it is important that this amendment proceeds because, if it does not, we may be faced with the circumstances that employers may need to have systems in place in two days to issue early group certificates.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-29,"—In another place at another time I mentioned to Senator Cook that in the film The Shawshank Redemption  the word `obtuse' was used. As a consequence, the person who used that word went into solitary confinement for two months. So with some trepidation I suggest to you that I might be being a little obtuse in this, but follow me with this and see why I am wrong. In section (5GC)(b) on page 19 of the bill, and in the amendment to (5GC)(b), it says:
The employer must give the employee 2 copies of the completed form no later than:
(b)	 14 July in the calendar year—
that is, 14 July 1999—
after the calendar year in which the employee ceased to be employed by the employer.
That is, after 1998. That means to me that you could lose your job on 2 January 1998 and only get your group certificate on 14 July 1999. All I want to see is your amendment say that, if you lost your job on 2 January, you would get your certificate by 14 July. If you lost your job on 1 July, you would get your certificate by the following 14 July. That is what I am trying to get you to give me back. I do not think the amendment says that, and the reassurance you gave me did not do that. I am not going to suggest to you how to phrase it, and I have no objection to you amending it on the run. But, frankly, the longest period under your suggestion that anybody would be without a group certificate should be no less than 364 days plus 14. So if you lost your job on 1 July 1998, you would get your certificate by 14 July 1999. If you lost your job on 1 January 1998, you would get your certificate by 14 July 1998.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech

If Senator Murray is obtuse and is headed for solitary confinement for two months, then I am equally obtuse and I guess I am headed there as well. I do not know if we are going to share the same cell, Senator Murray, but then it would not be 
 solitary confinement. We could probably rewrite the tax act while we were there.
Minister, you concluded your remarks in addressing the reasons why you supported the government's amendment by saying that it would be unreasonable to inconvenience employers to alter their systems within two days to be in a position to act as we suggested earlier they would be able to act if this amendment were not passed. That is what I understood you to say. Against that, you have to balance the fact that their systems are in place now for the law as it is now and that that does not, therefore, require them to do anything. Rather than inconvenience them, it seems to me that it conveniences them to defeat the government amendment.

In planning their preparation to conform with the law, they have planned in those terms.
I do not know when other members in this chamber first saw your amendment, but we saw it perhaps two days ago—very recently. No-one out there in the business world can even know that this amendment is there; if any do it would be very few of them. Surely it will not damage their preparation to con 
 form with this bill, should it become law, if this amendment is defeated. It seems axiomatic. Could you comment on that?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-03-29,"—Clearly there has been some warning on this. Equally, a lot of employers would be very anxious to see the bill through. That is always the dilemma with these things. It is hard to speak for all employers. Some would have been changing their computer systems to record the new fringe benefits amounts; perhaps others would have been waiting for the bill to go through. They have complained to the government about the short time that is available. This amendment will assist them with bringing in what is a major new system.
We have to recognise that we are talking about a fundamentally new system. As in all complex legislation, you have to achieve those required balances. Whereas you are saying that they would have known about this—perhaps there are some who even read the policies in the last election and who may have had a bit of a feeling this was coming—we have to recognise that this bill is just being debated at present. Equally, the government is aware of concerns among employers that there is too short a time period.

"Lightfoot, Sen Phillip",LP,1999-03-29,"—I appreciate the opportunity to speak tonight. I intend to devote the few minutes available to me to the coalition government's Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 . That bill introduces voluntary student unionism to the Australian universities, less those in Western Australia—the progressive state—which has had voluntary student unionism for about five years. The Western Australian legislation was passed during the time that I was still serving in the state Legislative Council. There are several major myths associated with the fear of 
 bringing in democratically proposed voluntary unionism. Part of those myths can be dispelled, if not all of them.
I am not in the habit of publicising the Australian Democrats, a political party for which I do not have much time at all, let alone agreeing with what they say. But when the Australian Democrats' higher education principles were released, I found there was some common ground that I had with them. I do not know whether that is an indictment of me or whether the Australian Democrats are becoming more democratic in their old age.
They have a pledge to decrease student fees and charges. They have a pledge to enhance access to higher education. They also have a belief that students must be able to control their own affairs. They support the incubus of compulsory student unionism, however, which is contradictory to those beliefs.
I can only come to the conclusion that they do not really mean it. If those three points were introduced, do they agree with some universities introducing and following through on the idea that degrees will not be granted unless student fees with respect to their guilds are paid? What VSU does is reduce barriers to higher education. It removes a compulsory up-front fee. It does not necessarily remove fees but it removes the compulsion to pay fees. It gives students freedom of choice to control their own affairs. That is not a bad start to democracy in tertiary education. And it puts power back into the hands of the students. It gives them the taste of power for their future lives. It recognises that students are sensible, intelligent and responsible enough to decide for themselves in a democratic process how their money is to be spent. What we don't say is that student unions, or any other union in Australia, should be outlawed. What we do say, however, is that if students want to join a union they can. We are not saying: do without unions. We don't say that in the work force. We don't say that either in the Western Australian legislation. But we do say that in this enlightened world students should have a choice as to whether they join a union or not.
I understand what the reason is behind compulsory unionism in tertiary institutions. It gives the socialists—that is, the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats—who want to inculcate a culture of compulsion in unions the start to put that in the minds of tertiary students. In some cases this carries on, of course, throughout their adult life. What that does is give the Bill Keltys, Bob Hawkes and Paul Keatings of this world a great advantage, and that is the culture of compulsory unionism—no ticket, no start. That is not what a modern world is about; that is not what Australia is about.
Let me draw a distinction between the legislation passed under the Victorian model, which used the term `voluntary student representation', or VSR, and the voluntary student unionism of Western Australia: a model which the coalition government's legislation superimposes from Western Australia, where it has been in now for five years. The Victorian model draws an artificial distinction between essential services and non-essential services. Under VSR, the Victorian model, a compulsory fee is still collected to fund those activities deemed non-political. We do not think that is good enough. Who is to decide what is political and what is non-political? We want students throughout Australia to decide for themselves whether or not they join a union with respect to their tertiary education.
Myth 2 is that, under the VSU, organisations and services will cease to exist. That is the big bogy. Of course, it does not happen. Let me have a look at some of the things at UWA. Voluntary unionism is five years old there. Cards are still available at Steve's Nedlands Park Hotel. You get a bar discount, you get a Steve's cafe discount and you get a bottle shop discount. The Grosvenor Hotel has discounts and the Metropolis Hotel has discounts. It goes on. There is a whole list of discounts that the student guild still runs. There are nightclub discounts. To change tack, the guild sells discounted clothing and merchandise. The guild runs a copy centre. The guild runs a second-hand bookshop. It sells cards, gifts and stationery. It runs a University of Western Australia tavern. It runs 
 a guild market. It provides Hostelling International membership. It runs dry-cleaning. It runs Talking Heads hair design. It runs a campus pharmacy and eye-care centres. It runs a travel agency. It even runs American Express at a discount. It runs boat trips to Rottnest Island at a discount. It has got live jazz in Cafe Acorn. It has got Winthrop Australia, which is a computer shop that the guild also runs. Don't tell me that services have dropped off.
Okay, you say, that is UWA, which is a fairly distinctive, perhaps top end of the street university and is one of the best universities in Australia. But look at the Student Guild at Curtin that everyone said would collapse. It has membership benefits. It has student assistance with respect to making life at university better. It offers campus services, clubs and activities, housing and the Guild Council. It connects with overseas student bodies. It has the Curtin Postgraduate Association. It runs a bookshop and it runs a paper—all funded by the voluntary contributions of students. It offers bookshop vouchers, discounted parking permits and accident insurance. It runs clubs and societies vouchers. It runs free entry to guild shows. It runs a copy centre, a sports store and a tavern. It runs all these things that people like those opposite, the socialists in this chamber, said would collapse. They did not collapse.
Some of the credit for the introduction to Western Australia of the VSU, which was ultimately copied by the federal government because they could not improve on it, must go to the present Minister for Tourism and Mines, the Hon. Norman Moore, in the Legislative Council of Western Australia. He was assisted by Mark Dale, who is currently president of the national body of the Young Liberal movement in Australia, the Young Conservative movement. They put it together in 1994, and it is that system that the coalition government in the Commonwealth has decided to use, because it works; we know it works.
I do believe that one of the things that we can do for youth today, in particular youth in tertiary education stepping out into life—a quantum leap from secondary education—is 
 show them that democracy means the freedom to choose. I think it is a great indictment of universities and of previous governments that they did not allow students to choose when it was a formative area of their lives. What the coalition government is doing is giving students choice to join or not to join.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Student Unionism</title>,Adjournment,22,1,speech
