Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (10:02):  This bill will reintroduce the seniors supplement budget measure, which was originally introduced, as senators will recall, in an earlier budget bill. As introduced, the measure would cease payment from 20 September 2014 of the seniors supplement for holders of the Commonwealth seniors' health card or the Veterans Affairs' gold card; however, other benefits will remain available to cardholders, such as discounts on medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In conjunction with this change to the seniors supplement, the bill will ensure that cardholders who formerly received the clean energy supplement in association with their card will now receive the renamed energy supplement maintained at current levels through the permanent removal of indexation.


Amendments will be moved to the bill to update the measure in light of delayed passage. This will remove schedule 1 and update with schedule 4 from the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Fair and Sustainable Pensions) Bill 2015 in its entirety. In particular, the implementation date will be moved to 20 June 2015, meaning the last quarterly payment of the seniors supplement will generally be one made on 20 June 2015. I am content to leave my remarks there.


Question agreed to.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2015-06-22,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (10:04):  At this stage it is important that I put on record that our position has changed on this bill. Those of you who can remember the passionate speeches made in this place last November will understand that after consideration of the range of issues before us in this area—there have been several changes as proposed legislation by the 2015 budget, which overtakes this process as it was part of the 2014 budget—and the fact that many, many more proposals are on the table, Labor's position has now changed. In view of Labor's need to focus on our support of people who are receiving pensions, our position on the removal of the pensioner supplement is that we are now supporting the government's position on this bill.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2015-06-22,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:05):  The Greens also spoke about this bill at the time and some concerns were expressed. We had a lot of concerns around this particular bill when we spoke about it in the chamber. People will also remember that when we put in our dissenting report to the committee inquiry into the 2014-15 budget measures, this was the measure that we thought, if you were considering it in the context of a retirement income review, would be one that would make the most sense of all of those terrible budget measures that the government sought to put through this place last year.


As the government noted last week, they have now committed to a review, through the tax white paper process, of looking at retirement income reviews and a more holistic approach. Although the government have not committed to some of the policy changes that we would like to see, at least we now have that retirement income review and people can participate in it. People can see the need for changes. As the Council on the Ageing said on Radio National before the budget:


… it's clear that there's a broad consensus out there in the sector that wasn't there five years ago as to how the basic architecture of the system ought to be restructured—


and we agree. We agree that the system does need a significant amount of change. The removal of this payment is in fact one of the first steps to what we believe would be a fairer system, a system where it makes sense to make sure that those who have the advantages that have allowed them to accumulate their wealth can, in fact, start using those assets that they have accumulated.


As we know, the senior supplement is a payment to older Australians who do not in fact qualify for the age pension. They do not qualify at all for the pension because their personal wealth and accumulated savings are very significant. In fact, in order to qualify for this supplement you have to have a significant amount of savings and assets. In the context of the changes that have occurred through this budget measure and the fact that we now have a commitment to a retirement income review, we have re-looked at this bill and we now think that this is an appropriate measure.


We also need to bear in mind the ACOSS report that has just come out today, which talks about inequality and points out that wealth and income inequality in this country is a huge issue. Although the report says that Australia's is above average for the OECD, in fact inequality is still, fortunately, below that in the US and that in the UK and a few other countries—but it is above average in the OECD. We need to address the issue around wealth and income inequality now or it is only going to get worse. The top 20 per cent hold 70 times the wealth of the rest of Australia. That is a significant issue that needs to be addressed.


We know that income inequality has a devastating impact on a society. It lowers health outcomes and it means that there are fewer opportunities for people to gain access to education to get better jobs. It can increase intergenerational inequality. These are all things that we believe need to be addressed. I think the ACOSS report is a very timely report that highlights this fact, and we are bearing that issue in mind whenever we look at these measures. We believe that a system of addressing income inequality and retirement income has only just started being addressed in this country. There is broad agreement among stakeholders that the system is not working—that it is skewed and needs to be re-addressed. We are starting to take those first steps now. We are looking at the long-term aim of having a fairer system for all people on income support, particularly those who have to rely on the pension.

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Human Services) (15:01):  I would like to add further information to an answer I gave to Senator Whish-Wilson on 18 June and provide further information to the questions taken on notice on that day—and I have given Senator Whish-Wilson notice of this. The government advise that we do not accept the premise of Senator Whish-Wilson's question. There is no evidence that 'thousands of manufacturing workers' will lose their jobs as a result of the continuation of Australia's decades-long bipartisan commitment to freer trade. In fact, independent modelling commissioned by the government forecasts that jobs will be created as increased exports and cheaper imports allow Australian businesses to hire more workers. The annual net jobs increase is forecast to be almost 8,000 in 2016, peaking at almost 15,000 in 2020.


Regarding industry policy specifically, there is no change to the government's existing arrangements to support growth and innovation in Australian industry. The government supports growth, jobs and competitiveness of Australian industries through the Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda. This includes a range of initiatives and programs, including the Industry Growth Centres Initiative, the Cooperative Research Centres program, the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program, the R&D tax incentive and the Manufacturing Transition Program.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-06-22,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Attorney General (Senator Brandis) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ketter today relating to the economy.


The groundbreaking work that has been released today by accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers shows very clearly that one in every five dollars of national income is produced by just 10 locations in the country out of some 2,214 nationally. Despite that, and despite Senator Ketter asking very clearly for Senator Brandis to respond to the fact that this demonstrates a definite inequality in our country and has led to a slowdown in economic growth in our country, Senator Brandis, as with many of the answers he gives in this place, instead tried to put his head in the sand and pretend everything is rosy. Everything is all right, despite all of the findings that have come out in this PricewaterhouseCoopers report.


Not only has PricewaterhouseCoopers identified that economic growth is coming from less than 0.5 per cent of our nation's landmass; on top of that, we have had the report of the Australian Council of Social Service today, which clearly shows that inequality in this country is higher than the OECD average, and particularly that it is higher in many of the regions. We know from this report that there are certain parts of this country where one-third of Australians are in recession.


Despite Senator Ketter asking Senator Brandis to address the very specific question which comes out of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, what we got from Senator Brandis was some diatribe about building approvals being higher and that we have the fastest economic growth rate. We know very clearly that our economic growth has slowed. Senator Brandis knows our economic growth has slowed. The annual growth rate in this country has in fact declined from some three per cent in the year to March last year to only 2.3 per cent now. We also know that Australian incomes are down—including, of course, the incomes of cleaners in this place. This government is cutting the wages of cleaners who clean our Parliament House offices. We know that business confidence is down, that consumer confidence is down and that wages growth has slumped, while unemployment is up.


Despite all of that and despite the findings of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, Senator Brandis very clearly chose to put his head in the sand and pluck out a few positive stats that he found in his notes as a means of trying somehow to discredit the findings of this very important, groundbreaking report. Two important reports have been released, by PricewaterhouseCoopers and ACOSS, and both of them point to the same outcome, and that is a growing inequality in this country—a growing inequality that this government does not seem to want to do anything about.


Unlike the government, Labor have a plan to address growing inequality, because we believe in lifting people out of poverty and ensuring that we live in a society that is based on the principle of equality. That is why our leader, Bill Shorten, in his budget reply speech, promised to invest in nation-building infrastructure. We know if we invest in nation-building infrastructure, especially in our regions, in our cities, in those areas of disadvantage, those issues of economic decline can be addressed, those issues that the PricewaterhouseCoopers report and the ACOSS report specifically refer to. They are areas that are the biggest losers, such as Nanango in Queensland and the La Trobe Valley in Victoria, which ranked very badly in their report. We can help in their transition to a clean-energy future. 


These are the kinds of forward-thinking ideas that a government should be looking at. It is these kinds of reports—the PricewaterhouseCoopers and ACOSS reports—that the government should be scrutinising, looking at in detail, and making policy recommendations to its cabinet to ensure it addresses it—that is if it believes in a country where everyone gets to share in the wealth and profits of it not just those few at the top who are identified in these reports. That is shameful of this government. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-06-22,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:08):  I would suggest to Senator Singh that she have a look at that report and have a look at the graph in that report showing the proportion of GDP concentrated in just 10 locations. You will see, if you look at that report and the graph, that most of the 'badness' in the report occurred in the years of the Labor government. Even the dysfunction shown in recent times is the rollover, the follow-up, from the Labor Party. So before the Labor Party misread—perhaps deliberately—these reports, they should understand that it was their party that caused this problem.


Why did the progress, the economic growth, in rural and regional Australia fall during the time of the Labor government? The first thing I can point to is the ban on live cattle exports, the most disastrous, stupid, uninformed and ill-researched decision that any government has made for as long as I have been here and I suspect even longer. That one decision—made overnight, by the Gillard government and Senator Ludwig when he was the minister for agriculture—decimated rural and regional Australia, particularly in the north of Australia, where beef cattle and live exports were so important. The industry was not doing too badly, and then—overnight—by a decision of the Labor government the income to that very significant industry in the north was stopped. As a result of that—in addition to suicides—the economic growth of those parts of rural and regional Australia has plummeted. You can thank the Labor Party and the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments for that. 


So before you get up and look at these reports, Senator Singh, I suggest you study them and understand that most of the things you complain about occurred during the time of the Labor government. If you have a look at the graph—and I invite you to do that—you will see that during the latter Howard years the increase in rural economies was much better. It is only in the Labor years that rural economies have gone backwards.




Senator Singh:
  It's not true! It's actually 2014.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Have a look at the thing. Your government was there from 2007 to 2013—economies do not change overnight. That is the rollover from the Labor government. As Senator Brandis quite rightly said, in recent times the Australian economy has been growing faster than any other economy in the Western world. Things are starting to come right. But it was during the Labor years that this problem came about.


I thought the Labor Party might have taken note, today, of the schools-funding issue. They have an MPI about it, later today. I do not know what anyone is going to talk about at the MPI because, as Senator Brandis and Senator Birmingham quite clearly said, there will be no such funding cuts, and funding of state schools is a matter for state governments. Even Mr Weatherill, the Labor Premier of South Australia, understands that.


Senator Wright asked during her question whether we had an emotional attachment to state schools. I always, in this chamber, very proudly say—unlike, I suspect, most of the Greens political party—I did all of my schooling in a state school and finished my high school in a state school. In fact, as my wife often reminds me, I liked my state school so much that we bought a house just opposite it—and we continue to live there. So we do have an emotional attachment to state schools, Senator Wright. I suspect most of the senators in the Greens political party went to private schools and would not understand state schools at all.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2015-06-22,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (15:13):  I also rise to speak in relation to responses given by Senator Brandis to questions that I asked. I asked a question about whether PricewaterhouseCoopers was correct when it said that more than one-third of Australia is in recession. Senator Brandis, in his response, chose to discuss what he considered to be the real facts, which I considered to be quite a selective representation of some of the economic indicators. 


He did take time to make reference to the NAB monthly business survey and he talked about that being up on the 12-month figures. He was highly selective in quoting those figures. In the time the current government has been in office that particular index has been down by 75 per cent and we have seen wages growth slumping to the lowest level in two decades, at 2.3 per cent, to March 2015.


The questions I asked of Senator Brandis went to income inequality and concentration within the economy. I was very disappointed to hear the answers from Senator Brandis because, as Senator Singh has indicated, he has his head in the sand when it comes to these particular issues. When I asked about the concentration of the national income in just 10 of 2,214 locations in Australia, he advised rather glibly that, when one looks at the PwC report, the concentration is found to be in CBDs. He said, 'That is what we would expect to see.'


However, when you look at the commentary from the researcher, Mr Tyson, he identifies that, from a social and equity point of view, there are challenges and potential conflicts that arise from this concentration of the economy in particular areas. He talks about the consequence being that governments should increasingly focus on, for example, public transport to link some of the CBDs with suburbs where there are powerhouse locations of innovation—for instance, the greater Sydney area.


But this is an area where this government have been found wanting again, because they abolished the Major Cities Unit in 2013 and they are slashing infrastructure spending across the country by 11.2 per cent over the next four years. When it comes to looking at the issue of inequality in the economy, this is a government which are absolutely disinterested.


We should be interested in this particular issue because there have been studies that show that rising inequality has an impact on growth. There is IMF research to the effect that there are economic downsides to inequality. Raising the income share of the poorest 20 per cent of the population increases growth by as much as 0.38 percentage points over five years. By contrast, increasing the income share of the richest 20 per cent by one per cent decreases growth by 0.08 percentage points. When we see the response from this government one could almost assume that they are continuing to apply the trickle-down economic model. We can see that this particular approach has failed the people of Australia.


Senator Singh made reference to the report from ACOSS which was released today. One of the concerns that I have in looking at that report is that ACOSS has identified a number of the structures we have had in Australia which have been a retardant to inequality over a period of time. When one looks at those—the taxation system, the system of minimum wages that we have in Australia and our income support systems—one can see that these are all things which have been inhibitors of inequality. These are all of the things that this government is seeking to attack. Time does not allow me to talk about that, but this government is looking at higher inequality, and Labor will always be the party that stands— (Time expired)

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-06-22,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (15:18):  This is all a bit embarrassing for the Labor Party today. We have a shadow Treasurer who does not understand or does not know what the tax-free threshold is. We have a former Treasurer who is still in the parliament who was responsible for racking up $240 billion in debt in six years when we did not have a recession. Now we are left with the legacy of that. But now it is starting to make sense because the Labor Party could not read a simple chart that was included in today's major business newspaper along with the report that they are trumpeting here as some kind of scandal.


Both Senator Ketter and Senator Singh have said it is a shock-horror scandal that 30 per cent of locations—actually 'ABS statistical area 2' is the designation they have used in this report—are in recession at the moment. You would think when you heard a stat like that—it is a pretty unusual stat; it is not something commonly referred to—you might think, 'Is that high or low relative to normal times?' There is actually, helpfully, a chart which answers that for them in The Financial Review. They do not have to read the report; it is there in the Financial Review article online. It is right there. The data very helpfully goes back to financial year 2002. It shows that the peak of areas in recession was under the Labor government. It was just slightly higher. Under the Labor government in the financial year 2011, there were more locations in recession than there are today. It also shows, going back over that 12-year period, usually something more than one-fifth of locations are in recession at any one time. That is what you would expect in a dynamic economy. Things change, markets change, prices change, and some areas do it tougher than others. Our job is to have a proper, seamless and flexible economy and policies in place to help those adjustments occur. That is always the case.


It was actually much, much lower under the Howard government. The Howard government had between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of areas in recession. It increased after the global financial crisis. Under the Labor government, it increased to over 30 per cent. I am not necessarily trying to blame the Labor Party for that like these guys are stupidly doing to us. I am not saying it is all their fault, because obviously there were other things that impacted on our economy at those times. Clearly, since those times, we have not been able to grow as strong an economy as we would like. We have moderate growth and an increasing amount of growth, but we still have more work to do.


The other really embarrassing thing is that those opposite have tried to hang so much off this graph. As you would expect, because we have not finished financial year 2015, the data in this report finishes in the last financial year. It has data only up to the last financial year. That means that those opposite are trying to pass judgement on nine months of the Abbott-Truss newly elected coalition government from September 2013 through to mid-2014. That is the only period in that time when the Abbott government was in power. There was no budget delivered by this government in that time; the then budget was the former government's budget. Their whole argument today hangs off nine months of the Abbott-Truss government, based on a comparative chart which shows that things were better under the last coalition government than when Labor were last in government. Now they are trying to say 'shock, horror, scandal' to the entire country. 


It just shows that these guys are running out of ideas. They are running out of ideas. They are running out of arguments. They do not quite know what to do since the budget came down. They were scatter brained, all over the place, today in question time, with different questions on different topics, and they chose this topic because it was the only one in the newspaper that they thought they could give a run. It is embarrassing for them.


The notion that somehow one in five dollars comes from 10 locations is, again, apparently 'shock, horror'. That has increased over the last 12 years. Sometimes I do not think the Labor Party can read y axes, because it is not zero in this chart; it has increased from 16.5 to 17.9 over the last 12 years—a massive, massive change. 


The other thing to take away from that is that of course it is concentrated, because the population in Australia is concentrated. Two-thirds of Australians live in capital cities, but only around a fifth of them—at least, in those 10 locations—are producing the wealth. So, they are actually underperforming. Our capital cities are not punching above their weight, because we all know that most of our export dollars and most of the wealth in this country is generated in regional areas, where only one-third of the Australian population lives. All our iron exports, all our coal, all our agricultural products and most of our tourism assets are actually in regional areas, and they are what produce the wealth for this country.

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2015-06-22,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:23):  I also rise to take note of Senator Brandis's answers to questions asked by Senator Ketter in question time today on the important subject of the rising inequality we are seeing across the country, as outlined in reports by both PwC and ACOSS. I will just pick up on a couple of things that Senator Canavan said. He said that the questions from Labor senators this afternoon were embarrassing for the Labor Party. The Labor Party will always fight inequality when we see it, and the report released today shows that there is rising inequality across the country—and it is not just in the PwC report; it is also in the ACOSS report which was released this morning. 


Rather than sheeting home the blame, which is what Senator Canavan just accused Senator Ketter of, Senator Ketter asked two very factual questions of Senator Brandis this afternoon. They were (1) whether the claim that more than one-third of Australia is in recession was correct, which I do not think was answered by Senator Brandis; and (2) whether it is true that every one in five dollars of national income is produced in just 10 of 214 locations in Australia. Again, I do not think that question was answered by Senator Brandis either. In terms of the answer that was provided, there were some areas with which I agreed—the fact that it is good that we are seeing economic growth across the country. Even if that growth is slow, it is a positive. 


But I think any responsible government opening the paper today and seeing the news story about the PwC report, which as I understand it is going to be released tomorrow, would look at this very closely and as a government say, 'Okay, what do we need to do about this? If some parts of the country are doing well but others are clearly not doing well—indeed, a third of the country, in PwC's terms, is experiencing recession—as the government of Australia what we do about this?' 


That is the point made by the ACOSS report, which claims that some elements of the social compact—that is, policies around full employment, universal access to public education, wage regulation, progressive income taxes and a well-targeted social security safety net—are key areas which address inequality in a country. It is these areas which seem to be 'unravelling', to quote the ACOSS report. It is also these areas which are under attack from this government, which does not lead us on this side of the chamber to believe that there is a serious plan to address the rising inequality in the country. As my colleague Andrew Leigh often says, central to tackling inequality is maintaining a sense of pride in our egalitarian ethos—that is, that we all work together to ensure that all citizens of Australia are treated equally. 


In his answer, Senator Brandis said it is the policies of this government that will address these issues. But, when we look at the policies of this government, we see the cuts to schools and health funding, the attacks on pensioners—pitting pensioners against pensioners; that is what is contained in this budget, where we have pensioners having to justify their pension against other those of other pensioners—and cuts to services like homelessness services and community legal services. These are all services that ensure that we do have that egalitarian ethos, that we have fair wages for work performed. These are all central to the social compact that is being consistently undermined by this government.


Senator Brandis can pretend this is not his problem. Senator Canavan can say that it is everyone else's problem, 'It's the previous government's problem.' But the reality is that we are seeing rising inequality in this country, and it is not clear that there is a plan from the government to address it. Those on this side of the chamber will always stand up and draw matters like this to the attention of the chamber when they occur.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2015-06-22,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:47):  I rise today to speak about the Abbott government's plan to abolish universal access to free public education. Specifically, a leaked copy of the federation green paper shows the Abbott government's plan to cut all Commonwealth funding to schools, means-test public education and force the re-introduction of fees for public school students. This is a government which is arrogantly out of touch. This is a government which is failing the Australian people at a time when we should be investing more money in education, but what do we see from this government? It wants to deregulate the universities; it wants to stop anyone who does not have a large credit card from going to university; and now it wants to stop free education in this country. It is absolutely outrageous.


The government is also considering incomprehensible damage to Australia's education system. We all know, as do the Australian people, that before the election there were a number of commitments and promises made by this  government, and one of those notably was that there would be no cuts to education. Another promise was a unity ticket on schools—a unity ticket on the Gonski reforms. But what have we seen? We have seen the exact opposite from those in government. There will be a massive increase in fees for children going into the public education system and there will be changes to non-government schools' funding as well. Alongside these disappointing and highly disturbing revelations today, we have seen $30 billion cut from our classrooms over the next decade—which is the biggest cut ever made to education in this country—and that, Senators, is nothing to be proud of. We have also seen the failure to deliver the Gonski agreements, which directly hit students that need the most support in our schools. Obviously not satisfied with abandoning Gonski and cutting $30 billion from education last year, Mr Abbott and his team are setting a new target, which is to attack and cut funding to public schools and to end the provision of free schooling altogether.


This is a disappointing and disturbing revelation, and it shows that the $30 billion cut in last year's budget was just the beginning. Even more disturbing is that we will lose the ability to meet the economic challenges this country faces. As I have said, this is a time when we should be putting more money into education and we should be ensuring that we have better trained teachers and that all parents in this country have the ability to send their children to the world's best schools. It is very clear that the Abbott government does not value public education. We on this side have always known that, and the Australian people have known that, but they were misguided and lied to by those opposite at the last election when they were told there would be no cuts to education—just as they were told there would be no changes to the pension. What have we seen? Nothing but borne-out lies from those opposite. Every Australian child has a fundamental right to expect to have access to the world's best education system. We are a rich country; we can afford to put more money into education. The Australian people are paying the price of the betrayal of Mr Abbott and his government. Mr Abbott cannot be allowed to get away with abandoning this funding for public education. He intends to charge hundreds of dollars to thousands of parents to send their children to the public schools in this country.


This government claims they have had a proper discussion with the states. But this has nothing to do with improving education outcomes for children and everything to do with cost-shifting and privatisation. We know the more pressure this government can put onto states by cutting education and cutting health the more it will force them to have to look at the GST and increasing that. We know that what this government cannot do through the front door they will do, by whatever means they can, through the back door.


To have a world-class education system in this country, we needed this incoming government to live up to the commitment that they gave by fully rolling out the Gonski initiatives. That was the only way we were going to have the best outcomes for every Australian child. Every child, no matter what their education ability, needs to be able to reach their highest academic achievement. But they also need to have access to drama, to sport, to music, to have those extra teachers in the classrooms, to have smaller classrooms. I really do not think that that is too much to ask from this government. But, as we have seen in so many other policy areas, we know that Mr Abbott still resides in the 1960s—and that is where he is taking education in this country.


We have fought Mr Abbott and his government on a whole range of things since we have been in opposition. We did it when he wanted to cut the pension, which would have cost Australian pensioners $80 a week. We stood up with the Australian people—and we can do the same here and now. I know that Labor will always stand up for public education. We will always stand up to ensure every Australian child has the world's best education system in this country. I also believe that the Australian community will send a very strong message to this government that they will not stand by and see this government attack public education in this country.


We know that there are some students who struggle to meet their academic achievements. What they need is more help and assistance. They need more highly skilled teachers. They need to have teachers' aides. They need more money put into education so that they can reach their personal achievements and their personal ambitions of having the best education they can. We know that there still needs to be more money put into numeracy and literacy in this country. We also know the benefits that come from participating in sport and having access to music in our education system. We always know that students do much better with smaller class sizes.


I, for one, and those of us in opposition will never trust Mr Abbott and Mr Pyne to deliver a good education system in this country. It does not matter whether you are talking about education and cutting funds to the states, or whether you are talking about deregulating the universities. We know those opposite have always believed—it is in their DNA—that you should not be able to go on to university if you cannot afford to pay your way. They want to see us go down the path of the American system.


In my home state of Tasmania, where we have a very low retention rate when it comes to tertiary education, we should be doing more. Having met with the vice-chancellor of the University of Tasmania very recently, it was reaffirmed to me—and it is something even I know—that instilling the value of education and ensuring that you have as many students as possible going on to tertiary education starts in primary school and is then continued on in the high school years. That is the way that we are going to get more Tasmanians going on to tertiary education.


This quite clearly is another election promise that has been broken. This is an election promise that has been broken just as the one was with the attack on pensions in this country. It is fundamentally every Australian's right to have the best education possible.



Senator Bushby interjecting—




Senator POLLEY:
  We also know—and we have the interjections from the other side—that you cannot trust anything they say. Even Mr Abbott said himself: if it is written down, then you can believe it. We know that you cannot believe anything this government says about the election commitments that they gave on the eve of the election—that there would be no change and no cut to education and no change to pensions. They have done exactly the opposite to that.


I, along with my colleagues, will fight this every step of the way to the next election. The Australian people know, because they know our reputation on this. They know those in political parties like the Australian Labor Party will always put education first. They will always put their money on a Labor government delivering better outcomes in education.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-06-22,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (15:58):  The old saying goes: lies, damned lies and statistics. But, perhaps, the saying should be updated to: lies, dammed lies and speeches from Australian Labor Party senators. What we have just heard, and it has continued throughout the day, is a hysterical reaction from the Labor Party—a reaction that is completely based on mistruth.


I think it is important, in relation to this topic, that we do try to have a sensible discussion. Certainly the government is trying to have a sensible discussion with the Australian states and territories about how the federation operates, about what our responsibilities are as a Commonwealth and what the responsibilities of the states and territories are, and how we make sure that we eliminate waste and duplication and get the best possible results in terms of the delivery of services right across all of the areas of government responsibility, including, and especially, good educational outcomes for students, and school students in particular.


Let us have a look at the discussion paper that has triggered this wave of outrage from those opposite. I will give you a few quotes from it. Firstly it says: 'The Constitution by virtue of section 51(xxiiiA) and section 96 has allowed the Commonwealth to increase markedly its involvement in education which is generally regarded as a state and territory responsibility.' It goes on to say:


… the current arrangements have … undoubtedly blurred the lines of accountability to the general public …


As result it is not always clear who ultimately is responsible for the delivery of high-quality services. This shared space on policy and funding has also led to duplication, waste and poor targeting of investment and effort. I would hope that those opposite, that anybody who cares about the future education of our schoolchildren and the management of our school and educational system, would want to eliminate duplication and waste and would want to make sure that investment and effort was well targeted to get the best possible outcome for students. This of course is framed as part of a broader discussion, though. This is not just a review in school funding; this is a review of the entire federation and how it operates. It is having a look at the health sector, it is having a look at the education sector, it is having a look at revenue—how governments have the revenue to access funding for the future.


Through all of that, it is trying to find a way to ensure services are delivered in the most efficient and effective manner possible without having that waste and duplication that we have seen. The problem with this level of waste and duplication and this lack of clear accountability for who is responsible—because currently you have every level of government tipping funding in different and disparate ways to every different level of education—is that nobody ends up being held effectively to account for outcomes. What we have seen, as this discussion paper goes on to say, is:


Spending by all Australian governments grew by 37 per cent, in real terms, in the ten years between 2002-03 and 2012-13.


But we now have fewer higher achievers and more low performers than a decade ago and average scores have declined. We are now equal 17th in mathematics; we were equal second. We are equal eighth science; we were equal third. And we are equal 10th in reading; we were equal second. So, while how much funding schools get is important, it is not the silver bullet to achieve better results. How it is spent matters more.



Senator Wright interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I will happily take that interjection, Senator Wright—and where it is spent, indeed. So, as a federal government, we have tried to make sure that a lot of our education reforms are focused on the 'how it is spent' question—how it is spent to make sure that we do deliver the appropriate policies that increase school autonomy, ensure that our curriculum is robust and relevant, promote parental engagement in children's learning and improve the quality of teaching; things the Commonwealth can clearly do. We are providing record funding—$69.5 billion to schools over the next four years. So the funding is there in record levels, but we are trying to tackle the policy measures that can help to ensure it is spent in ways that get better outcomes and redress the decline in our performance over the last decade.


We also want to make sure that the funding is used as wisely, effectively and efficiently as possible. That is why we have in this discussion paper, as it is across all elements of the Federation, canvassed the whole range of options that are available. Option 1 that is canvassed here is that states and territories become fully responsible for all schools. Of course, if that were to happen—I hear the hysterical reaction already—you would need to make sure that states and territories had the funding streams to be able to fund all schools, that they actually had the revenue to make up for where the Commonwealth was stepping back, and that of course would be part of any structured arrangement around Federation reform. Option 2 is that states and territories are responsible for funding government schools and the Commonwealth is responsible for funding non-government schools. That is essentially a finessing of current arrangements where the states and territories take the bulk of responsibility for funding the government school sector and the Commonwealth, as it has for decades, takes the bulk of responsibility for funding non-government schools. Option 3 is that there is reduced Commonwealth involvement in school programs—essentially, a level of maintaining the status quo in terms of some of the funding but with less Commonwealth interference in how schools are operated. Option 4 is that the Commonwealth is the dominant public funder of all schools on an equal and consistent basis. Option 4 would be saying that the Commonwealth would take a much greater role in terms of the amount of funding it would provide to education. Of course, the Commonwealth would need to consider how and where it got that revenue from and how it delivered this. But you can see from those four options that the whole spectrum of scenarios is there under consideration, yet we have an opposition—and, frankly, it includes the Greens and the unions on this topic—that is hell-bent on a misleading campaign suggesting that this is part of some strategy for the government to cut school spending.




Senator Wright:
  Absolutely.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Senator Wright says, 'Absolutely. There we go. Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, through you: Senator Wright, we will only achieve any reform of the Federation if the states and territories agree. That is why they have been involved in the development of this discussion paper, that is why the Prime Minister is sitting down with state and territory leaders in July, and of course that is why I am pleased to say that the states and territories are being far more sensible about this than any of those opposite, because they know that it makes sense to try to get clearer lines of accountability if it is possible. The South Australian Labor Premier has not endorsed Senator Polley's hysteria, nor Senator Wright's hysteria, nor the hysteria of many others in this space. South Australian Labor Premier, Jay Weatherill, has rightly said:


… it's only a discussion paper.


We've been asking them—


'them' being the Commonwealth—


to canvas the broader range of options …


So we have canvassed the broadest possible range of options. Premier Weatherill went on to say:


There's a broad debate going on about Commonwealth/state relations, which is a good thing.


And it is a good thing to have this debate and it is to the shame of all of those opposite that they do not want to have a sensible debate about this, that they want to turn it into a scare campaign and that they do not seem to care about whether or not funding going to the school system is wasted. They would rather run a scare campaign. They do not care about the fact that our educational standards are slipping because of this wastage, because of these inefficiencies. They want to run a scare campaign. We will not accept a scare campaign. We have been crystal clear today to make sure that everybody understands that there are no plans from this government to reduce support to schools. That is why we are providing record funding. We have no intention of charging people to attend and access free public education. But we do intend to have a proper discussion with the states and territories to see whether the Commonwealth can actually manage to operate and run the education system, and the schooling system, and the funding thereof, more efficiently—in partnership with the states and territories. That is what this is about—trying to get better outcomes for Australian taxpayers and for state taxpayers—



Senator Wright interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  but more importantly, Senator Wright, for students and parents, and to make sure that they are getting the best possible resources. It is to the shame of all those opposite that all they are interested in is a scare campaign on this—rather than achieving the best possible outcomes for Australian students, which is what this government wants to deliver.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (16:08):  I rise to speak on the Abbott government's plans to abolish universal access to free public education, as revealed in the leaked chapter of the Reform of Federation green paper today, but first—




Senator Birmingham:
  Complete bullshit! What rubbish! Could you just not start with an outright lie?




Senator WRIGHT:
  First, let me go to Senator Birmingham's discussion and contribution, because 'lies, damned lies, and statistics' is what it is all about today. We had Senator Birmingham in question time again repeating Minister Pyne's oft-repeated claim that school funding has increased by 40 per cent in the last 10 years. I interrogated this claim in Senate estimates recently, and the Associate Secretary of the Department of Education and Training, Tony Cook, said that the source of that claim was table 4A.7 in the Report on government services 2015 published by the Productivity Commission. Don't leave, Senator Birmingham. You might want to correct what you say publicly after you hear this. That table shows an increase of real funding—that is, adjusted for inflation—of 21.7 per cent—about half of that particular claim—between 2003 and 2012. That is half the figure claimed by Pyne. But let us unpack that a little bit more. That figure of 21.7 per cent was for aggregate funding for all schools—public and private—and made no allowance for increasing student enrolments. Surprise, surprise—with more students you have to spend more. And in fact, a later table in that report—table 4A.17—shows that the figure for real funding per student, adjusted for inflation, was only 12.7 per cent—about a third of the figure that Minister Pyne and Senator Birmingham keep claiming.


Let me come back to the debate. Sometimes in debates like this it is hard to find the right words to say, because it is hard to find another way to communicate how awful and how brutally cruel this government is, and how low it is willing to go. As one of my colleagues said to me this morning, after we had all woken up to hear that the government was floating a proposal from the so-called Centre for Independent Studies—a right-wing think tank—that would means-test wealthier parents if they wanted to support the public education system: 'just when you think this government can't get any worse, they do.' It can be hard to find words to defend what should be, in Australia, an inviolable right. It is hard to believe that any government would canvass, even for a second, such a radical proposal—to end Australia's proud history of universal access to free public education. Australia has been built on free, compulsory and secular public education. It is the foundation of our country and has been the envy of other nations for decades. This should not and must not be eroded.


Minister Pyne has now tweeted his opposition to means-testing this morning—after having floated it. This is the same man, mind you, who looked us in the eye and promised us a unity ticket on Gonski. Why would we trust him on anything? We have had the Prime Minister out there too, keeping this idea ticking along, and backbenchers, like Andrew Laming, tweeting support for a price signal on education—a signal to send wealthier parents away from the public education system into private education, perhaps. Simply and sadly, we cannot trust this government. And it is clear why: it is not just about flagrantly broken promises; it is about ideology. We have Minister Pyne very clearly on the record saying that this government has an emotional commitment to private schools. We have the Prime Minister saying: 'We have a particular responsibility for non-government schooling that we don't have for government schooling.' This government seems to have forgotten the most central platform for its existence, and it will do so at its own peril. It is here to govern for all Australians—not just those who are more wealthy, not just those who are more privileged, but all Australians. The government must not abandon the two million students who attend public school.


Public education is a right. Private schooling is a choice. Yet at every turn, as with every policy issue that arises, this government has shown they are more interested in defending the interests of the wealthy and the privileged. Their failure to implement a true needs-based and sector-blind funding system, despite their promises to do so, will further entrench privilege and entrench advantage in our schools. Why is this government afraid of real merit—real equality? What do they have to fear from universal, quality public education? The federation paper actually asks all the wrong questions. No wonder it is coming up with the wrong answers! The Abbott government are actually looking for a way out of being blamed for declining education standards, rather than looking at what they can do to make sure every Australian school is a great school. It is a fundamental right of every Australian to be educated in public schools free of charge. (Time expired)

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2015-06-22,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (16:13):  I rise to speak on the MPI this afternoon around the plans that we have seen outlined in papers today to abolish universal access to free public education. I think we all got a shock last night—those of us who were catching up on the news—to see the stories come in around the leaked document—the green paper for the reform of federation—which outlined some pretty outrageous options for the future of education in this country. Those options included: giving states and territories full responsibility for all schools; making states and territories fully responsible for funding public schools, while the federal government funds non-government schools; reducing the Commonwealth involvement in schools; making the federal government the dominant funder of all schools; or withdrawing the federal government entirely from the funding of public education. Anyone who has watched the education funding debate since education funding actually started being a negotiation between the states, territories and the Commonwealth back in the 1960s, would have seen how fraught the area of education funding is, and how difficult it is to resolve issues of who funds what and how much to fund it. But I think the one thing that most Australians agree on is that there is a role for the national government to be involved in the funding of all schools for every child in Australia. 


The option that was outlined as one of the ideas in this green paper was that means testing be introduced. I see that in question time today the Prime Minister came out and said that he does not support that, after being a little evasive on the subject this morning. The education minister, Christopher Pyne, came and said that he did not support it, and I note that the Prime Minister has now backed him. I think everyone in this chamber would support the clarification that has been provided today, but, that one issue aside, it would seem at the moment that one of the underlying themes of the Federation reform process is that the Commonwealth removes itself—whether in a funding role or in any kind of responsible role—from the areas of education and health. Indeed, I touched on this in my first speech, which I made last week, when I said that Federation reform should not be used as a way of prosecuting one government's political agenda over others and forcing unreasonable expectations or responsibilities on the states and territories and the smaller governments, which do not have the revenue-raising capacity that the national government does. 


Indeed, having been involved in some of the early discussions around Federation reform, I fear that that is exactly what we are seeing happen now. We are seeing a Prime Minister who has a fixed view, and his view is that the Commonwealth should, to use his words, 'get out of education and get out of health,' and leave it to the states and territories. For one, I think that if you ask the average person in the street, they would believe that there is a role for the national government in the areas of health and education, they would expect the national government to be there, and they would expect that the Commonwealth cannot, in a sense, abrogate its responsibility to the citizenry of this country by removing itself from two of the most important areas that any government is involved in. 


I do note that the green papers on education, health and tax reform will be released in due time. I am not saying there is no opportunity for Federation reform—I think that there is. But I do not think that it is a reform that is going to be progressed with leaks to the paper and federal ministers ruling the most outrageous initiatives out, but leaving some of the still very significant changes on the table to be agitated over prior to anybody getting the details. 


The first budget of this government, the 2014-15 budget, was delivered when I was still Chief Minister of the ACT. I am a previous education minister as well, so I do have a level of detailed knowledge about the funding of the education system and responsibilities between states, territories and the Commonwealth. What we saw in that 2014-15 budget, after being promised no cuts to education in the 2013 campaign, was the removal of $80 billion out of agreements that had been signed in good faith by governments. I signed the paperwork. I believed that that drew the Commonwealth to the table to provide a funding commitment to schools in the ACT for a six-year period. One of the first financial decisions taken by this government was to remove it—$50 billion in health and $30 billion in education. 


I attended—I think a week or so after that budget came down—a meeting of all of the first ministers in Australia, bar WA. It did unite across party divides, as all first ministers—apart from Premier Barnett—came together to try to understand what had just happened to the agreements, which we had also provided money for, in my previous role, to bring to the table; to try to understand what was going to happen into those out years; and to make a commitment that we would not let those cuts stand. However, the 2015-16 budget has been handed down and we see that, as those years come into the budget estimates, those cuts remain. 


One of the most important things around the agreements reached between state and territory governments and the Commonwealth government—the truly revolutionary aspect of what Prime Minister Gillard actually delivered through those agreements—was the uniting of the education sector on the best way to fund the system, regardless of what system or jurisdiction a child was in, in terms of school make-up—private, independent, Catholic systemic, Catholic congregational or public schools. We were able, through that negotiation process, to unite the sector in what has been, in my experience, a very difficult area to reach agreement on. 


We had the advocacy bodies for independent schools, for the Catholic schools, the Australian Education Union and the stakeholders for public schools all coming together. It was not only about funding—and this is something that is always forgotten. It was also around quality teaching, and it was going to the issues that Senator Birmingham outlined around value for the extra money put in; this was recognised in those agreements. It was also about delivering better student outcomes, giving flexibility for principals to make decisions in their schools, and transparency and accountability about where that money goes and what it is being used for. Most of all, it was about a needs based funding system for children so that—regardless of what school your child attends and wherever they attend in Australia—your child gets the level of resourcing that they need to get a great education. That was the true success of that agreement. That is what the state and territory first ministers signed up to, and that is what the Commonwealth said that they would deliver upon. That was removed unilaterally. In fact, we had a COAG meeting a week or two before the 2014-15 budget was handed down, and not one word was said about this massive change to agreements that had just taken two years to negotiate. That is the form. That is where we start. And now, not only do we not have Gonski or the National Education Reform Agreements, which provided a level of funding and some changes across the system that, at that time, we were all committed to implementing, but when we see the green paper it is supposedly going to come out and say, 'You are not even going to have that. We are actually going to look at removing ourselves entirely from this space and leaving it up to the states and territories.' I note the Prime Minister said today that states and territories run the system. I can tell you, if you get Commonwealth funding in those schools it comes with strings attached. You get told how that money is to be spent. If you do not spend it that way you do not get it. So it is not entirely true that the states and territories have all the say. But I look forward to the green paper being released eventually. I look forward to the debate, but I think we should all go in with our eyes open to the fact that there is an agenda that is being pursued through this process that cannot be supported. It cannot be supported in the interests of children's education in this country.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2015-06-22,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (16:23):  I, like everybody in this debate, support 100 per cent the right of every Australian child to be educated in an excellent school. For the one million children who are educated outside capital cities in this country, 660,000 of them, the majority of them, are in state schools. They are located right around regional Australia. My communities, my party, and my own family is invested in ensuring that there is excellence in state education right across this country. My own experience as a university lecturer within the education system gave me the privilege of training so many of the young teachers who are going to head out into state schools. And I want to confess that, in my own experience as a schoolteacher, I never taught at a grammar school. I only taught at state schools, because I believe that every child should have access to excellence in education.


Our government is the best friend the state system has ever had. We have had record funding across state school systems, and we have done more than that. We have not just thrown money, because we know that just throwing money will not make a difference and will not stop the decline in standards that is occurring despite filling up the buckets of money—it is how we target it. It is also different policy settings, or whether it is the national curriculum or the minister's TEMAG initiatives, which are actually going to ensure that there are quality teachers in our state schools and that quality teaching occurs within our state schools. If you want to ensure that every child has the best chance to succeed and the best chance for quality outcomes, the one thing this government can control—we cannot control the type of family they grow up in or where they grow up—is the quality of the teaching they receive, and not only in the Catholic and independent schools, which have so much more freedom and so much more autonomy on how they staff their schools than state school systems do. What we, the Commonwealth government, can do is ensure that our public purse is significantly subsidising the tertiary education of every teacher who is graduating from our universities, and that every teacher who is in front of an Australian child, whether in the state school system or in Catholic or independent schools, is of high quality, because that is the thing that we know will make the biggest difference.


But it is only the ALP and the Greens who will actually come in here and attack the fact that there is a range of ideas and options out there, that there is not a one-size-fits-all policy solution to this very complex and vexed issue of how we actually have a sustainable federation. We saw their approach to a tax review: we will have a tax review, but we will keep the most contentious parts of our tax system out of that public conversation. And so when you see the Henry tax paper, it neglected to actually deal with the complexities of the tax system as a whole. We are not afraid of ideas. We are not afraid of options. Just because they are on the table does not mean they are going to be taken up. But to actually restrict public debate before you have even started to have it really says more about you than it does about us. We respect diversity and we respect choice.


We welcome the initiative and we welcome and support an incredible, excellent public education system. What we also want to do is give freedom to our principals to hire and fire, to ensure that those quality teachers are actually in front of the classrooms. We want to ensure that public schools have the independence and autonomy that Catholic and private schools enjoy. I think if you want to talk about excellence in public schools we really need to look no further than my home state of Victoria, where you see, for instance, Balwyn High School—a fantastic public school. House prices just within that catchment area have increased by $250,000. There is an assumption that if you are a wealthy person you are going to head off to grammar and pay upwards of 25 grand a year per child to have an education, but why would you do that? There are a lot of parents in Victoria who are choosing to send their children to excellent public schools, and I applaud them for that. And they are prepared to pay the price for that. I look at Mac.Rob, a high-performing public school in Victoria, and at Melbourne High and Nossal High. Excellence in public education is something that we should all be championing, and I thank the minister for his strong support of state school systems.


We have heard today about issues around needs-based funding models. Even Senator Gallagher said, 'We do not have the Gonski model.' The reality is we never had Gonski. We never had the model envisaged by Gonski, because the political reality and the political mettle of the leadership of the Labor Party at that time saw us end up with 27 different agreements around what constituted a needs-based funding model when it came to public education in this country. So for those on the other side to somehow, once again, try to steal the rhetoric and the public debate and conversations, and somehow reframe reality now, is absolutely abhorrent. We never had the Gonski model. It was 27 funding agreements because people would rather play politics with public education.



Senator Wright interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  Senator Wright, rather than actually focus on what is best for students and what is best for schools, the Labor Party in partnership—hand in glove—with the Greens went to the last election desperate for deals with the states and ended up making promises they could never keep: that no school would miss out; that no student would miss out. 


When you put parameters on this sort of needs based funding model, I am sorry: it is absolutely unachievable. What we saw was an absolute dog's breakfast. This government came to power and has actually given more money to Queensland, to WA—money that you ripped out of those schools, that you were not going to provide to those schools in desperate need in those states. I find it a bit rich at this end of the debate.


How do we move forward? We all spruik how wonderful the Finnish system is, and indeed it has a lot of good things going for it. We need to get serious in this place and stop being political and partisan about school funding and have a bipartisan approach which puts students, teachers, school communities and parents at the forefront of any policy discussion. The reality is: the Commonwealth government provides about 15.6 per cent of the funding for state schools.


So, Senator Wright, you might actually be in the wrong place. If you care so much: run for state parliament, get the balance of power and make all your dreams come true.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-06-22,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (16:31):  Governments should ensure that a great education is available to every poor kid in Australia. The current approach is not necessarily the best way of achieving this. So I welcome the news today that the government has prepared an open-minded discussion paper on school funding and is consulting with the states and territories. I find it disconcerting that certain parties respond to this news by immediately asserting their support for the status quo and attacking anyone who dares to consider alternatives. 


The Liberal Democrats believe the Commonwealth government should play no role in school funding. The Commonwealth has no constitutional responsibility in this area, runs no schools and has no monopoly on the raising of taxes. But, if the Commonwealth government is to play a role in school funding, we believe funding should be provided according to the circumstances of the children and parents. It should not be provided according to who owns the school.


Don't be fooled by the Gonski cheer squad: current funding arrangements do not provide funding according to the circumstances of the children and parents. A poor child in a government-run school gets the most funding: more than a poor child in a church-run school, which is more than a poor child in a privately-run school. This results from two levels of government working at cross-purposes, from generous grandfathering arrangements for


church-run schools and Gonski's intentional discrimination between government-run and non-government-run schools. Those defending the status quo are clearly more interested in point-scoring than in the welfare of our poorest kids.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2015-06-22,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (16:33):  I rise—sadly—in support of this motion that has been put forward by Senator Claire Moore. It will be Labor that stands up for education and access to education in an equitable way for all Australians over and over and over. It was on Labor's watch that the most significant analysis of student success in schools was undertaken and it resulted in the Gonski review, which indicated very clearly after significant research that the way in which we could invest in the future of our young people is to make sure they get a fair crack at a decent education. 


The last time I looked when I was heading off overseas, I had an Australian passport, not a passport for New South Wales—nor, as far as I know, Deputy President Whish-Wilson, as a proud Tasmanian, for Tasmania. We belong to a country which requires all of us to have access to a great education. It should not be so different from state to state, which is one of the problems we see with the American model.


Today's article by Matthew Knott in both The Age and the Canberra Times bells the cat on what this government really want to do, and I have heard it over and over and over at Senate estimates—an abrogation of responsibility from the federal government of key areas, particularly health and education. I have heard minister after minister stand there and actually proudly declare that it is rightly the responsibility of the state, completely abrogating any sense of national responsibility for the education of our nation into the future. 


We live in a global economy. We have got a country that is diverse. We do not need to fracture it anymore by creating different levels of education across the states. With regard to the state of New South Wales, it was a bit of a shock to me to have heard in question time today claims that the states were responsible for this green paper. Is it a draft? Is it the real one that went out? But we heard today, clearly, that the states were involved in drafting it. I don't think anyone from New South Wales was involved in drafting it, because in the Financial Review today an article by Geoff Winestock said:


Ms Berejiklian called on the Abbott government to reverse a decision in last year's budget to slash payments to the state for education and health, which will start to take effect by the end of the current forecast period.


Ms Berejiklian said: 


The changes to health and education funding the federal government announced last year are not sustainable, and we will be fighting for the people of NSW to ensure this State gets its fair share both now, and into the future.


If that is the case, there is no way they could have participated in the green paper, because that is the complete opposite of what this government is telling us here today. 


Mr Piccoli is on record as saying, if the Commonwealth funding, the Gonski agreed funding—and it is agreed; it was agreed and they are still fighting for it for the children of New South Wales—is threatened:


the ability to fully fund all schools which are currently below the ""Schooling Resource Standard""—


would be threatened.


the next generation of literacy and numeracy reforms—


threatened.


additional initiatives to improve the quality of teaching—


threatened.


greater provision of Asian languages—


threatened.


targeted funding for students with high needs, such as those with a disability, refugees or from disadvantaged backgrounds;


—all of these children, all of these young people, are threatened by a green paper in which a government that is full of hubris and arrogance is determined to turn against the states and walk away from. It is disgraceful behaviour.


The funding impact on the state of New South Wales is a loss of $2.8 billion. For Victoria, it is $2.1 billion; for Queensland, $2 billion; Western Australia, $570 million; South Australia, $450 million; Tasmania, $200 million; the ACT, $30 million; the Northern Territory, around $200 million; and, overall, for Australia, $8.3 billion. This is what is at stake—money of that scale.


I can tell you, as a former teacher: the resources that we need, as teachers—as professionals who can diagnose students' learning abilities and needs—are so often not available. Currently, as to the disadvantage of teachers who are teaching in remote settings and teachers who are teaching young Aboriginal kids or children from a background where the English is not their first language, Gonski proved once and for all that those children need particular additional resources—and teachers know it. There are great teachers out there already doing the very best that they can with the resources that they have, but, for many teachers, it is an insult to go to schools day after day and not have what they need.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-06-22,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (16:38):  What a refreshing change it is that we have a federal government that actually wants to consult and negotiate with states and territories. I think back immediately to the Rudd prime ministership, as to hospital funding, in which he put a gun to the head of all of the states and territories and said: 'In return for some GST money, I will do something; if you do not do it—if you do not sign up—that is the end of you.' Thank the Lord there was one coalition Premier left in this country at the time, in Colin Barnett, who said to Mr Rudd: 'No you won't. The management of hospitals actually resides with the states. And thank you very much for your measly offer!'


But what do we see today? Again, what an incredible scenario, as presented—that the federal government would want to sit down with the states and territories, who have responsibility for the delivery of education in this country, and say to them: 'How can we work better? How can we actually reduce duplication? Is it necessary that we have in excess of 4,000 staff in the federal department of education when they do not actually teach a single child? Is that the best way to expend the taxpayers' money? Is that the best value for children in this country?' It may be or it may not be, but have a look at the manner in which this process is being undertaken.


We heard from Senator Birmingham this afternoon of the South Australian Labor Premier Mr Weatherill complimenting the government and the minister, Minister Pyne, and saying, 'What a refreshing idea it is that we would go through this process.' But I again remind those who might be listening that the provision of education services and delivery in this country, under the Constitution, is for the states.


I know that Senator Cash will be very interested in the comments recently of our state minister for education, Peter Collier, when he made these observations, not 72 hours ago, that, in our state—because Western Australia genuinely believes in provision of education delivery—these are the stats: we have the highest per-capita resourced schools in the nation; our teachers are the best-paid in the nation, and, according to Peter Collier, that is by a country mile.


But let us see the outcome of this, if we can. The trend of reducing attendances in our public state schools in Western Australia has been reversed, and we are now seeing a net increase in the attendance in our public schools. Why do you see that circumstance? There are three words that explain it, and they are: Independent Public Schools. Of the 799 public schools in Western Australia, 441 or 55 per cent of them are now independent public schools and another 92 have applied to join. What are we seeing? We are seeing principals with autonomy in terms of decision making, school communities very much more involved in the management of their school, and principals and their staff and the school community having the capacity to say, 'This is where we want to direct our resources; this is where our particular school needs the educational opportunities,' whether in disability or languages, and, of course, having the capacity to select their staff—to advertise for the teachers that they want. That is what we are seeing in our home state of Western Australia.


In response to the area we speak of, Mr Collier has already come out and said: 'Education is a state based issue; we won't be charging children or their parents to be going to school in the state schools.' So there is the excellence of a system led by a Premier and a minister who put education first.


Indeed, if Senator O'Neill has the long list of complaints and issues that she has got, then she should turn to the state authorities. They have ripped enough of Western Australia's GST money out; they should have sufficient funds to put into education.


But I go to the state of Queensland and to some figures given to me just recently in this debate, and those are on Queensland year 9 NAPLAN tests. And what do we see, Senator O'Sullivan—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson? We actually see, at the median SES level, no difference in the NAPLAN performance between state schools, Catholic schools and independent schools. So there are the circumstances.


To return to Western Australia again—because Western Australia and the Territory missed out badly in the last round of negotiations under the previous governments—these are the points I need to make. There are no cuts to Commonwealth government funding, and $69½ billion is to be expended over the forward estimates—and this includes funding for the Indigenous boarding initiative. How wonderful is that? We spoke for years in this place about the limited opportunities being offered through the independent system to take young Aboriginal people from the remote and rural areas and bring them down to the boarding schools—certainly, in my own home state, and, I know, in the other states. Now we have got sufficient funding to expand that program so that these young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children can get a full education, and the statistics that we saw on the success of that program previously, are of success at year 12 level—the level of going on to higher studies or to education and employment.


The Abbott coalition government—far from all the gloom and doom we heard from Senator O'Neill in this place a few minutes ago—has restored the $1.2 billion that the previous Labor government took out of school funding in the forward estimates. But it is better in our state, which, as Senator Cash well knows, missed out last time. You, Senator Cash—through you, Acting Deputy President—will be interested in these figures. The total Commonwealth funding to government schools in Western Australia will grow by $1.9 billion—a 36 per cent increase from 2014 up to 2018-19. For non-government schools, it will grow by $2.2 billion by 2018, a 23.4 per cent increase. Across the board, it is a 28 per cent increase. No-one who can stand up here and say to me that this Commonwealth government is not totally focused on those three areas. Teacher quality, school autonomy, engaging parents in education and strengthening the curriculum are the four pillars that are so essential in this debate.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (16:45):  I rise to participate in the matter of public importance discussion titled 'The Abbott government's plan to abolish universal access to free public education'. I congratulate Senator Moore for raising this matter. Despite the education minister rejecting the proposal in the government discussion paper to make wealthy parents pay to send their children to public school, it is clear that this option floated in the federal government discussion paper, which considers a radical overhaul of the nation's education system, is on Minister Pyne's and Prime Minister Abbott's list of things to do. This plan to make wealthy parents pay to send their children to public school's is just another attack on a fundamental Australian social right, namely, an attack on access to free public education. It goes hand in hand with the ideological political attack the Liberals have carried out on universal access to public health care and access that young people have to higher education.


While Minister Pyne is on social media saying his government does not and will not support the means test for public education, we are smart enough not to trust a word that comes out of his mouth. This is the same man who tried to make our young people pay $100,000 for their university degrees when there was not one word of warning before the last election. Mr Pyne's leader Mr Abbott is the Prime Minister who promised there would be no cuts to education before the last election. But in his first budget he announced cuts of $80 billion to health and education over the next decade, including a $5 billion—20 per cent—cut to university funding and deregulation of uni fees and schools funding. That is in addition to the Liberal Party's promise not to cut the budgets of health, ABC, SBS and pensioners entitlements.


The public education system in Tasmania is struggling, despite the fine effort of teachers, teachers aides, school principals, parents and parent helpers. The last thing Tasmanians need to hear in the media is the Prime Minister sidestep the issue of means testing. The Prime Minister is reported by the ABC as saying:


I think it's good that some of the states and territories at least are thinking creatively about how they can responsibly fund their operations …


Given the Abbott government's blatant disregard for the truth and lack of integrity, if means testing of parents for public schools is in a Liberal discussion paper now, you can almost be guaranteed, because of past behaviour, that should the Liberals be returned as a government after the next federal election, means testing for public schools will be introduced. There is absolutely no doubt about that.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (16:50):  I table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



SOCIAL SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FAIR AND SUSTAINABLE PENSIONS) BILL 2015


This bill will introduce several 2015 Budget measures improving the fairness and sustainability of the pension system, and reintroduce some measures previously introduced in 2014 bills that are still before the Senate.


For improved fairness and equity, the first of the new Budget measures will make sure a fairer proportion of a superannuant's actual defined benefit income is taken into account when the social security income test is applied.  From 1 January 2016, this measure will introduce a 10 per cent cap on the defined benefit income that can be excluded from the social security income test.


A defined benefit income stream is a pension paid from a public sector or other corporate defined benefit superannuation fund, where the pension paid generally reflects years of service and the final salary of the beneficiary.  Current arrangements allow some defined benefit superannuants to have a large proportion of their superannuation income excluded from the pension income test.


People receiving Veterans' Affairs pensions will not be affected by this change, and defined benefit income streams paid by military superannuation schemes will be excluded.


From 1 January 2017, the bill will reduce from 26 to six weeks the length of time the Age Pension, and a small number of other payments with unlimited portability, will generally be paid at the basic means-tested rate while the person is outside Australia.


After six weeks, payment will be made on a proportional basis according to the length of the pensioner's Australian working life residence—a concept representing the length of time the person has resided in Australia between age 16 and Age Pension age.


Pensioners overseas on the implementation date will stay under the current 26-week rule until they return to Australia.  Subsequent trips will be under the new six-week rule.  Those pensioners with 35 years or more of Australian working life residence, and those already exempt from the proportional payment rules—such as some recipients of the Disability Support Pension—will not be affected.


A further measure applying from 1 January 2017 will rebalance the assets test to make it fairer and better targeted, and to help ensure the pension system is sustainable into the future.  The changes will:


increase the assets test free areas to provide additional assistance to part rate pensioners with moderate asset holdings;


provide an additional increase in the free areas for non-homeowners to ensure fairer treatment for those who do not own a home and who therefore do not benefit from the principal home exemption; and


better target the pension by increasing the assets test taper (or withdrawal) rate for assets above the new free areas from $1.50 to $3.00 per fortnight for each extra $1,000 in assessable assets—this will reduce support to pensioners with higher levels of assets who have greater capacity to support themselves.


The purpose of providing tax incentives to encourage people to build up their superannuation is so they can draw down on it in their retirement.


People with higher levels of retirement savings have the capacity to draw down on their assets to support themselves in retirement rather than calling on the taxpayer for support.  Those most affected by the changes would only have to draw down a maximum of 1.84 per cent of their assets to make up for the loss of their part pension.


Importantly, pensioners who lose pension entitlement on 1 January 2017 as a result of the changes will be automatically issued with a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card, or a Health Care Card for those under Age Pension age, without the need to meet the usual income requirements.  Additionally, veterans whose Service Pension is cancelled under this measure will retain their Veterans' Affairs Gold Card.


This bill also takes the opportunity to reintroduce some measures relevant to pensioners from the 2014 Budget.


The first of these measures is to cease payment of the Seniors Supplement for holders of the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card or the Veterans' Affairs Gold Card.  This measure is currently before the Senate in the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Seniors Supplement Cessation) Bill 2014.


In reintroducing this measure, the implementation date will be moved to 20 June 2015 (meaning the last quarterly payment of Seniors Supplement would generally be made on 20 June 2015).


Lastly, the bill reintroduces two measures currently before the Senate in the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 4) Bill 2014.  These measures are to cease the Pensioner Education Supplement and the Education Entry Payment—with a new start date in each case of 1 January 2016.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-06-22,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (16:55):  When we concluded just before question time, Senator Fierravanti-Wells had just concluded the government's position. I will now move to our position on Greens amendment (2). I might suggest to Senator Ludlam that he move amendments (2), (3), (7) and (8) together, as they all deal with the issues he raised, as indeed does amendment (2), which removes facilitation of copyright infringement as a criterion for issuing an injunction, and the issue of imposing flagrancy as a criterion.



With respect to the first point, Labor understands the concerns raised by some in this debate about the breadth of the term 'facilitate' in this bill. However, it is important to note the context in which the word appears. The bill only covers websites which have the primary purpose of infringing copyright or facilitating copyright infringement. Clearly, all manner of websites might unwittingly and unintentionally facilitate the infringement of copyright in one way or another, but that is not the test. The question is whether it is the primary purpose of a website to do so. As a result, Labor is satisfied that it is appropriate for facilitation to remain in the bill, and we will not support this amendment.


With regard to the second point, with respect to flagrancy, as I have said, the 'primary purpose' test in this bill imposes a deliberately high burden on rights holders making their case to the Federal Court. This amendment would add to the test a requirement that a site flagrantly infringed copyright. Flagrancy is a concept known to Australian copyright law, and it has been used in legislation similar to this bill in other jurisdictions. However, as I have said, and as the committee concluded, the primary purpose is the appropriate threshold requirement for the grant of an injunction. I note that, under the bill as presently drafted, flagrancy is already a matter the court can take account of in deciding whether to grant an injunction. Similarly, the court can also take into account whether the site shows a disregard for copyright generally. Labor believes that the current drafting is appropriate, and will not support amendments with respect to imposing flagrancy as a criterion.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Ludlam, do you want to move only amendment (2), or a broader range of amendments?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,19,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-06-22,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:58):  No, and I will speak to my reasons for not doing that. I understand the point that you raise, Senator Collins, and I will take it as read that that is the position of the opposition for that series of amendments. The reason I am moving them separately is that this amendment deals specifically with flagrancy, and in a moment I will get to my strong concerns with how wide the term 'facilitate' is. But I will move through these amendments one at a time.


Noting the comments from both the government side and the opposition side, I am not going to detain us for too long before putting the amendment. It might sound a little bit technical, and I do not believe by any means that the concerns that I am putting on the record have been met by the comments of either the opposition leader here this afternoon or by the government. I will quote briefly from the Australian Digital Alliance submission to the bill, because it goes to the direction and the target of this amendment. The way that they put it is in their submission to the Senate inquiry is thus:


… the most preferable outcome would be to consider flagrancy as part of the scope for the online locations that can be blocked under the injunctive process (ie, a precondition for eligibility for site blocking injunction, not merely one of the factors to be assessed in determining whether to make an order). The flagrancy of the infringement is frequently referred to in the explanatory memorandum. It is a strong safeguards to ensure that injunctions are used against the most blatantly infringing sites et cetera without catching infringing services.


That is why we have targeted the amendment in the way that we have to effectively raise the threshold, or raise the bar, to make sure that in order for a court to issue one of these injunctions on application by a rights holder the sites must be flagrantly infringing copyright. I do not think that is unreasonable. I think it is a great shame that, evidently, this deal has been done outside this chamber and nobody from the major parties is inclined to consider this amendment. Nonetheless, I commend it to the chamber.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-06-22,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:01):  by leave—I move Australian Greens amendments (3), (7) and (8) on sheet 7710:



(3) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 15 and 16), omit 
""
, or to facilitate the infringement of,
""
.




(7) Schedule 1, item 1, page 4 (lines 10 and 11), omit

""
.




(8) Schedule 1, item 1, page 4 (lines 14 and 15), omit 
""
, or facilitate an infringement of,
""
.



What these three amendments do collectively is remove the way that the bill is drafted at the moment, which allows rights holders to seek court injunctions to target sites that facilitate copyright infringement, as opposed to 'enable' copyright infringement. There has been a lot of commentary through the Senate inquiry and outside the Senate inquiry process that has been very concerned about the breadth of the term 'facilitate' as it applies to copyright infringement. It is unnecessarily broad, and it is unclear. It could be used to, for example, take down cloud computing storage sites or services that link shortening sites or social media sites. It could be used to take down sites that provide technical tools that have entirely legitimate uses—for example, sites that provide large file transfer software such as WeTransfer and others. These services absolutely could be argued to facilitate copyright infringement. There is nothing stopping you from, for example, using a file transfer platform like WeTransfer to transfer a copyright infringing item from one party to another. That is absolutely not why that tool was built and it is not why the vast majority of users would use a service like that. Nonetheless, it can be swept up.


The government will probably argue that the bill is drafted tightly enough as it is. I would take strong issue with that. If this is to be targeted we should not be including language as broad as 'facilitating'. I will again quote from page 7 of the Australian Digital Alliance submission:


The Macquarie dictionary defines 'facilitation' as:


1. to make easier or less difficult; help forward (an action, a process, etc.).


2. to assist the progress of (a person): to facilitate the customer to find the right product.


This is immensely broad language. It is exceptionally broad language for a bill that covers the consequences of knocking websites and platforms offline. They continue:


This could conceivably cover a number of online locations offering products that have legitimate uses, but which may also be used assist in copyright infringement. VPNs—


and I will be dealing with VPNs in a separate amendment shortly—


cloud storage providers, providers of Bit Torrent or Internet Relay Chat ('IRC') software, browser plug ins or conversion tools may all be covered, as may blogs or subreddits discussing techniques or sites that may be used to infringe. A project such as Open Rights Group's attempt to transparently list the sites that have been blocked under the UK legislation may have a primary purpose of facilitating copyright infringement if the majority of users used the list to find sites with infringing content.


And that is irrespective of the motives of those who put that list up there. Again, if we are going to have site blocking legislation such as this on the statute books—effectively an internet filter managed through the courts by foreign rights holders—shouldn't we ensure that it is targeted absolutely as narrowly as possible, not at things that facilitate copyright infringement but at things that infringe copyright? That is the distinction we are seeking to draw here. Senator Collins did indicate the position on the half of the opposition a short time ago. I would love to hear from the government why you would be knocking over a perfectly sensible amendment such as this.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (17:05):  On the question of facilitation, I would just like to note that the bill contains a facilitation element because many of the online locations that are intended to be the subject of an injunction operate in such a manner as to avoid directly infringing copyright. For example, they do not host infringing content, but provide links or other means for users to obtain the infringing material. These websites are facilitators, and the bill is designed to ensure that they cannot avoid an injunction by simply not hosting or directly infringing copyright. Facilitation is intended to be a broad and flexible concept, as distinct from existing legal doctrine such as authorisation liability. In particular, in relation to amendment (7) it is unnecessary to include flagrancy as part of the threshold test in subsection (1). The existing primary purpose test is already an intentionally high threshold test that will not include legitimate websites. We have included a number of examples in the revised explanatory memorandum to make this adequately clear. For example, the primary purpose test would prevent an injunction to disable access to an art gallery website operated outside of Australia that may contain an unauthorised photograph.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-06-22,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:07):  I move Australian Greens amendment (4) on sheet 7710:


(4) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (after line 17), after subsection 115A(1), insert: 


(1A) To avoid doubt, for the purposes of subsection (1) a virtual private network is not an online location.


I will see if I can improve my luck on this one! This amendment goes to very serious concerns that I have that this bill could be used, and could be interpreted by courts, to prevent the use of VPNs—virtual private networks. It was an issue that was canvassed briefly in some of the contributions to the debate on the second reading. This amendment proposes to clean up this dangerous ambiguity, so that it is at least one thing that we do not have to worry about.


A VPN is a legitimate technical tool with many uses which have nothing to do with copyright infringement. It is used as a security measure and as a way for people to collaborate on a private network across multiple sites. I think Senator Leyonhjelm, in his earlier contribution, identified that when we log on to the Parliament House network from home base or from on the road, using our security token, we are in effect using a virtual private network. They have multiple legitimate uses across industry, government, security agencies—take your pick. You could argue that they also have more niche uses, which are nonetheless valuable and entirely legitimate. For example, a whistleblower could use a VPN to hide their internet address and protect their identity while revealing important information to a journalist. That would be one argument. A VPN may be used by a journalist to prevent their sources from being exposed. It may be used by a systems administrator to test if their company's network is functioning correctly.


Both the communications minister and the shadow Attorney-General have stated that the bill is not intended to capture or block or prevent the use of VPNs. But this is not good enough. Ambiguities have already been introduced—maybe wittingly, maybe unwittingly—by Senator Fierravanti-Wells's contribution before the debate was interrupted for question time. When interpreting whether these things are in or out, the courts must be given certainty as to parliament's intention. The smartest way for us to do that is to make sure that it is in the law. If any loophole is left in the legislation, then it may well be that these clauses are tested by rights-holders trying their luck, and the unintended—or intended—consequences of that would be quite profound.


This is a very simple amendment. It is designed to explicitly remove VPNs from the scope of the bill. I commend it to the chamber.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:10):  Labor shares the Greens party's concern that this bill should not capture VPNs. This bill, as I explained in my remarks earlier this morning, is directed only at the worst of the worst—websites which intentionally and brazenly flout copyright law. It is difficult to see how VPN services, which have a wide range of legitimate purposes, could satisfy the primary purpose test in this bill. Nevertheless, for the avoidance of doubt, Labor has asked the government to respond to the concerns expressed by the committee about this issue by inserting into the explanatory memorandum a clarification that the bill will not target VPN services. As a result, this amendment is superfluous.


I note, too, the undesirability of including in primary legislation a reference to a particular technology. We should strive to produce technology-neutral drafting. Thus, Labor will not support this amendment.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (17:11):  On behalf of the government: it is unnecessary to include provisions to expressly exclude a VPN from the scope of the bill. The amendments are not intended to apply to VPNs that are promoted and used for legitimate purposes. VPNs have a wide range of legitimate purposes, and have no oversight, control or influence over their customers' activities. A VPN site with a legitimate purpose would not be blocked, as it does not have a primary purpose of infringing or facilitating infringement of copyright. The bill does not require clarity on the definition of sites that could be targeted, because a legitimate site of any nature would not pass the primary purpose test. Accordingly, we oppose this amendment.

 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:17):  I know we tend to avoid drifting into hypotheticals, so forgive me if you think that is what I am about to do, but I cannot work out any other way of assessing whether the government knows what it is doing or I am simply misunderstanding the way that the act is going to operate. There is a VPN service provider out there that provides services to one million people, and they are using that for all manner of legitimate purposes in the way that we use the parliamentary VPN when we are distributed all over the country. I log on, I take out a subscription in that company and I use it to infringe copyright on a third-party site located somewhere else entirely. Are you seriously telling me that because of one bad egg—one user who is using it for dodgy purposes—you are going to knock that business out from its entire Australian customer base? I am reasonably sure that is not what is intended, but it is the way that you are making it sound, so please help us out. I get that you are going to block that site that I might be visiting using a VPN, but I do not understand how you can be proposing to knock the VPN business off the Australian internet at the same time.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS

A VPN site with a legitimate purpose would not be blocked as it does not have a primary purpose of infringing or facilitating infringement of copyright.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Edwards
):  The question is that amendment (4) on sheet on 7710, moved by Senator Ludlam, be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,19,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-06-22,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:26):  by leave—I move Australian Greens amendments (5) and (6) on sheet 7710 together:


(5) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 26), omit ""proceedings."", substitute ""proceedings; and"". 


(6) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (after line 26), at the end of subsection 115A(3), add: 


   (d) if a person or body with a public interest in the action makes an application to be joined as a party to the proceedings—that person or body. 


These are very important amendments. We have picked up the most significant body of critique that came through the committee process and public debate. These two amendments together would allow third parties—for example, consumer, public-interest groups or individuals—to join the injunction applications as parties to make arguments against specific websites being blocked. 


Currently, the only parties that would be involved are the internet service providers, the owners or hosts of the websites that are proposed to be blocked and those who are bringing the injunction in the first place, the rights holders. They are the only ones who can be a party. Our argument, very strongly backed up by a number of submitters to the inquiry, suggests that a much larger number of people are potentially affected and should therefore be able to join those court applications.


Foreign site owners are unlikely to contest injunctions, due to the cost of legal action in a foreign country. It is not inconceivable but is unlikely that they will front up to an Australian court or organise local representation because something is proposed to be blocked here. The experience of similar legislation in the UK has shown that ISPs are unlikely to contest injunctions beyond the first several examples. This was raised in the second reading debate. And why would they? We like to imagine that ISPs are going to steadfastly, every time one of these injunctions lands on their desks, step up and protect their users and fight these things, but we know that will not be the case. Cost and inconvenience will mitigate that substantially.


There will be, by default, no party to these injunctions arguing for the public interest. Try to visualise how it will look in a year or two once the dust has settled—and maybe, by and large, some amongst us have forgotten that this even exists—if a rights holder bowls up and says, 'I want this site taken offline,' the internet-service provider offers no resistance and then the following day the site is gone. That is what we are talking about. When that becomes routine, here, that gives you an idea of why we are opposing this bill so strenuously.


Courts are allowed to approve public-interest organisations to present, to the court, as amici curiae or friends of the court. We saw this in the iiNet High Court case, but the Greens do not believe this is strong enough and that is why this amendment is worded more broadly. This amendment would then allow third-party organisations to join the legal action and oppose injunctions, opening the door for public-interest documents to be made in important cases.


The Electronic Frontier Foundation—a very large and reasonably well-resourced US digital-rights organisation—is very concerned about the way this legislation is being progressed. In a letter to Ms Dunstone, the committee secretary, on 16 April of this year, they put it the following way:


Beginning with the process, we are concerned that in most cases, there will be nobody to advocate for the retention of content for which a blocking order is sought. The Australian intermediary who is party to the proceedings—


in this case that is likely to be the ISP—


has no particular interest in opposing the blocking of foreign content. Although the foreign content provider is entitled to apply to the court to intervene in the proceedings, their joinder to the proceedings remains within the court's discretion (under proposed subsection 115A(3)), and this would entail considerable expense, due to the high costs of foreign parties securing representation before the Federal Court of Australia. As a result, most hearings are likely to be undefended, and the question of whether particular content should be blocked will seldom receive a full and fair hearing.


Thus it becomes routine that sites simply disappear.


In a briefing note provided by the Australian Digital Alliance on 15 June which is on their website, they put it this way:


… once the injunction is ordered, only parties to the original case or parties appointed by regulation can seek revocation or appeal.


As an example as to why this is worrying, say you are working in a cross-border research group that has stored huge data files in cloud facility. If that site is blocked (it is also heavily used by pirates you find out) you have no standing to ask the court for a review of that order, even though you may now not be able to access your data.


That trespasses a little bit on my forthcoming amendment, No. 9, I think, that Senator Collins was inquiring about before, but it would apply equally in the granting of the injunction—that, if your rights are about to be trespassed on, if there is data that you need to be able to access, if a service that your business uses or that you use is being attacked by a foreign rights holder because of something else that might be happening on that server or some other activity that that company or an individual might be carrying out, you cannot come to court and have that argument heard. You would be relying on the ISP to fight that for you and it may be that they will not do that, not through any impure motives on their part. It is just that Federal Court action and representation is extremely expensive.


We believe that third parties, which may be the kinds of public interest groups that have been name-checked a few times on the way through this debate, should be able to be a party to these injunctions if they are of particularly important cases. Also, I believe, should members of the general public, and that is why this amendment is very broadly framed.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-06-22,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:32):  With the chamber's indulgence, I will also take my comments to amendment (9) rather than addressing them separately. These amendments would provide special standing for third parties wanting to intervene in an application for an injunction under the bill or to apply for an injunction once made to be rescinded or varied. In its present form, the bill provides that parties to an application for a site blocking injunction will be the rights holders, ISPs and the operator of the website in question, should they choose to appear. The bill does nothing which would alter the usual rules of civil procedure which govern standing, interveners and amicus curiae. However, I note that the bill does, in proposed section 115A(8) contemplate that a person nominated by regulation would be given standing to apply for injunctions to be rescinded. The explanatory memorandum to the bill notes that this role might be filled, for example, by the chair of ACMA or of the ACCC. Labor is satisfied that this is the correct approach and we call on the government to make such an appointment as soon as possible.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (17:33):  The bill provides that the parties to the proceedings are the copyright owner, the carriage service provider and the person who operates the online location if, but only if, that person makes an application to be joined as a party to proceedings. There is no justification for creating a right for any individual to be joined in the proceedings. First, this could result in a flood of applications that have little prospect of success and which unreasonably use up court time and resources. Second, the Federal Court has shown in cases such as the Dallas Buyers Club case that it is perfectly capable of balancing competing public interest, including those of consumers. Under the bill, the court may take public interest considerations into account under proposed subsection (5). These are the impact on any person or class of persons likely to be affected by the grant of the injunction and whether it is in the public interest to disable access to the online location. Given that there are sufficient safeguards which ensure that the interest of particular individuals such as consumers can be taken into account, it is not necessary for a specific amendment to be included. Further, the bill enables the government to prescribe a person who may apply for an order to limit, vary or rescind an injunction, and this could include agencies such as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or the Australian Communications and Media Authority. These agencies are well placed to be able to assist the court in identifying public interest considerations, including those that affect online consumers. Further, if it is apparent in the future that another particular group's interests need to be represented, the government will consider whether they should be prescribed.

That is bizarre. Why not pass this amendment now and save yourself the trouble? I find it a bit hard to believe that the government would rush in here and stand up against some foreign rights holder, when you are quite clearly failing to do that in the primary clause of the bill, and allow EFA, Choice or some other public interest organisation to get into court? Is that what you are suggesting you will do?

It certainly would not have found its way into court; it would have been over in a day. That is precisely what we are concerned about here. If iiNet had not stood up and attempted to protect the rights of its users, that would have been over and done with very rapidly. That is precisely what we are talking about in this instance.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:38):  I move:


(9) Schedule 1, item 1, page 5 (after line 7), after paragraph 115A(8)(a), insert:


   (aa) any other person with an interest in whether or not the injunction should be rescinded or varied; or


This is the final Greens amendment to this bill—(9) on the same sheet. We propose to give a third party the ability to seek a review of a website block. To date, we have been talking about the process of injunction—the process whereby the courts would allow a foreign rights-holder to take a site offline, as far as being visible from within Australia is concerned. With this amendment, we concern ourselves with the consequences once that is done—if an injunction has been granted in error; if legitimate uses have been disrupted; if others come along and discover that the site should not have been knocked out.


It appears, on my reading of the bill, that even if your company has been directly affected by having a website knocked over, you cannot order any kind of review; you cannot order any kind of revocation. Melbourne Free University, for example, was accidentally wiped out by ASIC's clumsy blocking of 250,000 sites under a separate power—section 313 of the Telecommunications Act. They had no rights of review either; I think they actually had to come through us. They ended up having to raise a bit of a fuss in public. They contacted us, and I presume they contacted MPs from other parties as well. That is an appalling process, if your legitimate website has been knocked over by an act of casual incompetence. What are we to do if a rights-holder comes through, seeks an injunction, and it is uncontested; the court lets it get up, and then other legitimate interests have been disrupted or trespassed upon, or people go out of business? Why should they not be able to seek review? And firstly, could the minister confirm that my reading is correct, in that it would not be possible for anybody—a third party—to seek a review if their site has been knocked over?

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (16:55):  When we concluded just before question time, Senator Fierravanti-Wells had just concluded the government's position. I will now move to our position on Greens amendment (2). I might suggest to Senator Ludlam that he move amendments (2), (3), (7) and (8) together, as they all deal with the issues he raised, as indeed does amendment (2), which removes facilitation of copyright infringement as a criterion for issuing an injunction, and the issue of imposing flagrancy as a criterion.



With respect to the first point, Labor understands the concerns raised by some in this debate about the breadth of the term 'facilitate' in this bill. However, it is important to note the context in which the word appears. The bill only covers websites which have the primary purpose of infringing copyright or facilitating copyright infringement. Clearly, all manner of websites might unwittingly and unintentionally facilitate the infringement of copyright in one way or another, but that is not the test. The question is whether it is the primary purpose of a website to do so. As a result, Labor is satisfied that it is appropriate for facilitation to remain in the bill, and we will not support this amendment.


With regard to the second point, with respect to flagrancy, as I have said, the 'primary purpose' test in this bill imposes a deliberately high burden on rights holders making their case to the Federal Court. This amendment would add to the test a requirement that a site flagrantly infringed copyright. Flagrancy is a concept known to Australian copyright law, and it has been used in legislation similar to this bill in other jurisdictions. However, as I have said, and as the committee concluded, the primary purpose is the appropriate threshold requirement for the grant of an injunction. I note that, under the bill as presently drafted, flagrancy is already a matter the court can take account of in deciding whether to grant an injunction. Similarly, the court can also take into account whether the site shows a disregard for copyright generally. Labor believes that the current drafting is appropriate, and will not support amendments with respect to imposing flagrancy as a criterion.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Ludlam, do you want to move only amendment (2), or a broader range of amendments?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,19,2
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-06-22,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:58):  No, and I will speak to my reasons for not doing that. I understand the point that you raise, Senator Collins, and I will take it as read that that is the position of the opposition for that series of amendments. The reason I am moving them separately is that this amendment deals specifically with flagrancy, and in a moment I will get to my strong concerns with how wide the term 'facilitate' is. But I will move through these amendments one at a time.


Noting the comments from both the government side and the opposition side, I am not going to detain us for too long before putting the amendment. It might sound a little bit technical, and I do not believe by any means that the concerns that I am putting on the record have been met by the comments of either the opposition leader here this afternoon or by the government. I will quote briefly from the Australian Digital Alliance submission to the bill, because it goes to the direction and the target of this amendment. The way that they put it is in their submission to the Senate inquiry is thus:


… the most preferable outcome would be to consider flagrancy as part of the scope for the online locations that can be blocked under the injunctive process (ie, a precondition for eligibility for site blocking injunction, not merely one of the factors to be assessed in determining whether to make an order). The flagrancy of the infringement is frequently referred to in the explanatory memorandum. It is a strong safeguards to ensure that injunctions are used against the most blatantly infringing sites et cetera without catching infringing services.


That is why we have targeted the amendment in the way that we have to effectively raise the threshold, or raise the bar, to make sure that in order for a court to issue one of these injunctions on application by a rights holder the sites must be flagrantly infringing copyright. I do not think that is unreasonable. I think it is a great shame that, evidently, this deal has been done outside this chamber and nobody from the major parties is inclined to consider this amendment. Nonetheless, I commend it to the chamber.

What these three amendments do collectively is remove the way that the bill is drafted at the moment, which allows rights holders to seek court injunctions to target sites that facilitate copyright infringement, as opposed to 'enable' copyright infringement. There has been a lot of commentary through the Senate inquiry and outside the Senate inquiry process that has been very concerned about the breadth of the term 'facilitate' as it applies to copyright infringement. It is unnecessarily broad, and it is unclear. It could be used to, for example, take down cloud computing storage sites or services that link shortening sites or social media sites. It could be used to take down sites that provide technical tools that have entirely legitimate uses—for example, sites that provide large file transfer software such as WeTransfer and others. These services absolutely could be argued to facilitate copyright infringement. There is nothing stopping you from, for example, using a file transfer platform like WeTransfer to transfer a copyright infringing item from one party to another. That is absolutely not why that tool was built and it is not why the vast majority of users would use a service like that. Nonetheless, it can be swept up.


The government will probably argue that the bill is drafted tightly enough as it is. I would take strong issue with that. If this is to be targeted we should not be including language as broad as 'facilitating'. I will again quote from page 7 of the Australian Digital Alliance submission:


The Macquarie dictionary defines 'facilitation' as:


1. to make easier or less difficult; help forward (an action, a process, etc.).


2. to assist the progress of (a person): to facilitate the customer to find the right product.


This is immensely broad language. It is exceptionally broad language for a bill that covers the consequences of knocking websites and platforms offline. They continue:


This could conceivably cover a number of online locations offering products that have legitimate uses, but which may also be used assist in copyright infringement. VPNs—


and I will be dealing with VPNs in a separate amendment shortly—


cloud storage providers, providers of Bit Torrent or Internet Relay Chat ('IRC') software, browser plug ins or conversion tools may all be covered, as may blogs or subreddits discussing techniques or sites that may be used to infringe. A project such as Open Rights Group's attempt to transparently list the sites that have been blocked under the UK legislation may have a primary purpose of facilitating copyright infringement if the majority of users used the list to find sites with infringing content.


And that is irrespective of the motives of those who put that list up there. Again, if we are going to have site blocking legislation such as this on the statute books—effectively an internet filter managed through the courts by foreign rights holders—shouldn't we ensure that it is targeted absolutely as narrowly as possible, not at things that facilitate copyright infringement but at things that infringe copyright? That is the distinction we are seeking to draw here. Senator Collins did indicate the position on the half of the opposition a short time ago. I would love to hear from the government why you would be knocking over a perfectly sensible amendment such as this.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (17:05):  On the question of facilitation, I would just like to note that the bill contains a facilitation element because many of the online locations that are intended to be the subject of an injunction operate in such a manner as to avoid directly infringing copyright. For example, they do not host infringing content, but provide links or other means for users to obtain the infringing material. These websites are facilitators, and the bill is designed to ensure that they cannot avoid an injunction by simply not hosting or directly infringing copyright. Facilitation is intended to be a broad and flexible concept, as distinct from existing legal doctrine such as authorisation liability. In particular, in relation to amendment (7) it is unnecessary to include flagrancy as part of the threshold test in subsection (1). The existing primary purpose test is already an intentionally high threshold test that will not include legitimate websites. We have included a number of examples in the revised explanatory memorandum to make this adequately clear. For example, the primary purpose test would prevent an injunction to disable access to an art gallery website operated outside of Australia that may contain an unauthorised photograph.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-06-22,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:07):  I move Australian Greens amendment (4) on sheet 7710:


(4) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (after line 17), after subsection 115A(1), insert: 


(1A) To avoid doubt, for the purposes of subsection (1) a virtual private network is not an online location.


I will see if I can improve my luck on this one! This amendment goes to very serious concerns that I have that this bill could be used, and could be interpreted by courts, to prevent the use of VPNs—virtual private networks. It was an issue that was canvassed briefly in some of the contributions to the debate on the second reading. This amendment proposes to clean up this dangerous ambiguity, so that it is at least one thing that we do not have to worry about.


A VPN is a legitimate technical tool with many uses which have nothing to do with copyright infringement. It is used as a security measure and as a way for people to collaborate on a private network across multiple sites. I think Senator Leyonhjelm, in his earlier contribution, identified that when we log on to the Parliament House network from home base or from on the road, using our security token, we are in effect using a virtual private network. They have multiple legitimate uses across industry, government, security agencies—take your pick. You could argue that they also have more niche uses, which are nonetheless valuable and entirely legitimate. For example, a whistleblower could use a VPN to hide their internet address and protect their identity while revealing important information to a journalist. That would be one argument. A VPN may be used by a journalist to prevent their sources from being exposed. It may be used by a systems administrator to test if their company's network is functioning correctly.


Both the communications minister and the shadow Attorney-General have stated that the bill is not intended to capture or block or prevent the use of VPNs. But this is not good enough. Ambiguities have already been introduced—maybe wittingly, maybe unwittingly—by Senator Fierravanti-Wells's contribution before the debate was interrupted for question time. When interpreting whether these things are in or out, the courts must be given certainty as to parliament's intention. The smartest way for us to do that is to make sure that it is in the law. If any loophole is left in the legislation, then it may well be that these clauses are tested by rights-holders trying their luck, and the unintended—or intended—consequences of that would be quite profound.


This is a very simple amendment. It is designed to explicitly remove VPNs from the scope of the bill. I commend it to the chamber.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-06-22,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:10):  Labor shares the Greens party's concern that this bill should not capture VPNs. This bill, as I explained in my remarks earlier this morning, is directed only at the worst of the worst—websites which intentionally and brazenly flout copyright law. It is difficult to see how VPN services, which have a wide range of legitimate purposes, could satisfy the primary purpose test in this bill. Nevertheless, for the avoidance of doubt, Labor has asked the government to respond to the concerns expressed by the committee about this issue by inserting into the explanatory memorandum a clarification that the bill will not target VPN services. As a result, this amendment is superfluous.


I note, too, the undesirability of including in primary legislation a reference to a particular technology. We should strive to produce technology-neutral drafting. Thus, Labor will not support this amendment.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (17:11):  On behalf of the government: it is unnecessary to include provisions to expressly exclude a VPN from the scope of the bill. The amendments are not intended to apply to VPNs that are promoted and used for legitimate purposes. VPNs have a wide range of legitimate purposes, and have no oversight, control or influence over their customers' activities. A VPN site with a legitimate purpose would not be blocked, as it does not have a primary purpose of infringing or facilitating infringement of copyright. The bill does not require clarity on the definition of sites that could be targeted, because a legitimate site of any nature would not pass the primary purpose test. Accordingly, we oppose this amendment.

Would you expect that a court would knock over use of that service for the entire Australian population, if one user is using it for illegitimate purposes?

I log on, I take out a subscription in that company and I use it to infringe copyright on a third-party site located somewhere else entirely. Are you seriously telling me that because of one bad egg—one user who is using it for dodgy purposes—you are going to knock that business out from its entire Australian customer base? I am reasonably sure that is not what is intended, but it is the way that you are making it sound, so please help us out.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Edwards
):  The question is that amendment (4) on sheet on 7710, moved by Senator Ludlam, be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,19,2
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-06-22,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:26):  by leave—I move Australian Greens amendments (5) and (6) on sheet 7710 together:


(5) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 26), omit ""proceedings."", substitute ""proceedings; and"". 


(6) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (after line 26), at the end of subsection 115A(3), add: 


   (d) if a person or body with a public interest in the action makes an application to be joined as a party to the proceedings—that person or body. 


These are very important amendments. We have picked up the most significant body of critique that came through the committee process and public debate. These two amendments together would allow third parties—for example, consumer, public-interest groups or individuals—to join the injunction applications as parties to make arguments against specific websites being blocked. 


Currently, the only parties that would be involved are the internet service providers, the owners or hosts of the websites that are proposed to be blocked and those who are bringing the injunction in the first place, the rights holders. They are the only ones who can be a party. Our argument, very strongly backed up by a number of submitters to the inquiry, suggests that a much larger number of people are potentially affected and should therefore be able to join those court applications.


Foreign site owners are unlikely to contest injunctions, due to the cost of legal action in a foreign country. It is not inconceivable but is unlikely that they will front up to an Australian court or organise local representation because something is proposed to be blocked here. The experience of similar legislation in the UK has shown that ISPs are unlikely to contest injunctions beyond the first several examples. This was raised in the second reading debate. And why would they? We like to imagine that ISPs are going to steadfastly, every time one of these injunctions lands on their desks, step up and protect their users and fight these things, but we know that will not be the case. Cost and inconvenience will mitigate that substantially.


There will be, by default, no party to these injunctions arguing for the public interest. Try to visualise how it will look in a year or two once the dust has settled—and maybe, by and large, some amongst us have forgotten that this even exists—if a rights holder bowls up and says, 'I want this site taken offline,' the internet-service provider offers no resistance and then the following day the site is gone. That is what we are talking about. When that becomes routine, here, that gives you an idea of why we are opposing this bill so strenuously.


Courts are allowed to approve public-interest organisations to present, to the court, as amici curiae or friends of the court. We saw this in the iiNet High Court case, but the Greens do not believe this is strong enough and that is why this amendment is worded more broadly. This amendment would then allow third-party organisations to join the legal action and oppose injunctions, opening the door for public-interest documents to be made in important cases.


The Electronic Frontier Foundation—a very large and reasonably well-resourced US digital-rights organisation—is very concerned about the way this legislation is being progressed. In a letter to Ms Dunstone, the committee secretary, on 16 April of this year, they put it the following way:


Beginning with the process, we are concerned that in most cases, there will be nobody to advocate for the retention of content for which a blocking order is sought. The Australian intermediary who is party to the proceedings—


in this case that is likely to be the ISP—


has no particular interest in opposing the blocking of foreign content. Although the foreign content provider is entitled to apply to the court to intervene in the proceedings, their joinder to the proceedings remains within the court's discretion (under proposed subsection 115A(3)), and this would entail considerable expense, due to the high costs of foreign parties securing representation before the Federal Court of Australia. As a result, most hearings are likely to be undefended, and the question of whether particular content should be blocked will seldom receive a full and fair hearing.


Thus it becomes routine that sites simply disappear.


In a briefing note provided by the Australian Digital Alliance on 15 June which is on their website, they put it this way:


… once the injunction is ordered, only parties to the original case or parties appointed by regulation can seek revocation or appeal.


As an example as to why this is worrying, say you are working in a cross-border research group that has stored huge data files in cloud facility. If that site is blocked (it is also heavily used by pirates you find out) you have no standing to ask the court for a review of that order, even though you may now not be able to access your data.


That trespasses a little bit on my forthcoming amendment, No. 9, I think, that Senator Collins was inquiring about before, but it would apply equally in the granting of the injunction—that, if your rights are about to be trespassed on, if there is data that you need to be able to access, if a service that your business uses or that you use is being attacked by a foreign rights holder because of something else that might be happening on that server or some other activity that that company or an individual might be carrying out, you cannot come to court and have that argument heard. You would be relying on the ISP to fight that for you and it may be that they will not do that, not through any impure motives on their part. It is just that Federal Court action and representation is extremely expensive.


We believe that third parties, which may be the kinds of public interest groups that have been name-checked a few times on the way through this debate, should be able to be a party to these injunctions if they are of particularly important cases. Also, I believe, should members of the general public, and that is why this amendment is very broadly framed.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:32):  With the chamber's indulgence, I will also take my comments to amendment (9) rather than addressing them separately. These amendments would provide special standing for third parties wanting to intervene in an application for an injunction under the bill or to apply for an injunction once made to be rescinded or varied. In its present form, the bill provides that parties to an application for a site blocking injunction will be the rights holders, ISPs and the operator of the website in question, should they choose to appear. The bill does nothing which would alter the usual rules of civil procedure which govern standing, interveners and amicus curiae. However, I note that the bill does, in proposed section 115A(8) contemplate that a person nominated by regulation would be given standing to apply for injunctions to be rescinded. The explanatory memorandum to the bill notes that this role might be filled, for example, by the chair of ACMA or of the ACCC. Labor is satisfied that this is the correct approach and we call on the government to make such an appointment as soon as possible.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (17:33):  The bill provides that the parties to the proceedings are the copyright owner, the carriage service provider and the person who operates the online location if, but only if, that person makes an application to be joined as a party to proceedings. There is no justification for creating a right for any individual to be joined in the proceedings. First, this could result in a flood of applications that have little prospect of success and which unreasonably use up court time and resources. Second, the Federal Court has shown in cases such as the Dallas Buyers Club case that it is perfectly capable of balancing competing public interest, including those of consumers. Under the bill, the court may take public interest considerations into account under proposed subsection (5). These are the impact on any person or class of persons likely to be affected by the grant of the injunction and whether it is in the public interest to disable access to the online location. Given that there are sufficient safeguards which ensure that the interest of particular individuals such as consumers can be taken into account, it is not necessary for a specific amendment to be included. Further, the bill enables the government to prescribe a person who may apply for an order to limit, vary or rescind an injunction, and this could include agencies such as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or the Australian Communications and Media Authority. These agencies are well placed to be able to assist the court in identifying public interest considerations, including those that affect online consumers. Further, if it is apparent in the future that another particular group's interests need to be represented, the government will consider whether they should be prescribed.

   (aa) any other person with an interest in whether or not the injunction should be rescinded or varied; or


This is the final Greens amendment to this bill—(9) on the same sheet. We propose to give a third party the ability to seek a review of a website block. To date, we have been talking about the process of injunction—the process whereby the courts would allow a foreign rights-holder to take a site offline, as far as being visible from within Australia is concerned. With this amendment, we concern ourselves with the consequences once that is done—if an injunction has been granted in error; if legitimate uses have been disrupted; if others come along and discover that the site should not have been knocked out.


It appears, on my reading of the bill, that even if your company has been directly affected by having a website knocked over, you cannot order any kind of review; you cannot order any kind of revocation. Melbourne Free University, for example, was accidentally wiped out by ASIC's clumsy blocking of 250,000 sites under a separate power—section 313 of the Telecommunications Act. They had no rights of review either; I think they actually had to come through us. They ended up having to raise a bit of a fuss in public. They contacted us, and I presume they contacted MPs from other parties as well. That is an appalling process, if your legitimate website has been knocked over by an act of casual incompetence. What are we to do if a rights-holder comes through, seeks an injunction, and it is uncontested; the court lets it get up, and then other legitimate interests have been disrupted or trespassed upon, or people go out of business? Why should they not be able to seek review? And firstly, could the minister confirm that my reading is correct, in that it would not be possible for anybody—a third party—to seek a review if their site has been knocked over?

So if a site that you are using for legitimate purposes is knocked over, and you can no longer access it—you cannot access data you might have hosted there, or you cannot access whatever it was that it was doing—and you, the third party, have no interest in infringing copyright whatsoever, and that was not the reason that you were using that site. In order to get that block lifted, you have to persuade the ACCC or the ACMA to what—to bring an application in the Federal Court? How would you go about having that block lifted?

The Court would also have the power to order that the parties establish a 'landing page' at the disabled online location to which internet users who attempted to access the disabled online location would be diverted. This landing page could state that the online location has been disabled in accordance with a Federal Court order and detail the terms of that order. The purpose of a landing page would be to ensure that subscribers are informed of the reason that they are unable to access a disabled online location, avoiding the need to contact their CSP for information.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-06-22,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (21:50):  Earlier today during question time I had to withdraw a remark aimed at Senator Waters. I will not repeat that remark here, and I do apologise for my undue outburst. But I want to explain why I made it. In a question, Senator Waters noted that 42 per cent of the Abbott cabinet is Catholic, including the Prime Minister himself, who once trained to be a Catholic priest. As was pointed out to Senator Waters at the time, her question was out of order because it was against a former President's ruling. Chapter 10 of Odgers states that it is not in order for a senator to refer to a senator's religion. Back in 2005, President Calvert stated his concerns about another Greens senator, Senator Kerry Nettle. He said in his ruling that:


Senator Nettle's question included a suggestion that the decisions of the Minister for Health and Ageing were influenced by his religious views. This was undoubtedly an imputation of improper motives against a member of the House of Representatives, contrary to standing order 193(3), and should not have been made. Senators should refrain from any such imputations in the future.


In 1969 President McMullin ruled that it is out of order to refer to a senator's religion. I think that is a very sound rule which should be adhered to by all senators.


So the Greens have form in this area. In fact, you can quite literally say they wrote the book on it. Greens Senator Larissa Waters, in a single question, managed to work in the fact that the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, had trained at a Catholic seminary and that 42 per cent of the cabinet are Catholic. It is an impressive achievement and it should be recognised.


There are those who would think that, with the decline in sectarianism in Australia so many decades ago, the art of dog whistling on religion would be a dying one. Not so—not with the Greens around. The standard defence by those who use dog whistling is one of straight-up denial: 'What? Who, me?' It is exactly what we saw during question time. 'I was only trying to talk about the Pope's encyclical on climate change.' Sure! It would be like somebody opening up a talk about multiculturalism with the words, 'As you know, 100 per cent of the Greens parliamentarians are white.' It would be completely irrelevant but it would also be completely true.


Senator Waters' reference to the proportion of the cabinet who are Catholic was irrelevant and made in a pejorative tone, as if it were shameful to be a Catholic and even more reprehensible to train as a Catholic priest. Pointing to the religion of different cabinet ministers—




Senator Waters:
  Madam Acting Deputy President Peris, on a point of order: as I said in the question, it was not intended to be disparaging; it was not said in a pejorative manner; and I ask Senator Canavan to withdraw that, as it is attributing false imputations to me which are not accurate and which are in breach of the standing orders.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Peris
):  Senator Canavan, I remind you not to impute any motives to any other senator.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Pointing to the religion of different cabinet ministers in a question to the Senate lacks class. Of course, Senator Waters denied any implication behind her words, because she wanted to land a blow without taking a swing. It was a cowardly claim and a cowardly act. It was cowardly bigotry through the use of dog whistling.


The Greens are massive hypocrites. The Greens speak of tolerance but practise intolerance. The Greens speak of equality—




Senator Waters:
  On a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: for exactly the same standing order breach that we just referred to, about imputing improper motives—which are also inaccurate motives—I ask Senator Canavan to, firstly, desist and, secondly, to withdraw the slurs that he has just made on me and my party.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Canavan, I ask you to withdraw those comments, please.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Can I just ask, for clarification, exactly which comments I am being asked to withdraw?



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Waters:
  The ones you just made.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Well, there has to be a particular point.




Senator Waters:
  Your last two sentences.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Canavan, you imputed improper motives and you know what they are. I ask you to withdraw, please.




Senator CANAVAN:
  I will withdraw, but if the senator wants to raise additional points of order through you, Madam Acting Deputy President Peris, it would be helpful to point out exactly what I said. I am criticising the statement of another senator, which should be allowed in this chamber. It is not an improper motive. I am not saying that the Greens are acting in an improper way. I am pointing out the Greens' massive hypocrisy in this area—which senators do all the time and are welcome to—and it should be pointed out in this area because the Greens are massive hypocrites. They preach tolerance all the time, like they are all sweetness and light, but they practise intolerance. They speak of equality but they actually practise discrimination. They speak of human rights all the time but then they feel free to mock people of certain religions. Australians should reject—




Senator Waters:
  Madam Acting Deputy President Peris, on a point of order: Senator Canavan, I will continue to take points of order while you continue—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—to impute improper motives to me, as if I have somehow disparaged the religious beliefs of members of your party. That was not my intention, and I will continue to say it while you continue to assert it. I ask you again to withdraw.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Waters, that is a debating point.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Australians should reject the Greens' divisive and resentful form of extremist politics.


As a practising Catholic I am fed up with how Catholics are portrayed by some in this chamber and some in the media. The Catholic Church is far from perfect but then it is far from evil, too. Some members of the Catholic Church have done some terrible things over time, and the Church deserves admonishment for those things. The Church itself has shown remorse and is trying, however imperfectly, to repent for the sins of some of its members.


What angers me most about the prejudice of some is their ignorance—their wilful ignorance, at times—of the good works that many Catholics do. I met my wife while volunteering at the Edmund Rice Camps when I was young. On these camps, young volunteers like my wife and me gave up their university holidays to help disadvantaged children go camping. They were full of great young people just striving to live by the example of Jesus Christ and help their fellow man. How is it, though, that an entire religion now can be denigrated for the sins of some? We should never denigrate the many for the mistakes of a few.


None of this is to suggest that I think it is improper for Senator Waters to raise the Pope's encyclical. It was quite appropriate for Senator Waters to do that. It was inappropriate for her—as the President ruled—to impute motives to Catholic cabinet ministers just because they were Catholic.


I have not had a chance to read the whole encyclical myself. I have had a quick look at it, and the central lesson that I took from it—and this is where the Pope speaks with the most authority, I think—is that the wellbeing of humankind, in particular that of the poor, has to be front and centre when we look at complex issues like climate change. Pope Francis makes the very strong point that any policy must put humanity as its central concern and that the moral course is to use human wellbeing, in particular that of the poor, for our standard. The Pope says in it that it is not for the Church to 'settle scientific questions or to replace politics', and he highlights the need for honest and open debate. He states:


For poor countries, the priorities must be to eliminate extreme poverty and to promote the social development of their people. At the same time, they need to acknowledge the scandalous level of consumption in some privileged sectors of their population and to combat corruption more effectively.


He goes on to say:


… demographic growth is fully compatible with an integral and shared development …


The most polluted places on earth are in the developing world, in countries without the benefit of industrial development and of cheap energy and electricity. So, industrialisation and fossil fuels have a place too. When we push up power prices, it is the poor who suffer the most. Also, in the 44,000 words of the encyclical, the word 'climate' appears just 16 times. The most common words are 'human' and 'God'.


Some other pressing moral issues identified by the Pope that the Greens might have missed—or, at least, hope the government will ignore—are the dangers of welfarism and the importance of the dignity of work in helping the poor. The Pope says:


Helping the poor financially must always be a provisional solution in the face of pressing needs. The broader objective should always be to allow them a dignified life through work.


He goes on to say:


Since everything is interrelated, concern for the protection of nature is also incompatible with the justification of abortion. How can we genuinely teach the importance of concern for other vulnerable beings, however troublesome or inconvenient they may be, if we fail to protect a human embryo, even when its presence is uncomfortable and creates difficulties?


While the encyclical did not touch directly on the definition of marriage, the Pope spoke strongly on this in January this year when he said:


The family is also threatened by growing efforts on the part of some to redefine the very institution of marriage, by relativism, by the culture of the ephemeral, by a lack of openness to life.


These are all important points that Pope Francis raises. I welcome the Greens new found interest in the teachings of the Catholic Church, and I hope Senator Waters does take the time to read the full encyclical.
