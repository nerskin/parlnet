"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2002-08-21,"—I take this opportunity to congratulate you, Mr President, on your election to the position.
—You were going to talk about me when you finished!
—Obviously Senator McGauran cannot wait for the retort that I was going to make as a response to his interjection at the conclusion of my speech last night.
—If Senator McGauran is going to continue to interject, he will have to do that from his own position.
—In the very short time that I understand I have available, I would draw attention to the fact that Senator McGauran has in the past been a strong advocate for human rights. For instance, I am aware that on previous occasions he has strongly supported the efforts of the Solidarity trade union movement in Poland, which was fundamental to the restoration of democracy in that country and throughout eastern Europe. This demonstrates the hypocrisy and the two-faced nature of this government when it comes to industrial relations issues: they are happy to support the trade union movement in other countries where it is struggling for democracy and human rights. Historically, that is a role that the trade union movement has had around the world. It is one of the organisations that is essential to the maintenance of free and democratic societies.
The hypocrisy of this government continues with this legislation. That is nowhere more evident than it is in the title of the bill. This bill is known as the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002. This legislation is not about compulsory unionism at all. That is a complete furphy. It is an attempt by this government to whip up some support amongst the ranks of its employer supporters against the concept of compulsory unionism. This bill is seeking to outlaw a legal practice in this country where trade unions and employers can enter into agreements for the payment of bargaining fees by employees in return for union services. To title this bill to suggest that it is an attempt to outlaw compulsory unionism is totally misleading. That, as I said, just demonstrates once again that this government has no shame when it comes to its attacks upon the trade union movement. (Time expired)
—I call Senator Hogg, and may I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election as Deputy President.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2002-08-21,"—Thank you, Mr President. Following on from my colleague's very illuminating speech on this issue, I think it is important to say that this is a very important issue to the trade union movement. I have a past steeped in the trade union movement, as everyone in this chamber knows. I participated in the trade union movement through the period of time when we went from a centralised wage fixation system to enterprise bargaining. With the emergence of enterprise bargaining we found that there were indeed a number of people on whose behalf we were bargaining at the workplace who, for reasons better known to themselves, refused to join the union but who, nonetheless, were always prepared to accept the benefits that flowed from the actions that were performed by the union. That, to me, is very un-Australian and it is an unfortunate trait in a number of people—they all want to get on the gravy train and they all want to accept the benefits that may flow, but they do not want to pay the price for achieving those benefits. 
Contrary to what is being said by the government, bargaining agents fees are not compulsory union fees; they are fees for service. Contrary to what is in the explanatory memorandum to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002, we have now evolved from a centralised wage fixation system to a system which is basically user pays. The fee that the unions seek is to reimburse their costs of bargaining for and on behalf of all employees. I will come to why this is necessary in a few moments. I have been involved directly in negotiations where we have bargained for and on behalf of all employees. All employees have had a role and a part to play in the bargaining process and all of those employees, at the end of the day, have benefited from that process. Indeed, they have willingly accepted those benefits.
We are dealing with a changed system to that which we knew in the trade union movement over a long period of time. As the president of the Queensland branch of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, I am still reasonably close to what is happening in the enterprise bargaining area. I have the pleasure of being the chair of the executive on a monthly basis and I see reports passing across the meeting about the number of enterprise bargaining agreements that the union is actively involved in. These are numerous indeed. There are many loyal unionists who are being actively bargained for by the union, but there are also non-unionists who are gaining the benefit of the time, effort, energy and resources that the union puts into those bargaining exercises. It is only reasonable—and any person with a half degree of moderation in this would agree—that there should be recompense paid to the union for the activity that it has undertaken in this difficult exercise of enterprise bargaining.
One should be under no illusion that enterprise bargaining takes place and can be achieved in a relatively short period of time or that there is no skill involved. Enterprise bargaining can be a protracted process. Not only is it a protracted process, but it can be complex, given the arguments that the employers are likely to throw up in any enterprise bargaining exchange. There is a need for a degree of expertise and competency on the part of the employee representatives to match that which is put up by the employers. That is achieved and can be achieved in the real world only by union participation in the enterprise bargaining process. The structure of this is terribly important. I will quote briefly from the submission on this from my national union, the SDA, to the Senate:
The structure of the Workplace Relations Act makes very clear that a Certified Agreement made under either Division 2 or Division 3 of part VIB of the Workplace Relations Act, can be made between an employer and a registered organisation of employees. These agreements, once certified, apply to and bind all persons whose employment is covered by the agreement. 
This means that members and nonmembers alike gain the benefits of the agreement. Clearly there is a binding relationship which is bestowed by the act upon the employers and all employees. It only makes sense that, if that is the system that is in place—and that is not necessarily a system that was eagerly sought by the trade union movement when we moved from centralised wage fixation— we would see those people who are gaining the benefits of the system paying their legitimate part of the expense that has been raised in gaining those agreements. The submission also says:  
Employees of employers who are bound to either a Division 2 or a Division 3 agreement will receive the benefits of the agreement whether or not they are members of the union. 
Union membership is not the qualification. It is the act that puts in place division 2 and division 3 certified agreements. With those certified agreements in place, all employees covered by them receive the benefit, whether they are union members or not. It follows then that workers who make no contribution to the union will gain the benefit of the work undertaken by the union in negotiating and bargaining and concluding an agreement with an employer and having such an agreement certified under the Workplace Relations Act. This submission was made by a union which is involved almost continuously in enterprise bargaining agreements. Literally thousands of agreements across this nation, at both the national and the state level, are made as a result of negotiating with employers. The submission also says:
Not only do the provisions of Section 170M and 170MA ensure that certified agreements made with registered organisations have application to non members but the Workplace Relations Act goes significantly further in Part XA by making it clear that it is an offence for an employer to treat a union member and a non union member differently.
The act that has been brought down by this government does not allow a member and a nonmember to be treated differently. It boils down to the fact that it is not possible for the union and employer to agree, when the enterprise bargaining process is taking place, to only have conditions for union members and to exclude the nonmembers. You cannot do it. When the union is in the bargaining process, the act requires that those people be brought into the process anyway and, as I have said, it is clear that those people benefit from the provisions that are made under a particular enterprise bargaining arrangement.
What we are talking about really is commonsense and what happens in the real world. In the real world you cannot divide the nonmember from the member in the workplace. One cannot treat them in a different manner. If the union is bargaining for and on behalf of the employees then these people who are nonmembers should and must pay an appropriate fee to the union to recompense them for the work that has been undertaken. The submission by the national SDA goes on to state:
It is clear therefore that the structure and purpose of provisions of the Workplace Relations Act is to ensure that a person who is not a member of a union is entitled to receive the same benefits that a member of the union is entitled to.
...	...	...
If employees have a right to receive any benefit negotiated by a union with an employer then there should be a corresponding obligation on the employee to assist in funding the cost of the bargaining negotiation and representation process necessary to obtain and maintain those benefits.
In that submission by the SDA there arises the issue of obligation. `Mutual obligation' is bandied around as being a fairly important concept in our society today. This government has pushed the issue of mutual obligation in a number of areas, particularly social security areas. Here we find that there is really an obligation to pay on the part of those people who have benefited, but the government is seeking through this bill to remove any obligation on their part. It just does not make sense.
What we have is a system where there really and truly has been established—not because of the desire of the trade union movement, but in part because of the move from the centralised wage fixation system to the current system—a position where there is a quite understated obligation on the part of people who benefit to contribute to the union which has undertaken the negotiation. Of course there is a lot of rhetoric, and of course a lot of hype is put out about the bargaining agent fee. None of that rings true of what happens in the real world. The bargaining agent fee is not designed to be a union fee. It is not designed to make these people members of the union. People who stand outside the union still have the right not to be members of the union, but it is like anything in this world—if you are a participant in the process, you cannot wash your hands of the process and say, `I will take what I like that is good out of the process but deny what I do not like in the process.'
When I was reading through their submission it was interesting to look at what the national SDA had to say about the overseas approach. Whilst we are not exactly similar to the United States and Canada, there is a system there based on enterprise bargaining agreements. Entrenched and enshrined in the legislation of the United States and Canada are the rights of unions to bargaining agent fees. The SDA submission states: 
In those two jurisdictions—
that is, the United States and Canada—
the concept of bargaining agent fees are well entrenched within the legislative framework of bargaining.
One does not need to look for a more anti-union, anti-worker environment than that in the United States, particularly, but even in that very capitalist environment one finds— entrenched in their legislation—that they have recognised that unions have a bona fide right to claim a bargaining agent fee. The submission goes on:
Both the United States and Canadian industrial relations system recognise the absolute right of unions to recover a bargaining agent fee, where the union has bargained an agreement, which provides benefits to all employees in a workplace.
Our government is seeking to be out of sync and out of step with international practice, with no cause or reason whatsoever. It is interesting that further on in the SDA submission the word `obligation' comes up again in respect of the Canadian and United States systems. Again, I quote:
Both the Canadian and United States systems are based upon the concept of recognition of mutual obligations. If a worker is to have access to the benefits negotiated by a union, then the worker has an obligation to pay a portion of the cost incurred by the union in negotiating an enterprise agreement.
The submission goes on to what I think really gets to the nub of this bill. In looking at the Canadian situation, the submission referred to a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Lavigne v. Ontario Public Service Employees Union (1991), and the references are cited. Madam Justice McLachlin, part of the majority in this case, said most succinctly:
The whole purpose of the (Rand) formula is to permit a person who does not wish to associate himself or herself with the union to desist from doing so. The individual does this by declining to become a member of the union. The individual thereby dissociates himself or herself from the activities of the union. Fairness dictates that those who benefit from the union's endeavours must provide funds for the maintenance of the union. But the payment is by the very nature of the formula bereft of any connotation that the payor supports the particular purposes to which the money is put. By the analogy with government, the payor is paying by reason of an assumed or imposed obligation arising from this employment, just as a taxpayer pays taxes by reason of an assumed or imposed obligation arising from living in this country.
That is on pages 345 to 346. The submission by the SDA goes on to draw this conclusion:
The exact same logic compels the total rejection of the current Bill.
So here we have people operating in a woolly environment—not in the real world, not dealing with the day-to-day machinations of the enterprise bargaining process, not dealing with the votes that are taken or the consultation that is undertaken by the trade union movement through the enterprise bargaining process. We have people trying to inflict a regime which says, `We want enterprise bargaining; we know that the union is part of the process but we don't want the union to be properly remunerated where it represents the interests of those non-members.' The bill should be defeated.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2002-08-21,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002 is another fine example of the use by this government of Orwellian doublespeak in industrial relations. We have seen a series of bills introduced into this chamber, into this parliament, all with titles that have implied one thing and with content that has implied the exact opposite. Whether the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in taking this approach, thinks he can con the Australian people into believing he is trying to do rational things in the area of industrial relations is one thing but whether he thinks he can con us into supporting draconian style legislation simply because it has a high-sounding title is another. I condemn the government for the misleading title of this bill. It is not a bill about compulsory union fees. If that were the case, that phrase would be used at least once in the text. It is not referred to at all in the text of the legislation. The bill refers only to bargaining service fees, which are defined to specifically exclude union membership dues, and that is another transparent attack on unions and the millions of workers they represent. 
This is an issue pursued by the current minister with all the fervour of a zealot. He has turned this into an ideological issue. He has turned every industrial relations issue this government has dealt with during his period as minister and during the period of his predecessor into an ideological issue. One has to pose the question: is this minister serious about promoting industrial relations reform in this country that will benefit the participants in the system or is he simply about putting forward legislation in this chamber to build a bank of bills that potentially can be used down the track to promote a double dissolution, to create the environment that maximises the political options available to this government? While, on the one hand, he has said a lot in the public arena about the necessity of some of this legislation, he has had an opportunity on other bills to pick up amendments that would have made those bills more rational and more able to be worked within the industrial relations community, but on all occasions he has rejected them simply because he has not been able to get his own way. One wonders in fact whether he wants the legislation to be passed by the parliament at all.
The government's rhetoric in support of this bill is intended to promote the myth that bargaining fees in enterprise agreements are being forced on employees without their consent. This is not correct and would not be possible under the relevant legal framework. The Workplace Relations Act 1996 requires that all employees who will be subject to an enterprise agreement must have ready access to a proposed agreement for at least 14 days beforehand, that employers must take reasonable steps to ensure that the terms are explained to employees and that a valid majority of employees voting have genuinely agreed to the agreement. The commission has specified that genuine agreement requires both informed consent and an absence of coercion.
The approach taken to the matter of bargaining fees in certified agreements is also inconsistent with the government's approach to negotiation of AWAs. An employee can appoint their union as their bargaining agent in relation to an AWA and nothing precludes the union from charging a fee in respect of such an arrangement. And yet the government would seek to prevent employees from agreeing by a majority vote to a collective agreement that includes such bargaining fees. The minister argues that employees should not be liable to pay a fee that they have not, individually, agreed to prior to the service being provided. This might carry some weight if employees were in a position to reject the service, with the consequence of being excluded from the benefits of a collective agreement negotiated by a union.
However, that is not the case under the current act. The government opposes unions striking agreements that restrict the benefits of their negotiated agreements to financial members of the union. In early 2002, the Employment Advocate applied to the Federal Court for the removal from several certified agreements of a clause providing insurance for union members. He argued that the clause is contrary to the act because it extends a benefit of insurance cover to employees who are union members instead of extending it to all employees.
The minister has made it clear that he expects unions to represent nonmembers, as in his criticism of unions for failing to insert a redundancy pay provision into the award covering One.Tel employees. It might surprise the minister and some people on that side of the chamber that historically, since 1905, unions have consistently represented non-union members in the industrial relations system. They have consistently argued on behalf of non-union employees. Every award struck in the federal Industrial Relations Commission since 1905 has provided not only for wages and working conditions for union members but also for the extension of those wages and working conditions to non-union members. 
But we are living in a different environment in the year 2002. We have enterprise bargaining as the central focus of our industrial relations system. By its very nature, that is a system that requires considerable use of resources in order to promote the system effectively. Because the government has also tried to outlaw pattern bargaining, it requires unions to visit virtually every workshop, workplace and employer, serve logs of claims on every individual employer in this country and sit down with each individual employer and go through a process of negotiation to achieve an outcome. That consumes enormous resources from the point of view of the union, and over the period that bargaining has been in place unions have had to put additional people into the field in order to cope with the demand and the requirements of their membership. In those circumstances, why shouldn't they seek some recompense for the effort that they put into securing improved wages and working conditions for employees and workplaces? Union members pay for it by virtue of being members of the organisation, and why shouldn't those other employees in those enterprises, who get the benefit of the effort put in on their behalf by other employees, also make a contribution to the achievements that are made on their behalf?
This government, in fact, are strongly wedded to the concept of user pays and individual responsibility. If that is the case, why won't they also apply that to union members and non-union members? Why can't they see that those persons achieving a benefit as non-unionists should also make a contribution to that achievement, as is the reasoning they would apply in other areas? In his minority report resulting from the committee's inquiry into the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2001, Senator Murray, from the Democrats, stated:
It is hard to see how provisions for bargaining fees should be against the spirit of the WRA and its object of facilitating agreement making. Agreement making is desirable, and if fee-for-service contributes to that, it is to the good. There is also the issue of `free-riders', by employers on the backs of employer organisations, and employees on the backs of unions.
It is interesting that in the inquiry held into this particular piece of legislation we had the employer unions, such as the AIG, coming along and arguing very strenuously that nothing should be put in this legislation that would prevent them from collecting their fee for service when they represent individual employers, because not every employer represented by the AIG or by other employer unions is necessarily a member of those organisations. But they all operate very substantially on charging fees for service to those employers who, from time to time, they may get a brief to represent. While on the one hand they were arguing that unions should not have access to such a provision, on the other hand they were very keen to ensure that whatever was done did not operate in such a way as to preclude them from being able to collect those fees for service.
As Senator Murray has pointed out, if the 2002 bill is intended to deal with compulsory unionism, this is already comprehensively prohibited under the act. The government argues that bargaining fees are inconsistent with freedom of association. If this were correct, bargaining fees would be prohibited by the International Labour Organisation principles and standards, which are founded core principles such as freedom of association. No such limit exists. In contrast, bargaining fees are permitted by the ILO and in countries such as the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Israel and South Africa, which are also known for their adherence to principles of freedom of association.
The ILO views bargaining fees as a valid issue for collective bargaining, with its freedom of association committee holding:
When legislation admits trade union security clauses such as the withholding of trade union dues from the wages of non-members benefiting from the conclusion of a collective agreement, those clauses should only take effect through collective agreements.
The ILO's general survey explicitly states that bargaining fee provisions, when negotiated between unions and employers, are consistent with freedom of association principles. It says:
[Clauses in collective agreements] may also require all workers, whether or not they are members of trade unions, to pay union dues, or contributions, without making union membership a condition of employment ... or oblige the employer, in accordance with the principle of preferential treatment, to give preference to unionized workers in respect of recruitment and other matters. These clauses are compatible with the Convention provided, however, that they are the result of free negotiation between workers' organizations and employers. 
In conclusion, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002 is nothing but a blatant attack on unions and their legal efforts to recover some of the costs of negotiating agreements that benefit nonmembers. Some points need to be reinforced. The behaviour this amendment seeks to outlaw is not compulsory unionism. Compulsory unionism is already outlawed under the Workplace Relations Act. Nor is the bargaining agents fee undemocratic. It requires the consent of the majority of the work force before it can be included in an enterprise agreement. If it is good enough for workers to vote before going on strike, as the minister desires, then why is it not good enough for them to vote to have a bargaining agents fee that is enforceable. It is only fair that workers who enjoy the benefits of union enterprise agreements and cannot be excluded under the Workplace Relations Act pay for some of the costs of those negotiations. The government does not support free-riders in other spheres of our society, and it should not here. Bargaining agents fees are consistent with International Labour Organisation principles and are observed by many countries with economies as advanced as ours.
The reality is that the reason the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has put this bill before the parliament is not, as I said initially, because he has a commitment to making the arbitration system—our industrial relations system—a fairer, more effective system operating on behalf of both employers and employees. The reason is that he is an ideological zealot when it comes to this issue. He has a passion and commitment that is focused simply on doing whatever he can to destroy the capacity of workers in this country to organise effectively and to be able to use their collective resources to promote their interests in the workplace. He has made no bones about where he stands in the industrial relations debate. He has no shame— nor, indeed, did his predecessor—about making the point that he stands foursquare in support of the employer and will do whatever he can to tip the scales on behalf of employers. For those reasons, I urge the members of this chamber to vote down this bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-08-21,"—Let me underline and support the closing remarks of my colleague Senator George Campbell. It is appropriate to ask this chamber to vote down this legislation and to do so in the national interest, because this legislation, if it were carried, would set up a process that would bias industrial relations and tilt the playing field to employers against workers. It would work not only against the interests of the at least 2½ million Australians who are members of trade unions in this country but also against those of the many millions of other workers who are not members but who benefit, nonetheless, from the standards achieved by industrial negotiation conducted by unions.
The point here is that unions, by negotiating freely and fairly with employers, set benchmark remuneration and conditions of level benefits for union members. That sets the market rate, to put it in economic terms. That is the rate that non-union members obtain as a free good if they are not members paying a fee, and that is the rate that non-union members negotiate from if they are involved in direct individual bargaining to try to improve their situation and justify why in their particular case—a case I do not necessarily agree with, but nonetheless they are entitled to this view—an individual work agreement is a better deal. Once the market rate is set, that is the benchmark. To bias the playing field so that that market rate cannot be fairly set is not in the economic interests of this nation. It is certainly not in the domestic interests of individual families who have to survive on the income they receive. If the industrial relations system is palpably unfair it will inevitably break down, because if it is unfair Australians are such a robust group of people that they will not cop it. If they do not cop it we will have industrial disputation in this country, which we do not want to see. If there is industrial disputation the people who will be hurt worst are the workers who withdraw their services and lose their incomes. As a Labor person, I do not want to see families suffer in that way, but it will occur in this country if the injustices visited on them, or the lack of fairness delivered to them, means that the outrage is greater than the pain suffered to try to correct it. 
Therefore, we as legislators in this place have an obligation to ensure, above everything else, that the playing field is fair—that it is not unfair—that it is seen to be fair and that people can fairly engage in negotiations on it. This bill denies that opportunity. This bill, therefore, should be rejected. The words `mean and tricky' come to mind.
—You refer to Peter Reith!
—No, Senator Collins. That is not a quote from the ex-minister for industrial relations, Peter Reith. The words `mean and tricky' are a quote from the President of the Liberal Party of Australia, Mr Shane Stone, in a letter to the Prime Minister in March last year in which he said that the Prime Minister was perceived as being `mean and tricky' in the conduct of his office. We know that this letter exists and that this is a truthful quotation because it was published in full in the Bulletin magazine. That is, in fact, a very good description of what this bill is: it is mean and tricky.
Let us take the title of this bill. It uses what in the normal course of events would be regarded as agreeable language—a language to which ordinary Australians would take no exception. But that agreeable language covers a devious purpose. The title of this bill absolutely misrepresents what this bill is about, but ordinary Australians looking at the title would say, `What is wrong with it?' The title of this bill says `Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees'. There is no definition and no repeat of that phrase anywhere at all in this bill. That title does not say what this bill is about. This bill is about—because the bill itself defines what it is about—bargaining services and payment for bargaining services. There is a universe of difference between the two concepts.
Let me illustrate that. Where a workplace has decided to negotiate a collective agreement, where the bargaining agent is the union and where most but not all members of that workplace are members of a union, the union as the agent and on behalf of all workers in that workplace negotiates with the employer, and eventually—and, hopefully, peacefully—a deal is struck. In order for that deal to have validity and to be certified as binding, there has to be a vote in the workplace and all workers who will benefit from that deal, whether or not they are union members, vote. All of those beneficiaries, if it is an affirmative vote, pocket the advantage, whether or not they are union members. Union members, by virtue of being union members, pay a fee to their union to provide that service, but non-union members do not. The proposition here is that those that benefit should pay a service fee—that is to say, they should not be required to join the union, but if they take advantage of the service that is being rendered they should pay a small contribution towards the cost of providing that service.
The government elsewhere in its legislation refers to this as `mutual obligation'. It says to welfare beneficiaries, `You have a mutual obligation to put some contribution back into the system, if you are a beneficiary of the system.' I have no difficulty with that general concept. Sometimes it is applied unjustly, but the concept itself is not remarkable; it is a fair concept. The concept here is that beneficiaries should make a contribution to the cost of achieving the benefit. This is lawful in Australia. It is also lawful in the United States of America, which is the home of much of the ideological attitude that this government brings to industrial relations. It is also lawful in Canada, Switzerland, Israel and a range of other countries. This is not an exceptional idea.
It is so lawful in Australia that an appeal as to whether or not this should apply has been taken to the Industrial Relations Commission, and the umpire has ruled that it should apply, that it is fair. The government has an opportunity through the High Court to appeal that decision of the umpire if it disagrees with it—and, incidentally, I understand that the government has lodged an appeal. The big questions hanging over this debate are: why won't the government allow the umpire to make a fair decision based on the merit of this case and why is it reaching over the court system to tie the hands of the umpire and prevent it from making a decision? They are the big questions that hang over this case, because the door is open, the appeal is lodged and the process can proceed. The only conclusion one can fairly draw is that the government is afraid that the courts will uphold this process as legal, as it is in the United States of America, Canada and a range of other countries where this type of bargaining—the system that we have now adopted in Australia—applies. 
The economic term for a group or an individual that takes an advantage without making a contribution to it—and it applies in the economy in general—is a `free-rider'. That person without making a contribution takes the ride at no cost. The behaviour that the government is wishing to enshrine in this legislation is to encourage a proliferation of free-riders. In looking at all the economic texts, we see that that is regarded as something that should not be encouraged and that in the interests of good government free-riding should be eliminated. Yet, in reverse of the economic line that this government preaches, in this particular set of circumstances encouragement of free-riding is being proposed.
One does not have to be very bright to work out why all of this is taking place. One does not have to be very bright to go to motive, because Mr Tony Abbott and Mr John Howard frequently tell us what their motive is. We are bound, given that they repeat this, to believe them when they say what their motive is. Their motive is to break down the bargaining power of unions in Australia. They are anti-unionists. I do not take exception to that; they are entitled to have that view. But they are not entitled to abuse high office by removing the rights of ordinary Australians to protect their employment interests if they choose to be members of unions—where workplaces in Australia vote through a collectively bargained arrangement, with the union as the agent, in order to break down the power of the union and bias and skew the bargaining outcomes against ordinary workers. While they are entitled to be non-unionists, they are not entitled in the national interest to abuse their elective office by implementing a regime that works against ordinary working people.
There are a number of things that can be said about this which in the government's own terms need to be considered. People listening to this broadcast may remember that back in 1996 when the government was first elected it said two things about industrial relations. The first was that we should keep third parties out of the workplace, that we should allow the people in the workplace to make the decisions that govern that workplace. That was the main platform upon which the government based its argument. This process places the government squarely in the workplace and says to the parties in the workplace, `There are things that you can do, but there are things that we will prevent you from doing.' Government has intruded into the workplace, into the partnership that occurs between workers, employers and their agents in that workplace. Based on the government's own electoral mandate—it claims that every detailed point of its complicated manifesto was voted for and endorsed, which is a concept I find somewhat odd—the first point I make is that this is against what the government promised the Australian electors.
The second justification is even more bizarre and goes back to the mean and tricky concept that the President of the Liberal Party, Shane Stone, accused the Prime Minister of in his letter that was leaked in March of last year. The justification advanced by the government for this legislation is that it is somehow consistent with the international convention Australia has signed up to on freedom of association. I know about the freedom of association legislation and the freedom of association convention, because I had the good fortune to participate in a renegotiation of it at the International Labour Organisation. The ILO is a United Nations agency representing employer groups, worker groups and government groups in a tripartite international commission to reach agreement on what the basic international rules should be for fair industrial relations. This is all governments of all types of countries—workers, employers and governments—represented fairly and equally. When a body like this speaks, it speaks with some force, some power and, dare I say, with some dignity. It has defined what freedom of association means, and it does not mean this—it does not mean this, and it has said so. 
In another realm this government is faced with the conflicting situation of rejecting United Nations advice when it comes to refugees but clothing itself in the protective arguments of the United Nations when it comes to other issues of international affairs, particularly in the current debate about a war with Iraq—we know that. The ILO is an agency in which Australia has had a long and proud tradition. It was founded after the First World War. Australia was one of the very first countries to be associated with it and is a proud member. To claim that what the government has put forward is freedom of association is complete nonsense. The only body that can define freedom of association is the International Labour Organisation in which all interests are represented, and it has specifically said that this is not freedom of association. Yet most Australians do not know that. Going back to the mean and tricky approach that this government has made its theme and motif, this government uses those words to cover a mean purpose with a benign or appealing slogan.
The third point I wish to make, which in some respects is related to an earlier point I made, is keeping the government out of the workplace. This is something that the government says, but it is not what the government does. The most dramatic recent example of this is in the automotive industry. In the automotive industry there is a history of a strong union movement, a strong employer group and robust negotiations that reach agreements which by and large work for the benefit of both. Where that happens you would have thought it was in the national interest to preserve a system that actually works. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, and this ain't broke, so why intervene?
In the government's recent submission to the Productivity Commission, the government made these observations about the automotive industry. They said that the automotive industry do not apply the government's industrial relations policies. No, and under the act they do not have to. They are free to choose what industrial relations policies they apply in order to get the productivity and cooperation that they want from their work force. But the government object to this and say, `This industry'—if you like, the heartland of Australian manufacturing—`should apply the policies that we as a government are ideologically committed to. So if they don't come into line when we crack the whip and do as we ask we will remove from the automotive companies in Australia'—these are Toyota, General Motors Holden, Ford and Mitsubishi—`contributions we make on an industry policy basis to encourage those companies to export and other commitments we make that encourage those companies to engage in research and development and other issues to make them more competitive.'
In other words, the government are so barefaced about their ideological agenda in industrial relations that they can threaten a major employer body that is the heartland of Australian manufacturing: `Comply with our ideological agenda. Change your ways or we will bring your industry down and render it less competitive, and then you will be out of business.' This is not something that has achieved very much notoriety in recent weeks, but this is a total outrage, this is a threat to bring a manufacturing sector to its knees unless the ideological agenda of the government is adhered to. This is a very good reason why this chamber should say to the government: `Enough is enough. No more.' The principles upon which we want to see industrial relations conducted in this country involve a fair and level playing field in which working people that want to protect their rights and choose to be union members can do so with dignity and respect and can conduct their affairs honourably, and employers should be able to do the same. There should not be one set of rules for one lot and another set of rules to make victims of the other lot. (Time expired)
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-08-21,"—Mr Acting Deputy President Forshaw, may I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your position. I would also take this opportunity to congratulate Senator Nettle on a brilliant first speech. There were some things in her contribution that I would obviously not accept, such as that the Labor Party is self-interested and profit motivated, but I think there are many areas of common interest that we can share and look forward to. May I also say that I find it hard to imagine our Prime Minister, Mr Howard, swaggering. I think some elements of the content of Senator Nettle's speech lead us to the current debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002, in which we are addressing what I would characterise as the Howard government's latest industrial relations stunt which, in my view, is quite principled to the issue of the harmony of one of our most important democratic institutions— that is, Industrial Relations Commission and our industrial relations system.
I go further than the contribution made earlier this morning by Senator Cook in relation to the motive for this legislation. He indicated that the motive seems to be to encourage a proliferation of `free-riders'. I would take it one step further and argue that the motivation is in fact to sabotage our industrial relations system. There are many reasons I can highlight to justify that case. While many of my colleagues have raised a number of issues about this bill in its current form, I think it is important to put the bill in its context and history, even in the sense of where we have come to today in considering this legislation in the parliament. In a more general sense it is no surprise that we are starting this parliamentary sitting in this way. Throughout the term of the Howard government we have had one stunt after another— firstly under then Minister Reith, and now we have the same pattern of behaviour under Minister Abbott. They are ongoing attacks.
—Onthe union bosses.
—They are ongoing attacks not on union bosses, as Senator Kemp seems to be arguing, but on having a viable industrial relations system. Senator Kemp understands this, and in fact he is arguing my case for me because he would be a supporter of the H.R. Nicholls Society, whose views are that we should not have an industrial relations system. So, really, the government is seeking to destroy our system by stealth. What is that stealth? This stealth starts with the very title of the bill: the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002. As Senator Cook said not long ago, nowhere in the bill do we talk about union fees. The bill is actually about bargaining fees. It does not address compulsory union fees and it is not, as the government seeks to argue, about the principal issue here: it is not about compulsory unionism. I think I should go back to when the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee addressed this bill during an inquiry— 
Honourable senators interjecting—
 (Senator Forshaw)—Excuse me, Senator Collins, please be seated for a moment. Would honourable senators on my right please keep quiet. It is disorderly to be constantly talking at such a loud volume and interrupting a speaker.
—I was saying a moment ago that it is important to go back and look at the report produced by the committee that inquired into this bill during the last parliament. I understand that there has not been an inquiry into the bill in its current form, and over the last couple of days I have found it difficult to trace some of the changes that appear in this current bill as opposed to the bill that was considered by the committee on the last occasion. As I mentioned a moment ago, some of the issues that are relevant here go to stealth and I will get back to that in a moment. In the broader context, I would like to take the Senate to the opening comments in the Labor senators' dissenting report on this bill, where we highlight that this particular report was the sixth report made by this committee in the last parliament on proposed amendments to the Workplace Relations Act. We state: 
The view of Labor senators in regard to this bill is consistent with earlier dissenting reports. The legislation currently before the Parliament is yet another attempt to marginalise union involvement in workplace relations and in negotiations on wages and conditions to the point of irrelevancy.
Senator Kemp seeks to say no, we are just bringing down big union bosses, but anyone who understands the day-to-day mechanics of how our bargaining system operates would understand the free-rider principle and understands that if we want to have a sustainable bargaining system this is a matter we need to address seriously. On that point, following the report of the dissenting Labor senators was a report by the Australian Democrats that equally understood very clearly those very issues. I understand that some amendments have been circulated by the Democrats that seek, essentially, to do that: to deal with this matter in a legitimate way to try to ensure that we can address the free-rider issue so that, unlike the government's intention, we will not have a proliferation of free-riders in the bargaining system that we have moved towards.
One area in which Senator Kemp and I would agree is that in Australia in industrial relations we have moved down the path of bargaining. It was a step made by the Labor government at the time, and it was followed further by the current government. We can have arguments about the extent to which we have travelled down the path and about several quite inappropriate and misdirected measures that I would argue this current government has sought to take. However, the point remains that Australia has moved towards a bargaining system but, in making that movement, we have not dealt with some other systemic problems that this bill does not seriously address.
For the government to argue that what we are really dealing with here is compulsory union fees or compulsory unionism is, to pick up Senator Cook's phrase, mean and tricky. I thought he was actually referring to the conduct of Mr Reith and the pattern of behaviour he had established as minister. At the time I continually referred to Mr Reith as the `Minister for Misinformation'. But, as Senator Cook highlighted, the problems go much higher than that. The Liberal Party itself acknowledges that the problem is that we no longer have `Honest John'. Do senators actually recall the stage in time in our political history when media and others referred to our Prime Minister as `Honest John'? I cannot recall the last time I heard that reference. As Senator Cook said, this is another example of `mean and tricky'. 
The other evidence for the government's real agenda is easily highlighted—that is, in the first bill the government simply went too far. I am pleased to see that that has been acknowledged, very quietly, in the current version of the bill. The problem highlighted by Labor senators in their dissenting report on the last occasion seems to have quietly slid away in this current bill. In fact, I am disappointed that Mr Smythe from the department is not present so that I could clarify for the Senate exactly when, why and how these concerns were addressed and rectified. The fact that the government had gone too far is an example of what we have highlighted as `mean and tricky'. The government had gone beyond its stated intent with this bill. It had designed a bill that, in relation to bargaining fees, would have precluded new employees from voluntarily contributing to the cost of a union negotiated agreement. It did this through the very strange argument that new employees could not pay such fees as it was impossible for them to consent to services that were delivered before they started with their employer.
When we raised this in committee with the department, the response at that point in time was quite astounding. Let me take senators to the area in our report where this issue is highlighted. Labor senators noted that the problem with the definition of bargaining services in the bill was that, on our reading, it would preclude new employees from voluntarily contributing to the cost of a union negotiated agreement by requiring consent prior to the negotiation occurring. This was rejected by the department. On that occasion, Mr Smythe said:
... this bill does not prohibit a new employee from making a contribution to the union if they wish to; it simply precludes that contribution from being characterised as a service fee because the government believes that, in those circumstances, it is not a service fee.
So, if an employer and workers want to characterise something in their agreement as a service fee and if they want to allow new employees who enter into that agreement under requirements in the act to make a contribution voluntarily to that fee, this would be precluded by the way this bill was first drafted. Mr Smythe said:
... the government's position is that because at the time the negotiation occurred the new employee was not there and therefore could not be consulted about or have any input into that negotiation, no services could be provided to them. The difference between us, Senator—
Mr Smythe suggests—
—is that you equate the services with the outcome whereas what I am doing is equating the services with the process.
The point here is that the government had contained the notion of what a bargaining service fee might relate to to just the narrow issue of the process of the actual negotiation of the agreement. It became illogical to the stage where, through this provision, the government was going to preclude a new employee from joining into an agreement and voluntarily seeking to make a contribution with respect to how that agreement had been bargained because they were not there at the time. I highlighted that point by saying:
An extension of this argument, if applied to other areas of economic activity, would preclude the likes of road tolls, building levies or any other usage charge associated with the creation of infrastructure. One possible perverse outcome of this logic, if followed to its natural conclusion, would be that, by simply renaming a bargaining fee an outcome fee, union parties to an agreement would still be able to recover compensation from non-union members for negotiating an agreement. Regardless, though, the scope for legal wrangling to resolve these issues was great.
From the current definition in the bill it looks as if the government has taken note of those comments and has redefined the bargaining service fee to provide for those requirements. I look forward to hearing more on that issue, because I have been trying to trace when and where that amendment was made and I have not got to the bottom of that aspect of the situation. I look forward to that being dealt with, hopefully in the committee stage of this debate.
Getting back to my central point, this requirement that new workers coming under an enterprise agreement would be precluded from even consensually contributing a bargaining fee was an example of the fact that, in drafting this bill, the government was going beyond its stated intent. It was going to be proscribing behaviour that everybody would agree was acceptable, because its real agenda was to encourage the proliferation of free-riders and, going one step further, to practise sabotage of the industrial relations system. That problem was highlighted. When I get to the bottom of how these changes were made, hopefully it was because the government was embarrassed and rectified that error. Still, the fundamental agenda of trying to proscribe employers and unions from establishing bargained service fees in their agreements remains. 
Most of the other issues and problems that we highlighted in our report and that many other senators have mentioned today also remain. For example, we described it as `pre-emptive and knee-jerk'. Despite the fact that we now have a commission decision on this matter, the legislation being here before us now is still jumping ahead of the judicial process. I understand that an appeal has been lodged with the High Court in relation to the earlier decision that would have allowed bargaining service fees to continue to be accepted as a valid component of an enterprise agreement. Since an appeal has been filed, we should be waiting on the result of that process. I do not see the immediacy or the urgency of this issue. I can think of countless other matters on our legislative agenda that require serious and immediate attention. We have a process to deal with the legality of this issue and we are once again being pre-emptive. Why are we being pre-emptive? We are being pre-emptive because the government has a broader agenda. The mean and tricky side of this is that it is just one component of a much broader, larger agenda to sabotage the industrial relations system. Senator Kemp said earlier, `No, it is to pick on those big union bosses.' No, it is about sabotage of our industrial relations system. People such as Senator Cook and others, who understand the International Labour Organisation's approach to this issue and many others and many of the challenges that have occurred in relation to this government's agenda in industrial relations, understand that issue.
Perhaps you might be able to accept that there were some components of the reform package that had some validity if you did not understand that the agenda of many of the members of the government and their associations with the H.R. Nicholls Society is to dismember, to dismantle, the industrial relations system. This is but one cog in that overall machinery. In the case of this legislation, it helps if senators, and particularly new senators, understand that we have a new trend to find very creative titles for legislation. A new senator looking at this legislation would see the title, open the bill and say, `Where is a compulsory union fee? Where is a definition of a compulsory union fee?' There is not one, because that is not what it is really about. Titles such as `A fair go all round', `More jobs, better pay' and the title of this one very rarely properly relate to the content of the bill.
The other evidence for my assertion here about the real intention is that the bill is riddled with inconsistencies with respect to what the government purports to be its agenda. Take its agenda about freedom of association, for instance. If the government were serious about freedom of association, then—as Senator Cook highlighted—there would be no reason for it seeking to intrude into the relationship between the employer and the employees in relation to an enterprise agreement. But it is doing that and it is doing that because its agenda is really elsewhere.
Let me conclude by highlighting the relevance of our conclusion last time we addressed this bill in committee:
It is the opinion of Labor senators that the proposed bill is inconsistent with the spirit of the WRA. It seeks to close loopholes which may not exist and is biased on the very shaky grounds of violation of the principle of freedom of association. As knee-jerk legislation, it is highly vulnerable to being struck down by the courts and as such represents not only a waste of taxpayers money, but also brings regulation of workplace relations further into disrepute. 
That remains the case now.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-08-21,"—We have had a pretty exhaustive debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002 and the battlelines are drawn, but let me just underline the principles. If there is one area in which you will never modernise, it is this. We very much appreciate that, I might say. For as long as you continue to be wholly owned subsidiaries, then I think the Australian public— 
—Of the Law Society, Richard?
—That is only for solicitors, Nick. They did not trouble me.
—Of the H.R. Nicholls Society? Are you a member of H.R. Nicholls?
—No, I am not. The principles of freedom of choice and association of course underpin the freedom of association provisions of the act. The principles seek to ensure that individual employers and employees are free from discrimination and victimisation, irrespective of the choice they make. This bill reflects the government's continuing commitment to the principles of freedom of association by ensuring that workers are not coerced, either directly or indirectly, into joining industry associations. 
For the record, I should address a number of the criticisms made. The first was that the commission has allowed such fees. It has been argued that the legitimacy of compulsory fees is demonstrated by the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission to allow bargaining services fee clauses to remain in certified agreements. The decision in question, however, does not address the appropriateness of compulsory fee clauses. The decision was based on the technical meaning of an objectionable provision as defined in the act. In fact, as part of the same decision, the commission accepted that such clauses have a coercive intent. 
The second criticism was that the title of the bill is misleading. The bill, in fact, applies equally to fees imposed by employer associations and by unions. This reflects the structure of the freedom of association provisions more generally. The title of the bill, however, reflects the catalyst for its introduction, which was the campaign by unions seeking to include bargaining fee clauses in agreements. In other words, the title of the bill spotlights the origins of the need for this legislation.
Another argument that has been put forward is that the bill is trying to create the impression that unions are imposing fees against the will of employees—although an agreement cannot be certified unless a valid majority of employees to be covered by the agreement vote in favour of it. It would be inconsistent with the principles underlying the Workplace Relations Act to allow individual freedom of association rights to be overridden by a majority vote. Under the act, every individual has the right to choose whether or not to join a union and cannot be penalised for the choice they make. The act already gives necessary protection to this right, preventing the commission from certifying an agreement that contains provisions which are discriminatory or contravene the freedom of association principles, even if a valid majority has voted for the agreement. The bill appropriately extends that principle.
Will the bill allow voluntary contributions? Despite the views expressed by some, this bill will not prevent an industrial association and a nonmember from entering into agreements and arrangements for the provision of bargaining services, provided no coercion or misrepresentation is involved. Nor will it stop any nonmember from offering a voluntary contribution for bargaining services, provided there is no coercion or misrepresentation. Are CUF clauses inconsistent with the ILO standards on freedom of association? Critics of the bill argue that compulsory bargaining service fee clauses are in line with ILO standards, but this is not the whole story. The ILO also accepts that prohibition of bargaining service fees is consistent with its principles. Paragraph 323 of the ILO's freedom of association digest states:
Problems related to union security clauses should be resolved at the national level, in conformity with national practice and the industrial relations system in each country. In other words, both situations where union security clauses are authorized and those where these are prohibited can be considered to be in conformity with ILO principles and standards on freedom of association. 
In addition, paragraph 100 of the ILO's 1994 general survey on freedom of association relevantly states:
... systems which prohibit union security practices in order to guarantee the right not to join an organization, as well as systems which authorize such practices, are compatible with the Convention.
An attempted justification for compulsory union fees is that they are in accordance with the familiar user-pays principle. This argument is a distortion of that principle. Compulsory fees for an unsolicited and often unsubstantiated service do not constitute user pays. User pays involves an exchange that is freely entered into by willing and properly informed parties. Trade practices legislation prevents ordinary businesses from providing someone with an unrequested service and then demanding payment for it. The same principle should apply to union and employer associations. It has also been asserted that, because nonmembers receive the benefit of certified agreements negotiated by unions, they are free-riders who should be required to pay for the service they receive. It is claimed that this is consistent with the government's approach to the provision of services in accordance with mutual obligation principles. Such arguments fail to recognise the key difference, which is that people to whom the government applies mutual obligation asked for the benefit.
In conclusion, bargaining service fees create a financial incentive for employees to join unions and may act to coerce individuals to take out or retain union membership. Such clauses in certified agreements clearly represent a serious threat to freedom of association and freedom of choice. The bill will protect those fundamental rights. I thank all senators for their contribution and urge them to support the bill.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PROHIBITION OF COMPULSORY UNION FEES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-08-21,"—The opposition do not support the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. Not only do we not support the bill; we go further and say that we think it is a disgrace that this bill is even before the parliament. The stated purpose of this bill is to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 so that the agent of the Liberal Party's federal secretariat can determine the distribution of public funding between the federal secretariat and the state and territory divisions of the Liberal Party.
The real purpose of this bill is far more sinister, far sleazier and much more about the internal power struggles within the Liberal Party than the glib words of the government reveal. This bill is really about the Liberal Party federal secretariat's desperate dash for cash and the fact that the federal office of the Liberal Party does not have any faith in its state divisions. It cannot trust any of the state divisions. In particular it does not trust its Queensland division. I suppose that is something, as Senator Brandis would acknowledge, we would all understand. Let me make it absolutely clear to the chamber that this bill specifically addresses Liberal Party matters, Liberal Party internal affairs. It imposes on the Liberal Party a resolution to its incessant internal bickering about the disbursement of public funding within their party. This bill has nothing whatsoever to do with anything other than the Liberal Party or anyone else other than Liberal Party members.
The bill is very instructive about how the Liberal Party manages its internal disputes and what it thinks this parliament is really for. Clearly it cannot manage any internal disputes. Clearly the Liberal Party thinks the parliament is here to serve the Liberal Party rather than vice versa. You would hope that the Liberal Party would believe that its obligations were to serve the parliament. What will we have next? If a Liberal Party minister is having a family dispute, would there be an attempt to amend the Family Law Act to bind the person's spouse by name? Or if someone like a John Moore or a Warwick Parer were involved in a corporate dispute, would the Liberal Party try to swing an amendment to the Corporations Law, telling a private company how to run its internal affairs?
This bill is exactly the same in its intent and nature. By this legislation, Mr Howard and Mr Lynton Crosby of the Liberal Party are debauching the role of the parliament, and it is a disgrace. The Liberal Party is using the federal parliament to sort out its own internal problems. Mr Howard is saying to the Labor Party, to the Democrats and to other parties in the Senate, `We want your votes—
 (Senator Watson)—Order! I think you made an unparliamentary remark against the Prime Minister when you referred to Mr Howard and Mr Crosby, or Mr Crosby and Mr Howard.
—I did not make any unparliamentary remarks. What were they, Mr Acting Deputy President?
—I understood there was a comment in relation to debauchery in which you linked the two names. You can name people outside the parliament but you cannot name the Prime Minister. If you named the Prime Minister, I ask you to withdraw it; if you did not, I am in error.
—I do not think I made an unparliamentary remark but let us be absolutely clear: Mr Lynton Crosby is debauching the role of parliament. I will also make it very clear a little later on as to what Mr Howard is up to. What Mr Howard is actually saying—
—I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. You requested Senator Faulkner, the leader of the Labor Party in this place, to withdraw a comment. He has his speech right in front of him. It would be very easy for him to go through his notes and determine whether or not he read out the words that you assert. If he did, they ought be withdrawn.
—I have indicated, Mr Acting Deputy President, what my approach to this is. You do not even know what I said.
—I do, yes.
—What did I say?
—You linked the two names together.
—With the word debauchery—you know that.
—I do not think I have said anything unparliamentary, Mr Acting Deputy President, as I have indicated to you. But if I have said anything unparliamentary, again I say I withdraw it. I have said that twice now.
—I will accept that.
—Do you want me to say it three times?
—No, I will accept that.
—Thank you. As I was saying, what Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, is saying to people in this chamber is for us to see if we can use our best efforts to get the Liberal Party's act into gear. The fact is that Mr Howard and Mr Crosby need this bill, because the Liberal Party is in deep organisational trouble. There are so many manifestations of these sorts of problems right around the country. The Liberal Party leadership have basically given up trying to fix anything using their own internal mechanisms. You have all the Liberal Party state divisions in disrepair. As reported on Crikey.com in 1995, Mr Howard's Liberal Party at that time held six state and territory governments and 332 supporting MPs. In 2002, as we speak now, this has shrunk to zero state and territory governments and just 220 MPs. They are interesting statistics: more than one in three conservative MPs in state and territory governments have disappeared since January 1995.
Around the country the Liberal Party in its state and territory divisions is in complete disarray. In Queensland we have the Caltabiano and Quinn factions at each other's throats. The Australian reported last week that the Queensland Liberal Party executive considered 800 new membership applications on Friday 2 August: 500 were recruited by the Caltabiano faction and 300 were recruited by the hapless state leader, Mr Bob Quinn. Very embarrassingly for Mr Quinn, it turns out that he was calling for reforms to wipe out branch stacking while he was actually engaged in branch stacking himself. Mr Quinn should practise what he preaches. We acknowledge that branch stacking is a curse for any political party, but Mr Crosby is doing nothing about it. He is laughing off the Queensland branch stacking as recruitment.
—Why don't you study the Hawke-Wran era!
—I suppose that you could compare the problems of Queensland with those of Tasmania, which Senator Abetz is not only well aware of but also largely responsible for. We have the swift exit of Senator Abetz's mate Mr Cheek and his deputy as well in the recent state election. That has led Mr Crosby to accuse the Tasmanian branch of the Liberal Party of cannibalism. Frankly, you would want an official taster if you practise cannibalism in the Liberal Party. Look at the report from Mr Crosby on the performance of the Liberal Party in the 2002 Tasmanian election. He made 92 recommendations to reform the branch. I suspect there are not even 92 members left in the Liberal Party in Tasmania.
—Keep your daytime job!
—Senator Abetz, who is interjecting, has basically applied the Draino to anyone at all down there who has a whiff of moderation about them. They have all been rubbed out and removed. The report was presented by Mr Crosby and a copy of it has been provided to us. We appreciate that. 
—It's been publicly released!
—Thank you. That is right—we appreciate it. It reads like an autopsy of a dying political carcass. You are responsible for it, Senator Abetz. It is so damning of you, of the Liberal Party's Tasmanian division and of those who lead it.
—No it's not—not at all. You haven't read it!
—I have, actually. Let me quote from it. On page 4 it says:
The result was not simply the culmination of an ill-judged election campaign; rather it reflected entrenched structural problems, poor decisions and a deficient organisation which dated back years.
I will read another quote:
The general feeling of party members is that the election result was regrettably inevitable—the product in part of flawed processes which were themselves a product of a flawed culture.
On page 11, Mr Crosby bemoans the anarchic approach within the Tasmanian division of the Liberal Party and the `culture of self-interest that permeates the division'. On page 15 of this report, commenting on the Tasmanian Liberal Party's strategy, Mr Crosby states the same conclusion that many Tasmanians appear to have reached, which was that `there was no real Liberal campaign strategy'. That was followed by an absolute gem of campaigning advice—that `policies don't win elections'. On page 23, in what is perhaps a piece of personal advice to poor old Senator Abetz, Mr Crosby states:
The Tasmanian Liberal Party must take the middle course on policy and not be seen to be driven by ideology at the expense of relevance.
On page 25 of the report, Mr Crosby states the obvious:
There has been a consistent chorus since the election that most voters did not know what the Tasmanian Liberals stood for. And people add, when voters found out, they did not like what they saw.
Mr Acting Deputy President, you would know about what was happening in Tasmania.
As if that was not enough, retribution is on the way in the Western Australian Liberal Party division following Mr Keirath's failed challenge for party president. The faction that was run by that old hand and master puppeteer Mr Noel Crichton-Browne is mobilising for another grudge match over there. We hear that a lot of membership driving is happening in the southern suburbs of Perth. So it is business as usual in the Western Australian division of the Liberal Party.
I do not want to mention the Victorian division of the Liberal Party, of course, because that has suffered yet another unedifying leadership spill. The Herald Sun of 12 August reported that the top end of town in Melbourne were unhappy with Dr Napthine and, importantly, that the donations were drying up. The fundraising bodies in the Liberal Party—and you have to understand that that is where the real power lies in the Victorian Liberal Party—were talking about bringing Mr Jeff Kennett back from the political dead, according to the Herald Sun. We would have been very pleased. That would have been a masterstroke. Apparently, a member of the Baillieu family—young Ted—offered his seat of Hawthorn to Mr Kennett if he wanted to return to the fold. I thought that was a most magnanimous gesture from young Ted. So much for Ted's constituents—I do not think he cares much about them.
There is real reform going on down there, because yesterday the Victorian Liberal Party churned their leaders once again. They now have Mr Robert Doyle as leader. Mr Kennett was quick to jump on the bandwagon on his radio show. He said this about Mr Doyle:
He is not leadership material now and he is certainly not leadership material in the future. He's been in Parliament a short time. He's terribly ambitious and those who back him inside the Parliament and out must accept responsibility for what I consider to be a gross act of disloyalty so close to an election.
Last night on the 7.30 Report Mr Morris, who is a very close confidant of the Prime Minister, summed up the state of the Liberal Party divisions better than any of us on this side of the chamber could. Let me quote Mr Morris. I do not normally quote him, but on this occasion I will: 
I think at the moment in State Parliament we've got the most boring batch of boofheads you've ever seen. They tend to be lazy and they tend to be lacking in passion and I think it's the batch of people that we have in Parliament.
I do not often agree with him, but on this occasion I think that is wise counsel indeed.
The Liberal Party, like all other political parties in this country, has its internal problems. Fair dinkum political leaders and fair dinkum political parties sort out their own problems. They do the hard yards. They take on the vested interests. They solve their own problems internally without using the parliament to impose some external fix-it mechanism for internal problems. That is certainly the approach that Simon Crean is taking in relation to issues that he sees of concern in the Labor Party. But what is Mr Howard doing? Mr Howard is trying to stitch up a sleazy amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act to try and fix up a problem that he cannot solve internally in the Liberal Party.
This bill has a most innocuous title. It is called the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. That sounds straightforward enough to any person who might read it or hear it, but we have always said that the bill should be retitled and called what it really is: the Liberal Party Central Office Dash for Cash Bill.We have been able to identify and expose what the Liberal Party is on about in this appalling legislation. The Liberal Party is mentioned no fewer than 30 times in the bill. Nearly every paragraph of this bill has the Liberal Party mentioned in it. This bill is for one purpose only: to fix the Liberal Party's internal headaches. The bill has no other purpose at all. It shows how weak the Prime Minister really is when it comes to the crunch within the Liberal Party. It is obvious the Prime Minister does not have sufficient personal authority to solve the problems of the Liberal Party's internal finances. He has to get the parliament to change the Commonwealth Electoral Act to fix the internal finances of the Liberal Party.
It is very instructive indeed about the government's legislative priorities in the area of electoral law to have this bill before us. We recently had a parliamentary committee—the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters—hold an inquiry into electoral funding and disclosure laws. That inquiry was deferred in August 2000 while the government prioritised its discredited inquiry into the integrity of the electoral roll. But the inquiry into electoral funding and disclosure laws was resuscitated in the dying days of the last parliament. At public hearings, all parties agreed that changes to the laws governing other aspects of funding and disclosure are important. The AEC is so concerned over the significant problems of the current electoral funding and disclosure laws that it has made two lengthy submissions to that inquiry on those issues. Submissions have been received from all the political parties. It may come as a shock to the Senate to know that the distribution of the Liberal Party's internal finances has never been raised by the coalition before that committee. It has not been raised by coalition members or senators. It has not been raised by the Liberal Party's federal secretariat in any submission. There has not been one mention of this issue at any of those inquiries before JSCEM over the last 10 years. The Liberal Party has appeared before that committee many, many times. There has never been a squeak out of the Liberal Party on this matter. After all, why would you say it there if you can try and put the fix in in the parliament?
In that context, it is extraordinary that the government could bring forward such a bill for debate in this chamber. There are so many more significant and important electoral funding and disclosure issues that ought to be dealt with by this parliament. With some political will from the government, I believe consensus could be reached on those issues. But the government's prioritisation of its disgraceful piece of legislation over matters such as secret donations and fundraising for political parties by commercial organisations really demonstrates what the priorities of the government are.
This bill has no policy benefits at all. The only beneficiary here is the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party of Australia. They will be benefiting through an improper use of the Australian parliament. As such, I believe this bill should not even be before this chamber. The Commonwealth Electoral Act currently provides that public funding is paid to the agent of the state branch of a party for which the candidate stood. The parliament has provided a mechanism for the Liberal Party, and for every other political party, to sort out how it organises its internal finances. That is absolutely clear. A state branch can lodge a notice with the AEC requesting payments be made to the agent of another party. That is the simple mechanism in the Commonwealth Electoral Act for parties to resolve how public funding is organised. It is up to the parties to sort out how they do that. In the case of the ALP, our national secretariat reached agreement with all the state ALP branches that the national secretariat receives public funding at federal elections. The Liberal Party could do the same thing. Senator Ray offered to provide a stamp so the letter could be sent. I will go further. I think the Liberal Party should accept Senator Ray's offer of a stamp. I will offer to draft the simple letter and provide a draft to you which will mean this legislation does not have to be brought before this parliament, that we do not have to see this abuse of the parliament, that we do not have to see this parliament used for the basest political party advantage that we have ever seen. This bill is a disgrace. It will not be supported by the opposition.

"Senator EGGLESTON,",LP,2002-08-21,"—I would like to talk today about the stunning proposal to develop further trains on the North West Shelf in Karratha and Dampier, and the contract which has recently been signed for Western Australia to provide gas to the Chinese market. This is an enormous achievement for Australia, and it means that we are going to see enormous development on the Burrup Peninsula. This will benefit not only the people of Karratha and Dampier in terms of employment and the development of industry there but the people of Western Australia as a whole and in fact the people of Australia.
The plan to develop North West Shelf gas was first proposed by Sir Charles Court way back in the 1970s and 1980s. The North West Shelf project was originally his concept, and he brought it to fruition. More recently, Richard Court, who was the Premier of Western Australia in the last Liberal government, worked very hard to obtain this contract to provide gas to the Chinese market. In the end the Australian government worked very hard in lobbying the Chinese government to give this first contract for gas to Western Australia. I understand that it seemed the contract was going to go to Indonesia but, because of the enormous lobbying effort by the Prime Minister, John Howard, and his ministers, that decision was changed, and now Australia has the first contract to provide gas to the Chinese market.
That is very important because it is a threshold decision. The Chinese are moving from the use of coal to the use of gas as a means of generating power. They also, of course, use large amounts of oil from the Middle East. It means that the Chinese are sourcing energy for electricity generation from Australia, whose political climate is much more reliable and stable than that of the Middle East. The United States Department of Energy's International energy outlook 2002 has estimated that natural gas consumption in China will increase by 10.1 per cent annually until 2020. The implication of this is that the Chinese market is one of great potential for the further expansion of the Australian liquefied natural gas industry.
The new LNG trade deal with China will create thousands of jobs in the construction phase in the Karratha-Dampier area and will necessitate the construction of a fifth LNG train on the Burrup Peninsula. That is going to involve additional capital expenditure of more than $1 billion over three years. Even before the announcement of this new deal, the North West Shelf venture was going through a major process of expansion. The processing facility on the Burrup Peninsula near Dampier and Karratha currently has three LNG processing trains, and in late 2001 the construction of a fourth train commenced in order to meet further demand for LNG from the Japanese market. This in itself involves capital expenditure of some $1.6 billion, and this new train is scheduled to come on-line in mid-2004. It will have an annual capacity of 4.2 million tonnes of LNG and will be the largest LNG train to have been built anywhere in the world when it is up and running. 
According to Woodside, the operator of the North West Shelf venture, it is expected that the fourth LNG train will add a further $2 billion annually in export revenues for Australia, as well as contribute some $6.7 billion in extra taxes and royalties over the life of the project. The new train will be a showcase of Australian engineering expertise and will provide a lot of opportunities for Australian business. Indeed, according to Manfred Henze, Woodside's general manager of onshore expansion projects:
This is the first time such a plant has been designed and built in its country of origin ... our aim is to develop a world-class project, using Australian engineers, contractors and supporting staff wherever competitive so that we maintain and build the Australian skills base to service the industry in future.
That is a very good thing for Woodside to be doing, because we do need to develop engineering skills in Australia and maintain those skills. What all of this translates to is more jobs both for Western Australia and Australia generally. During its construction phase, the fourth LNG train is expected to directly and indirectly support no less than 9,000 jobs across Australia. In general terms, the North West Shelf venture has been a great Australian success story. It currently supplies about 70 per cent of Western Australia's natural gas needs, as well as supplying LNG to Japan and condensate, crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG, to international markets.
Commercial development of the North West Shelf began in 1980. In 1984, what was then the world's largest capacity offshore gas production platform, North Rankin A, began producing natural gas, initially for use in the domestic market and then later for the Japanese market. From 1989 on, the Japanese market became a recipient of LNG from the North West Shelf, and today the North West Shelf provides gas which is used to generate electricity for some 73 per cent of the Japanese population. As I said, the North West Shelf has contributed markedly to the economic prosperity of Dampier and Karratha, the wider Pilbara region, the state of Western Australia and Australia as a whole. It is a major export earner, bringing annual export revenue of around $3 billion to this country. Overall it has involved capital expenditure of $13.2 billion as of November 2001. More than $9.5 billion has been spent on the purchase of Australian goods and services. The North West Shelf has created no less than 80,000 jobs estimated on the basis of the multiplier effect around Australia and is a source of annual royalty payments to the government of Western Australia and the Commonwealth running into millions of dollars.
The new contract with China and the expansion of the North West Shelf venture is especially good news for Karratha and Dampier but, as I said, it is going to have a broader effect throughout this country. One of the most important things it is going to do is lead to the development of secondary downstream processing. Australia is a great commodity exporting nation. We export many commodities, from agricultural commodities to minerals and gas, but many people feel we really ought to be into secondary downstream processing and developing industries which use our natural resources rather than sending them to other countries. I must say that the Pilbara gas industry looks like being the first really important success story in the development of secondary downstream processing from an Australian commodity.
According to the Pilbara Development Commission, the Pilbara region is on the cusp of an exciting new phase of industrial growth, with existing industries expanding and new ones emerging. At the Pilbara Industry Conference in 2000, Colin Barnett, the Minister for Resources Development in a former state Liberal government, said: 
In the next few years, Karratha will witness the birth of a significant chemical industry based on the downstream processing of natural gas into products such as ammonia, ammonium nitrate, synthetic hydrocarbons, methanol, urea and other petrochemicals. Collectively, these new industries will be much bigger than anything on Australia's eastern seaboard.
So Karratha-Dampier is going to develop into a major industrial area. Some of the companies which are considering the Burrup Peninsula as the site for downstream processing projects include the Syntroleum Corporation, with the Sweetwater gas-to-liquids plant; Burrup Fertilisers Pty Ltd, who are developing an ammonia plant which will annually export around 759,000 tonnes of ammonia to India for the manufacture of fertilisers; the Dampier Nitrogen Project, which involves a group of companies who are considering the construction of a $900 million world-scale ammonia and urea plant on the Burrup; and Japan DME Ltd, who have a dimethyl ether project. Japan DME is a consortium of a number of Japanese corporations, and they are considering the investment of $1 billion to develop a dimethyl ether plant on the Burrup. Another company, Methanex, are developing a methanol plant and are already on the Burrup and proceeding with the early site works for the development of their plant. They will be constructing the world's largest methanol plant and, again, this plant represents an investment of $1 billion. Then there is GTL Resources, who have another methanol project proposed for the Burrup Peninsula. What we are seeing happening in the north-west of Western Australia is secondary downstream processing, which I am sure everybody in the Senate and those listening around Australia will regard as a very worthy outcome. It is time that we stopped just exporting minerals and began secondary downstream processing.
The one thing that I would like to say as a caution, however, is that the Burrup is an area of great heritage significance to the Indigenous people of the north-west. When I was on the board of the Pilbara Development Commission, Harry Butler, who was the chairman at that time, took me to the Burrup Peninsula. There are literally thousands and thousands of Aboriginal rock carvings or petroglyphs on the Burrup, and concern has recently been expressed that, with further development of chemical plants on the Burrup, these rock carvings may be endangered by the effects of chemical emissions. I think that is a legitimate concern, and I hope that consideration will be given to preserving those petroglyphs, preserving and protecting the general amenity of the beaches on the Burrup Peninsula and protecting the people of Karratha from noxious emissions from petrochemical plants.
As it happens, the state government has developed a potential industrial estate, known as the Maitland Estate, about 20 kilometres south of the Burrup on flat land which would need to have a gas pipeline and infrastructure put into it. I think that is the site on which further industrial development on the Burrup Peninsula should go. The site costs of developing plants on the Burrup are very high because it is a very rocky area, but at Maitland there is flat land and, once the initial infrastructure were put in place in terms of roads, electricity, gas pipelines and perhaps the development of new port facilities, there would be endless potential for expanding that site as further petrochemical projects were proposed.
The amount of land free on the Burrup Peninsula for further development is very small and, as I said, there is a potential for endangering the petroglyphs on the Burrup and also, possibly, a danger to the people of Karratha-Dampier from noxious emissions from petrochemical plants. So I do hope that the current Western Australia government will listen carefully to the public views expressed by the people of Karratha that they would prefer to see development placed on the Maitland Estate and not on the Burrup Peninsula.
I recently attended a rally on the Burrup Peninsula, where there was a cross-party group in support of the Maitland Estate being the site for further development. I attended for the Liberal Party, and the group also included the Greens, One Nation and the shire president, who belongs to the ALP. Of course the ALP itself did not support the proposal.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2002-08-21,"—Yesterday, Senator Conroy asked me a question about corporate governance. I seek leave to incorporate the answer to his question in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) has advised that ASIC has asked two listed companies to disclose option values under section 300A of the Corporation Act and both complied with the request. In a third case, the company was required to reissue its directors' report and advise all of its members. 
—Mr President, I raise a point of order. It is in relation to the question that Senator Minchin has answered. It is a technical point and I would like it to be cleared up. Senator Minchin mentioned in the chamber yesterday—and Senator Coonan has mentioned again today—that questions in relation to ASIC are properly directed in this chamber to Senator Coonan. The opposition and other senators, if so informed, are more than happy to deal with that. I respectfully suggest that the list tabled in the chamber by the Leader of the Government in the Senate on 19 August does not reflect that, and it should, if that is the case.
This is a question of making sure that the level of advice given to senators in the chamber is appropriate. This list indicates that the Treasurer, the Hon. Peter Costello, is represented on all matters by the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin. We do not mind, and I am sure other senators do not mind, if there is a change to those arrangements. The only point that I make in relation to the list tabled on 19 August is that, if reflections are going to be cast on senators who ask questions, that tabled document should reflect any chamber arrangements in relation to representational duties. It is a very fair point and I am sure that, on reflection, both Senator Minchin and Senator Coonan would acknowledge that the criticism they made of senators was inappropriate in that circumstance and the tabled documentation should be clarified.
—On the point of order, Mr President: far be it from us to criticise the opposition, but I thought that the arrangements had been made clear to the opposition. If that is not the case, then we are happy to ensure that those arrangements are clarified. In this case, we have in the Senate the minister assisting the Treasurer, Senator Coonan, and the parliamentary secretary assisting the Treasurer, Senator Campbell. I am here as Minister for Finance and Administration representing the Treasurer on all things that are not the responsibility of Senator Coonan and Senator Campbell. We will clarify that for the sake of the opposition.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-08-21,"—I notice a recommendation in the Selection of Bills Committee report is that `the provisions of the following bills be referred immediately to committees'. The Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 is to be referred to the Community Affairs Committee and the reporting date is 24 October 2002. I think it is important on a major piece of legislation like this which goes to the heart of society that there should be a thorough examination of the provisions of the legislation. If we are going to have a conscience vote on this matter, surely it would be helpful if we had an informed conscience and we were able to see the evidence that was coming in to us and what recommendations might be made by the committee. It is 18 years since a Senate select committee on a similar topic was established. That was on the human embryo experimentation bill. Some very interesting things came out of that examination. I feel that we should have waited until we had the bill before us before referring it to a committee, but if it gives a little more time to us or to the people who may wish to examine that particular matter and give the committee submissions—I am not a member of the committee, though I am a participating member of all committees—then so be it. 
—We all are participating members.
—Yes, that is true. I have had a look at what was said in the House of Representatives. It is a pity that the information is not coming through to them. I want to highlight one aspect of the discussion last night where the member for Leichhardt, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, was talking about a person who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and was under the care of an imminent Australian Alzheimer's researcher, Professor Colin Masters. Mr Entsch went on at the end of that to say:
Alzheimer's will eventually kill him—
that is, the patient—
Tom's only hope for a full recovery lies with further research into embryonic stem cells.
I suggest that honourable senators look at that and see whether there is an implication that somehow or other Alzheimer's will be cured by stem cell research. Have a look at what Professor Colin Masters, a neuroscientist at the University of Melbourne, says. He compared the idea of putting a bunch of cells into someone's brain to cure Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease to 1930s experiments in which the testicles of a bull and monkey were injected into people with the aim of stopping ageing. And this is from an Alzheimer's expert! You also had Professor Rathjen saying: `It is ... nonsense that stem cells might be able to cure Alzheimer's.' We do not even know the cause of Alzheimer's, yet almost every speaker in the House of Representatives was promoting this idea. We need to look at the truth and to get the truth. Though somewhat reluctantly at this particular juncture, I support the recommendation of the Selection of Bills Committee.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-08-21,"—by leave—I refer to the order of the Senate of 20 August directing the tabling of two documents relating to live cattle exports. The first document sought under the order—moved successfully by Senator Bartlett from the Australian Democrats—is a livestock officer's report for the Jordanian vessel the Maysora, which, it was claimed, departed Australia on 28 February 2001. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has advised that no Jordanian flagged vessel named the Maysora travelled from Australia on 28 February 2001. It may help the Senate to know that a Bahamas registered vessel—the Maysora—arrived in Jordan on 28 February 2001.
Any livestock officer's report is a private document provided to Livecorp, the body which oversees Australia's live export industry. The report is not provided to the government; therefore, the government is unable to provide the document to the Senate. If the Senate would like a copy of the report it will have to make an approach to Livecorp. The second document sought is the master's report for the Maysora. The minister is unable to agree to the publication of the master's report from that voyage. It includes commercial information which he is advised could unreasonably damage the vessel owners' business if disclosed.",SENATE,<title>TRADE: LIVE CATTLE EXPORTS</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-08-21,"—Mr Deputy President, I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your elevation to that position and to thank you on behalf of all of us on this side who are looking forward to your hospitality, which we understand you are freely offering. 
—Sooner rather than later.
—Yes. This matter of corporate governance is a very serious issue. Given the high number of Australians who now own shares either directly or indirectly through their super fund, it is essential that we get it right. This government has for too long not got it right. The government faces a conflict of interest and has shown itself unwilling to act against its mates at the big end of town. It has concentrated on the wrong priorities—unfairly punishing families who incur family payment debt even when they properly inform Centrelink of changes in circumstances—and not on protecting Australian retirement incomes. 
This government and its Prime Minister have introduced mutual obligations for certain social security recipients and promised to penalise those who breach those obligations. The Prime Minister certainly has not said he will be relying on self-regulation for those that are beneficiaries of the abuses to show a willingness to play their part. No, he sets a different standard for those entrusted with the very serious obligations to investors, employees and business creditors—and that is not right and it is not fair. The Chairman of ASIC spoke recently of the need not to be complacent about corporate governance. He said:
What we underestimated, I think, was some quite pernicious and endemic factors at play—a new outbreak of management greed, the failure of boards to put a brake on excessive and structurally unsound remuneration practices and the many commercial pressures that influence management and boards to focus on short-term pay-offs.
John Howard's message to Australians is: greed is good. He just wants to stand back. In the face of that stinging attack on corporate ethics and corporate behaviour in the last few years, the Prime Minister stands there and says, `She'll be right; no problems; greed is good.' This government has refused to acknowledge these factors and it has put at risk the retirement savings of ordinary Australians.
On a number of occasions, ASIC officers have spoken of key corporate governance failures by some Australian companies. These have included: a dominant director having undue control over the company's affairs; non-executive directors failing to carry out diligently their duty to ensure that directors and management are accountable; senior executives not reporting improper behaviour; ineffective internal controls; auditors not maintaining an independent outlook; inadequate reporting to shareholders of company strategies; and the use of optimistic and aggressive accounting treatments which can disguise the true performance of the business. These are failures identified by ASIC in various investigations. They are real; they are happening in this country, not in the US. We have seen some of these corporate governance failures in the recent high-profile corporate collapses. These collapses have had serious consequences for the shareholders, employees and creditors of these companies. In the US, we have seen the repercussions of a loss of confidence in the market. We need to avoid that here in Australia. This requires that we act now.
Australia is not without problems and it is unwise to pretend that this is not the case. For example, an ASIC study on auditor independence released earlier this year found that the provision of non-audit services by audit firms to their Australian clients is widespread, at least in respect of major corporates. Audit firms are earning substantial fees for non-audit services. Processes for dealing with potential conflicts of interest require attention. The rotation of audit partners remains inconsistent and the rotation of firms is almost non-existent. We are also aware that ASIC has forced restatements in company accounts of more than $3 billion over the last three to four years. The government may assert, like they have in relation to the number of people who face criminal sanctions, that this is evidence of the effectiveness of our law and of the regulator. However, it is also evidence of the existence of the problems in corporate governance that this is being allowed to happen in the first place. 
Another issue frequently raised is that of executive remuneration. The Prime Minister has refused to act on this issue. When you get him on talk-back radio and people call in, Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, is all sympathy to them. He is prepared to say, `Oh yes, look, it's quite worrying. The corporates have got to have a good look in the mirror and, if they don't do something, I'll do something soon.' When he was questioned recently about the $13.2 million payment to George Trumble at AMP, the Prime Minister said, `It's indefensible. That is a matter—I don't control that and I don't want to control that.' So what is it? Just empty platitudes once again. This is despite findings by the Australian Financial Review, in its survey last year on executive remuneration, showing that the salaries of Australia's top chief executives rose by 13.4 per cent in 2001, despite slowing corporate profit growth and shares going down. That is not to even talk about the options, which I will come to. It was the same period in which superannuation fund members were being told they should be happy if their fund managed a positive rate of return.
Organisations like the Australian Shareholders Association have been campaigning on the issue of executive remuneration for years. Unfortunately, they are finding that too many corporates will not tell them the full details of executive remuneration and too many remuneration packages are issuing options with performance hurdles that encourage mediocrity. The ASA also talks about companies lowering exercise prices for options, often in cases where the company has manifestly failed to perform. That is right—believe it or not, they do not want just one bite of the cherry by getting options with almost no hurdles; even when they fail the pitiful options, some of them come sneaking back to the boards and try and get the boards to agree to reprice them and take away the pitiful options that they had in the first place. That is unacceptable.
I have also spoken on questions regarding broker independence, which is something this government has just discovered, despite my raising it in this chamber over one year ago. There has been no word on this from the government in the last few years, until the last month or so from Senator Campbell, who, to give him his due, is someone who does follow these issues. Investors rely heavily on broker reports to make their investment decisions. They need to be assured that the advice contained in those reports is accurate and has not been biased because of the work being done in other sections of the financial institution for which the broker works. 
The problem in Australia has not been quantified but there is anecdotal evidence to support these suspicions. These are global companies with global cultures. To dismiss what has gone on in the US on Wall Street as a US aberration, when all the practices that those firms have employed are here, is not good enough. There is the story of one analyst, who made an accurate, but unpopular, sell recommendation on one of Australia's largest bluechip companies, being driven out of the research industry after being ostracised by the company. There are other reports of firms, having tendered for or obtained corporate advisory work, producing favourable broker reports. This is happening here in Australia and it has to be addressed.
The government have been lax. What have the government done on these issues? What are they doing to protect ordinary investors? They have avoided doing anything where possible, when they could have conducted a review. I am sure that when Senator Campbell follows me in this debate you will hear him talking about more reviews. Senator Minchin yesterday, in question time, was quick to ensure that he was not required to answer questions on corporate governance, despite representing the Treasurer. Senator Coonan went for the review option yesterday: `It will all be revealed in a discussion paper—CLERP 9—to be released later this month.' She parroted Senator Campbell—he slipped her a note and she read it out dutifully. It was good to see, but we will have the actual organ grinder rather than the monkey today. 
The Treasurer and the Prime Minister are quick to say that more regulation is not needed. That is the Prime Minister: `I don't want to burden those hardworking executives; we don't want any more regulation.' Labor says: now is not the time for less regulation; instead, we need strong and effective regulation to protect Australian investors. But we should take a closer look at what this government has done in a number of relevant areas. Firstly, there is executive remuneration. In 1998, Labor moved an amendment to the Corporations Act to require the disclosure of the detail of executive remuneration in a company's annual report. The government clearly did not want this amendment. They clearly did not want transparency in the arrangements surrounding executive remuneration. In relation to that amendment, Senator Campbell, who had carriage of the bill in this chamber—the same Senator Campbell who will be following me in this debate—said: `We will be not supporting the Labor amendments.' His preference—wait for it!—was for a committee of review, to review and then not act. Begrudgingly, he then offered not to oppose the amendments when, with the help of Senator Murray, the numbers were clearly here in the chamber. Senator Murray will remember that debate, I am sure. Labor has always worked very closely on these issues with Senator Murray, and he deserves credit for that.
This was an amendment to empower shareholders, and the best the government would do was to not oppose it. They have continued to not oppose it by ignoring the level of noncompliance with its requirements. Thanks to research commissioned by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, we now know that 52 per cent of the top 100 listed companies that issue options to executives do not fully disclose the details of executive remuneration. They refuse to disclose the value of the options, despite an amendment in 1998 requiring them to. What did the Treasurer say yesterday when he was asked about this? The Treasurer said, `Refer to me any information of any company that is not complying with Corporations Law.' We whipped out a few names for him today. We referred him to the 52 per cent of companies. We took him through a few names and what did he say? He said that, oh no, it was not his job to refer anything to ASIC. We asked him to refer it to ASIC, to direct ASIC to investigate these breaches of the Corporations Law—and what was the Treasurer's response? He took a hands-off approach as usual, missing in action.
ASIC, for which the Treasurer is the responsible minister, has said that it cannot enforce this provision. That is a very important thing, because it is waiting—and this is what it said in answer to questions at Senate estimates—for the government to clarify the provisions. Senator Murray, when we moved it, you and I thought it was pretty basic, pretty straightforward and pretty clear; but the corporate sector all of a sudden found that they could not understand it, and they have told ASIC they do not understand it. The government knows what needs to be done, because in 1999 the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities recommended the necessary changes. Even government members accepted the arguments of Senator Murray and me, saying, `Yes, if there is uncertainty, this is what the government should do to clear it up.' On 6 February 2001—yes, that is two years later, for anybody who did not do the maths—the government tabled its response to this committee's report, accepting the committee's recommendations. So even the government was shamed into accepting the committee's recommendations. But what has happened in the 18 months since? Nothing—only more reviews. Senator Campbell will talk about more reviews. The government does not want the disclosure of executive remuneration. Let us be clear about this. It does not want to bring sunlight into the cosy deals done, whereby executives are paid huge packages without any reference to their performance or that of the company. But the shareholders pay these packages. It is their money which has been expended, and too often they are not told about it.
I was lucky enough last week to attend the speech of Sir David Tweedie, the head of the International Accounting Standards Board, in Sydney. He is in charge of implementing international accounting standards across most of the world, bar the US, in the next few years. He said, `The time has come.' `We all know,' he said to a room full of accountants, `that these options are an expense to the company, and we have voted 13-0 to expense options.' They will be releasing a draft standard. It was voted 13-0 to make this happen. Unfortunately, it is not going to happen here until 2005. 
—Rubbish!
—Then you stand up in the debate and say that you will introduce legislation and make it mandatory straightaway.
—I say I won't do that, for good reason.
—What did David Tweedie go on to say? He said, `Look, I have companies coming to me and saying, “What are you doing? Why are you doing this?” He said, `It happens to be the fact of the matter.' They said, `But you can't do that!' and he said, `Why not?' David Tweedie, the head of the International Accounting Standards Board, said, `Do you know what they say to me? They say, “If we told shareholders the value of these options they would never agree to them.”' And he said, `That is exactly why we are going to do it.' At least somebody in this debate around the world is being honest. At least some companies are taking the lead in the US. In the US, we have seen some of the biggest companies in the world finally fess up to this—and what does this government do? It sits there and says, `Oh no, we can wait until 2005; it'll be fine.' In relation to Macquarie Bank, it says, `Yes, we agree they're an expense and, yes, they should be expensed but we're not going to until we are made to.' Make them, Senator Campbell!

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-08-21,"—Senator Conroy has sought to mislead the Senate in relation to a number of key issues. I would like to address them first. In a desperate grasp for relevance in this debate, Senator Conroy has shown in recent weeks that he is prepared to undermine the credibility of the regulator at a time when the credibility of the regulator is crucial. He has tried to misrepresent ASIC's enforcement role and he has also, for the first time in Australian corporate and political history, sought on three occasions to interfere in the accounting standard setting process. Today we have seen him back up threats made outside the parliament to interfere in the accounting standard setting process by saying, `Why wait until you have an international standard on the treatment of share options? Why not legislate instead?' It shows a fundamental disregard and lack of knowledge of the importance of having an independent accounting standards setter.
One of the great problems that was the cause of the Enron debacle in the United States was that politicians like Senator Conroy chose to interfere in the accounting standards setting process. Big business people went up to Capitol Hill and said, `We want this accounting standard.' In this place only a few years ago, Senator Conroy, with the support of a majority, disallowed an accounting standard for the first time in Australian history. Senator Conroy has now said that he wants to pre-empt the international accounting standards process to come up with thorough international accounting standards in relation to options and legislate. In other words, he wants to supplant the international accounting standards setting process and the role of the independent expert—the Australian Accounting Standards Board—and substitute a Labor politician, with the support of some people on the crossbenches.
I put it to you, Mr Deputy President, that you could not have a greater recipe for a disaster in corporate affairs than having politicians writing accounting standards. You would have corporate people coming up the hill to take Labor people out to lunch, give campaign donations and say, `This is how we want to treat things within our accounts.' It is the sort of corruption of process which led to the collapse of the Enron Corporation in the United States of America; it was because politicians were involved in the process. Can I make one plea to the Australian Democrats and to people in the Australian Labor Party who think carefully about policy—and that clearly does not include the shadow spokesman—that when we address accounting standards reforms, as we will later this year under the CLERP 9 process, we work very hard to ensure politicians cannot interfere in the process. It is a crucial part of good corporate regulatory policy. 
In Australia we have had a government that has been more active in the past six years on improving corporate governance and building a sound regulatory framework than any other at any time in Australian history. Through the corporate law economic reform process, we have brought the most significant reforms to virtually every area of the Corporations Law. There is only one group in the entire corporate world across the globe that seeks to undermine the corporate regulatory work of building a better law, building a better regulator and funding a stronger regulator that has been built up by this parliament, and that is the Australian Labor Party who, for cheap political purposes, seek to undermine people's faith in the corporate regulatory system.
Mr Deputy President, you know very well that in the wake of the Enron collapse, the WorldCom collapse and the Global Crossing collapse the marketplace scoured the details of corporations in Australia thoroughly to find similar accounting treatments. If those analysts and investors and institutions had been able to find even a sniff of what went on in the United States of America, then the Australian market would have suffered a similar fate to what happened on the New York Stock Exchange. Of course, that did not happen here because the law in Australia has been reformed by this government, and the regulator has been given the resources it needs by the parliament—repeated oft by successive chairmen of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.
What is Labor's response? For the past four years, Senator Conroy has been saying, `You are underfunding the regulator. You need to give them more.' Do you know what? Last October, we had an election and, under the charter of budget honesty, the Australian Labor Party was able to put their money on the table. They could not just come to an estimates hearing or to the Senate and make glib statements about the underfunding of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. They had to come up with a policy. Senator Conroy just had 15 minutes to come up with a policy on corporate governance. He again failed to do so. There is no new policy. I think because we have repeated so often over the last few days how we have responded to ASIC's resourcing needs that he has given up criticising on that. But last October they had to go to the people and put down a document which had to be costed by Treasury on where a future Beazley government would spend money on corporate regulation. Do you know what Labor promised? An increase of $1.5 million a year. I think that is roughly less than one per cent.
Within a few weeks of coming back into government, this government increased ASIC's funding by some millions to resource them for their involvement in the HIH royal commission and other investigations. In the current budget, we increased their annual funding by a further $23 million; in fact, we increased it by over $90 million over the next four years. When Labor had the opportunity to put their money where their mouth was and to act instead of talking, they failed. They have had the opportunity every day since the election to give to the Australian people some alternative proposal for Corporations Law reform in this country, and they have not done it. What they have done is fallen into the trap of successive Labor governments—that is, to ignore Corporations Law as an ongoing part of economic policy in this country until there is a failure. 
I commend an article by Professor Bob Baxt—the former head of the ACCC's predecessor—in a book called Collapse Incorporated, published by CCH, as a fine history of corporate regulation in Australia. To paraphrase Professor Baxt, Corporations Law in this country has tended to be a reaction by politicians to the political heat created by collapses. He eloquently describes the course of previous company collapses in Australia as being akin to Shakespearean tragedies, except that the players involved are usually less skilled.
The Labor Party has done it again this time. Instead of looking at policy in a coherent way and asking, `What are the fundamentals we are trying to achieve? How do we build a better company law? How do we ensure shareholders get quality information?' they say, `Let's have a knee-jerk reaction to the latest headline.' The government has an alternative approach. That is the approach shown under the Corporations Law Economic Reform Program, where we have consulted shareholders, investment groups and the institutions who manage the money of the mums and dads—the money on which they will rely in their retirement. We have developed reforms in a cohesive way, and that is how we will respond to the challenges facing the corporate world at the moment. We will not be rushed into a knee-jerk reaction. We will come up with sound policy that serves Australia for the decades ahead and not the short-term political requirements of an opposition without policy, direction or, most importantly, any philosophical framework. 
We will ensure that Australia has improved auditor independence laws, that analyst independence is promoted by the law, and that the modern technology of information transfer through the Internet will enable investors to be more involved in their companies and receive better information in real time, and we will do so in a way that involves the business community. We will not slam through a piece of black-letter law and then have to wait two years for the Australian Accounting Standards Board to come up with an accounting standard. 
The government support executive remuneration disclosure, but you need to do it in a way that is going to create good disclosure, not throw a new clause into the law and then say, `We will leave it to someone else to enforce it.' You do it in a considered way, and, if it means that you have to have a review to do it, then you should do so. You should involve the community in discussions about how you build a better Corporations Law in Australia. The government make no apologies for that. We will continue with our current stance on corporate law reform in this country.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-08-21,"—Without casting any aspersions—because I do not do so—on the last two speakers, may I say that we are favoured in this debate by the first four speakers all having had extensive interaction on the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program and, indeed, on corporate law matters over the last six years. I think it is well worth having this debate at this time. Although Senators Conroy and Campbell may be seen to be adversaries in this matter, I should comment in a spirit of perspective that over the last six years the coalition, the Labor Party and the Democrats have between them introduced some far-sighted and very effective contributory laws on the corporations side. 
Nevertheless, it is quite apparent that the laws we have are not sufficient for the problems we have, and that is why this debate about greater regulation and more intense action is necessary. All politicians know that the two things you have to deal with are perception and reality, and, for politicians, those two apply almost with equal force. The difficulty for the coalition is that there is a fairly common perception out in Australia that they are soft on big business but hard on the little guy. Nowhere is that better shown than in their crackdown on unemployed Australians, which has seen the number of breach penalties increase from 120,000-plus in 1997-98 to 260,000 in the last financial year. They might well argue that there are good grounds for such activity but the same sense of intense activity is not apparent where business failures apply. 
The reality—and that is what we must attend to; I think there is some other point behind the thrust of remarks made by many people in this area—is that, while many companies, company directors and members of management will be fine and upstanding people, far too many companies are operating badly under poor governance activity. The Australian Democrats have a strong commitment to the application of democratic principles, openness and accountability in business. We believe Australian company law is in need of further reform to advance corporate governance and corporate democracy. The participants in this debate know that we have pursued these themes over the last six years. The greatest need for improved corporate practice is with companies that have the greatest impact on our society: public companies. The fundamental issue is that public companies should be fully accountable to not only their largest shareholders but their individual and small shareholders—and that issue divides us from the coalition.  
Those companies must also be accountable for their actions if they affect society and the environment. The way in which this corporate accountability is advanced and enforced is the responsibility of every democratic government. There is currently a great disparity between the principles of corporate democracy and the rules set out in the Corporations Act governing the internal operations of companies. For example, the existing method of electing company directors on a limited re-election basis allows dominance by control groups and inhibits the likelihood of support being expressed for particular directors or independent directors. 
The law does not enable minority interests to be heard through more accessible internal procedures, forcing them to rely on expensive and time-consuming formal procedures like the legal system and ASIC. Unacceptable discriminatory practices still apply and women are still in a small minority as directors. The Democrats believe that, if the ASX and ASIC do not soon insist on best practice election processes for directors, then election procedures for companies would need to be legislated. Why do I put the emphasis there? Ultimately, the emphasis for good corporate governance rests with the board.
Whenever the issues of good corporate governance and external auditors are addressed, the question of independence comes to the fore. Our great difficulty is that the Corporations Law does not define what independence does. I have seen no report from the government—or any Senate or other committee—which starts with a definition of what independence should be with respect to corporations and their boards. Our difficulty is that, by and large, boards are the creature—or a captive—of the controlling or dominant management or shareholding interests. The result is that the audit committees that are talked about are creatures of a board which is in turn controlled by the controlling financial interest, or the dominant management interests, as they were in HIH. At some stage, we have to address the issue of what is a truly independent, non-executive director, what is a truly independent auditor and what is a truly independent audit committee.
When we look at things the government can constructively do to address the current spate of corporate collapses, there may be three sets of issues that we can outline. The first—this is where I find myself in agreement with Senator Ian Campbell—is that many of the lapses involve the violation of existing laws and regulations. I expect that the HIH directors and management and the One.Tel directors and management will find themselves in court under the existing laws. They will be found to have breached laws that already apply. Therefore, it is a matter of whether the effective enforcement and application of laws is occurring rather than a matter of whether those laws exist. That is an important point to recognise. If you look at that point, you then have to return to the focus of the debate between Senator Conroy and Senator Ian Campbell, and that was the resourcing of ASIC. Therefore, the funding levels of ASIC matter, and the focus and direction of ASIC matter.
The second set of issues is that where companies failed to meet widely accepted standards of good corporate governance, why was the whistle not blown? What other mechanisms are needed? ASIC, the ASX, financial journalists and politicians are interested in this area. Why was the whistle not blown? In that respect, I return to the remarks I made earlier about the need for genuine independence and genuine separation of powers within the institutional mechanisms of companies. To me, that means you need to explore the issues of independent non-executive board members, truly independent auditors, truly independent audit committees and, of course, a mechanism I have outlined a number of times in a number of forums: a corporate governance board. I will not explore that matter further today but those are material areas to discuss.
The third set of issues relates to accounting standards, accounting methods and the way in which auditors look to apply them. I cannot say much about that matter right now because I am bound by the work I am doing on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, which is examining these issues. But it is true that, unless auditors are given true independence and the ability within that independence to exercise fearless judgment about the way in which assets and liabilities and financial statements are presented, we will continue to have problems because the true state of affairs of a company are disguised. We have to accept and acknowledge what the people who head accounting standards organisations worldwide are saying: we need a far better accounting standards regime. We have to accept that; they are far more expert in this area than we are. 
As I draw to the end of my allotted time, I will correct Senator Ian Campbell on the record. The accounting standard that was disallowed was specifically disallowed because the board that recommended it was split. The point was made that if you are going to come forward with an accounting standard, it must be one which the experts can agree on. It should not be up to us as politicians to fall on the side of five when four oppose or vice versa. That is a legitimate point to make.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Policy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,22,1
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2002-08-21,"—We have to give Labor one thing: they might be misguided but they are certainly persistent. They have failed to raise a blip on the radar with regard to the matter that they raised in question time yesterday and today and in the debate on taking note of answers yesterday afternoon, yet they are back here today raising the same issue as a matter of public importance.
—They have nothing else to do.
—They probably have nothing else to do, Senator McGauran, but it is no wonder they have raised this issue today because the reality is that it is a pathetic attempt to divert attention from the rorting that their union masters have been undertaking in the construction industry, as identified in the report that the Cole royal commission released yesterday. That royal commission identified widespread corruption, including breaches of industrial law involving the widespread application of and surrender to inappropriate industrial pressure on the part of trade unions. The government's pre-emptive strike against that corruption—a task force to police the industry—was described as obnoxious by John Sutton, the construction division secretary of the CFMEU, who said:
It's a stark contrast with the Government's attitude to regulating the corporate sector—John Howard's attitude on corporate crooks is just inertia.
It is quite easy to see, in this matter of public importance this afternoon, from whose hymn sheet Senator Conroy and his Labor colleagues are singing. Labor's subjection to their union masters is just pathetic. The fact is that the Howard government's action with regard to shortcomings under the Corporations Law has been prompt on all occasions. We have acted promptly with regard to Corporations Law reform, just as in the last 24 hours, with the publication of that royal commission report, we have acted promptly in dealing with union thugs.
—You weren't quick to bring in legislation when HIH collapsed.
—The fact is that the Howard government instituted the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program virtually immediately after we won the 1996 election. We have had a consistent program of reform of the Corporations Law. We have had the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program—CLERP, as it is known. CLERPs 1 to 6 are a series of reforms of the corporations and financial services law that have enhanced the Corporations Law and investor protection over the six years that the government have been in office. We now have CLERP 7, which follows CLERPs 1 to 6, which, as I have said, have been achieved over the last six years. CLERP 7 will be incorporated in legislation which will be introduced into this parliament within the next few weeks. We now have CLERP 8. As Senator Ian Campbell, the parliamentary secretary, has already mentioned, CLERP 9 is in the policy discussion paper process and will be released within a couple of weeks. CLERP 9 builds on the earlier reforms of CLERPs 1 to 6 in addressing the very issues that have been raised by Senator Conroy in this matter of public importance today. When you look around the world—Senator Conroy knows this only too well, as a member of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services and as a shadow minister with responsibility for this area, and I know it as chairman of that committee—and compare Australia's system of Corporations Law, corporate regulation and investor protection, which were developed under the CLERP process over the last six years, you are left in no doubt that Australia has world's best practice in corporate regulation. 
We have a national structure of corporate regulation which we have achieved by cooperative discussions with the states which contrasts markedly with the situation in the United States of America, where a lot of the corporate regulation still remains in the hands of the states. We have been able to avoid the worst effects of the Asian financial crisis of the late nineties and the recent financial crisis in the United States as a result of this government's approach to corporate regulation. The fact is that the government has been working on those more recent CLERP 9 proposals since November of last year, not just in the wash up of the recent events in the United States and the HIH collapse, which I heard an interjection about a few moments ago. Since November last year the government and in particular Senator Campbell, who has responsibility as the parliamentary secretary, have been working through reforms which are known as CLERP 9.
Let there be no doubt: this government is adamant that anyone who cheats—shareholders on the one hand or taxpayers on the other—should suffer the full consequences of their actions. As far as the government is concerned there is no difference between corporate cheats and welfare cheats—they should all suffer the full consequences of the law. The fact that the government has acted against corporate cheats is shown by the number of prosecutions that have been embarked upon over the last few years by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the regulator under our corporate law.
As I said, CLERP 9 addresses the issues that have been raised. Its having been in gestation since November last year, the government announced in late June a review of audit regulation and the wider corporate disclosure framework, under the title of CLERP 9, as the next phase in our reform program. CLERP 9 provides a response to the Ramsay report and addresses a wide range of issues of corporate disclosure. The policy paper, which Senator Campbell has indicated will be released in a couple of weeks, considers a range of issues relating to quality of audit, including a review of oversight structures for the profession and for audit standards. It will also examine the adequacy of the current framework for continuous disclosure by corporations. It will seek to maximise investor access to price sensitive information and ensure that the framework is supported by appropriate penalties to deter any contravention of the law.
Another important area that CLERP 9 addresses is that of analyst independence—another hobbyhorse of Senator Conroy's. The aim there is to ensure that investors have access to accurate and unbiased information in relation to listed companies. The key issue is the extent to which the conduct and disclosure framework, which we have already introduced in the Financial Services Reform Act—it was known by the shorthand term `CLERP 6' and subsequently became, in its legislative form, the Financial Services Reform Act—applies appropriately to general advice provided by share analysts as well as to the other range of advice and information which is dealt with under that financial services reform legislation.
The adequacy of the current framework of fundraising disclosure, including whether shares and debentures should be regulated under chapter 7 rather than section 6D of the Corporations Act, will also be subject to the CLERP 9 consideration. As Senator Campbell said, that policy paper will be released within the next couple of weeks. That will then allow the full consultation process to occur so that legislation can be introduced into parliament in 2003. 
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The speaker's time has expired.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Order! The honourable senator's time has expired.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Policy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,22,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2002-08-21,"—I rise this afternoon to provide some input on this debate in relation to standing order 75. It highlights the extraordinary contrast in the government's attitude to corporate law—and the lack of regulation by this government of what happens in the corporate world—and its embarking on policies and activities, through its various departments, that are hell-bent on punishing struggling families who try to do the right thing by abiding by the new regulations and policies.
This government continues to sit on its hands when it comes to corporate governance. It is soft on tightening corporate regulation but it is as tough as nails on families. I hope the families who are listening who have been affected by this family debt repayment will be able to relate to what I am about to talk about. The Howard government has not only been harsh and punitive towards families in relation to the recovery of overpayments, as we have seen in the last couple of days and indeed in the last couple of weeks. Furthermore, it has acted in a way that flies in the face of good governance. It has failed to be honest and transparent about its methods and intentions for recovering these overpayments. Yet this is a government that constantly promotes itself as being family friendly.
I find it amazing that this government persists with its hollow rhetoric on families. It boasts about, and prides itself on, being a government that is there for families, yet dithers around on matters such as paid maternity leave. It has tried to cut the income of 200,000 disabled people and their families and it is absolutely hell-bent on increasing the costs of essential medicines to families by 30 per cent. Thankfully, we were able to ensure that that did not go ahead. But we are particularly enraged that a government which refuses to act on corporate governance continues to punish ordinary Australian families through this flawed family payment system: a system that does not recognise in any way the changing situations that families undergo in our society these days.
As a background to this, families may have a changed income estimation system. Senators are well aware that the government has seen fit to change the way in which income is estimated for the purpose of family payments—that is, the family tax benefits and the child-care benefit. Instead of using the previous year's income to calculate the entitlement to family payments this government now requires families to gaze into a crystal ball and predict what their family income will be over the coming year.
Despite the answers we have heard continually this week from Senator Vanstone in question time—a senator who continually wants to hang the blame on families—where she refers constantly to their tax income and tax return, that is not the return that these families have to provide to Centrelink for the next year's calculations. That is the previous year's income. These families are asked to predict what the coming year's income is going to be. Anyone can see that there is a problem with this system. Women having babies are commonly undecided about the timing of their return to work and whether they will return on a full-time or a part-time basis. Of course, with families with fluctuating incomes such as overtime payments and split shifts this system can be a nightmare. How can you possibly predict in those situations when you will work or what your income will be on a week-by-week basis, let alone for a total year? These are not extraordinary circumstances; they are situations in which hundreds of thousands of families in this country find themselves each year.
What we have seen is that last year over 600 families incurred debts. The massive debts arising from this unfair and unworkable system became apparent in January this year, when families received their first debt notices in respect of the 2000-01 financial year. In a blatantly political move this government held over family debt payments until after the election. There was no intent by this government to ensure that this payback—or debt to the government, as Senator Vanstone harps on and on about—was brought to the attention of these families and these people prior to the last election. Oh no, this was held over until well after the election was over. But the pain did not end there. Over 100,000 families got a Christmas present from this Prime Minister—an average debt of $750 for overpayment of family benefits. 
This year will be no different. This government has refused to act on any of the suggestions made by this party to fix this flawed system—and that is a problem here. We have a minister in this chamber who, day after day—and despite example after example from people in this party showing that it is not working—continues to defend this system and continues to defend the actions and intent of her policy instead of standing up and admitting that there is a flaw in the system, that it is not working and that families are being punished unjustly. It really adds insult to injury for every Australian family hit with a family debt payment when the Minister for Family and Community Services insists, as she did today, that this system is fair and, when questioned about the flaws in the system, continues to characterise those incurring debts as being dishonest. There is an emphasis by this minister that those people, despite the fact that they have willingly and honestly and as best as they can advised Centrelink of their changed situation and projected income, which for some reason or another is not being picked up by this system, are somehow being dishonest, mischievous or almost criminal in intent in having somehow gained this money that was not duly and honestly paid to them.
The reassurances given by the minister that if families report changes to their incomes they will not incur debts are simply wrong. Even this week in the Northern Territory we have had two examples of that. In fact, one example was sent to us from the office of Mr David Tollner, who happens to be the member for Solomon. One woman marched into his office with an overpayment of nearly $3,000—a family debt payment. He simply said to her, `We don't deal with those sorts of street issues here. You had better go off and see either Mr Warren Snowdon, the member for Lingiari, or Senator Crossin.' So we have government members in electorates who are not even interested in assisting people who are being caught in the trap of this government's policies. Mr David Tollner would have this person believe it was a street issue. They are not interested in that sort of stuff—not interested in the bread-and-butter issues that affect families on a day-to-day basis.
At one point the minister even suggested that families should lie and overestimate their income. Families in this country do not do that, and do not want to do that. They have tried to operate effectively and honestly within this system. Families who play by the rules and advise of changes in income should not be slugged with debts. Families who have a parent return to the work force after caring for children should not be slugged with debts either. And families should not be put in the position of having to lie, as the minister would suggest, about their earnings to Centrelink and have their fortnightly payments deliberately reduced in order to avoid debts. The reason this is happening is that, while this government pretends to be concerned about assisting families, you cannot do that if you develop policy without talking and taking care of the reality of families in this country—without knowing how families function and without knowing that the situation in families in this country can, on a day-to-day and a week-by-week basis, change. This policy does not recognise this, and this system is not set up to recognise this. This is a flawed system. The Prime Minister himself has demonstrated how out of touch he is with ordinary families in the current debate around paid maternity leave. The Prime Minister says that he is lukewarm on it because he is unconvinced that it would make any difference for many women.
Recently Senator Vanstone has defended these draconian debt recovery processes by arguing that families have the option of avoiding debt by claiming their benefits at the end of the financial year. If I suggested to most families in my electorate that they take that option they would think I lived in another world. Family payments are meant to help families with the day-to-day expenses of raising children, and you do not get an account for those costs at the end of the year. You need that assistance every fortnight. (Time expired)
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Policy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,22,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2002-08-21,"—The motion in the name of Senator Conroy provides the Senate with the opportunity to consider the reforms for which the Howard government has been responsible in the field of financial reporting and also to address future proposals, which are on the table as we speak. This is an important issue. It is an issue of great concern, beyond politicians, beyond government, throughout the commercial community. It is an issue which affects every Australian in one way or another, whether they be an employee, a small shareholder or the man or the woman in the street.
The Howard government is proud of its record of ensuring that the highest standards of corporate governance are observed in this country—a record much more proud, I must say, than that to which the Hawke or Keating governments could point, under whose period of office corporate governance in Australia, particularly in the late 1980s, was an expression of mockery. The keystone to the Howard government's reform of corporate governance is the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 1999—the CLERP Act, as it is known by its acronym—which commenced on 13 March 2000. That legislation amended the provisions of the Corporations Act relating to takeovers and fundraising. The takeover provisions were streamlined. Most importantly, the Corporations and Securities Panel, now the Takeovers Panel, replaced the courts as the primary body for resolving takeover disputes. This peer review body may also review ASIC exemption and modification decisions and make rules that are not inconsistent with chapter 6. It is widely acknowledged now that the Takeovers Panel is operating successfully. The CLERP Act also introduced new fundraising provisions governing shares, debentures and interests in managed investment schemes. These reforms aim to improve the quality of disclosure to investors while reducing transaction costs, especially in relation to small business.
As well as the CLERP Act, the government has restructured the accounting standard setting process to strengthen the independent standard setters and balance the influence of the accounting bodies with broader stakeholder input. The Australian Accounting Standards Board and its oversight body, the Financial Reporting Council, are operating effectively under these new arrangements. Australian accounting standards are recognised internationally as being of high quality. Particularly under the leadership of the parliamentary secretary, my friend Senator the Hon. Ian Campbell, Australia has led the world in the reform of accounting standards and the adoption of new accounting standards with a higher level of transparency. ASIC has a history of targeting abuse of accounting standards. In 1999, it caused restatements of reported accounts in the listed sector of $1.4 billion and has carried out targeted surveillance each year since. ASIC is currently conducting a surveillance project targeted at accounting issues of the type recently uncovered in the United States.
The government's CLERP initiatives have included a number of specific measures to enhance corporate governance in other ways. Among them is the statutory derivative action—which enables shareholders of a company to bring an action on its behalf, including against the company's directors, for a wrong done to the company where the company is unwilling or unable to bring that action—and enhanced disclosure of director conflicts. The CLERP Act amendments to the Corporations Act 1999 introduced comprehensive disclosure requirements for directors regarding disclosure and voting on matters involving personal interests. The amendments also reformed the requirements for disclosure and shareholder approval for related party transactions. 
I turn to CLERP 6. The Financial Services Reform Act commenced on 11 March 2002. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, it introduced a new and harmonised licensing and disclosure regime for financial markets, clearing and settlement facilities, and financial services providers. It also introduced a new financial products disclosure regime for financial products other than shares and debentures. From the time the act commenced operation, investors will be provided with greater disclosure in relation to conflicts of interest that might affect personal advice that they are being provided. A new product disclosure framework aims to ensure that investors receive consistent and comparable information which will enable them to understand and compare different financial products. Market licensees, as well as CS facility licensees, are required to adopt specific measures to address potential conflicts of interest between their commercial interests and regulatory responsibilities. ASIC will review these measures on an annual basis. The FSR Act also introduced civil penalties in relation to continuous disclosure, insider trading and market manipulation. ASIC is now able to apply to the court for a financial penalty of up to $200,000 in relation to contraventions of these provisions.
But the work of reform goes on, and it will proceed with the legislation in contemplation, known as CLERP 9. On 27 June, the government announced a review of audit regulations and the wider corporate disclosure framework as the next phase of the corporate law economic reform program. CLERP 9 will provide a government response to the Ramsay report and address other issues in corporate disclosure. It will consider a range of issues relating to the quality of audit, including a review of oversight structures for the profession and for audit standards. Government senators acknowledge the importance of the issue which Senator Conroy's notice of motion identifies. But we maintain that this government has been alert and astute in addressing these policy issues through the most comprehensive and continuing program of reform of corporate governance and the enhancement of the transparency of accounting and reporting standards in Australian commercial history.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-08-21,"—The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 provides that public funding for the Liberal Party is to be paid to the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party rather than to state and territory divisions. Alternatively, the federal secretariat may lodge with the Australian Electoral Commission a written note that sets out the proportion of public funding to be paid to the state and territory divisions and the proportion of public funding to be paid to the federal secretariat. One of the great joys of this bill is to watch the adversarial politics on display, because this kind of interaction between the two major parties leaves spectators like us watching with some bemusement— and, I hope, occasionally some amusement. But the serious issue is whether a bill described as a `dash for cash' by Labor should be let through. As the electoral matters spokesperson for the Democrats, I have tried to employ a fairly central principle—that is, whether this bill does allow the same process or the same opportunity to every participant in the electoral process who is entitled to receive public funding. I find that it does not, and I and my party would not let the bill through as it is outlaid.
The other principle I have to look at is whether the allegations by the Labor Party concerning Liberal Party disaffection with this bill are true or not. I have no way of knowing that; I have no way of knowing how much irritation there is in state Liberal divisions. I can only work from my own experience and, as the electoral matters spokesperson, I have not had any—not one—member of any Liberal state executive, any Liberal president or any Liberal office holder ring me, email me or write to me, either officially or unofficially. The only time I have had any concerns expressed to me about this bill was by two members of this parliament who raised the matter informally with me. So I do not have any evidence that there is any internal Liberal Party concern about the mechanism which would allow a more centralised funding payment.
However, if that is the case, I then have to discard that area of concern and return to the first principle, which is whether this bill will allow the same provisions for all political parties or all those who receive funding. With regard to the Australian Democrats themselves, the law presently provides that funding is paid to a principal agent. Labor, in the speech from Senator Faulkner, outlined their agreed method between their state and federal bodies to allow them to be paid nationally. This legislation proposes to allow the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party to be funded directly, and we have been advised that that is unanimously agreed to by the federal Liberal secretariat, which includes all divisional presidents.
Either we would end up rejecting this or we could try amending it—and, being Democrats, that is what we have tried. As a result, we will probably end up satisfying nobody. The first amendment we will be presenting later in the debate provides for a general right of access for political parties to national funding. Through different mechanisms, the funding of both the Labor Party and the Democrats is paid directly to the national or principal agent to the party, and the legislation proposes to make it accessible to the Liberal Party in its particular circumstances. There are a lot of political parties other than the ones just mentioned. Our amendment will provide a similar option for all political parties. We think it is reasonable for the Liberal Party to have the option to be funded at a national level, if that is their consensus, but the option should be available to all political parties via the Australian Electoral Commission without in future having to come to parliament seeking specific legislation.
Therefore, our amendments will amend the bill so that it applies more generally to political parties registered under the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Those amendments have the effect of extending the provisions currently in the bill relating to the Liberal Party to other parties which have a federal secretariat and state or territory branches. They provide that a registered political party with a federal secretariat and state or territory branches structure, other than the Liberal Party, may choose—note the word `choose'—to be treated as a designated federal party. A designated federal party may give a written notice to the Electoral Commission specifying the percentage of public funding to be paid to the state and federal branches of the party. 
In order to be treated as a designated federal party, the registered officer of a registered political party must lodge a written notice with the Electoral Commission stating that the party chooses to be so treated. The registered officer may revoke this choice by notice in writing to the Electoral Commission at any time except between the period commencing at the start of the polling day for an election and the end of the 14th day after the day on which the writ is returned. The effect of those amendments is to make this bill a bill of general application. The Democrats have no objection to political parties being funded at a national level if they so choose and desire, but it should not be necessary to come to the parliament seeking specific legislation in future in order to do so. This amendment will extend the option sought by the Liberals to all relevant political parties.
The second amendment proposed by the Democrats will give effect to recommendation 1 of the Australian Electoral Commission's 1996 Funding and disclosure report, which recommended that public funding be paid into the account of the registered party, rather than paid in the name of individuals as agents of political parties. The Electoral Commission expressed its concerns as follows:
The AEC is concerned, particularly given the very large amounts of funding now being paid to individuals as agents of political parties, that the legislation as it currently stands does not compel an agent to deposit the cheque in an account of the party. A more secure method of effecting payment would be to make cheques out in the party's name. This would require an amendment to the legislation which, as it stands, does not allow the agent to nominate such a redirection of payment.
On this basis, the Democrats' second amendment establishes enhanced and more secure payment provisions relating to the payment of public funding. It provides that the Electoral Commission will make payments of public funding by direct deposits into a nominated bank account or by cheque where there is no nominated bank account. Where the payment of public funding is made by cheque, it will be made out in the name of the registered political party, not in the agent's name as is currently the case.
In conclusion, the Democrats accept the right of a political party to be funded nationally, but we believe it should be an option open to all political parties, not only to those who can secure the passage of party specific legislation through the parliament. On that basis, we will support this bill if our amendments making it a bill of general application are accepted. If they are not accepted, we will be opposing the bill.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-08-21,"—The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 entrenches the name of the Liberal Party in legislation more times than there are Liberal senators in this chamber. The Liberal Party is mentioned, by name, over 33 times in four pages. That has never happened in the legislative history of this parliament. This is the worst piece of legislation I have ever seen come into this parliament in just over 21 years. It is a total perversion of the legislative process to have this national parliament called upon to settle what is an internal factional wrangle in the Liberal Party. It is an absolute joke. No-one has ever contemplated the misuse and abuse of parliament in such a way before.
Let us go to the process issue. Virtually all electoral legislation in the past 19 years has been run before the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. What happened with this one? It has never been near the committee. There have been no submissions to the joint committee and there has been no reference by the minister. This did not get any public scrutiny at the time that it was drawn up. How did it come about? It was cooked up by the federal Liberal Party secretariat at Robert Menzies House and in the Prime Minister's office; the evidence is there for that. They cooked up this particular scheme and it went nowhere near any of the normal processes. It was then rushed through the party room with a minimum of discussion and a maximum of threats. We know that from what appeared in the newspapers, which was never denied. 
Time and again in the last year, this government has tried to leapfrog this bill up the legislative calendar. Each time we have managed to head that off and push it aside. Now comes what will be a debate of Stalingrad proportions. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, we are in the tractor factory and we are going to fight this piece of legislation pillar and post right to the end because it is so corrupt. Look at the rationale for this piece of legislation. It is a very simple and beguiling rationale. This is here because the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party says that it runs national campaigns and should have the funding.
Let us go back eight years to when this legislation came in. Who was up on their feet arguing that they wanted the dual track process? It was the Liberal Party of Australia. They wanted the option. They pleaded with the then government, `Do not make it compulsory to go to the national body; give us the option.' `We're a federal party,' we were told by the Liberal Party, `We're a party based on states' rights. How dare you compel national funding to go to the national body!' We said, `Oh well, all right. We'll go back, we'll bring in a more convoluted form of legislation and we'll end up having to pass it,' and we did it; we accommodated the Liberal Party. Now they want to change 180 degrees.
We also now hear from Mr Peter Wells, the director of the WA division of the Liberal Party. What does he say about it? He is reported to have observed that the current system creates `cash flow problems' for state divisions and the federal secretariat. He went on to add:
Why mess around with GST if you do not have to? 
Why don't you go out and tell that to all of your small business mates who have to mess around with GST time after time? We now have a piece of legislation that helps the Liberal Party avoid their GST obligations. What a sleazy, GST-rorting organisation the Liberal Party of Australia would become if Mr Wells had his way.
Having promised to reveal all about GST rorting in the electorate of Groom, they cleverly got the tax office to do the investigation and they now hide behind the confidentiality of its findings. There is one, and only one, real rationale as to why this legislation is here today: follow the money. As soon as you give the national office of the Liberal Party all the money, they will be in a position to tell each of the state divisions what to do. I have some sympathy with that. I understand the frustration that must exist up at Robert Menzies House as to some of the antics of their state division, but the way their constitution is currently written and the resistance to attempts to change it say to me that, at the moment, the Liberal Party state divisions do not want to be controlled or directed by the national secretariat. That has been their historical choice and, as far as I understand, overwhelmingly is their position today. So this is all about saying, `We'll give all the public funding to the national secretariat. They'll dole it out to the states, provided the states conform to the views expressed.'
Why would the federal Liberal Party want to take control of the state divisions? Let us do a run around the country. Let us start in Western Australia and have a look at the state of the Liberal Party there. It has gone from 28,000 members to 2,800 members in 10 years. It is subject to constant feuding. All you have to do is look at Senator Crane's comments on Senator-designate Johnston. I do not give any value to them but it shows how bitter the divisions are in Western Australia. Look at the fact that, as soon as Senator Knowles puts out a confidential letter ripping up a few colleagues, it is immediately leaked to crikey.com. Look at the fact that Senator Knowles has had to apologise and pay money to former Senator Noel Crichton-Brown. Look at the fact that Colin Barnett is currently being undermined in the state parliament. Look at the fact that that was their worst state election result in decades. The whole Western Australian Liberal Party is in meltdown: of course `Lightweight Lynton' wants to go along and take it over. 
Go across to South Australia—no rosier picture. There you have the Olsen and the Brown forces slugging it out, month in, month out, costing them state government. And look at Senator Hill and Senator Minchin—butter would not melt in their mouths in this chamber, but, the moment they are outside, the knives come out and they are into each other. This is factional warfare, culminating in the greatest branch-stack in South Australian history in the state electorate of Unley. Away they go, signing up people from Kuala Lumpur, London and even Afghanistan, I understand, as members of the Unley branch in South Australia. That is what we have: an absolutely pathetic Liberal Party in South Australia, probably the most pathetic of any division.
Look at my home state. Branch-stacking is absolutely rampant in the electorate of Bulleen and in other spots in Victoria. Of course, not satisfied with that, we also have the Doyle-Napthine brawl of the last few days. I will tell you what I really think about that—what about those 15 members of the Victorian Liberal Party who all promised poor Denis a vote and then went and voted the other way? What a sad indictment of a pathetic state Liberal Party, once the jewel in the crown of the national Liberal Party. The majority of federal members from Victoria are Labor; in state Labor government, the majority are Labor. What have the Liberals got in Victoria? Absolutely nothing, just fighting amongst themselves. No wonder the federal secretariat wants to tell them what to do.
We move on to the Apple Isle. Have a look at that: seven members out of 25 in the Legislative Assembly, none out of five in the House of Representatives, none out of 19 in the Legislative Council and five out of 12 in the Senate—and the only star that can be promoted to ministerial status is the Hon. Senator Eric Abetz. I do not know how many of you watched him on election night: he moved from being the arch string-puller to being just a commentator. He was commentating on something that he had had a major role in—what a self-effacing minister we have here! The person that dictated the whole strategy in Tasmania is no longer a part of it; he is simply a commentator. Look, do not think that I am at all bitter about Senator Eric Abetz; he is one of my closest mates here! Who else can I thank for returning five federal members to the House of Representatives? Who else can I thank for that great headline in the Australian `Honey, I shrunk the Opposition'? There is no-one closer and friendlier to the Labor Party than Senator Eric Abetz; he is our greatest asset in Tasmania and I say to him, if he is listening to this in his office, `Comrade, you have always got a free dinner on me.'
Will we move up to New South Wales? Is it much better? Half of the New South Wales membership of the Liberal Party are over the age of 65. I am not here to criticise Australia's elder citizens; it just reflects that the Liberals are no longer reflective of Australian society. Of course, we have similarly had a war between Mrs Chikarovski and Mr John Brogden; they have been at war for ages. Within the branches, it is a battleground between the group and the uglies fighting it out. If you really want to know how New South Wales has become the absolute pits, think about who is the Prime Minister's representative on their administrative committee: Senator Bill Heffernan. How low can you go! If that does not reflect the malaise in New South Wales, I do not know what does.
Then there is the ACT branch. Apart from their throwing away territory government, at least we know that every member of the ACT branch of the Liberal Party is lining up to replace Senator Margaret Reid. 
—They're all running for the Senate.
—All six of them are in the field. I just say this: I am pretty certain that Senator Margaret Reid will stay here a bit longer and will continue to make the great contribution she has always made, so they will have to wait in the queue just a bit longer.
We now return to the final great state branch of the Liberal Party: that in the great state of Queensland. I love Queensland—I always have my holidays there. 
—It is a very great state, Senator.
—It is a very great state, as Senator George Brandis—
—Who desperately hopes that the bill will go down.
—I do not know about that, but it is certainly regarded by some as the problem child. If the Queensland state branch of the Liberal Party were a piece of real estate, how would a real estate agent describe it—`has potential for improvement'? It has three out of 88 members in the Legislative Assembly. I remember—I will not be too derisory—that we could only field a cricket side there on one occasion. All you can do is have a game of kellypool with three entrants—an absolutely three-out-of-88 top-class effort!
Just go through their history. We have had to raise in this chamber Mr Mal Brough's fundraising rort. Remember that one—that was an absolute bottler that embarrassed the party. Then we had the Entsch government contract that went on as though office of profit under the Crown and everything else simply did not exist. Then we had the civil war in Moncrieff—that was a beauty. The then existing member threatened to sue everyone else in sight, and we had this big preselection brawl in which character assassination was a byword. Let us not forget the great Ryan stack—that was an absolute bottler. I understand they now have 40 delegates to the state convention, they have stacked it out so much. That and the treatment of Mr Ted Tucker—I do not know him personally, so I do not really care whether he was mistreated—had an enormous stench. It had the highest overseas membership of any branch of any political party in Australia. Their theme song was taken from Qantas: `I've been to cities all over the world.' The members—it was like a Peter Stuyvesant ad— were dotted all around the globe!
We then had Senator MacGibbon's preselection that went to court. We have the documents that show just how outrageous the preselection was. One Senate candidate—I will not identify him, but he has certain similarities to Mr Bean—voted for himself in the preselection, which was totally in contradiction to the rules. Ballot papers were taken in and out of the meeting. It is all there in the 25-page affidavit from Senator MacGibbon just how rorted that preselection was, and he went down by only one vote— absolutely pathetic. Then we have the issue of how they `assassinated' the opposition leader on the Brisbane City Council. That was all there: he was `assassinated'. I understand he is probably a friend of yours, Senator Brandis. You might confirm that.
—He's a very fine man—Councillor Caltabiano.
—That is right. His enemies did him in too, even though Senator Brandis has put on oath here today that he is a very fine man and obviously doing a very good job.
Then we have the Groom GST fiasco, where they said, `It was only a few dollars.' The small business minister has some views on GST. We found that they were rorting their GST deliberately there. I will not go into any of the details of the Carroll-Tucker factional brawl, because that would take me all afternoon. Of course the current rort in Queensland is this: you are allowed 10 delegates to a Senate preselection if you have more than 100 members. So what you do is take members from the Sunshine Coast and top up those electorates that you control, move them over the 100 and get the 10 delegates. I thought we were pretty good in the Labor Party at times, but, gee, I take my hat right off: this is a top operation and it is going on because the word is that Senator Herron is off to Ireland and the Vatican at some stage in the near future. Of course, not content with that, here they have the leader, Mr Quinn, saying, `Unless you reform these branch-stacking activities, I'm off.' What did they say? They said, `See ya.' They are going to have a valedictory for him. Off he goes. You could go on, like a lot of those things.
In the very last incident, we had Batman and Robin sponsoring the federal Treasurer going around Queensland. The two senators, Batman and Robin, took the Treasurer all the way around outback Queensland to humanise him—with absolutely altruistic motives. Preferment from a future Prime Minister is the last thing they are thinking about with this visit! So the Queensland branch is the real target of this legislation, one has to say, from what we know of it. 
I have said before that this matter is solvable. It is solvable because there already exists within the current act the ability for the Liberal Party to transfer its funding from state divisions to the federal secretariat— after all, we have done it in the Labor Party. Do you know what you have to do, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot? You go and get each state director to sign the same letter, saying, `We transfer the funding from a state division to the federal secretariat.' It is simple—one letter, one stamp, as I have said in the past, and it is all done. Why isn't it being done? The federal director of the Liberal Party denies that there are internal differences on this. Why can't he go and collect a letter? Why can't he have it delivered to the Electoral Commission and save this parliament the embarrassment of having to settle a factional war in the Liberal Party by legislating to enforce victory for one side? It is unbelievable that a supposedly sophisticated government that supposedly believes in upholding the traditions of this parliament could so besmirch it by bringing in legislation of this particular type. I really cannot understand why the Prime Minister and his henchmen want to do this, other than that this is the only way they can capture control of the machinery of the Liberal Party and sent out their diktats.
A solution is easy: 45c, and we can go home or get on with the next piece of legislation—one stamp. Everyone knows of my largesse—Senator Harris acknowledges it. Senator Harris will be pleased to know this: here is the stamp, and I am tabling it and donating it to the Liberal Party of Australia for them to send a clear letter to the Chief Electoral Commissioner at the Australian Electoral Commission—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—You will need the permission of the chamber to table it.
—I seek leave to table the stamp.
Leave granted.
—Any member of the Liberal Party can come and collect it. I will trust you to give it to Mr Lynton Crosby. I know you would not pocket it and I know that you will declare it under the Electoral Act, even though it does not go beyond the $1,500 limit. So, Mr Lynton Crosby, Federal Director of the Liberal Party, collect the seven signatures—the Liberal Party is not represented in the Northern Territory—from the six states and the ACT. They all just need to say that the federal secretariat can have all the public funding. I thought we had someone to collect it—but, no, we do not. I really did think we had someone coming over to collect it.
—The attendant is there to collect the stamp and we assume that the stamp becomes a document of the Senate.
—Thank you.
—It was taken from your electoral allowance, I assume.
—I would not make any presumptions as to its origin, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—It was an assumption, not a presumption.
—Thank you. All Mr Crosby has to do is to get the letter, get the seven signatures and send it to Mr Andy Becker at the Australian Electoral Commission, and this entire piece of legislation becomes redundant. As I said before, there is a simple solution to this. The fact that they cannot do it means that they are not telling the truth. The fact that they cannot do it means that there are internal difficulties within the Liberal Party of Australia and they are trying to use this parliament to enforce their own factional warfare solutions. It is not on. We intend to fight it all the way through and if we lose we lose. But we will put up the fight and we will make sure that every element of this bill is fully tested.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2002-08-21,"—I am almost lost for words in awe of the theatrical skills of Senator Robert Ray. What we have seen in the chamber this evening has been a bravura performance in hypocrisy by Senator Robert Ray. How could Senator Ray, of all people, the quondam leader of the right faction of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party—and, Mr Acting Deputy President, you will agree with me that he delivered that speech for 20 minutes with a straight face and without missing a beat—give a speech condemning the evils of branch stacking, factionalism, leadership squabbles and character assassination? 
He has been succeeded in that role by his protege, Senator Stephen Conroy. No sooner did Senator Conroy saddle up to take the factional reigns than he got bumped off by Senator Kim Carr, who walks into the chamber now. Senator Carr, in a retreat to the pre-Whitlamite days, to the unreformed state of the Victorian Labor Party in the fifties, seized factional control from Senator Ray and his protege, Senator Conroy, and brought it back into the hands of the tomato left.
It is an extraordinary thing that, in a political party as bereft of ideas and principles as the Australian Labor Party, one of their senior statesmen—a former cabinet minister and a party heavyweight by anybody's definition of the word—could stand up and condemn branch stacking and factionalism. This is from the Labor Party. It has been an awesome performance. May I commend to the Senate and to those people who may be listening this evening to the broadcast—if they want to know the way the Labor Party really ticks—former Senator John Button's essay in the latest edition of Quarterly Essay. It is an essay which has attracted—and rightly so—a deal of notoriety in the last couple of months.
Former Senator Button is a product of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party, and the picture he paints of the Labor Party—not just in his home state of Victoria but throughout the country—is of an institution riddled with decay, factionalism, violations of its own constitution and malpractice, an institution which is bereft of a way forward. What does former Senator Button say is the heart of the problem? He says that the heart of the problem is that the Labor Party is in the death grip of the trade unions. This party in the opening years of the 21st century is still clinging to a political structure which was devised in the late 19th century. Of all the institutions in Australian society today, whether they be political, commercial, social or public institutions, it is hard to imagine one that is more hidebound and more resistant to change than the Australian Labor Party. It has not fundamentally changed, either structurally or in its political culture, for more than a century.
Isn't it a sad thing and isn't it amusing and pathetic to see the dinosaurs of that remnant of Australian politics—that mix between an historical theme park and a political mausoleum that people like Senator Robert Ray, Senator Kim Carr and Senator Stephen Conroy represent in this place—lecturing the Liberal Party? The point former senator Button made is that, because the Labor Party is in the death grip of the trade unions, it is becoming more and more out of touch with the Australian people—simply because its recruitment base, the trade union movement, represents a smaller and smaller proportion of Australian society.
Do you know the really sad statistic that John Button recited in his impressive article in Quarterly Essay? It was not just that today only 25 per cent of the Australian work force are unionised but that, of that 25 per cent, only 14 per cent of the Australian work force are members of trade unions which are affiliated with the Australian Labor Party. So much for the claim to be representing the interests of working Australians! Indeed, so much for the claim to be representing the interests of working Australians who are trade unionists! The fact is that only 14 per cent of the work force—one-seventh of the work force—are today members of unions with an affiliation with the Australian Labor Party.
We have had two more products of the political mausoleum—Mr Hawke and Mr Wran—assay a review of the Labor Party. What did they come up with? After an arcane debate about whether trade union influence in preselections should be reduced from 60 per cent to 50 per cent, they actually produced a model which gives the trade union movement, this decaying social and economic base which is the Labor Party's narrowing connection with the Australian people, more say—not less—in the Australian Labor Party's affairs. It is pathetic! It is, in the words of Senator John Button in the title of his essay, `beyond belief'. 
All political parties are places of vigorous competition. In all political parties aspirants will recruit their supporters to come to their assistance in ballots. There is nothing wrong with that practice. As the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Lynton Crosby, said recently:
One man's branch stack is another man's membership drive.
That was Mr Crosby's observation. We in the Queensland division of the Liberal Party, which I so proudly represent in this place, have in fact increased our membership steadily, not sporadically, over the years.
—We don't fly them in.
—I must respond on behalf of my own division of the Liberal Party to the rather uncharitable suggestion that, having an embarrassingly small number of members in the state parliamentary party, the division is not performing well at all levels of politics. At the level of politics that we represent in this chamber—the federal level—the Queensland division of the Liberal Party is performing magnificently well. Did you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, that the Queensland division of the Liberal Party returns 15 members to the House of Representatives—as many as the Victorian division of the Liberal Party does, a state with almost twice the population? Did you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there are now more government members— of course you do, Mr Acting Deputy President; I do not mean to insult your intelligence or your wisdom—from Queensland in the government party room here in Canberra than from any state other than New South Wales, with two and a half times the population of our state? We in the Queensland division of the Liberal Party stand proud of our achievement, particularly in securing the return of the Howard government. We stand proud of our achievement over many years in punching above our weight as a participant in the federal Liberal Party's affairs.
As I said a moment ago, political parties will always be fields of vigorous competition, and it is right and proper that that should be so. The question is this: who are able to be the competitors? In the Labor Party, unless you are a trade union heavyweight you do not even get a go. Unless you are a member of the 14 per cent of the Australian work force that has a link of union affiliation with the Australian Labor Party, you do not even get a go. In the Liberal Party our doors are open to all, and that is why we have become the great mass based political party of Australian politics—just as Sir Robert Menzies conceived the Liberal Party to be when he shaped it in the late 1940s.
Let me conclude on this note: Senator Ray, in a slighting reference to my friend Senator Mason and me, referred to a trip around western Queensland which the federal Treasurer accompanied us on last week. One of the things we saw on that trip was a woeful excuse for a shrub in Barcaldine. It is called rather grandly the `tree of knowledge'. I want to describe it to you. It is a gum tree. It stands beside the Barcaldine railway station and beneath it there is a plaque which purports to record the historical fact—it may well be a piece of apocrypha which has become romanticised over the years—that beneath the branches of that tree in 1891, during the course of the great shearers strike of that year, the body met from which the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party was ultimately formed. Let there be no denying that in the 1890s, particularly in my state of Queensland, the Australian Labor Party had a proud record. It formed briefly under Anderson Dawson the first Labor government in the world in, I think, 1903. The glory days of the Labor Party—that is, those days about a century ago—began under that tree in Barcaldine. If you look at the old photographs of it, you will see what a magnificent, majestic tree it was. If you looked at it today, it could serve as the most exquisite metaphor for the modern condition of the Labor Party. First of all, it is practically dead. Its life was only saved by tree surgeons a couple of years ago—I believe at taxpayers' expense, because the Beattie Labor government in Queensland has been bold enough to claim it as a national heritage site or worthy of protection by the state environment department. Its trunk is maintained by plaster and cement— 
—Yes, it is, Senator Forshaw. Above the once mighty trunk there stretch a few miserable, weedy, half-decayed branches. The disproportion between the dead but once mighty trunk and the few shrivelling, weedy, pathetic branches that emerge from it could not be a better metaphor for the modern Australian Labor Party in that attractive and sleepy town of Barcaldine in western Queensland. If you wanted to see a metaphor for the state of the current Australian Labor Party as diagnosed by one of their great ministers during the time of the Hawke government, Mr John Button, you would not look any further.
The former Labor Party Federal President, Mr Barry Jones, said that the way the Labor Party was going at the moment it was at risk of becoming a heritage party and, just like the heritage tree at Barcaldine—that pathetic shrub—that is what the Labor Party is today. It is a shadow of its former self, so much so that we see the performance piece of a man like Senator Ray, who, as I say, can stand up in this place and with a straight face condemn branch stacking and with a straight face tell us about the evils of factionalism. Yes, that was Senator Robert Ray—the great factional chieftain, the great factional warlord, the mentor of the junior factional warlord, Senator Stephen Conroy.
We saw Senator Ray condemning character assassination. Yes, that was Senator Ray condemning character assassination! This was the Labor Party which, not all that many years ago, members of this chamber might recall, during the course of preselection for a seat in Sydney—and Senator Forshaw might help me with the name of the seat—was engaged in such an ugly contest that one of the participants in that preselection was savagely bashed to within an inch of his life. That was Mr Peter Baldwin who went on to win a preselection somewhere and became, I think, a minister in the Hawke government. Nobody in Australian politics should ever forget the haunting image of the bashed, bruised and scarred face of Mr Peter Baldwin on the front page of the Sydney papers the next morning under the headline `This is the face of modern Labor'. 
We in the Liberal Party have vigorous contests, but the violence, the criminality, the sheer political thuggery which has been so much a feature of the Labor Party in its decline, in its decay, is unique to the Labor Party and something about which they ought not to do anything other than hang their heads in shame. People like Senator Ray ought not lecture the Liberal Party on vigorous internal competition. They should try to conduct their own internal competitions without dishonesty, without illegality and— as they have done in some cases—without actual physical violence.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-08-21,"—I most certainly cannot bring to the chamber the oratorical abilities of Senator Ray or the immaculate legal mind of Senator Brandis. But I will try to bring this debate back to, and focus on, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. I believe that to some degree that will probably be more appreciated by the people who are listening to this debate on broadcast.
I would like to commence my comments on the bill by quoting from a research paper by the Department of the Parliamentary Library called `Australia's political parties: more regulations?' In the `major issues' section of the paper the Department of the Parliamentary Library has this to say:
The private aspects of parties has provided no means for aggrieved party members to challenge their parties' actions in court. A pivotal 1934 High Court case reinforced the view that their rules did not form a contract that was enforceable—
that is, the rules of the political party—
and as a matter of law it was held that party members had no personal interest in a party's assets. The parties therefore asserted their freedom to act without any type of external oversight. 
Today, however, various factors suggest that they should have a greater level of accountability to the Australian people—
and my emphasis is on the people who make up the party. The paper continues:
It is now much harder to sustain the case that parties are private bodies, in some way beyond the law:
·	of great importance is the fact that several recent court cases have thrown doubt on the extra-legal nature of parties 
·	parties now a constitutional presence, as well as a presence in legislation
·	in addition, the establishment of public electoral funding has produced legislative changes which have seen the first serious parliamentary `interference' in party operations
·	some observers believe parties' own tough internal behaviour has helped produce a loss of support in the wider community, and
·	there has been a shift in society towards expecting more accountability and transparency in our institutions.
Not all political systems have allowed the same degree of freedom to their political parties, and many Western democracies move to adopt regulatory arrangements well before it became an issue in Australia. Such nations:
·	have seen parties as public organisations which have not only a responsibility to their members for their actions, but also to wider community
·	have placed close-checking requirements on parties if they receive public funding
·	believe parties have a role to preserve the democratic nature of the state within which they operate, and
·	see parties as having a responsibility to implement democratic practices within their own internal operations.
The question therefore arises: 
does more need to be done to make parties accountable to the Australian public, let alone to their own members?
That is the opening quotation of the Parliamentary Library's research paper. The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 seeks to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, allowing the agent of the Liberal Party of Australia—that is the federal secretariat—to determine the distribution of election funding between federal secretariat and the state and territory divisions of the Liberal Party. One Nation believes that the geographical distribution of that the federal funding to political parties should not be the purview of this parliament. Once federal funding has been obtained, distribution should proceed as an internal party matter. This bill clearly demonstrates that some sections of the Liberal Party want to use legislation to override other sections of the party.
The effect of the bill will be to centralise more power within the federal structure of the Liberal Party. This centralisation flies in the face of the spirit of the Australian Constitution. Mr Acting Deputy President, if you cast your mind back and try to envisage what life was like at the turn of the 1800s, we have a series of colonies separated by vast distances with little or no communication between them. One of the major concerns of each of those individual colonies was the issue of states rights and the possibilities of states losing their power to a centralised body. This was a critical concern in framing the Australian Constitution. Section 51 was framed and worded to specifically restrict the function of the Commonwealth government in relation to states rights. In relation to section 51, noted constitutional experts Sir John Quick and Sir Robert Garran have stated:
The federal government can claim no powers not granted to it by the Constitution: powers actually granted must be such as are given expressly or by necessary implication. The instrument is to have a reasonable construction according to the import of its terms; where a power is expressly given in general terms, it is not be continued to particular cases, unless that construction grows out of the context or by necessary implication.
Further, they note:
A law in excess of the authority conferred by the Constitution is no law: it is wholly void and inoperative; it confers no rights: it imposes no duties; it affords no protection ... What is not so granted to the parliament of the Commonwealth is denied to it.
Furthermore, the Constitution does not authorise political parties. Their existence has come about by convention. This is reflected by the fact that the federal funding for political candidates is paid to the individual candidate, not the political party. The candidate then agrees that the party can become an agent to receive the funding. It is debatable whether the parliament even has the scope to legislate on the matter before us.
Several justifications for the introduction of this legislation have been presented. The first rationale is that the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party is responsible for federal election campaigns and therefore it is appropriate that all of the party's or part of the public funding be paid to an agent of the federal secretariat. This is nonsense. The ALP has reached its own accord within the party in relation to the distribution of funding and there is no reason why the Liberal Party cannot do the same. The second rationale is that the legislation will enable the Liberal Party to streamline administration of the GST. All I can say is if the Liberal Party is trying to find a way around the GST then bad luck. Let the Liberal Party comply with its own policies. The final rationale is that the amendments serve to settle an unresolved dispute between the federal secretariat and certain state and territory divisions.  
The Liberal Party wants to use federal legislation to mitigate internal party wrangling. This legislation raises wider issues regarding the distribution of funding to political parties. I am not talking about federal funding. One Nation fully supports the federal funding of political parties. What I am referring to is corporate patronage of political parties. It is simply naive to believe that big donors will never want a return on their investment. Of course, the major parties reject the suggestion that corporate patronage has the capacity to influence policy decisions. Members of parliament have a sworn duty to do the best for the Australian people and any suggestion that politicians can be bought off is repugnant. But questions on corporate donations to political parties continue to resurface. This is a potential hot potato among constituents who believe the large corporations combine political donations with intensive lobbying. The Australian Electoral Commission's submission returns for the financial year 2000-01 indicate that the Liberal Party received $21,813,658 in donations; the National Party received $6,659,664 in the same period and the Labor Party received $31,888,812. The total amount donated to the Liberal, Labor, and National parties during that period was in excess of $60 million. By far, the major donations were from corporations.
Corporate political funding is a very touchy area indeed and here are a couple of examples from the media. The Age on 2 February 2001 reported Special Minister of State, Senator Eric Abetz, saying he would pursue changes to electoral laws after it was revealed that Labor's single biggest donor was the public relations company Markson Sparks, which collected $829,255 on behalf of the ALP. In the same story the Age reported that the Victorian Labor Party accused the Victorian Liberals of hiding a $60 million slush fund in a network of shady companies and fundraising organisations. Clearly, there is innuendo and there are accusations surrounding corporate donations to both major political parties. 
Australia's major political parties are yet to pay back significant financial donations obtained from disgraced companies, despite creditors being out of pocket. Australian political parties have not followed the lead of the US politicians who have returned donations that could help victims of failed companies like Enron. The US politicians have returned corporate donations to former employees, creditors or charities assisting former employees. There are two controversies here in Australia that I will use as an example. A $100,000 HIH donation was made to the New South Wales Liberal Party in 1999 and a $181,000 gift from the entrepreneur Karl Suleman's Froggy business to New South Wales Labor. 
Sydney investors faced losses of up to $65 million from Mr Suleman's Froggy business failure while the HIH crash is one of Australia's worst corporate collapses. A media report on News Limited's web site indicates that so far only the Western Australian Labor Party has agreed to repay a $10,000 donation to Suleman's businesses. Liberal Party national director, Lynton Crosby, is reported to have said that he would only consider giving back the $100,000 HIH donation if Labor returned its money from Suleman. The bottom line comes down to a disagreement between Liberal and Labor, not what might be an ethical decision to help people who are adversely affected by corporate collapses.
I would also like to raise the issue of material benefits that may be provided to political parties. The provision of your own labour is not a gift for the purposes of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. However, the provision of someone else's labour—that is, paid by you—may be. What happens if a corporation uses this provision to put company experts at the disposal of political parties during election campaigns? Media strategists, public relations experts or fundraising personnel could simply take leave to work on a campaign. I put it to you that the imbalance caused by corporate donations that go to all political parties must be corrected. It is in the interests of achieving a more healthy democracy. One Nation does not have a problem with federal funding of political parties, but corporate patronage is far worse. The rules work very heavily in favour of the big parties. 
In conclusion, I would like to quote from the Department of the Parliamentary Library's research paper entitled Australia's political parties: more regulation? Under the heading `Their Own Worst Enemy?' it states:
Parties perhaps need to be alert to dangers posed by a decline in public support for their activities, both inside and outside parliament. In many democratic societies the level of public support has reportedly fallen to a record low. This is confirmed in the case of Australia, where it has been claimed by Professor Ian McAllister of the Australian National University that one in three voters believe politicians use public office to line their pockets, and even fewer believe that their political leaders have `a high moral code'. Discussions in the Labor Party since the 2001 Commonwealth election have linked such matters to the decline in party memberships: `For those without political ambitions who simply wish to make a contribution, rank-and-file membership of the ALP is profoundly unappealing'.
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-08-21,"—by leave—I give notice that, at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting, it is my intention to withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 standing in my name for the disallowance of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Regulations 2001 (No. 2).",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,28,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-08-21,"—I want to address my comments tonight to the absolute failure of Senator Hill's defence spokesman in the House of Representatives, Ms Danna Vale. On at least two occasions she has been asked questions on the Super Seasprite project. On each occasion, she has refused to address the details of the question and has sought to deflect attention by saying that the project is essentially one of a previous Labor government. She argues that tenders closed not long after Labor left office, but she never explains why the contract for the Seasprites was signed in June 1997, a full 15 months after Labor's departure from office.
Minister Vale's failure to acknowledge that three Liberal defence ministers had responsibility for this program prior to the 2001 election really condemns those ministers as being asleep at the wheel. She is in effect saying—and I do not endorse it—that Ministers McLachlan, Moore and Reith did a bad job. That failure, together with a failure to answer questions, indicates that she is not fit to hold office. There are obvious shortcomings in the current Seasprite contract. It is not easy to ascribe responsibility for this. Is it the fault of the Navy, the government or contractors? We will never know if we have to rely on Minister Vale. She merely tries to apportion blame without analysis. She tries to argue that Labor should never ask a question on this matter because the whole issue was one of our own creation. This is absolute nonsense.
It is the duty of an opposition to scrutinise government. I acknowledge that bipartisanship in the defence area is highly desirable, but it does not mean or imply that you do not examine government programs. If as a defence minister I operated in a climate of bipartisanship, I never once expected that the five shadow ministers that I had in six years would not pursue issues to do with equipment purchases and the efficiency of the Department of Defence. So why should Mrs Vale believe that we should not pursue these matters? 
It was the incoming Liberal government who chose Kaman Aerospace for this particular project. If it was not satisfied with Kaman's offer, then it should not have taken it up. And if it was not satisfied that Kaman could deliver a good product, then it should have at least looked properly at the Westland alternative. I must say, I always thought Westland would win this tender, but, to save $200 million, the option was taken up with Kaman Aerospace. Mrs Vale complains that there was not a liquidated damages clause in the original request for tender. It was entirely up to Minister McLachlan, when it got to contract negotiation stage, to determine whether or not a liquidated damages clause was put within that contract. The Labor government never got to see the final tenders and never got to negotiate the final contract, yet Mrs Vale seems to think that it is all our fault if something goes wrong five or six years later. Mr McLachlan probably had his own reasons for not going down the route of liquidated damages, but people can pursue it with him.
The crucial role for a minister in all this process really lies in two areas: in making sure, firstly, that the tender process evaluation is fair and responsible and, secondly, that the final contract does justice to the Australian taxpayers. That is the role of the minister. It is not to get in there and write software or crawl over the belly of a ship or anything else; it is at those two crucial stages. Of course, much has been made of the decision to try to have commonality between frigates and OPVs with regard to helo capacity. Certainly, when this government made the decision not to proceed with the OPV program, it was wide open then for it to reopen the question as to which helo capacity it wanted to have for the frigates. It chose not to do so. If you look at this government's track record with regard to early warning aircraft, it opens tenders and closes tenders; it then cancels the process and reopens the process somewhat later—at great cost to the taxpayer, I might add. So, if you are not satisfied with the tender process and who has tendered, it is not as though it is impossible to reopen it, make the appropriate compensation and get a better outcome.
Let me note in passing that the OPV project was cancelled in 1997. In retrospect, wouldn't it have been an ideal platform for border protection these days? It would be a far cheaper and far more efficient option than having frigates and destroyers and other things patrolling off the North West Cape of Australia. The OPV, as it was then designed, would have been an ideal vehicle to enforce border protection, especially with its helo capacity. It is also true to say that it may not have rated in the Navy options or priorities; we have to concede that. We also have to concede that it was probably a far more expensive option once the Malaysians pulled out of a joint project. So it was not as though there were not valid reasons not to proceed with the OPV program back in 1997. But, equally, having made that decision, you can then have much better options as to what sort of helo you put on the back of a frigate. This government did nothing about it; it just proceeded with the project as it was going.
I am not, tonight, going to make judgments on the success or otherwise of the Seasprite program. It is a truism to say that anything that involves complicated software will involve a major risk. Failure to meet timetables with regard to defence equipment that has complicated software is the norm. If you meet timetables on time, that is the exception. But what an irony that, having gotten into difficulty on this project, the government should turn to Computer Sciences of Australia for software: the very firm that was responsible for not delivering on the Collins class submarine integrated combat system. The very one that failed to write the software and deliver on that has now been called in to write the software on the Seasprites.
I have taken the precaution of reacquainting myself with all the documentation there was on the subject before I ceased to be Minister for Defence. I am allowed to do this on the basis of refreshing my memory. I will not be quoting from the documents nor tabling them, nor have I shown them to anyone else. But, having gone back and read those documents, it is quite clear that we were always going to be left with a difficult tender process given the fact that at one stage we had six contenders that were interested in tendering for this project. By the time tenders closed, only two remained. Eurocopter, Augusta, Bell and Sikorsky all dropped out. That leaves a difficulty for a government of any persuasion, I have to concede. And, indeed, the type of naval helicopter we wanted was not specifically available, which meant you had to take another helo platform and modify it for Australian use. 
I can assure the Senate that when I was briefed on this project never once were the airframes or the complicated nature of the software mentioned to me. That all came later, and that was dealt with by Minister McLachlan in whatever form, so for Mrs Vale to continue with her obfuscation on this issue is just not on. In politics you must accept blame when you are responsible for it. When it is your watch and things go wrong, you have to accept blame. The Seasprite problems occurred on the Liberal Party watch, so it is up to them to fix the problems and not deliberately and falsely accuse the previous government of having a role to play here. It is not easy with some of these projects—I concede that. They run late, and that is true, as you would know, Mr Deputy President, right around the globe. But what we want in this parliament is accountability. We want Mrs Vale to actually answer the questions she is asked, to make the appropriate explanations and not accept the advice of some crackpots in the Department of Defence—because it is only a couple of them— that say, `Oh, you don't have to answer any of these questions: just blame the previous Labor government and they will shut up.' That is not on. It did not happen on our watch. I do not ascribe blame for any of the faults that have occurred, because I do not know the full circumstances, and we will never know them from Mrs Vale. She has a duty to answer questions on this and not hide behind the blame game.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Defence: Seasprite Helicopters</title>,Adjournment,29,1
