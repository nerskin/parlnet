Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (09:02):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Since Federation, industry and government have worked in partnership to support the productivity of rural industries and improve the reputation of Australian exports abroad. Government support developed in an ad hoc manner until, in 1989, John Kerin and the Hawke government had the foresight to establish the research and development corporation model. The research and development corporations, or 'RDCs', were established under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 (the Act). For 24 years, our investment in the RDCs has boosted the productivity and sustainability of rural industries. This bill will make improvements to the existing RDC model and ensure it remains responsive and adapted to our needs.


There are 15 RDCs providing services to a diverse range of rural industries. The RDCs provide the mechanism for industry to invest collectively in research, development and, importantly, extension. Government assists by establishing and collecting a levy if an industry requests this. After recovering costs, the government returns levy funds to the relevant RDC. To encourage this investment, the government matches the RDC's eligible research and development (R&D) spending up to legislated limits. In the next financial year almost $250 million will be invested by the government in rural innovation in this way. Our collaborative model is unique, viewed with envy overseas and benefits all Australians by encouraging profitable and sustainable rural industries.


There are many challenges facing our rural industries. These include climate change, the vagaries of the global economy and increasing populations to feed. There are also opportunities such as increasing exports of Australian agricultural products, particularly to Asia. To ensure our own food security, economic stability and the health of our agricultural resources, the RDC model needs to be updated in line with our changing needs.


Our rural research and development model has proven results, with Australian rural productivity increasing at more than double the rate of other Australian industries over recent decades.



A government member:  Hear, hear!




Mr SIDEBOTTOM:
  Hear, hear! The high level of industry engagement and the strong support the RDC model enjoys from all sectors make it unique among research funding models around the world. Research, development and extension have a vital role in preparing Australian rural industries for the future challenges and opportunities we face together.


In 2011, the Productivity Commission and the Rural Research and Development Council reviewed the rural research, development and extension system in Australia. Consultation meetings around Australia were held with all interested stakeholders. The ideas and issues raised by stakeholders fed into the government's response: the Rural Research and Development Policy Statement. Ultimately both the Productivity Commission and the council acknowledged the strong foundations of the existing system. Both recommended improvements to the system.


This bill and its companion bills, the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment Bill 2013 and the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment Bill 2013, implement the commitments made in the policy statement that require legislative change. They will commence concurrently.




Marketing activities



Of the 15 RDCs, nine are industry owned companies and can already carry out marketing for the benefit of their industry. This bill will give the statutory RDCs the same ability to undertake marketing, if the relevant industry proposes a marketing levy and the government agrees to collect it. Government matching funding will not be used for marketing, only for research, development and extension services.


There is great enthusiasm for allowing statutory RDCs to undertake marketing. The prawn industry has already started down the path of establishing a marketing levy. We have well-established processes to guide industries through the consensus-building process for a levy proposal.


Permitting statutory RDCs to undertake collective marketing will allow industry to educate consumers about the safety and nutritional value of Australian products, the origin of our food and fibre, and the ecological sustainability of our resources.




Matching of voluntary contributions



Primary industries understand that our R&D model is unique and generates benefits far exceeding its cost. This model creates a healthy return on a modest investment. As a result, some businesses in the rural sector are willing, and are able, to make additional voluntary payments to conduct R&D.


The bill will encourage voluntary contributions by making arrangements for the contributions to be matched by government. Currently some RDCs can receive this matching funding and the bill will extend access to matching funding for voluntary contributions to all RDCs. Overall matching funding will continue to be limited by a cap based on each industry's gross value of production. However, RDCs may be able to maximise the R&D they fund by strategically using voluntary contributions to top up R&D spending. Voluntary contributions also allow supply chain partners to work with an industry on issues of joint interest.




Funding agreements



Over the last 10 years, funding agreements between the government and industry owned RDCs have been used to manage governance and performance matters. This bill extends funding agreements to the government relationship with statutory RDCs. Funding agreements will create a flexible mechanism, which can be more readily modified to reflect the changing needs of the parties.


Funding agreements will be used to promote transparency and accountability. The agreements will be tabled in parliament and contain requirements relating to corporate governance and performance. These agreements will also allow government to provide guidance to RDCs regarding the research priorities and needs of the broader Australian community. The bill allows until 1 July 2014 for the statutory RDCs and government to enter into funding agreements.




Appointment process for statutory RDC board directors



Current procedures for appointing directors to statutory RDC boards have proved expensive and time-consuming, diverting scarce resources away from statutory RDCs' core functions—providing R&D for their industries.


Amendments in the bill will streamline the selection process. Selection committees will be limited to five members and the committee will be established for up to three years to cut the expense of establishing a committee for each selection process. A 'reserve list' will be created that can be used to fill unplanned board vacancies for 12 months. If a candidate with the necessary skills is not available from the list, the process must begin again.


The presiding member must have regard to equity and diversity when recommending members to the selection committee of a statutory RDC. Similarly, the selection committee must do the same when recommending candidates for the board of a statutory RDC. Diversity of skills and background can broaden and enhance the board's skill base to ensure an effective statutory RDC board.




Fisheries research and development



The Fisheries RDC receives most of its funding through the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. The farmed prawn industry is the only individual fishery with a statutory R&D levy. 


The bill creates a new class of fisheries R&D levy that can be matched by the government without having to form part of jurisdiction's contribution. The amendments will permit new, individual fishery-sector levies to be collected and matching public funding provided up to a cap specific to that fisheries sector. 



Each separately levied fishery will be subject to existing eligibility rules for matching funding. In effect, the fisheries sectors which so choose, will be able to invest in specific R&D and marketing by proposing a levy for that purpose. 




Minor amendments



To reduce unnecessary red tape, this bill provides that statutory RDCs will no longer have to seek ministerial approval for their annual operating plans. This has become an avoidable burden for both RDCs and the government. Ministerial oversight will focus on strategy rather than day-to-day management. Annual operating plans will be required, but ministerial approval will not.


Minor amendments will remove redundant parts of the legislation. For example, energy is no longer part of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio, so all references to 'energy' will be removed from the act. References in the act to R&D councils and funds are obsolete and will be removed, making the act easier to understand and administer.


Other minor amendments encourage consistent treatment of RDCs, including standardising requirements to comply with ministerial directions and standardising delegation powers. 'Scientific and technical capacity building' will be added to the objects of the act. 




Conclusion



The changes in this bill will make RDCs more flexible and responsive to deal with the new realities they face. The governance processes for RDCs will be streamlined, promoting certainty and consistency for levy-payers and other stakeholders. We will retain a strong focus on transparency, accountability and effectiveness. 


Debate adjourned.

Introduction




The government is committed to providing regular reports and updates on Afghanistan, including to the parliament.


This is my third report to the parliament this year.


On 7 February this year I presented an update on transition in Afghanistan. As this process gains pace and we look towards the very substantial drawdown of the ADF in Uruzgan at the end of this year, it is appropriate to again update parliament and the Australian people on progress towards transition.


This update follows on from my visit to Afghanistan on 2 June. 




Afghan-wide 
T
ransition



Progress continues to be made on transition across Afghanistan. Australia welcomes the announcement yesterday of the fifth and final tranche of transition, which will see Afghanistan's final provinces and districts enter transition. With the inclusion of these final districts into the transition process, Australia welcomes the achievement of the so-called 'Chicago Milestone', where the Afghan National Security Force officially takes the national lead for security responsibility for all the districts in all of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, all of which have now entered transition.


Throughout Afghanistan, the Afghan National Security Force is growing more competent and capable. The Afghan National Security Force participate in all operations and are in the lead in 95 per cent of these—from routine tasks, including combat service support missions, medical evacuations and route clearance operations to high-level tasks such as special operations. The ANSF indigenous training capability is increasingly developing with the ANSF delivering up to 90 per cent of their own training.


In keeping with this trend, on 11 April this year, the Australian-led Artillery Training and Advisory Team (ATAT) officially completed its mission to establish a fully autonomous Afghan National Army School of Artillery and the ADF personnel relevant to that training mission have returned home.




Australia
'
s 2014 Role



In 2014, the Australian commitment to Afghanistan will include a commitment of around 75 personnel, including instructors and advisers, support staff and force protection at the Afghan National Army Officer Academy in Kabul, together with our British and New Zealand colleagues.


In Kandahar, the ADF will continue to provide advisory support to the 205 Corps of the ANA through an adviser and force protection complement of over 50. The ADF will also maintain its commitment of 10 advisers to the Logistics Training Advisory Team in Kabul.


Australia currently has over 100 staff embedded within a range of ISAF headquarters. The embed commitment in 2014 is expected to evolve as ISAF prepares for the post-2014 train, advise and assist mission. A possible Special Forces role remains contingent on government consideration and consultation with the United States and ISAF over Australia's possible post-2014 Special Forces role.




Post-2014 NATO-led Mission



At the Chicago summit in May 2012, ISAF nations and the Afghan government agreed to work together to establish a new NATO-led post-2014 mission to train, advise and assist the ANSF. We are well down that path. At the recent NATO/ISAF defence ministers' meeting in Brussels on 4 June, the concept of operations for the post-2014 train, advise and assist mission was endorsed by defence ministers. Operational planning for the post-2014 mission will continue to develop through the remainder of 2013.




Australia
'
s post-2014 role



Australia is prepared to maintain an ADF presence in Afghanistan to support stability and security after the completion of nationwide transition at the end of 2014. Australia will continue to provide training and advisory support to the ANSF through the NATO-led train, advise and assist mission to Afghanistan. Under an appropriate mandate, Australia is prepared to make a Special Forces contribution, either for training or for counter-terrorism purposes, or both. The actual size and scope of Australia's post-2014 ADF contributed is yet to be determined.


As well, Australia will contribute $US100 million annually for three years from January 2015 as part of international efforts to sustain and support the ANSF beyond transition, a continuation of the $US200 million Australia committed in 2009 to help sustain the ANA in Uruzgan Province over the five years from 2009 until the end of 2014.




The National Security Interest



In my first statement on Afghanistan to the parliament as Minister for Defence on 20 October 2010, I said, 'Therecan be no more serious endeavour for any country or government than to send its military forces into conflict.' To send its men and women in uniform into harm's way, a country or government must have a clear national security interest reason to do so.




Lessons from Afghanistan



Australia's national security interest in our commitment to Afghanistan—past, present and future—is clear: to prevent Afghanistan from again being used by terrorists to plan and train for attacks abroad on innocent civilians, including Australians in our own region and beyond.




The Use of Military Force



Our experience over the last 10 years in Afghanistan has highlighted some important general lessons for the use of military force. It has reinforced the well-known point that it is the easiest thing in the world to get involved in major commitments, but it is substantially more difficult to get out. That is why, when a government makes a decision about a military intervention, it must very, very carefully consider whether that intervention is required in a country's national security and national interests.


In the case of Afghanistan, there was strong international community and bipartisan domestic support for the intervention in Afghanistan, mandated by the United Nations Security Council in December 2001. If there had not been a continually renewed United Nations mandate for Afghanistan, the international community, in my view, would have withdrawn years ago.


Progress in Afghanistan was substantially undermined as a result of Iraq, which was not the subject of a United Nations mandate and which did not have bipartisan domestic support either here or internationally.


International community focus shifted from Afghanistan in the latter half of 2002, in the lead-up to the Iraq War. This allowed the Taliban to regroup in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and reassert and rebuild its influence in southern Afghanistan from 2003 through 2005. As a result, from 2006 onwards, ISAF forces faced fierce opposition from a resurgent Taliban in southern Afghanistan. Focus shifted back to Afghanistan in 2008.


The subsequent surge of international troops and resources into Afghanistan and the sharper international focus led to the transition process and where we are today, but the regrettable fact is that valuable years, a half dozen years, were lost to the Afghanistan mission as a result of Iraq.




International decision making



From the earliest days, the government was forthright in demanding a place at the international table when key decisions were made on Afghanistan. My ministerial predecessors Ministers Nelson, Fitzgibbon and Faulkner did very valuable work on that front. Australia insisted that strategic level decisions on Afghanistan were taken by the International Security Assistance Force, not just by NATO.


While the government was prepared to put our men and women in uniform into harm's way to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a breeding ground for international terrorism, we were equally determined to ensure that from 2008 Australia was part of the decision-making process for the international community's strategy on Afghanistan.




Strategy and Mission



In Lisbon in November 2010, leaders from Afghanistan and ISAF countries agreed that a conditions based transition to Afghan led security begin in 2011, with the aim of completing transition by the end of 2014. The international community agreed at the Chicago summit in May 2012 to continue to fund, train and support the Afghan National Security Force post transition, and to consolidate and build on the security gains of the transition strategy.


The international community also committed to supporting Afghanistan's development in the long term, including through the signature of long-term strategic partnership agreements. Long term support to Afghanistan, its institutions and its security forces are an important signal to the people of Afghanistan, the Taliban and the region that the international community will not walk away from Afghanistan at the end of 2014.


This long-term support is an important safeguard against the inevitable pressure the Taliban will seek to bear on Afghan institutions of state and the Afghan National Security Forces with transition to Afghan led security responsibility. Similarly, a continued special forces contingent will be important to maintain an active deterrent against the re-emergence of international terrorists.


These two elements—long-term international support and continued special forces assistance—will be important both to sustain the transition to Afghan security responsibility and to ensure the viability of what the international community has achieved in Afghanistan.


If, following the transition to Afghan security responsibility, Afghan institutions and the Afghan security forces were to collapse, or Afghanistan was again to re-emerge as a base for international terrorism, the Australian public would rightly question whether stabilisation operations and humanitarian interventions were worth the cost in lives and resources.


That is why Australia has committed to the long-term support of Afghanistan and is prepared to maintain an Australian Defence Force presence in Afghanistan to support stability and security after the completion of nationwide transition at the end of 2014. That is why I have stressed that under an appropriate mandate, Australia is prepared to make a special forces contribution, either for training or for counterterrorism purposes, or both.


The requirements of Australia's adherence to the rule of law in Afghanistan, our approach to civilian casualties and our detainee management framework, are exacting. They have however stood the ADF and their well-deserved reputation in good stead and allowed the ADF to retain the pride and support of the Australian people in the job they are doing.



Our international reputation, our credibility and our reliability as a partner as a result of our experience in Afghanistan have been enhanced consistent with the finest traditions of Australia and the ADF in combat or warlike operations: first class fighters, and respectful of international law and highly conscious of the rights of civilians and locals.




Afghan-led Peace and Reconciliation Process



I said to the House in my 7 February 2013 statement that Australia has long supported an Afghan-led peace and reconciliation process, recognising that conflict in Afghanistan will not be ended by military force alone.


Australia welcomes the opening of an office in Doha for the purpose of negotiations between the Taliban and the High Peace Council of Afghanistan as part of an Afghan-led peace process.


Australia also welcomes the fact that United States representatives will meet the Taliban in Doha for talks aimed at achieving peace in Afghanistan.


These talks will necessarily be long, complex and inevitably subject to setbacks, but efforts at peace and reconciliation must continue.




Awards from Operations in Afghanistan



Australia's contribution to Afghanistan has seen great acts of bravery. Australia's highest military honour, the Victoria Cross for Australia, has been awarded to three outstanding individuals for their acts of exceptional courage: Trooper Mark Donaldson, Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith, and Corporal Daniel Keighran. 


Operations in Afghanistan have also seen the award of the Battle Honour Eastern Shah Wali Kot to the Special Air Service Regiment and to the 2nd Commando Regiment for their outstanding performance during the Shah Wali Kot offensive in Afghanistan from May to June 2010. Eastern Shah Wali Kot is the first Army Battle Honour awarded since the end of the Vietnam War. 


On 10 May this year it was my privilege to attend the presentation of the Eastern Shah Wali Kot Battle Honour to the Special Air Service Regiment at Campbell Barracks in Swanbourne, Perth. Today I will have the privilege of attending the presentation of the Eastern Shah Wali Kot Battle Honour to the 2nd Commando Regiment in Holsworthy, Sydney. 




Australian Battle Casualties





Australia
'
s mission in Afghanistan has come at a
 substantial
 price.


We have lost 39 ADF members and 254 personnel have been wounded in action to date.







We have achieved much in Afghanistan. We still have much to contribute.







Today in this 
p
arliament, we pay tribute to our wounded warriors and those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.


We will not forget them.





I take this opportunity to table a paper in conjunction with my ministerial statement and I seek leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Fadden to speak for 13 minutes.

",HoR,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,2,1
"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2013-06-19,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (09:37):  I thank the minister for providing his final update to the House for this parliamentary sitting. I thank the minister for his consistency in keeping the House informed regularly throughout his term as the Minister for Defence. He has done so quite openly and quite forthrightly.


Yesterday, the long war in Afghanistan reached another historic milestone. NATO and coalition forces formally announced the handover of the final provinces and districts to Afghan security forces. President Hamid Karzai described the announcement as a historic moment for his nation and the fulfilment of one of his greatest desires. Whether the President's desire will be met in the future is now fully and totally up to him, his government and their security forces. NATO and coalition forces, including substantial elements of the ADF, have done an enormous amount of heavy lifting over a very long decade. The ANA and the Afghan National Police, the ANP, are as equipped and as trained and prepared as they could be. Now is the final moment of the testing. Now we determine whether Afghan forces and the people of that country are able to rise up and realise their self-appointed destiny as a nation in the full concert of others around the world. 


The minister was right to recap on the just and right way Australia entered the war—to face the realisation of extreme Islamic terrorism head-on and to stand shoulder to shoulder with our American friends and other allies around the world. Terrorism is a threat that cannot and must not be negotiated with. It must be faced; it must be defeated.


This was the war that saw the ANZUS alliance activated. And we are not fair-weather friends; tens of thousands of Australia's finest men and women have poured through Afghanistan on continuous rotations. We have provided the third-largest special forces contingent within that troubled country, with numbers and numbers of our special forces soldiers rotating through on up to nine separate occasions. 


Ours has been a long and tough fight. We have provided substantial air, land and sea assets. As a nation we have provided the largest contingent of forces per capita; a phenomenal feat, not just as a non-NATO country but for any nation. We have not weathered great political storms that have seen other governments fall and forces withdrawn. The government and the opposition have stayed shoulder to shoulder in ensuring that a legitimate, right and just fight against those who would seek to do us harm was adequately and appropriately responded to. 


It has been a long road in this fight against extreme Islamic terrorism. We deployed forces in response to the barbaric acts of September 11 in late 2001. Apart from a hiatus in 2003-05, when Australia's contingent was two lone engineers, we have maintained a consistent and strong presence. We have paid an exacting price: 39 Australians killed in action; 254 wounded in action, including a special forces soldier in the last 24 hours, after a heavy landing of a Black Hawk; numerous bravery awards given to our fighting men and women, justly deserved, including three Victoria Crosses. 


Of course I will join the minister today when the 2nd Commando Regiment receives the Army battle honour for eastern Shah Wali Kot for its heroic fight in the May-June period 2010. 


The future now is Afghan security forces securing their own country, especially the difficult southern provinces and the districts that they will operate independently—under independent command, with independent force dispositions from the end of the year. Australian forces will come home from Uruzgan at the final parts of this year and early next year. And there is every indication that Uruzgan province will not have a coalition footprint post withdrawal as it has not yet been named as one of the 10 provincial areas where coalition forces will remain.


The 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army has been trained by the finest soldiers in the world: the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. They will operate in a province where there will be no coalition footprint to assist. They will truly have to realise their long-held dream of autonomy and security independently. Our military is proud of what they have been able to achieve. They have trained the Afghan forces to the highest possible standard. I am confident the 4th Brigade of the ANA will rise to the challenge.


The coalition will continue and will maintain its strong bipartisan support to the government on Commonwealth operations in Afghanistan right through to the election. I have been proud over the last three to four years, as the only member of the coalition shadow defence team here in the House of Representatives, to have put strong voice to that bipartisanship for our combat operations. It may surprise the Australian people to know that bipartisanship is not so much the minister and I at the dispatch box standing shoulder to shoulder; it mostly involves closed-door meetings, phone calls, joint flights, like that which the minister and I will do today to join the 2nd Commando Regiment, and keeping each other informed as to where we are going. Bipartisanship starts privately; it exhibits its face publicly. We have not wavered during some of the darkest days in this parliament when our casualties were high. The bipartisanship will continue through to the election and, regardless of the result, it will continue post election from the coalition's point of view. 


In responding to the minister's forced disposition post withdrawal, can I simply back up the minister with his view that post September, if the nation does elect a coalition government, they can be assured that we will continue with the planned withdrawal of the bulk of the combat force and that we will honour the agreements the concert of nations have put together in terms of future boots on the ground. That includes our long-held support to 'Duntroon in the desert'—because there is no way I am letting the Poms get away with calling it 'Sandhurst in the sand', which is the ANA officer training in Kabul—support we have offered from the very beginning. Likewise, this includes the logistics training advisory team, as well as continued embedded personnel within ISAF commands where it is warranted.


I note from the minister that our gunners have returned from running and commanding the Afghan school of guns, which was a remarkable success. It was a landmark contribution that had the hallmarks of the great things that Australia's fighting men and women do. Faced with having to train in a technical environment of gunnery, and with a largely illiterate Afghan force, it was the Australians, the young men and women, who devised an educational regime of teaching the gunners how to read and write within a six- or seven-week period as part of their training program. I believe it was so successful that commander ISAF came and visited to see what the Australians were doing in order to extend it further afield in other parts of training. The Anzac spirit of innovativeness and entrepreneurism on the battlefield continues to this day.


We join the minister in considering the use of any possible special force capabilities when we have greater clarity over the status of forces agreement that they would operate under. I believe the government is still working with its coalition partners in trying to get sufficient clarity on that. The minister and I have spoken at length about it, and sufficient clarity at present does not exist in terms of a mandate under which they would operate. Suffice it to say, we will engage quickly and strongly with our allies and partners, and we will demonstrate that great Australian spirit of reliability and conscientiousness as a partner.


The Australia Army can also rest easy that if there is a future coalition government it will not be resting on our laurels post Afghanistan. There will be no post-Vietnam long-peace approach to our military, a peace that I entered as a serving officer—and I look across at the minister for procurement, then Colonel Kelly, and it was a long peace that he entered—but that was interrupted by operations that, frankly, the military was not prepared for. We are committed to a hardened, networked Army which can operate in a network-centric joint environment as part of a maritime strategy. We are committed to the next phase of the Army's development, especially Land 121 Phase 4 and Land 400, which go to the bulk of the Army's vehicle replacements.


The post-Afghanistan Army, building on a very sensible and well-considered force generation cycle—plan BEERSHEBA—will be a tough, hardened capable force able to meet the government's strategy objectives. That is our aim for a post-Afghanistan military. In that spirit we have announced that there will be no cuts to the Defence Force under any incoming coalition government and that all savings from the bureaucracy will be reinvested back into Defence.


I thank the minister for his work with our wounded warriors and their integration back into Australia. We are in furious agreement with the minister on his concerted approach to caring for our wounded, both physically and mentally. We vociferously supported the MOU and a closer working relationship between Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and note the effectiveness of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel being one and the same person. That way the minister cannot hand something off to another minister; he has to hand it off to himself. That has proven to be a remarkably effective way forward and, considering the wind-down from Afghanistan, the issues we are now facing in mental health, and the extent of the MOU, there is considerable sense in continuing that approach.


Minister, thank you for the opportunity to speak one last time in this parliament on our combat operations. The withdrawal is progressing well. The amount of cargo being removed from the Afghanistan Theater of Operations is astonishing, as we seek to move almost $3 billion of equipment out through a limited land bridge and an extensive air bridge before shipping cargo back. We are now in a logistics battle, where our logisticians will rise to the fore. If there was to be a logistics war then this is it, and I am confident that our loggies can rise to the challenge. The minister can be sure that the coalition will provide considered bipartisan support right to the very end of this parliament. I thank the minister for the opportunity to update the House.

I think it is important that we have these briefings on our military engagement. As you are fully aware, that delegation felt that, when we move into a civil engagement after the military engagement, to honour the efforts of the military engagement we should ensure that that civil engagement of Australia in Afghanistan continues at a great pace. I hope that future parliaments will have reports about that civil engagement of the same standard that we have had during this parliament. I congratulate the Minister for Defence.

Mr JENKINS
 (Scullin) (09:50):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the following reports:


Eighth report of 2013—Examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011: Bills introduced 27 May-6 June 2013; Human rights and civil penalties, and


Ninth report of 2013—Examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011: Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Act 2012 and related legislation


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr JENKINS:
  by leave—I thank the House. The eighth report of 2013 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights sets out the committee's consideration of 37 bills introduced in the House from 27 May to 6 June 2013. The committee has identified 28 bills that do not appear to give rise to human rights concerns. Some of these bills do not engage human rights, some engage and promote rights, and a number engage and limit rights but are accompanied by statements of compatibility that set out an adequate justification for each of these limitations. In addition, two private members' bills may engage rights and the committee leaves open the option of examining these bills further in the event that the bills proceed to further stages of debate. Two bills were introduced without statements of compatibility and the committee will write to the proponents of those bills seeking clarification of this. The committee will seek further information in relation to the remaining seven bills.


In this eighth report of 2013 the PJCHR sets out its understanding of the human rights law position on civil penalties. Since commencing its work in August 2012, the committee has noted a number of bills containing civil penalty provisions and has sought clarification regarding the consistency of these provisions with the guarantees relating to criminal proceedings contained in articles 14 and 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In this report, the committee has set out its comments on the civil penalty provisions in four bills, indicating the type of analysis that it considers may be appropriate to include in statements of compatibility accompanying bills that introduce or incorporate civil penalty regimes. The committee thanks the ministers concerned for their detailed responses to the committee's comments and for their forbearance while the committee gave detailed consideration to this issue.


The committee has concluded that the civil penalty provisions in two of the bills are unlikely to be considered criminal. The remaining two bills contain civil penalty provisions that the committee considers may properly be characterised as 'criminal' in nature under international human rights law. As such, the committee has expressed concerns that where a person may be subject to a pecuniary penalty for a civil penalty contravention, in addition to punishment under a criminal offence for the same or substantially the same conduct, this may be inconsistent with the right not to be tried twice for the same offence as set out in article 14(7) of the ICCPR. To assist those involved in policy development, drafting and human rights scrutiny of these types of development, the committee has developed an interim practice note setting out its understanding of the human rights law position. Practice note 2 forms appendix 2 to the committee's report and is available on the committee's website.


The committee's ninth report of 2013 sets out the committee's examination of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Act 2012 and related legislation. The committee initially wrote to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship seeking information about the human rights compatibility of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Act 2012 on 22 August and 31 October 2012. The committee subsequently held two public hearings and accepted a number of submissions on this and related legislation.


Let me say at the outset that the committee does not underestimate the scale of the challenge facing the government. The committee is in no doubt that the risks faced by people seeking Australia's protection by irregular maritime travel are significant. The committee recognises that under international law every state has the sovereign right to determine who may enter its territory. However, the exercise of this right is subject to any obligations the state accepts under international treaties, including human rights treaties, or by which it is bound under customary international law. The committee acknowledges that the setting of immigration policies may involve judgements about the national interest and these national interest considerations may properly be taken into account in determining whether any restrictions on human rights resulting from the implementation of immigration policy are justifiable.


The committee has approached its consideration of the human rights implications of the policies implemented through this package of legislation using the same analytical framework that it consistently applies to the assessment of the limitation of rights in any bill or instrument that comes before it. I draw the attention of members to the analytical framework applied by the committee in its interpretation of the underlying human rights obligations and principles engaged by this legislation. Through its consideration of the measures in this legislation, the committee has focused on three key questions: (1) whether the measures are aimed at achieving a legitimate objective; (2) whether there is a rational connection between the measures and that objective; and (3) whether the measures are proportionate to that objective.


The committee considers that it is a legitimate and pressing objective for the government to explore all reasonable solutions to reduce the risks associated with irregular maritime travel. Nevertheless, in order to be justifiable under human rights law, such measures must be demonstrated to be rationally connected to the achievement of that objective and must be proportionate to that objective. On the basis of the evidence before it, the committee considers that the regional processing measures as currently implemented by this legislation carry significant risk of being incompatible with a range of human rights. To the extent that some of those rights may be limited, the committee considers that the reasonableness and proportionality of those limitations have not been clearly demonstrated.


In closing, I would like to emphasise that this consensus report reflects a careful and considered response to the human rights issues raised by this legislation. As such, I encourage honourable members to read the committee's comments on this legislation in their entirety. I emphasise that point: we ask that members read the committee's comments on this legislation in their entirety, that they do not cherry-pick, that they do not take it out of context. Not to look at the committee's report in its entirety diminishes the work of the committee.


I take this opportunity to thank my committee colleagues for their principled and collegiate approach to the consideration of these complex and contentious issues. I commend them for their concerted efforts to set aside partisan positions in considering questions of human rights compatibility, in the consideration of this legislation and consistently in the consideration of all legislation that comes before the committee. I commend the committee's eighth and ninth reports of 2013 to the House.

Mr JENKINS
 (Scullin) (09:50):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the following reports:


Eighth report of 2013—Examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011: Bills introduced 27 May-6 June 2013; Human rights and civil penalties, and


Ninth report of 2013—Examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011: Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Act 2012 and related legislation


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr JENKINS:
  by leave—I thank the House. The eighth report of 2013 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights sets out the committee's consideration of 37 bills introduced in the House from 27 May to 6 June 2013. The committee has identified 28 bills that do not appear to give rise to human rights concerns. Some of these bills do not engage human rights, some engage and promote rights, and a number engage and limit rights but are accompanied by statements of compatibility that set out an adequate justification for each of these limitations. In addition, two private members' bills may engage rights and the committee leaves open the option of examining these bills further in the event that the bills proceed to further stages of debate. Two bills were introduced without statements of compatibility and the committee will write to the proponents of those bills seeking clarification of this. The committee will seek further information in relation to the remaining seven bills.


In this eighth report of 2013 the PJCHR sets out its understanding of the human rights law position on civil penalties. Since commencing its work in August 2012, the committee has noted a number of bills containing civil penalty provisions and has sought clarification regarding the consistency of these provisions with the guarantees relating to criminal proceedings contained in articles 14 and 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In this report, the committee has set out its comments on the civil penalty provisions in four bills, indicating the type of analysis that it considers may be appropriate to include in statements of compatibility accompanying bills that introduce or incorporate civil penalty regimes. The committee thanks the ministers concerned for their detailed responses to the committee's comments and for their forbearance while the committee gave detailed consideration to this issue.


The committee has concluded that the civil penalty provisions in two of the bills are unlikely to be considered criminal. The remaining two bills contain civil penalty provisions that the committee considers may properly be characterised as 'criminal' in nature under international human rights law. As such, the committee has expressed concerns that where a person may be subject to a pecuniary penalty for a civil penalty contravention, in addition to punishment under a criminal offence for the same or substantially the same conduct, this may be inconsistent with the right not to be tried twice for the same offence as set out in article 14(7) of the ICCPR. To assist those involved in policy development, drafting and human rights scrutiny of these types of development, the committee has developed an interim practice note setting out its understanding of the human rights law position. Practice note 2 forms appendix 2 to the committee's report and is available on the committee's website.


The committee's ninth report of 2013 sets out the committee's examination of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Act 2012 and related legislation. The committee initially wrote to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship seeking information about the human rights compatibility of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Act 2012 on 22 August and 31 October 2012.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2013-06-19,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (10:37):  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Cook moving forthwith that the report from the Selection Committee meeting of June 18, 2013 at 5 pm be immediately tabled and reported to the House.


Earlier today I asked the Speaker when the Speaker intended to table the report of the Selection Committee before the House. She indicated that would be done after question time today in accordance with that process. At issue here is the fact that prior to that meeting yesterday the coalition sought to have the bill regarding the migration amendments to implement the 457 scheme referred to the Education and Employment Committee, which has just reported before this House. If the Selection Committee indeed has decided to refer that bill to the committee, then that bill cannot be debated in this place until that committee has considered that bill. What the government are trying to do is avoid parliamentary scrutiny of what is one of the most shameless attacks on skilled migrants that has come before this place, and it has been done at the behest of the union movement.


This motion and the reason why standing and sessional orders need to be suspended is to ensure that the government cannot ram their union driven attacks on skilled migration through this parliament over the last two sitting weeks of the 43rd Parliament. That is the intention of the government. Last night they tried this on and they were beaten in this House of Representatives. The government were defeated in the House when they tried to bring this on. One of the reasons they were defeated is that the minister for immigration, whose own bill this was the subject of, could not be bothered even turning up for the vote that would see his bill put before it. This is a shameless attack on process in this House and it should not be allowed to continue, and standing and sessional orders should be suspended to allow that report to be tabled.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Cook will resume his seat. I will just give some advice, though. The selection report has not been tabled. It is still privileged. Discussing the contents—

The SPEAKER:  I am clearly putting on record that it has not been tabled. The parliamentary secretary has the call.

  This is a serious issue. You are not in charge.

  It is a serious point of order. It goes to whether there has been a breach of privilege of this parliament with regard to—

Mr Morrison:
  I withdraw.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Sturt will resume his seat. As I have already indicated, I have grave concerns already about privilege and this issue. I also have grave concerns about the process of the Selection Committee, which has run successfully in this parliament, now being tampered with. As Speaker, I have already expressed my concerns and the tabling of the report is in accordance, as I indicated this morning, with the procedures adopted at the beginning of this parliament and to some—



Honourable members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  No. I am saying you are politicising what had been a selection process and I am expressing that concern, but I am allowing you to continue with the suspension. I am noting my concern, which I do not believe is outrageous at all but something a Speaker should have the right to do. The member for Sturt has the call.




Mr PYNE:
  Speaker, I certainly would not want to reflect on the chair so I will not comment on your contribution to the debate.

(1) full research report is completed on the true incidence and nature of abuses and non-compliance within the 457 visas program, in comparison to other programs, by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to substantiate the requirement for the measures proposed in the bill;


(2) full consultation program with industry and other stakeholders has been conducted by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship on the impacts of the measures contained in the bill; and


(3) regulatory impact statement has been completed by the Government in relation to Schedule 2 of the bill relating to the proposed labour market testing regime as required by the Office of Best Practice Regulation and submitted to the Parliament.

Mr Albanese:
  Speaker, I rise on a point of order.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The member has the right to raise a point of order! The member for Cook does not have the call; the Leader of the House does.




Mr Albanese:
  Thank you, Speaker. This is the second attempted suspension of standing orders in a row. In the past it has been ruled by previous Speakers that where there are—



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr Albanese:
  consecutive—thank you—suspensions of standing orders in order to disrupt the parliament, it has been regarded as disorderly conduct. Given the state of the parliament in our last sitting days and the amount of business that is before the parliament, I fail to understand what is motivating the member for Cook in moving this motion. The fact is this legislation was introduced in the normal way and is being dealt with in the normal way.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The member for Sturt will resume his seat. Yes, it is a consecutive suspension, but it is a different motion. The member for Cook has the call.




Mr MORRISON:
  Thank you, Madam Speaker. The point of this motion is to suspend sessional and standing orders to prevent this bill being debated in this parliament because the government has not consulted, it has not done its homework. It is making up claims about abuses in the system: 10,000 abuses, the minister has said, and he has had to openly admit that he just completely made it up. That is the basis for the bill that is coming before this parliament at the behest of the unions. Just how much more union business do you want to get into this parliament?




Mr Albanese:
  Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Cook is casting aspersions on the minister. He is not allowed. During a suspension of standing orders, he must discuss why standing orders should be suspended. He has not mentioned one word about that, and he is out of order.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms K Livermore
):  The member for Cook has the call.




Mr MORRISON:
  Standing and sessional orders should be suspended because the government is seeking to ram a union driven bill through this parliament in the last days of the 43rd Parliament. This bill has not been subject to the proper consultation and processes necessary for this House to consider it, and the government is seeking to ram through things on behalf of the unions.




Mr Albanese:
  Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 90, Reflections on Members, indicates:


All imputations of improper motives to a Member and all personal reflections on other Members shall be considered highly disorderly.


The member for Cook has reflected on the motivations of the minister who has brought this legislation before the parliament.



Mr Pyne interjecting—




Mr Albanese:
  The Manager of Opposition Business has just indicated, again, that the member for Cook is being disorderly—




Mr Pyne:
  No, I said that you were being disorderly!




Mr Albanese:
  by pointing out that he is putting forward the argument. He must stick to why standing orders should be suspended, and he must withdraw the reflection on the minister. He should withdraw.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms K Livermore
):  I thank the minister. I ask the member for Cook to withdraw, as requested by the minister.



An opposition member:  Withdraw what?




Mr MORRISON:
  To assist the House, I withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I appreciate that. The member for Cook will confine his remarks to the motion.




Mr MORRISON:
  Let me table, for the benefit of the House, the open letter to members of this parliament from the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia and the Migration Council of Australia, which have refuted the claim made up by the minister about 10,000 abuses of the system. It says:


We are greatly concerned by the lack of supporting evidence, damaging rhetoric and poor process …


This is why standing orders need to be suspended—because process and consultation have not been followed.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Cook will resume his seat. He is still not speaking to the motion to suspend the standing orders.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  This is vexatious!




Mr Albanese:
  There is some element of irony in those opposite objecting to points of order being made, but nonetheless this is a motion to suspend standing orders and the member for Cook—



Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order!




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  What is your point of order?




Mr Albanese:
  You never got to be Speaker, Bronwyn.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister has the call and will address his point of order.




Mr Albanese:
  The member for Cook must address why standing orders should be suspended.



Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting—




Mr Pyne:
  He is. This is a vexatious point of order.




Mr Albanese:
  Further to my point of order, under standing order 65, Deputy Speaker, while I have been giving my point of order, the member for Mackellar has continued to interject and throw slurs across the chamber, as has the Manager of Opposition Business. Both of them clearly want to be Speaker—and there have been opportunities to put themselves forward before now.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The minister has made his point of order. The member for Cook will continue addressing the motion before the House.




Mr MORRISON:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, as I was saying: standing and sessional orders should be suspended because this government is seeking to ram a bill through this parliament without following proper process and without doing the proper consultation and homework on the bill that is required. Again, I seek further to read from the letter:


… damaging rhetoric, poor process—




Mr Albanese:
  Standing order 90 indicates that you cannot make imputations against members. As Leader of the House, I have strong objections to the imputation that a bill is being 'rammed through' this parliament when there is no bill even being discussed in this parliament. No-one on this side of the House has moved that any questions be put. What we seek to facilitate is discussion—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister will resume his seat. The member for Mackellar is seeking the call.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I would refer you to page 189 of Practice. I would refer you to the paragraph that says that members have been disciplined by the chair for raising spurious or frivolous points of order or introducing debate when rising on a point of order and for persisting with a matter. As chair, Madam Deputy Speaker, it is incumbent upon you to rule him out of order and not take any more points of order, as the chair has often done when she sees that it is to put another spurious point of order.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Mackellar has made her point of order.

  Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Cook is casting aspersions on the minister. He is not allowed. During a suspension of standing orders, he must discuss why standing orders should be suspended. He has not mentioned one word about that, and he is out of order.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms K Livermore
):  The member for Cook has the call.




Mr MORRISON:
  Standing and sessional orders should be suspended because the government is seeking to ram a union driven bill through this parliament in the last days of the 43rd Parliament. This bill has not been subject to the proper consultation and processes necessary for this House to consider it, and the government is seeking to ram through things on behalf of the unions.




Mr Albanese:
  Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 90, Reflections on Members, indicates:


All imputations of improper motives to a Member and all personal reflections on other Members shall be considered highly disorderly.


The member for Cook has reflected on the motivations of the minister who has brought this legislation before the parliament.



Mr Pyne interjecting—




Mr Albanese:
  The Manager of Opposition Business has just indicated, again, that the member for Cook is being disorderly—




Mr Pyne:
  No, I said that you were being disorderly!




Mr Albanese:
  by pointing out that he is putting forward the argument. He must stick to why standing orders should be suspended, and he must withdraw the reflection on the minister. He should withdraw.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms K Livermore
):  I thank the minister. I ask the member for Cook to withdraw, as requested by the minister.



An opposition member:  Withdraw what?




Mr MORRISON:
  To assist the House, I withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I appreciate that. The member for Cook will confine his remarks to the motion.




Mr MORRISON:
  Let me table, for the benefit of the House, the open letter to members of this parliament from the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia and the Migration Council of Australia, which have refuted the claim made up by the minister about 10,000 abuses of the system. It says:


We are greatly concerned by the lack of supporting evidence, damaging rhetoric and poor process …


This is why standing orders need to be suspended—because process and consultation have not been followed.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Cook will resume his seat. He is still not speaking to the motion to suspend the standing orders.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  This is vexatious!




Mr Albanese:
  There is some element of irony in those opposite objecting to points of order being made, but nonetheless this is a motion to suspend standing orders and the member for Cook—



Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order!




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  What is your point of order?




Mr Albanese:
  You never got to be Speaker, Bronwyn.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister has the call and will address his point of order.




Mr Albanese:
  The member for Cook must address why standing orders should be suspended.



Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting—




Mr Pyne:
  He is. This is a vexatious point of order.




Mr Albanese:
  Further to my point of order, under standing order 65, Deputy Speaker, while I have been giving my point of order, the member for Mackellar has continued to interject and throw slurs across the chamber, as has the Manager of Opposition Business. Both of them clearly want to be Speaker—and there have been opportunities to put themselves forward before now.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The minister has made his point of order. The member for Cook will continue addressing the motion before the House.




Mr MORRISON:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, as I was saying: standing and sessional orders should be suspended because this government is seeking to ram a bill through this parliament without following proper process and without doing the proper consultation and homework on the bill that is required. Again, I seek further to read from the letter:


… damaging rhetoric, poor process—




Mr Albanese:
  Standing order 90 indicates that you cannot make imputations against members. As Leader of the House, I have strong objections to the imputation that a bill is being 'rammed through' this parliament when there is no bill even being discussed in this parliament. No-one on this side of the House has moved that any questions be put. What we seek to facilitate is discussion—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister will resume his seat. The member for Mackellar is seeking the call.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I would refer you to page 189 of Practice. I would refer you to the paragraph that says that members have been disciplined by the chair for raising spurious or frivolous points of order or introducing debate when rising on a point of order and for persisting with a matter. As chair, Madam Deputy Speaker, it is incumbent upon you to rule him out of order and not take any more points of order, as the chair has often done when she sees that it is to put another spurious point of order.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Mackellar has made her point of order.




Mr MORRISON:
 Standing and sessional orders need to be suspended in order to ensure that this government—

Mr Albanese:
  Firstly, under standing order 90, the member must withdraw that allegation against the minister.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (11:40):  I rise reluctantly now to speak on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013, given that the government has now forced this bill on this parliament, having had a majority of members of this place—albeit a simple majority, not an absolute majority—seek to prevent that and allow this bill to go through a proper process of consultation, for a regulatory impact statement to be provided and for there to be the research that is necessary to establish whether the premise of the bill is correct and there is indeed the problem that the government seeks to assert. The government having used its minority numbers to prevent the absolute majority required in the recent votes, we will now debate this bill.


This bill is an attack on those who come to Australia the right way to divert attention from this government's failure to do anything about those who come the wrong way, illegally by boat, which continues at record levels. These measures are designed not to improve the 457 skilled migration program, which is so important to this country, but to choke that program at the behest of the unions, choking the scheme with union red tape. This bill—and the reckless rhetoric of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and those from that side of the House who also decided to join in—ends decades of bipartisan support for skilled migration in this country. It goes against the grain of our immigration tradition. 


A few months ago, prior to February, there was a minister for immigration who actually supported skilled migration. That all changed when Minister Bowen was removed from that portfolio and replaced with Minister O'Connor. One of the things that changed on that day was that the union movement got hold of immigration policy in this country. The bill before the House today is proof of that, because prior to that time the previous minister was engaged in a very sensible process through the skilled migration advisory council that had received recommendations from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship that required only routine housekeeping measures that would have assisted with the administration of that scheme. The vast majority, if not all, of those measures could have been introduced by regulation, none of which substantially required legislation at all.


But what happened in February was that the Prime Minister and the minister for immigration decided to go and attack skilled migrants in this country. Of all places, they decided to do it in Western Sydney, where there are thousands upon thousands—tens or hundreds of thousands—of people who have come to this country as skilled migrants or are the second or third generation, or fourth generation indeed, in the families of skilled migrants who came to this country.


It is bad enough that this government has failed so badly on our borders and allowed people to come willy-nilly and illegally enter this country, and that the government is in denial about it. The communities in this country who, frankly, are so offended by this government's failure on our borders are those communities who came to Australia the right way. What the government is saying in this bill is that it has a problem with those who come to Australia the right way but it has no problem, it would seem, with those who come the wrong way. That is what sits at the heart of what we see here, and it is even seen in the way that these bills have come before this parliament.


The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in particular, and the government, sat on their hands while an important bill that had been supported by the coalition on this side of the House in November of last year to excise the Australian mainland—which was one of the recommendations of the Houston panel—wasted away up in the Senate until the opposition had to force the government to actually go and act on that bill. So on a matter of border security the government is happy to do nothing for months and months on end when it comes to matters that come before this House and the other place. But when it comes to their union mates they cannot get a bill into this place fast enough and seek to ram it through at every opportunity, even in the dying days of this 43rd Parliament. No request from the union movement to this government is too small for them to act upon, as if it was the most urgent issue facing the nation, because this is a government which have completely sold out to the demands of the union movement in the area of immigration policy and engaged in this grubby attack on skilled migrants to this country. They should be ashamed of themselves.


This bill has been strongly criticised by employers, industry groups, the Migration Council of Australia and labour market experts, including the government's own advisers, who have universally indicated there is no evidence, including from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, to support the suggestions of alleged widespread rorting by the minister. Labor are attempting to ram this through in what is nothing less than an attack on skilled migrants and, frankly, an insult to the tradition in this country which is seen at its best in projects like the Snowy Mountains Scheme and the Warragamba Dam, which were built by skilled migrants. Their descendants who now live across Australia, and particularly in western Sydney, are now the targets of the government's rage when it comes to matters on migration, rather than the smugglers who support them and those who come illegally to this country.


Labor continues to belittle and demonise people working as overseas workers here in Australia. It is a grubby thing that this government is doing through this bill, when an alternative path which was being pursued by the previous minister for immigration was the more sensible, the more adult and the more responsible route. That was something that the coalition would have supported but instead we get this. That is why the coalition will not be supporting this bill.


The coalition has serious concerns about this bill, not the least the fact that it has no regulatory impact statement for schedule 2. There has not been proper consultation. This bill contains this bizarre back-to-the-future attempt to reintroduce labour market testing which operated from 1996 to 2001 and was found, independently, to be ineffective, costly and a significant delay to employer recruitment action. An important program was doing a good job. A measure that the government seeks to introduce was found not to be helping that task and it was abolished. But most concerning is that the bill is based on a false premise. The government, and the minister in particular, have completely made up the numbers regarding widespread rorting and abuse of the 457 program. From the outset we have said to the government, 'Present your case, show us the research, give us the numbers, demonstrate how this area of the migration program has been subject to anything more than the types of regular abuse you would expect under any other scheme.' The answer has been silence—with crickets—because there is nothing there. This is nothing more than jumped-up rhetoric for the Prime Minister to try and deflect attention from her woeful administration and oversight in her government of Australia's immigration program, particularly in relation to the integrity of our borders.


The measures contained in this legislation require a parliamentary inquiry, and that is something we have been seeking. I hope that will occur, but this bill should never have been debated if this matter had been referred to a committee for that purpose. This is not an attempt by a responsible government to finetune a working program. This is an attempt to choke a program. Instead, this bill is classic union overreach put in place by a minister dominated by union masters to do the bidding of the unions before the election because Labor needs the cash of the unions.


This bill seeks to introduce a number of additional compliance and onerous enforcement measures. These changes represent a major additional regulatory burden on business—more union red tape. Over 18,000 additional regulations have been introduced by this government on business and the community in this country since they have sat on that side of this chamber. Is it any wonder why businesses are struggling with innovation and competitiveness when they are spending all of their time being compliance officers for a regulatory-hungry Labor government? That is what happens.


This government think they are the answer to every problem, and they have solved not one of them. Yet they still think the answer is more labour regulation. On every occasion the answer is more labour regulation. Well, it is not the answer. It is not the answer in this matter and it is not the answer in so many of the other matters where this government has sought to force increased regulation on businesses and the community in this country. Whether it is the charitable sector or whether it is the business sector, there is never too much regulation for those of the Labor Party and those who sit on that side of the fence.


The Prime Minister has exempted this bill from a regulation impact statement for unspecified exceptional circumstances, with no substantiation of that. There is no explanation of that. Well, here is the explanation—the unions want it, she is going to do it for them and that is why this bill is in this place. That is why process has been set to one side because this Prime Minister is not prepared to count the cost of this measure. She does not want to know what the cost is. She just wants to do it for the union movement because that is who the true sponsors of this bill are. It is not clear exactly what those exceptional circumstances are, other than what I have just said. But certainly it is exceptional that a Prime Minister's enthusiasm to trash-talk skilled migration and demonise 457 visas and damage our international reputation on these matters is entirely regrettable.


Demographer Professor Peter McDonald, who was a member of the government's Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, and arguably Australia's finest demographer, has labelled the Prime Minister's rhetoric on this matter 'nasty'. Those are his words, not mine. Those members opposite, when they go out into their electorates after this sitting fortnight, can explain these nasty measures to those skilled migrants who have come under the 457 program and are now contributing—as they always have been since day one—citizens of this country, why this government has such a problem with them and why they think the scheme that brought them to this country should now be choked off by these measures.


Labor's attack on skilled migration is nothing more than a desperate distraction. The bill requires further investigation into the regulatory impact these changes will impose on Australian business and industry, labour market efficiency and business productivity. We have sought to refer this matter to committees to ensure there are no adverse impacts arising that would prohibit business from accessing the skilled labour they need to support Australian jobs and investment.


This is nothing more than unsubstantiated assertions from the government that sits behind this bill. The first of those is the 10,000 rorts claim by Minister O'Connor. He simply made it up. He pulled it out of thin air mid-interview. There is no substantiation for this figure of 10,000 457 visa rorts. This minister is the boy who cried rort on this issue. He has been unable to substantiate his outrageous claims. When asked at a Senate inquiry on this matter, Dr Wendy Southern, a senior official of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, the deputy secretary of the policy and program management group—a highly respected public servant, I add—stated:


We certainly did not provide advice around a number of 10,000.


His own department has completely disowned him over these baseless claims he is making.


So where did the figure come from? The minister said later he made it up and was forced to backtrack. Department officials admit that, the very next day after the interview where the minister made up this claim, they had discussions with the minister 'around clarity'. When officials were asked what made the minister change his mind, DIAC's first assistant secretary of the migration and visa policy division, Mr Kukoc, said:


I am not in a position to provide advice in terms of what guided the minister to talk about that number.


I am not surprised. The minister cannot even talk about what led him to talk about that number. Mr Stephen Bolton, senior adviser in employment, education and training at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, gave evidence to a Senate hearing committee:


Never, to my knowledge, has a figure so high been raised.


…   …   …


There has never been any evidence given at any of the formal feedback structures that we participate in, or indeed our informal conversations with the department, of widespread abuse to the level claimed by the minister.


Mrs Anne O'Donoghue of the Law Council of Australia described it as 'an exaggeration of the situation'. Ms Angela Chan, National President of the Migration Institute of Australia, said:


We would only have the information that is provided through DIAC, and the statistics do not support either a 10,000 rort or a 100,000 rort.


When asked during the Senate inquiry into framework and operation of subclass 457 visas, enterprise migration agreements and regional migration agreements, not even Labor's union mates were able to save the day and produce raw data to back up the minister. Tony Sheldon, a well-known employer of 457s—almost as famous as the Prime Minister's own efforts in this area—has received just 24 complaints about 457 visas over the last two months since the federal Labor government began this smear campaign. They had received no specific complaints in the previous 10 months. Moreover, the TWU had not reported those 24 allegations to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Meanwhile, the ACTU claimed they had received allegations of rorting relating to around 150 individual cases. That is well short of the 10,000. The government was short by two votes on a vote last night. That is a much closer margin than this one. They said:


The usual practice is for the ACTU to refer complaints to the relevant union to follow up or to refer the visa holder to DIAC—


but would not say how many cases the union had actually passed on. They just said referrals happened 'where appropriate'. That is in spite of Mr Kukoc's testimony at estimates that 'the obligation is on the unions, if they have come across evidence, to pass that on to the department that is responsible for compliance in that area'.


Clearly, there is no evidence to back up the minister's claim of 10,000 rorts. Not even unions have been able to help the minister draw that long bow, but that has not stopped Labor from embarking on a shameful campaign to attack skilled migrants through their rhetoric and through the measures in this bill. This is a blatant area of hypocrisy. On 9 March 2012, Minister Bowen issued a press release that stated:


Skilled migrants deliver major benefits to the Australian economy in terms of contributing to economic growth and offsetting the impacts of an ageing population.


…   …   …


We know these workers can do the job and are ready to make a commitment to Australia …


Mr Bowen was right. He said on 10 May 2011 we need to ensure 'migration is shaped by Australia's economic needs, and the temporary business 457 visa is a key pillar in this approach.' They are the words of the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. He said:


The 457 visa program has proved to be highly responsive to labour market conditions.


On 3 September 2012, the minister said:


The subclass 457 visa allows businesses to employ overseas workers for up to 4 years in skilled occupations only.


…   …   …


The program cannot be used by a business as a substitute for training and employing Australian workers.



The 
Sunday Mail in Brisbane reported on 20 January 2013 a comment attributed to a spokesperson for immigration minister Bowen:


The government's first priority is always ensuring jobs for Australian workers. The 457 visa program is designed to address genuine labour shortages that cannot be met from the Australian labour market and we believe we have this balance right.


That was the offering from the minister's office on this matter. The minister's spokesperson went on to say it would be 'irresponsible' to shut down the 457 visa program, but that is the intent of these measures. They are union red tape designed to choke a skilled migration program that has delivered for Australia. You should be ashamed of yourselves.


Minister Burke, another cabinet minister, told The Australian Financial Review on 30 March, 'When there are genuine skills shortages, employers are able to quickly recruit temporary overseas workers to fill skills gaps and keep the economy growing.


This bill is based on a completely false premise. The government has been unable to substantiate this bill. That is why I move the following second reading amendment to the bill:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""consideration of the bill not be concluded by the House until a:


(1) full research report is completed by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship on the true incidence and nature of abuses and non-compliance within the 457 visas program in comparison to other programs to substantiate the requirement for the measures proposed in the bill;


(2) full consultation program with industry and other stakeholders has been conducted by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship on the impacts of the measures contained in the bill; and


(3) regulatory impact statement has been completed by the Government in relation to Schedule 2 of the bill relating to the proposed labour market testing regime as required by the Office of Best Practice Regulation and the statement be submitted to the Parliament.""


Madam Deputy Speaker, the amendment is seconded. The value of the 457 program is significant to this country and you do not go and choke it through the measures that this government has proposed here without having done your homework. Given that the government is not prepared to do that, despite our calls for them to do that since February-March this year, this parliament should do the work for them. That is why this second reading amendment is important. The government has not brought forward the evidence, the regulatory impact statement, and undertaken the consultation that is necessary to justify or allow this House or the other place to consider the measures that are put forward in this bill, so this amendment is demanding that the government do that homework.


We see so often in this place with this government's 'ready, aim, fire' approach to legislation how often they get it wrong. Just last night in this place we were debating another bill where the government had so badly got it wrong the first time they had to bring in amendments last night to clean up their earlier mess, despite the fact the coalition had pointed them out to them at that time. We are doing it again here. We are saying: 'You have not thought this through, you have not done the consultation, you have not substantiated your case, you have not done what even this parliament requires in terms of process.' And you have not completed the regulatory impact statement because, as I said before, I suspect you just do not want to know.


The government does not want to know because there is one agenda here, and that is: 'Let's ram this through before the election because that is what our union mates want.' And when that is on the agenda, this government drops everything. That is what gets them moving. Perhaps we should get the unions to encourage them to stop the boats, maybe they will do something about it then—because when the unions want them to do this they can't move quickly enough!


As at 30 April 2013, there are 108,810 primary 457 visa holders in Australia. That is less than one per cent of the Australian workforce, despite the fact that that is a 20 per cent increase on the same number of 457 visa holders in Australia at this time last year. The 457 visa program is the dominant component of Australia's temporary skilled migration program. It is designed to provide a swift response to changes in demand for skilled and semiskilled workers where that demand cannot be met from within the Australian workforce. 457s are coalition policy: we designed them, we introduced them. They are a successful part of our very successful skilled migration program, which at least on this side we still believe in. We still stand by skilled migration. Those decades of bipartisanship on that issue vanished in February when the government went on this attack on skilled migration. 457 visa holders pay their own way; they make a contribution from day one. They are exactly the sort of migrants that we want to come to this country and should encourage. They even pay their own healthcare costs. They do not have access to welfare and in my home state they even pay to send their kids to public schools.


Research has shown that temporary skilled migration and 457 skilled migration visas are vital to the operation of the Australian labour market delivering significant economic benefits to the economy and the living standards of all Australians. 457 skilled migration visas have been vital in meeting skill shortages in regional locations and are an important component of state and territory migration plans for occupations such as doctors and nurses in regional Australia.



A government member interjecting—




Mr MORRISON:
  These are the people who are coming—doctors and nurses to support the health system in regional Australia. Apparently they are the ones we have to stop. Health care and social services accounted for 10 per cent of 457 visas granted so far in 2012-13 across the country. By contrast, mining accounted for just 6.6 per cent and has actually declined by 24½ per cent compared to last year. The great majority of 457 visas issued today are for people in higher skills occupations, such as accountants, managers, engineers, ICT professionals, doctors and nurses, where there is—as far as I am aware, and certainly the minister cannot put anything forward to substantiate anything different—little, if any, evidence of any abuse in the program.


The top five citizenship countries for applications granted to May 2012-13 were: India, with 22,170 grants; the United Kingdom, with 20,520; Ireland, with 8,680; the Philippines, with 6,690; the United States, with 5,830; and China, sixth, with 5,350. This is a program that is working well. According to Access Economics estimates, the 90,120 entrants on 457 visas in 2010-11 will generate $2.2 billion over three years or more and $27,000 each.


The members for, say, Parramatta, Reid and Greenway may want to explain to the large segments of their electorates where there is a substantial Indian community why this government is saying that 457 holders are visa rorters and abusers, given that one in five 457 visas are held by people of Indian citizenship and the highest rate of growth in 457s is for people of Indian citizenship. The minister's claim has been: 'We know they're rorting because the number of claims and applications is growing and they're growing faster than the rate of employment.' The community of people who are applying for 457s, who have one in five of the 457s given and have the highest rate of growth of 457s are people of Indian citizenship. So who are you claiming are rorting the system? Sorry, through you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask: who is the government claiming these 10,000 rorters are? Given that one in five are people of Indian citizenship, is that what they are suggesting? If they are, they should come clean about it, be honest and explain that to the people of their electorates, who know.




Ms King:
  I rise on a point of order, Deputy Speaker. I remind you that the member should address members by their proper title.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I will ask the member to observe that standing order.




Mr MORRISON:
  This is a program that delivers for Australia. These are people who come to this country to contribute from day one, whether they are of Indian nationality, of Chinese nationality or of Filipino nationality. They come and they work and they contribute, and the vast majority increasingly go on to be permanent residents of this country. I can think of no better migrant to Australia than one who comes via this program, one who comes on a 457 and offers their skills, and for four years demonstrates their capacity to contribute and then applies for permanent residence and goes on to citizenship. The rate of unemployment of people in the employer-sponsored permanent migration program and those who come through 457s is 0.5 per cent. That is the achievement. Not only that, they add value by the skills they bring to the country and the transfer that takes place.


That occurs in other countries as well. I refer the House to a paper by the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research and the Partnership for a New American Economy. They found that two primary categories of temporary foreign workers in the US are associated with strong job creation for Americans. The study found that states with greater numbers of temporary workers in the H1B program for skilled workers and the H2B program for less skilled nonagricultural workers had higher employment amongst US natives. Adding 100 H1B workers created additional 183 jobs for US citizens; adding 100 H2B visa class workers created 464 jobs for Americans.


This program creates jobs for Australians. It brings the skills that enable business to continue. How many jobs do you think Australians get if the business closes? That is the question I pose through the Deputy Speaker to the House. How many jobs do you think are going to be there if businesses go bust because they cannot get the people they need to meet the contracts and commitments they have? 


But what this government is doing through this measure is seeking, at the behest of the unions, to tie this matter up in union red tape and to choke this program's contribution to Australia. It chokes the appreciation that we have of the contribution of skilled migrants to this country. The members on that side of the House should be ashamed of this measure. Bipartisanship ended on skilled migration the day that this Minister for Immigration and Citizenship came into office and handed control of the migration policy of this country to the unions. Bipartisanship ended on that day.


The coalition stands by skilled migration. It stands by the contribution of the thousands and millions of skilled migrants who have built this country, and we stand here in support of them in opposing this bill by a government that is trying to ram things through for their union mates. They have not done their homework. They refuse to do their homework. They are trying to rush this through in the last, dying two weeks of this parliament as a bid to pay off their union mates before the election is held. (Time expired)

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,5,1
"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2013-06-19,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (11:40):  I rise reluctantly now to speak on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013, given that the government has now forced this bill on this parliament, having had a majority of members of this place—albeit a simple majority, not an absolute majority—seek to prevent that and allow this bill to go through a proper process of consultation, for a regulatory impact statement to be provided and for there to be the research that is necessary to establish whether the premise of the bill is correct and there is indeed the problem that the government seeks to assert. The government having used its minority numbers to prevent the absolute majority required in the recent votes, we will now debate this bill.


This bill is an attack on those who come to Australia the right way to divert attention from this government's failure to do anything about those who come the wrong way, illegally by boat, which continues at record levels. These measures are designed not to improve the 457 skilled migration program, which is so important to this country, but to choke that program at the behest of the unions, choking the scheme with union red tape. This bill—and the reckless rhetoric of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and those from that side of the House who also decided to join in—ends decades of bipartisan support for skilled migration in this country. It goes against the grain of our immigration tradition. 


A few months ago, prior to February, there was a minister for immigration who actually supported skilled migration. That all changed when Minister Bowen was removed from that portfolio and replaced with Minister O'Connor. One of the things that changed on that day was that the union movement got hold of immigration policy in this country. The bill before the House today is proof of that, because prior to that time the previous minister was engaged in a very sensible process through the skilled migration advisory council that had received recommendations from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship that required only routine housekeeping measures that would have assisted with the administration of that scheme. The vast majority, if not all, of those measures could have been introduced by regulation, none of which substantially required legislation at all.


But what happened in February was that the Prime Minister and the minister for immigration decided to go and attack skilled migrants in this country. Of all places, they decided to do it in Western Sydney, where there are thousands upon thousands—tens or hundreds of thousands—of people who have come to this country as skilled migrants or are the second or third generation, or fourth generation indeed, in the families of skilled migrants who came to this country.


It is bad enough that this government has failed so badly on our borders and allowed people to come willy-nilly and illegally enter this country, and that the government is in denial about it. The communities in this country who, frankly, are so offended by this government's failure on our borders are those communities who came to Australia the right way. What the government is saying in this bill is that it has a problem with those who come to Australia the right way but it has no problem, it would seem, with those who come the wrong way. That is what sits at the heart of what we see here, and it is even seen in the way that these bills have come before this parliament.


The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in particular, and the government, sat on their hands while an important bill that had been supported by the coalition on this side of the House in November of last year to excise the Australian mainland—which was one of the recommendations of the Houston panel—wasted away up in the Senate until the opposition had to force the government to actually go and act on that bill. So on a matter of border security the government is happy to do nothing for months and months on end when it comes to matters that come before this House and the other place. But when it comes to their union mates they cannot get a bill into this place fast enough and seek to ram it through at every opportunity, even in the dying days of this 43rd Parliament. No request from the union movement to this government is too small for them to act upon, as if it was the most urgent issue facing the nation, because this is a government which have completely sold out to the demands of the union movement in the area of immigration policy and engaged in this grubby attack on skilled migrants to this country. They should be ashamed of themselves.


This bill has been strongly criticised by employers, industry groups, the Migration Council of Australia and labour market experts, including the government's own advisers, who have universally indicated there is no evidence, including from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, to support the suggestions of alleged widespread rorting by the minister. Labor are attempting to ram this through in what is nothing less than an attack on skilled migrants and, frankly, an insult to the tradition in this country which is seen at its best in projects like the Snowy Mountains Scheme and the Warragamba Dam, which were built by skilled migrants. Their descendants who now live across Australia, and particularly in western Sydney, are now the targets of the government's rage when it comes to matters on migration, rather than the smugglers who support them and those who come illegally to this country.


Labor continues to belittle and demonise people working as overseas workers here in Australia. It is a grubby thing that this government is doing through this bill, when an alternative path which was being pursued by the previous minister for immigration was the more sensible, the more adult and the more responsible route. That was something that the coalition would have supported but instead we get this. That is why the coalition will not be supporting this bill.


The coalition has serious concerns about this bill, not the least the fact that it has no regulatory impact statement for schedule 2. There has not been proper consultation. This bill contains this bizarre back-to-the-future attempt to reintroduce labour market testing which operated from 1996 to 2001 and was found, independently, to be ineffective, costly and a significant delay to employer recruitment action. An important program was doing a good job. A measure that the government seeks to introduce was found not to be helping that task and it was abolished. But most concerning is that the bill is based on a false premise. The government, and the minister in particular, have completely made up the numbers regarding widespread rorting and abuse of the 457 program. From the outset we have said to the government, 'Present your case, show us the research, give us the numbers, demonstrate how this area of the migration program has been subject to anything more than the types of regular abuse you would expect under any other scheme.' The answer has been silence—with crickets—because there is nothing there. This is nothing more than jumped-up rhetoric for the Prime Minister to try and deflect attention from her woeful administration and oversight in her government of Australia's immigration program, particularly in relation to the integrity of our borders.


The measures contained in this legislation require a parliamentary inquiry, and that is something we have been seeking. I hope that will occur, but this bill should never have been debated if this matter had been referred to a committee for that purpose. This is not an attempt by a responsible government to finetune a working program. This is an attempt to choke a program. Instead, this bill is classic union overreach put in place by a minister dominated by union masters to do the bidding of the unions before the election because Labor needs the cash of the unions.


This bill seeks to introduce a number of additional compliance and onerous enforcement measures. These changes represent a major additional regulatory burden on business—more union red tape. Over 18,000 additional regulations have been introduced by this government on business and the community in this country since they have sat on that side of this chamber. Is it any wonder why businesses are struggling with innovation and competitiveness when they are spending all of their time being compliance officers for a regulatory-hungry Labor government? That is what happens.


This government think they are the answer to every problem, and they have solved not one of them. Yet they still think the answer is more labour regulation. On every occasion the answer is more labour regulation. Well, it is not the answer. It is not the answer in this matter and it is not the answer in so many of the other matters where this government has sought to force increased regulation on businesses and the community in this country. Whether it is the charitable sector or whether it is the business sector, there is never too much regulation for those of the Labor Party and those who sit on that side of the fence.


The Prime Minister has exempted this bill from a regulation impact statement for unspecified exceptional circumstances, with no substantiation of that. There is no explanation of that. Well, here is the explanation—the unions want it, she is going to do it for them and that is why this bill is in this place. That is why process has been set to one side because this Prime Minister is not prepared to count the cost of this measure. She does not want to know what the cost is. She just wants to do it for the union movement because that is who the true sponsors of this bill are. It is not clear exactly what those exceptional circumstances are, other than what I have just said. But certainly it is exceptional that a Prime Minister's enthusiasm to trash-talk skilled migration and demonise 457 visas and damage our international reputation on these matters is entirely regrettable.


Demographer Professor Peter McDonald, who was a member of the government's Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, and arguably Australia's finest demographer, has labelled the Prime Minister's rhetoric on this matter 'nasty'. Those are his words, not mine. Those members opposite, when they go out into their electorates after this sitting fortnight, can explain these nasty measures to those skilled migrants who have come under the 457 program and are now contributing—as they always have been since day one—citizens of this country, why this government has such a problem with them and why they think the scheme that brought them to this country should now be choked off by these measures.


Labor's attack on skilled migration is nothing more than a desperate distraction. The bill requires further investigation into the regulatory impact these changes will impose on Australian business and industry, labour market efficiency and business productivity. We have sought to refer this matter to committees to ensure there are no adverse impacts arising that would prohibit business from accessing the skilled labour they need to support Australian jobs and investment.


This is nothing more than unsubstantiated assertions from the government that sits behind this bill. The first of those is the 10,000 rorts claim by Minister O'Connor. He simply made it up. He pulled it out of thin air mid-interview. There is no substantiation for this figure of 10,000 457 visa rorts. This minister is the boy who cried rort on this issue. He has been unable to substantiate his outrageous claims. When asked at a Senate inquiry on this matter, Dr Wendy Southern, a senior official of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, the deputy secretary of the policy and program management group—a highly respected public servant, I add—stated:


We certainly did not provide advice around a number of 10,000.


His own department has completely disowned him over these baseless claims he is making.


So where did the figure come from? The minister said later he made it up and was forced to backtrack. Department officials admit that, the very next day after the interview where the minister made up this claim, they had discussions with the minister 'around clarity'. When officials were asked what made the minister change his mind, DIAC's first assistant secretary of the migration and visa policy division, Mr Kukoc, said:


I am not in a position to provide advice in terms of what guided the minister to talk about that number.


I am not surprised. The minister cannot even talk about what led him to talk about that number. Mr Stephen Bolton, senior adviser in employment, education and training at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, gave evidence to a Senate hearing committee:


Never, to my knowledge, has a figure so high been raised.


…   …   …


There has never been any evidence given at any of the formal feedback structures that we participate in, or indeed our informal conversations with the department, of widespread abuse to the level claimed by the minister.


Mrs Anne O'Donoghue of the Law Council of Australia described it as 'an exaggeration of the situation'. Ms Angela Chan, National President of the Migration Institute of Australia, said:


We would only have the information that is provided through DIAC, and the statistics do not support either a 10,000 rort or a 100,000 rort.


When asked during the Senate inquiry into framework and operation of subclass 457 visas, enterprise migration agreements and regional migration agreements, not even Labor's union mates were able to save the day and produce raw data to back up the minister. Tony Sheldon, a well-known employer of 457s—almost as famous as the Prime Minister's own efforts in this area—has received just 24 complaints about 457 visas over the last two months since the federal Labor government began this smear campaign. They had received no specific complaints in the previous 10 months. Moreover, the TWU had not reported those 24 allegations to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Meanwhile, the ACTU claimed they had received allegations of rorting relating to around 150 individual cases. That is well short of the 10,000. The government was short by two votes on a vote last night. That is a much closer margin than this one. They said:


The usual practice is for the ACTU to refer complaints to the relevant union to follow up or to refer the visa holder to DIAC—


but would not say how many cases the union had actually passed on. They just said referrals happened 'where appropriate'. That is in spite of Mr Kukoc's testimony at estimates that 'the obligation is on the unions, if they have come across evidence, to pass that on to the department that is responsible for compliance in that area'.


Clearly, there is no evidence to back up the minister's claim of 10,000 rorts. Not even unions have been able to help the minister draw that long bow, but that has not stopped Labor from embarking on a shameful campaign to attack skilled migrants through their rhetoric and through the measures in this bill. This is a blatant area of hypocrisy. On 9 March 2012, Minister Bowen issued a press release that stated:


Skilled migrants deliver major benefits to the Australian economy in terms of contributing to economic growth and offsetting the impacts of an ageing population.


…   …   …


We know these workers can do the job and are ready to make a commitment to Australia …


Mr Bowen was right. He said on 10 May 2011 we need to ensure 'migration is shaped by Australia's economic needs, and the temporary business 457 visa is a key pillar in this approach.' They are the words of the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. He said:


The 457 visa program has proved to be highly responsive to labour market conditions.


On 3 September 2012, the minister said:


The subclass 457 visa allows businesses to employ overseas workers for up to 4 years in skilled occupations only.


…   …   …


The program cannot be used by a business as a substitute for training and employing Australian workers.



The 
Sunday Mail in Brisbane reported on 20 January 2013 a comment attributed to a spokesperson for immigration minister Bowen:


The government's first priority is always ensuring jobs for Australian workers. The 457 visa program is designed to address genuine labour shortages that cannot be met from the Australian labour market and we believe we have this balance right.


That was the offering from the minister's office on this matter. The minister's spokesperson went on to say it would be 'irresponsible' to shut down the 457 visa program, but that is the intent of these measures. They are union red tape designed to choke a skilled migration program that has delivered for Australia. You should be ashamed of yourselves.


Minister Burke, another cabinet minister, told The Australian Financial Review on 30 March, 'When there are genuine skills shortages, employers are able to quickly recruit temporary overseas workers to fill skills gaps and keep the economy growing.


This bill is based on a completely false premise. The government has been unable to substantiate this bill. That is why I move the following second reading amendment to the bill:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""consideration of the bill not be concluded by the House until a:


(1) full research report is completed by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship on the true incidence and nature of abuses and non-compliance within the 457 visas program in comparison to other programs to substantiate the requirement for the measures proposed in the bill;


(2) full consultation program with industry and other stakeholders has been conducted by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship on the impacts of the measures contained in the bill; and


(3) regulatory impact statement has been completed by the Government in relation to Schedule 2 of the bill relating to the proposed labour market testing regime as required by the Office of Best Practice Regulation and the statement be submitted to the Parliament.""


Madam Deputy Speaker, the amendment is seconded. The value of the 457 program is significant to this country and you do not go and choke it through the measures that this government has proposed here without having done your homework. Given that the government is not prepared to do that, despite our calls for them to do that since February-March this year, this parliament should do the work for them. That is why this second reading amendment is important. The government has not brought forward the evidence, the regulatory impact statement, and undertaken the consultation that is necessary to justify or allow this House or the other place to consider the measures that are put forward in this bill, so this amendment is demanding that the government do that homework.


We see so often in this place with this government's 'ready, aim, fire' approach to legislation how often they get it wrong. Just last night in this place we were debating another bill where the government had so badly got it wrong the first time they had to bring in amendments last night to clean up their earlier mess, despite the fact the coalition had pointed them out to them at that time. We are doing it again here. We are saying: 'You have not thought this through, you have not done the consultation, you have not substantiated your case, you have not done what even this parliament requires in terms of process.' And you have not completed the regulatory impact statement because, as I said before, I suspect you just do not want to know.


The government does not want to know because there is one agenda here, and that is: 'Let's ram this through before the election because that is what our union mates want.' And when that is on the agenda, this government drops everything. That is what gets them moving. Perhaps we should get the unions to encourage them to stop the boats, maybe they will do something about it then—because when the unions want them to do this they can't move quickly enough!


As at 30 April 2013, there are 108,810 primary 457 visa holders in Australia. That is less than one per cent of the Australian workforce, despite the fact that that is a 20 per cent increase on the same number of 457 visa holders in Australia at this time last year. The 457 visa program is the dominant component of Australia's temporary skilled migration program. It is designed to provide a swift response to changes in demand for skilled and semiskilled workers where that demand cannot be met from within the Australian workforce. 457s are coalition policy: we designed them, we introduced them. They are a successful part of our very successful skilled migration program, which at least on this side we still believe in. We still stand by skilled migration. Those decades of bipartisanship on that issue vanished in February when the government went on this attack on skilled migration. 457 visa holders pay their own way; they make a contribution from day one. They are exactly the sort of migrants that we want to come to this country and should encourage. They even pay their own healthcare costs. They do not have access to welfare and in my home state they even pay to send their kids to public schools.


Research has shown that temporary skilled migration and 457 skilled migration visas are vital to the operation of the Australian labour market delivering significant economic benefits to the economy and the living standards of all Australians. 457 skilled migration visas have been vital in meeting skill shortages in regional locations and are an important component of state and territory migration plans for occupations such as doctors and nurses in regional Australia.



A government member interjecting—




Mr MORRISON:
  These are the people who are coming—doctors and nurses to support the health system in regional Australia. Apparently they are the ones we have to stop. Health care and social services accounted for 10 per cent of 457 visas granted so far in 2012-13 across the country. By contrast, mining accounted for just 6.6 per cent and has actually declined by 24½ per cent compared to last year. The great majority of 457 visas issued today are for people in higher skills occupations, such as accountants, managers, engineers, ICT professionals, doctors and nurses, where there is—as far as I am aware, and certainly the minister cannot put anything forward to substantiate anything different—little, if any, evidence of any abuse in the program.


The top five citizenship countries for applications granted to May 2012-13 were: India, with 22,170 grants; the United Kingdom, with 20,520; Ireland, with 8,680; the Philippines, with 6,690; the United States, with 5,830; and China, sixth, with 5,350. This is a program that is working well. According to Access Economics estimates, the 90,120 entrants on 457 visas in 2010-11 will generate $2.2 billion over three years or more and $27,000 each.


The members for, say, Parramatta, Reid and Greenway may want to explain to the large segments of their electorates where there is a substantial Indian community why this government is saying that 457 holders are visa rorters and abusers, given that one in five 457 visas are held by people of Indian citizenship and the highest rate of growth in 457s is for people of Indian citizenship. The minister's claim has been: 'We know they're rorting because the number of claims and applications is growing and they're growing faster than the rate of employment.' The community of people who are applying for 457s, who have one in five of the 457s given and have the highest rate of growth of 457s are people of Indian citizenship. So who are you claiming are rorting the system? Sorry, through you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask: who is the government claiming these 10,000 rorters are? Given that one in five are people of Indian citizenship, is that what they are suggesting? If they are, they should come clean about it, be honest and explain that to the people of their electorates, who know.




Ms King:
  I rise on a point of order, Deputy Speaker. I remind you that the member should address members by their proper title.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I will ask the member to observe that standing order.




Mr MORRISON:
  This is a program that delivers for Australia. These are people who come to this country to contribute from day one, whether they are of Indian nationality, of Chinese nationality or of Filipino nationality. They come and they work and they contribute, and the vast majority increasingly go on to be permanent residents of this country. I can think of no better migrant to Australia than one who comes via this program, one who comes on a 457 and offers their skills, and for four years demonstrates their capacity to contribute and then applies for permanent residence and goes on to citizenship. The rate of unemployment of people in the employer-sponsored permanent migration program and those who come through 457s is 0.5 per cent. That is the achievement. Not only that, they add value by the skills they bring to the country and the transfer that takes place.


That occurs in other countries as well. I refer the House to a paper by the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research and the Partnership for a New American Economy. They found that two primary categories of temporary foreign workers in the US are associated with strong job creation for Americans. The study found that states with greater numbers of temporary workers in the H1B program for skilled workers and the H2B program for less skilled nonagricultural workers had higher employment amongst US natives. Adding 100 H1B workers created additional 183 jobs for US citizens; adding 100 H2B visa class workers created 464 jobs for Americans.


This program creates jobs for Australians. It brings the skills that enable business to continue. How many jobs do you think Australians get if the business closes? That is the question I pose through the Deputy Speaker to the House. How many jobs do you think are going to be there if businesses go bust because they cannot get the people they need to meet the contracts and commitments they have? 


But what this government is doing through this measure is seeking, at the behest of the unions, to tie this matter up in union red tape and to choke this program's contribution to Australia. It chokes the appreciation that we have of the contribution of skilled migrants to this country. The members on that side of the House should be ashamed of this measure. Bipartisanship ended on skilled migration the day that this Minister for Immigration and Citizenship came into office and handed control of the migration policy of this country to the unions. Bipartisanship ended on that day.


The coalition stands by skilled migration. It stands by the contribution of the thousands and millions of skilled migrants who have built this country, and we stand here in support of them in opposing this bill by a government that is trying to ram things through for their union mates. They have not done their homework. They refuse to do their homework. They are trying to rush this through in the last, dying two weeks of this parliament as a bid to pay off their union mates before the election is held. (Time expired)

(b) the two activists were arrested for distributing literature protesting against China's claims to the Paracel and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea; and


(c) there are credible reports from various international agencies of continuing human rights violations in Vietnam which is evidenced by the high number of house detentions and imprisonment for people engaged in activities as basic as expressing views contrary to the Vietnamese Government's position; and

(3) is:


(a) concerned that approximately 50 per cent of needlestick, scalpel and other sharps injuries are not reported, with rates of under-reporting ranging from 40 per cent to 80 per cent; and

(4) acknowledges that preventative measures can be taken to reduce injury, including the use of safety engineered medical devices which, when combined with relevant education and training, reduces the incidence of sharps injuries;


(5) notes that Australia lags behind other western countries that have mandated measures to reduce sharps injuries, such as:


(a) the United States, that signed into law more than a decade ago the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act of 2000, 106 USC 430 (2000);

That this House notes that:


(1) Australia has an abundance of natural gas reserves, with gas production projected to quadruple from 2095 petajoules in 2010 to over 8,000 petajoules in 2034-35;


(2) the export of natural gas is booming, projected to triple from 20 million tonnes in 2010-11 to over 63 million tonnes by 2017;


(3) at the same time Australia's primary energy consumption of gas is expected to increase from 22 per cent in 2008-09 to 35 per cent in 2034-35, which is consistent with Government policy to shift households and businesses to more efficient and less carbon intensive energy sources;


(4) in Australia, manufacturing, mining and electricity generation are the largest consumers of gas, consuming 84 per cent;


(5) driven by near-term infrastructure and supply constraints, Australia is facing a price squeeze on gas at the same time as many large contracts for gas supply expire from 2014;


(6) Australian manufacturing and domestic suppliers are therefore heavily exposed to rising prices and access to contracts for supply of gas at competitive pricing;


(7) in North America, governments have adopted the strategy of giving priority to domestic supply at affordable prices over other uses as a means of reinvigorating their manufacturing sector, which has led to the establishment of new businesses in the United States and the creation of over 500,000 new manufacturing jobs; and

4. The committee determined that the following referral of a bill to a committee be made—



House Standing Committee on Education and Employment:


Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013.



REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION:



This bill has been strongly criticised by employers, industry groups, the Migration Council of Australia and labour market experts, including the government's own advisers who have universally indicated that there is no evidence including from the Department of Immigration to support the suggestions of widespread rorting alleged by the Minister and government.


The bill reintroduces labour market testing which operated from 1996 to 2001 and was found then to be ineffective, costly and a significant delay to employer recruitment action. It also introduces a number of additional compliance and enforcement measures. These changes represent a major additional regulatory burden on business yet the Bill has been developed without consultation with industry groups or labour market experts. In addition the Prime Minister has exempted the bill from a Regulation Impact Statement for unspecified exceptional circumstances.


The bill requires further investigation into the regulatory impact the proposed changes will impose on Australian business and industry, together with impacts on labour market efficiency and business productivity from the reintroduction of labour market testing in particular. An inquiry is required to ensure no adverse impacts arise that would prohibit businesses from accessing the skilled labour they need to support Australian jobs and Australian investment.

4. The committee determined that the following referral of a bill to a committee be made—



House Standing Committee on Education and Employment:


Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013.



REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION:



This bill has been strongly criticised by employers, industry groups, the Migration Council of Australia and labour market experts, including the government's own advisers who have universally indicated that there is no evidence including from the Department of Immigration to support the suggestions of widespread rorting alleged by the Minister and government.


The bill reintroduces labour market testing which operated from 1996 to 2001 and was found then to be ineffective, costly and a significant delay to employer recruitment action. It also introduces a number of additional compliance and enforcement measures. These changes represent a major additional regulatory burden on business yet the Bill has been developed without consultation with industry groups or labour market experts. In addition the Prime Minister has exempted the bill from a Regulation Impact Statement for unspecified exceptional circumstances.


The bill requires further investigation into the regulatory impact the proposed changes will impose on Australian business and industry, together with impacts on labour market efficiency and business productivity from the reintroduction of labour market testing in particular. An inquiry is required to ensure no adverse impacts arise that would prohibit businesses from accessing the skilled labour they need to support Australian jobs and Australian investment.

"Oakeshott, Robert, MP",Ind.,2013-06-19,"



Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (15:20):  I thank the shadow minister for communications, as well as colleagues within the government, for allowing this nation to go ahead, and you, Speaker, for allowing this most urgent debate to happen.


There is a view and mythology that loiters in Australia and in the corridors of this place, that the National Broadband Network build is some sort of expensive luxury spend. The urgency of this debate today, proved by a laugh received from a parliamentary colleague, is that this is an urgent, essential item and an investment with a rate of return for the Australian taxpayer. I raise it as a matter of public importance today, not just to make that point again but based on the most respected and most accurate report that comes out on a triennial basis, known as the Cisco Visual Networking Index. That is the global guidance for all governments around the world on global intranet traffic and what is happening with regard to the uptake and movement of data.


This is the most respected and the most accurate index that we have internationally. It normally errs on the conservative side, and it is indicating in its most recent report that we in Australia, regardless of the policy options on the table, have a problem of congestion that will emerge in the next five years. There is no question that by 2016 our network, if we continue to rely on copper, will be overwhelmed. The idea, the analogy, of pushing a pumpkin down a hosepipe has to start being the driver of policy solutions from all parties in this chamber. That is why this is urgent. This is not some long-term vision splendid and splash of money; there is an urgency about building this now to deal with the exponential growth in data that has been exposed by the most respected and accurate global index that we can get our hands on.


I am not lining up just one side of this parliament. This is going to be an issue for all policy. We should have addressed a failed, redundant, waterlogged, asbestos-riddled network a long time ago. By rolling out the NBN as per the corporate plan and the shareholder minister's letter we are going to have transition issues on the back end of a 10-year deal, as exposed by this VNI—this virtual networking index from Cisco, the most respected index that we can get our hands on. We will have issues with transition on the back half of the current corporate plan and of congestion in communities which are not yet on the rollout list. That should not be denied and there should be a consideration from the existing corporate plan and NBN Co., right now, on those issues of transition and congestion.


The answer is not to go backwards. The answer is not to continue to rely on copper in any form. That is why this most recent information from the global index really is a call for the Liberal and National parties to reconsider their position on this last-mile copper-to-the-node policy; to look at the exponential growth that is happening in global internet traffic and reconsider relying on copper. That is quote after quote, evidence after evidence, that that policy simply will not work.


The vice president of Cisco global technology, a gentleman called Dr Robert Pepper, currently sits on the board of the Federal Communications Commission of the USA and its UK equivalent, Ofcom. In these roles, he briefs governments and network operators from around the world on infrastructure and what to expect from future data requirements and modes of broadband usage based on the reality of traffic statistics and growth curves. He is an American; he has no dealings in Australia or with Australian politics whatsoever. This is what he said when releasing these most recent Cisco VNI figures. There are about eight items.


He has said that all roads point to the requirement of optic fibre being implemented deep into both wired and wireless networks. He does say the future is indeed wireless but it will be mostly wi-fi and not 4G, and he emphasises that this is complementary to a fixed-fibre network as the skeleton of the communications network in any country. He says that Australian mobile networks will soon have to join the US and the UK in the concept of offloading data onto local wi-fi networks in order to avoid congestion, which is the emerging issue of our failing communications network. He said that, as an example, a 4G mobile user—and there are many in this room—uses 28 times more data than a 3G user. That is part of the lead-in to this exponential growth in data demand. He says that the new wireless spectrum needs to be opened up as quickly as possible. I would say that is urgent to cope with the growth that we are seeing. He says that as much wireless traffic as possible needs to be seamlessly offloaded onto the wired networks to avoid congestion. Again, this is the emerging issue of this moment. He also says there is a huge increase in requirement for low-latency data transfer and high upload speeds. People have been listening to this issue of download speeds.


The issue that has been identified by the experts on global internet traffic is not download speeds; it is upload speeds that are the political and policy issue of the moment. He also said—again, not knowing anything much about Australian politics—that fibre needs to be very nearby every internet connection, whether wired or wireless. Here is the killer blow. Again, talking about internet trends generally—not just in Australia, but really making this point about last-mile copper—he has said that fibre-to-the-node infrastructure which relies on a last-mile premises connection using Australia's current copper infrastructure—its current HFC networks—or fixed 4G-like wireless will not have the symmetry, the contention ratio, the bandwidth or the latency to keep up with demand by 2016. He makes that point, but under the coalition's policy within four years the network will be overwhelmed. He makes the point that it will be overwhelmed before it is complete.


That is why this is urgent before this chamber. We have three months before a very significant decision will be made at the ballot box, on a policy difference in how we build our communications technology for this country. There is a corporate plan in place and a shareholder minister's letter that is currently delivering the rollout. It has a rate of return of over seven per cent. It delivers on telecommunications industry separation, which is long overdue in Australia. It drives an upgrade of the pits and pipes that were identified only a fortnight ago as being absolutely rubbish. This corporate plan actually drives an upgrade of this network of pits and pipes that was not necessarily built by Telstra and maybe not by Telecom, but maybe even by PMG—a long, long time ago. It is rubbish infrastructure that needs to be upgraded before we get into the issues of speed, reliability, pricing and rate of return to the taxpayer.


It absolutely does my head in when I hear members of parliament, who should know better, in conversations with their communities trying to spread the fib that this is a $90 billion spend or even a spend at all. This has a rate of return on investment to the taxpayer. It is an investment, not a spend. It is not a luxury item; it is an essential service for the future of this country. If we do not do it, we are going to have congestion on our internet in this country like we have never seen before. And it is going to be an enormous problem in business and in all forms of communication: health, education, personal, entertainment, whatever. Congestion is going to be our issue from 2016 and beyond.


The current government plan at least tackles it on the back-end of its 10-year rollout. If we allow this last mile of copper to be the winner of the day we are going to set ourselves up as the country that wants to put pumpkins down a hosepipe, that wants to build a one-lane Sydney Harbour Bridge and all the analogies you can think of. What are we doing even having a policy debate on this when the most respected, the most accurate global indices are saying we are going to have exponential growth and are going to hit a zettabyte by 2016? I am scared someone is going to ask me what a zettabyte is. My only response is that it is a lot. And it is a lot more than what is happening now.


A zettabyte, I am told, is over 11 times more than all the internet traffic globally in 2008. That is the type of exponential growth we are seeing. I am told that in 2016 or 2017 alone—depending on who you want to listen to—the NBN will deliver as much if not more global internet traffic than all the years of internet traffic before it. That is the exponential growth. We are becoming more and more reliant on and are grabbing the opportunities that are provided by the internet in all aspects of our personal and business lives.


The best we have got is saying we need to build fibre as deep as we possibly can into the infrastructure. Why are we arguing the toss on what is as deep as we possibly can when we get a rate of return by building it to the home? It just does not make sense that we are still stuck in the bog of a political debate when this is the opportunity for some really good visionary nation building.


I know everyone in every pub talks about what this country should do and what this parliament should do. Why are we blinking? Why are we falling for some sort of argument of max speed of download below what will be the international average speed? Why do we choose to set ourselves up so that by 2016 we will only just be ahead of Africa on the average speeds that are being offered by the Liberal and Nationals parties? We will just be ahead of the Middle East and Africa. We will be rivalling South America but we will be blown out of the water by the US and Europe. Why as a first world country can we not demand better than that? Why are we choosing the African model of fibre to a node that is going to be overwhelmed before it is complete?


Yes, many think this is a waste of money. Yes, many think this is a luxury item that we plucked off some top shelf of luxury items of policy and do not understand why we are delivering an upgrade to a 60-year-old redundant network that is going to blow its lid in the next four years unless we upgrade it. I urge the government to consider all those issues of transition that in my view are not as explicitly dealt with in their corporate plan and by NBN Co. on the back-end of their 10-year rollout. Post-2016 is going to be a problem if the policy settings stay as they are.


I urge my friend at the table, the shadow minister, to really do more to drag your side from blowing up this NBN network, and I give you credit for doing that, but to drag it that last mile of copper and get it to the home. That is what delivers ubiquity, delivers the rate of return and delivers on the issue of congestion that is emerging quickly.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2013-06-19,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (15:35):  The honourable member for Lyne has been chairman of the committee on the NBN, which I have been a member of over the term of this parliament, and I am disappointed by his remarks. After all this time and after familiarising himself with the NBN, he still shows himself to be so terribly confused about the nature of internet bandwidth and the requirements of a network. He quotes from a recent report published by Cisco called The zettabyte era. The zettabyte is, as I recall, 10 to the power of 21. It comes before a yottabyte, which is not to be confused with the Nepalese concept of a yeti bite. He refers to this report which talks about a massive increase in data being transmitted over the internet. Of course that is well understood. There is nothing new in that and it is described extensively in our own policy. This is being driven, as the Cisco paper discloses, by a massive increase in video entertainment or video traffic being carried over the internet. This is the growth of IP TV and more and more movies and television shows being carried over the internet, to the point where one-third of all of the bandwidth in the United States is being consumed by one company, Netflix, which is a movie and television entertainment download business. That is well understood. 


But the issue about the NBN is not whether there will be more bandwidth required in the network and not whether there will need to be more fibre capacity in the big cables in the core of the internet linking exchanges and linking countries and so forth. It is: what is the nature of the connection from the local exchange to the customer's premises—what is the size of the pipe in that last mile to the customer's premises? What the honourable member is confusing is an exponential growth in bandwidth across the network and assuming that that means you need to have a similar growth in the size of the pipe to the customer's home. If I can give honourable members an example that might make this clearer, it is a bit like this. If everybody in Sydney, for example, were to decide to have three one-hour-long showers every day, it would mean that Sydney Water would have to provide a lot more water. It may have to build another dam or another desalination plant. But it would not mean that every house had to have a bigger water pipe going into that house. You see, we will consume much more data through our internet connection but the size of the pipe—which is described misleadingly as talking about speed when it is really a question of capacity—whether it is 10 megabits per second or 25 or 30 or 40 or 100, does not necessarily need to grow. For example, if you want to watch a high-definition video, which is the biggest file that is typically transmitted over the internet to residential users, you need, we have assumed in our policy, about six megabits per second. Netflix know a bit more about this than any of us here, and their own publications say you need four megabits per second. So if you had, for example, a 25 megabit per second connection to the internet you could stream simultaneously four, or more than four—five or six—high-definition video streams. And so you could, as a household, be watching much more video, consuming much more data—hundreds and hundreds of gigabytes a month—but nonetheless not require that larger pipe. The issue, therefore, is: what is the utility of provisioning the larger pipe? We all understand that the utility of increased bandwidth, increased size of the pipe into your house, diminishes as it grows. To go from dial-up to five megabits per second, that is a big increase in utility. You can watch videos; there are a whole bunch of things that you can do that you could not do before. To go from five to 25 is another increase in utility, because if you have got a family with three or four people in it, they can all do that simultaneously. To go from 25 to 50, that may not be so much of an increase in utility. It is certainly not twice as useful. It may be a little bit better. To go from 50 to 100—it is very, very questionable how much of an increase in utility that is. The point is that it does not progress in a linear fashion.


The problem, however, is that because in order to reliably give everybody 100 megabits per second and more you would need to take, with current technology, fibre into every premise, the cost of taking everyone to 100 or better is enormous. Just as the marginal utility of higher speed starts to flatten out and become zero, that is when the cost of provisioning it goes through the roof. If you think about it in this context, if you can give everybody in a given area very high speeds, no one less than 25 and most people with 50 or better, for an investment of $1 million and meet all of their requirements—that is fibre to the node, that is the approach that we are talking about. If it costs you $5 million to take fibre to the premise so that they can have 100 or more, but with no incremental benefit to the customers, with no applications that they can use and value with that additional speed, then what you have got is $4 million of investment, enormous trouble and expense, enormous delay, and no return on it. Inevitably, you have a higher cost of connectivity. 


The fundamental problem that the honourable member overlooks is this: he says that the NBN has a seven per cent rate of return. That is the most extraordinary nonsense! I cannot believe that he could seriously say that the one thing—if we have learnt anything on the NBN joint committee, we have learnt that their financial forecasts are completely discredited. The contractors are going broke; we all know that. The project is failing. It will be lucky to make 15 per cent of its forecast build by 30 June, and we are taking their financial forecasts seriously? Come on, Deputy Speaker. The NBN Co. is a financial disgrace. It is the largest blank cheque ever written in the country's history. The government does not know how long it will take to complete, and they do not know how much it will cost. That, regrettably, is the truth.


We get back to this fundamental question of fibre to the premise. What is the additional benefit of taking fibre to the premise, and does it justify the investment? That is the key question. We could have had a very reliable, very considered, thoughtful, well-informed answer to that question if the government had lived up to its pledge in 2007 and had a cost-benefit analysis into this project. If the honourable member for Lyne had supported us consistently on this matter—



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  Well, he was not able to get his friends on the crossbench to do that, but the fact is that without that cost-benefit analysis, we simply end up having an argument about this rather than having some very hard numbers. 


If the proposition is that we should have fibre-optic cables deep into the network, we agree. The question is: how deep, how far? Alcatel-Lucent, the big telecom vendor, have got a good summary of this. They say that fibre should go to the furthest economically viable point. We agree with that. If you can achieve the bandwidth requirements that people need, as quickly as possible and at a lower cost, thereby making it more affordable, without taking the fibre right into the house, that makes sense.


As for the honourable member saying that fibre to the node is an African model, I did not know that the United States was in Africa; I did not know that Britain was in Africa; I did not know that Germany was in Africa. What an extraordinary statement, notwithstanding the rather unpleasant slur against Africa. The fact of the matter is that the approach that we are proposing it is one that is consistent with the practices of the major telcos around the world. By that I mean the honourable member down the back has never heard of Deutsche Telekom or British Telecom or AT&T or Bell Canada.



Government members interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  The Labor members are shouting because they know this project is failing. But the fact is that the honourable member does not know remotely what he is talking about. British Telecom have passed 19 million premises in their broadband upgrade, 10 per cent with fibre to the premises and the balance with fibre to the node.



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  If the honourable member wants to doubt that he should get in touch with Mike Galvin, who is heading the rollout. They cannot cope with the truth.


The honourable member for Lyne said that the Cisco report says by 2016 our network in Australia will be overwhelmed. It says nothing of the sort. What it actually says is that by 2016 it expects average speeds on fixed line broadband in the Asia-Pacific to be 41 megabits per second, and that is very achievable under our policy. Indeed, we see most of the premises under our policy having 50 megabits per second or better. The report sees the speeds for handsets being on average 3.9 megabits per second. The proposition that the network is going to be overwhelmed has no basis of fact in that report.


The real issue of congestion in the future is not going to lie in the last mile to the home. If we get into office that will be addressed within a few years and by the end of the next parliament everyone in the fixed line footprint will have at least 25 megabits per second, most will have 50 or better. We expect to build plenty of fibre to the premises, and wherever it can be done cost-effectively we will do so—greenfield sites and others that appropriately qualify. But the real congestion is going to lie further back in the network. This, I regret to say, is what the honourable member for Lyne simply does not understand. The NBN is not a complete telecom network. It is a customer-access network. It connects an exchange, called a point of interconnect, to the customer's premises.


I ask every member and anyone listening to this speech to check their line speed when you get an opportunity and then seek to download something from iTunes or some other service of that kind. I would be very surprised if you do not find that your rate of download is a lot less than your line speed. The reason for that is that in a telecom network the rate at which data is transmitted, at which signals propagate over the network, depends on the slowest link and the rate of the server to which you are connected. You may have 50 megabits per second between your house and the local exchange, but how much congestion is there behind your exchange back into the core of the network? How much congestion is there on the international cable? What is the rate that the server you are connecting with in the United States or wherever is delivering data? If it is very popular, you may be getting a very low rate of download.


If the honourable member is trying to say that we need to have more capacity in the core of the network and the backbone of the internet then he is absolutely right, although it is a penetrating glimpse of the obvious. But it is not a problem that the NBN will address, because the NBN is a last-mile customer-access network. So, yes—the NBN, under our approach, will certainly eliminate the last-mile bottleneck, but the questions of congestion will then be further back in the network. It will depend on how much capacity your retail service provider has bought, back into the core of the network, and all of the factors I mentioned.


So we do need more fibre. We do need it to the furthest economical point. But it is a great pity that the member for Lyne, after all these years, is still so confused on this important issue.

 (Ballarat—Minister for Road Safety, Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories) (15:50):  It is with a great deal of pleasure that I speak on what is a very important matter for regional communities, and I commend the member for Lyne for putting up this matter. In particular, I am disappointed that the shadow minister is leaving the chamber, because I wanted to take up a number of the points that he just raised in his contribution—but he is, of course, a very important man! And he is leaving the chamber in the middle of the debate on his core policy area.


I turn to the base assumption behind what the shadow minister has just said. The coalition's plan is based on an assumption that no-one will ever want or need more than 25 megabits. That is exactly what their policy is based on, and that is the base assumption. If the shadow minister's policy is so great, and if it is the best possible high-speed broadband policy for this country, why is it that everybody—everybody who knows anything about high-speed broadband—who is involved in this sector says that their policy is a lemon? I am going to quote some of those people.


Mark Gregory from RMIT in an interview on Triple J's Hack said: 'What the coalition are offering us, the Australian public, is, in real terms, an improvement on the one megabit per second for $30 billion, but it is the greatest lemon in Australian history.' Rod Tucker of the University of Melbourne said: 


On balance, I think Labor's policy is superior because it provides the best long-term strategy for delivering the kind of high-speed broadband that Australia is going to need in the future …


Guy Cranswick, the analyst with IBRS, said:


It's crazy to say that the average family only needs 'this much' because we don't know what the future holds and have already seen the more familiar the technology, the larger the files we use …


Geoff Huston, the Chief Scientist at APNIC and Telstra's former chief internet scientist, said:


… quite frankly, 25Mbps in 10 years' time—that speed is going to look like what a [dial-up] modem looks like to us today. Too little, too slow, too backwards.


It is an apt description for the coalition's so-called high speed broadband policy.


What we hear about constantly from the coalition is the downloading of movies on iTunes. What we do not hear about are the other uses people are putting the internet to. People are uploading substantial files, and increasing the amount of data that they are uploading. I have an example from my own constituency. I have people who are working from home who are composers working internationally. They are uploading large files, of music that they have composed, and their speeds—at the moment they are on dial-up—are atrocious. They will give you the example that they can, from their small country town, start to upload their file, drive to Melbourne, log into their system in Melbourne, and find that this file has still not arrived—and they are an hour and a half to two hours down the road from Melbourne. So from the coalition we hear all about the downloading by families of a few movies from iTunes but they have failed to understand what uses people are putting and will put high-speed broadband to.


Since the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Wentworth were last in government, there have been a few changes. I do not know if anyone has noticed that. We have not just been frozen in time—much as the opposition would like to think that we are—with the world staying exactly the same. There has been an exponential change in the way people use high-speed broadband and the internet. Since the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Wentworth were last in government the amount of data downloaded by Australians over the internet has grown fifteenfold, and it is expected that that growth will continue exponentially. In the five years to 2012, broadband internet subscriptions alone doubled, to 11.6 million subscriptions. And, with the amount of information being stored online, the demand on broadband infrastructure is going to continue to grow. The Asia-Pacific, our region, will see more traffic generated than anywhere else in the world. If we are to deal with this growing demand, our nation needs appropriate infrastructure.


We heard about cloud based systems. I recognise the member for Lyne's contribution on this in particular. We are seeing more and more cloud based systems being used nationally and internationally that again will see greater need for high-speed broadband. Frankly, it is growth that the coalition's inadequate copper-to-the-home broadband plan is going to be absolutely incapable of dealing with. There is a reason that people have started up the website 'savethenbn'—because it is an incredibly important policy for this country. And it is about time the coalition realised that what they have put up is a dud. It is going to dud regional Australians. It is dudding people in metropolitan areas. We will see people left behind.


Whether it is broadband infrastructure or our roads, ports, rail or regional development, I am very proud that this government has delivered record investment in nation building. It is a government that has a very long-term plan for the country's future. The NBN is going to fundamentally change and improve the way Australia does business both domestically and internationally. It is infrastructure that will be especially important for Australia's regional communities.


The government has been trying to ensure that Australians have access to the best quality services and employment opportunities regardless of where they live. The NBN for regional communities is a game changer, not just in access to services but in the economic opportunities available to them. Whether you are in the most remote part of the country, whether you are in the regional or provincial cities such as where I live or whether you are in rural communities, it is a game changer for the economic opportunities. The NBN will improve the competitiveness of our regions, significantly improving regional Australia's businesses and our service delivery capacity.


Last month I visited a new business in the small town of Clunes in my own community run by somebody who has moved from Melbourne. There are a lot of tree-changers moving into that town. It is a town with just over 1,000 households. This business owner designed a very innovative gardening edging product which is a fantastic product. He has customers domestically, within our own region and nationally, and internationally. He trades exclusively online. He has no shopfront; he only trades online. The landscaping system that he has developed requires huge amounts of information transfer. It is being developed by an entrepreneur in a very small community, who we are delighted to have had move to a regional community and who will provide jobs and growth in that region. He has absolutely welcomed the National Broadband Network because he knows it allows him and his family to move to a country area but still to expand, develop and grow a business and an economic opportunity in the township of Clunes.


By contrast, the Leader of the Opposition wants to spend some $20 billion on a plan that will leave millions of Australians with no discernible difference in their broadband speeds—none whatsoever. Why would you do such a stupid thing? Indeed, the opposition voted against the National Broadband Network legislation in this place and in the other place no less than 16 times. What were you thinking? Those opposite have a plan that will see Australian taxpayers' money spent on rolling out broadband, with all of the costs but none of the benefits and certainly none of the benefits to regional Australians. Under Labor's plans, all homes and businesses will be able to access the NBN at no connection cost so that everyone can enjoy the benefits of fast broadband.


By contrast, under the policy that the coalition has put forward—and again the member for Wentworth did not talk about this—if it were to be implemented, regional Australians would be left behind with none of the opportunities presented by the NBN. Regional Australians would have no access to the modern infrastructure investment that will ensure our competitiveness in the future, not just domestically but internationally. For example, the coalition policy leaves families that are the last house on their block with slower speeds. If you are the last house on the block remaining on the copper wiring and you decide that you absolutely, because of both your needs and your employment opportunities, want to get more than that 25 megabits that is offered by them, and you need to do that—and we know that in the future that is going to be the case—you will need $5,000 for a connection. That is the reality we have under the coalition's plan. 


The other issue that is incredibly important to regional communities, which was not talked about by the shadow minister, is uniform pricing. The coalition will abandon uniform pricing and force people outside of the cities to pay more for their internet. This means that people in Ballarat, my own community in regional Australia, will pay more for internet than those living in our capital cities. The absolute disgrace of this is in how the National Party have folded on this. Frankly, as a regional member I cannot understand it; it is a complete anathema to regional communities, and I condemn them for it. (Time expired)

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2013-06-19,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (16:00):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on what is an important debate. As a member of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, I have observed the progress of the project over some time, as has the member for Lyne, who is the chair of that committee. As a committee of the parliament, the role that we serve on that committee is very similar to that of a board of directors for a company. In our responsibility to report back to the parliament on the progress of the project, we have an obligation to report the facts as we see them. But we also have an obligation to examine and test the propositions that are put before us by NBN Co. and the shareholder ministers. That is our responsibility to the parliament: to ensure that we are getting a rate of return on the project as has been promised, to ensure that the funds are spent wisely, to ensure that the committee is able to report the truth of what is happening on the ground with regard to the NBN project.


It concerns me that the member for Lyne has been quoting the rate of return of seven per cent. I know that he has some justification for that; in the business plan it clearly states that the internal rate of return is seven per cent. But there are a number of problems with that calculation, because as we all know the internal rate of return is a rate that discounts future cash flows back to zero; that is the way the internal rate of return works. The problem here is that we are seeing significant and systemic problems with the project. We are seeing very significant delays to the project; we are seeing massive capital costs upfront. And they are necessarily massive, because that is the way big infrastructure projects work: you have big capital outlays in early years, and they may continue for a period of time, and the income comes at a later time. The problem we see with this project is that we are having massive cash outflows, but the project is being delayed and delayed and delayed. That has major repercussions for the rate of return of the project. If the rate of return of seven per cent as originally promised is to be achieved, what needs to occur is a massive acceleration of the project in later years—and we have seen no evidence of an acceleration in the rate so far; in fact we continue to see significant problems occurring at every turn. 


We see significant problems being encountered with regard to the fixed line rollout—not necessarily at the technology end but certainly at the civil works end where you are dealing with the difficulties of operating in confined metropolitan and regional environments, where you have to work around the built environment, something engineers have been dealing with throughout civilisation, working with what is already there. With the wireless network we see very significant delays. In fact the wireless network will not achieve half of the forecast rate of rollout that has been put forward. 


So we have seen NBN Co. making a range of forecasts—we had business plan No. 1; we had the revised business plan and substantially downward revisions in expectations with regard to the rollout—and what that means for the returns of the project is that, to keep and maintain that rate of return, you have to see a massive acceleration in the cash flows in later years. You have to see much later, much larger, increases in income to compensate for the slow rollout. I see no evidence of that being likely to occur. With regard to the risk of the project, when you are relying on very big increases in income in later years, there is a substantial increase in the risk. The costs going out now we know: they are certain; the cheques have been written for those amounts. But the revenues we are going to receive in years 7, 8, 9, 10, into the out-years, are unknown and they attract a higher risk premium, if you are looking at this as a particular investment decision. So there is real concern, and when the member for Lyne accepts the fact that there is a seven per cent return, I think he should question that point, because nothing has occurred to date to give us any confidence that the rate of return is going to achieve anything like seven per cent. And in fact it is likely to be less than half of that, the way this project is going where there is a delay at every turn. And that is going to be at massive cost to the taxpayer.


The next issue goes beyond the rate of return and that is the digital divide. What we are seeing through these delays to the project is that people in regional areas are being denied access to high-speed broadband. What the coalition's proposal does is attempt to get high-speed broadband to all Australians by 2016. I think that is an important objective. The increase in speeds from very slow dial-up speeds to a reasonable level of service is where you get from a national perspective the greatest productivity gains. The member for Wentworth noted this in his contribution and I am sure that the member for Lyne would agree.


Unfortunately what we have with NBN Co. is a rollout that is so slow that many people in regional areas are being denied access to high-speed broadband. So, rather than being a project that delivers for people in rural and regional areas, it is perversely starting to become a project that will deny people access to high-speed broadband. We can have very little reliance, we know, on the forecast for NBN because each forecast revision is less successful than the one before. We do not see NBN Co. advising this House: 'We have taken remedial action and as a result of that we have increased the speed of the rollout in areas A, B and C.' What we see is endless downward revisions in the rate of progress and an attempt to conceal that. That is of great concern; information that is vitally important for the parliament to know is being concealed. And that is a real concern for us. 




Government members interjecting—





Mr HARTSUYKER:
  It is being concealed. We never get frank advice. We never get frank information on the progress of the rollout. We never get a report across the sites as to how the various sites are progressing. What problems are being incurred. What remedial actions are being taken to return to program. It is a real concern. It is a failure of reporting. It is a failure by the shareholder minister. It is a failure by the committee to hold NBN Co. to account for the problems with the rollout. 


Really the coalition will address this because, if we have the honour of being elected on 14 September, we will address the issue of the digital divide directly by requiring NBN Co. to attend to those areas with the worst broadband services first. That is a major distinction. The Labor Party is quite happy to roll along, rolling out broadband wherever it is politically expedient, ignoring the needs of so many people in the bush. What we will be doing is: within 90 days of being elected we will have a report on the worst areas of broadband service and we will be directing NBN Co. not to duplicate services in Ballarat and not to duplicate services in metropolitan areas. We will be requiring them to address areas where there are problems with broadband—be they regional areas or metropolitan areas—not just addressing political problems for this Prime Minister and her beleaguered government. I think that is an important difference. Increasing the speeds where broadband must be most urgently improved will have the greatest productivity gains and the greatest enhancement in attending to the digital divide.


The coalition is focused not only on fixed line broadband. We are very mindful of the problems with regard to mobile. This government has dropped the ball on mobile communications. It has not spent one dollar on mobile communications since coming to office, and that is a major problem. If you have not noticed, I say to members opposite, since this project was mooted, we have had the release of the iPhone and the iPad—have you heard about the iPhone or the iPad? They have come along. There is a massive demand for mobile service as well as for increasing demand in fixed line service. 


I would say to you: focus on the entire digital situation, do not just blindly follow along this very narrowly focused NBN project with a single technology. The coalition will be addressing the issue of mobile communications if we are elected to government. The coalition will be delivering broadband services where they are needed most. We will be doing that first. The coalition will guarantee acceptable speeds for broadband for all Australians by 2016, unlike what the current government is going to do which will see people in regional areas perhaps waiting decades for their service to be connected because this government cannot manage major projects. This government cannot bring projects in on budget. We have seen pink batts and school halls being repeated again and again.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2013-06-19,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (16:10):  Mr Deputy Speaker, through you, the member for Cowper, like all the Nationals in here, is an absolute sell-out when it comes to the issue of looking after communities by providing broadband and mobile infrastructure. Yet they are saying how terrible we are for what we are doing to change and transform the network, when they are prepared to see people in rural areas pay more under their plan.


They say they will get rid of uniform pricing. They say that it is okay to charge rural and regional areas more and dismantle uniform pricing. The member for Cowper, the member for Gippsland and all those Nationals just sit there. If they win office in September, don't you think the Liberals will call all the shots at the expense of National members? They will not care one jot about your regional—



Mr Tehan interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  Don't you dare distract me, member for Wannon, by throwing NBA scores in the middle of my rant. But they know deep in their hearts that the Liberal Party will completely roll over them, especially when it comes to telecommunications. 


The NBN is spearheading economic transformation in this country. It will promote what is going on right now and will accelerate it even further. What is happening now in the business world and in the broader community is people are moving from an analog world to a digital one. This has major ramifications for the way that we will operate as a country and the way our economy will transform itself. This will be off the back of these hair-thin fibres delivering data at 300,000 kilometres a second, hands down the best technology for getting data to the end point and helping our economy's future growth.


What is this going to do? It will free up the nation from capacity constraint that those opposite were unable to fix when they tried nearly 20 times but failed. As much as they will say to people that we do not do this, they tried 19 times and failed 19 times to fix broadband in this nation. It was par for the course for those opposite who, whenever it came to a capacity constraint and whenever the Reserve Bank said that their inability to deal with infrastructure in this country was creating a capacity constraint and holding back the economy, never did anything about it. We are in the process of investing to free people from the digital divide, and those people stuck in a dial-up era will be able to get superfast broadband.


I welcome the member for Lyne's comments, because he is absolutely right to say this is an investment in our economy. This will see, through an investment of just over $30 billion, the spread of economic benefit through a technology that is already delivering, according to Deloitte, $50 billion in economic value right now with $70 billion expected to be delivered in the future. It is going to see us change the way that we operate. That value can be seen in a range of areas. I am a member of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, which the member for Lyne chairs. We have looked at the benefits of the NBN for healthcare, education, telework and all the things that have been done through the work of rolling out the NBN. Again, this is revolutionising our economy and helping us deliver a digital economy. On top of that, in the last few weeks we released our updated National Digital Economy Strategy. We updated the strategy that was released in May last year. For example, this will see us potentially becoming one of the world-leading digital economies by 2020.


So the economic value is undoubted, but what is the challenge? The big challenge is data growth. This is a point that was touched on by the member for Lyne. The statistics for where we are headed are amazing. CSC have quoted that they expect a 4,300 per cent increase in annual data generation by 2020. That is phenomenal. The drivers of this include a switch from analog to digital technologies and a rapid increase in data generation by individuals and corporations alike.


There is always a sneaky attempt by the coalition to undermine the rationale for the NBN. The member for Wentworth did it today at the dispatch box. He talked about Netflix, video and IPTV. Talking about the NBN and being able to meet the needs of people wanting to download Netflix, movies or iTunes is their way of undermining the project. This is their way of saying that that is all the NBN is about—downloading movies and films. You have CSC saying that there will be a 4,300 per cent increase in data growth between now and 2020. They say it is being driven by a changeover from analog to digital technology, by corporations changing the way they are doing business and by the way we are living our lives. Those opposite are always looking down their noses to make it seem like the NBN is only about delivering movies and IPTV. It is more than that.


The opposition have wrestled with this for quite some time. They started on the basis that they would destroy the NBN. They then said that optic fibre would be outdated. This is a ridiculous argument. They said that this technology would be outgrown because of the pace of new technology yet they never pointed to what that might be. Then some relented and said: 'It is because of wireless. It is the rollout of mobile broadband. It is the rollout of 4G networks.' Most people know—and you can experience this in the most simple way—that if I am watching the Wanderers at Parramatta Stadium with all the other fans I cannot get onto social media and tweet something. Just try to tweet something using a mobile network in a stadium that holds 25,000 people. What do you get? Congestion, slower speeds and the inability to download. That is exactly the principle that is applied when you try to have a lot of people using a wireless network at the same time. It is incapable of dealing with demand.


Now those opposite have given up on that and they have gone to fibre to the node. At the same time they have been suggesting that this would be a much more efficient way and it will bring in a much better rate of return. I wish they would just land on one rate of return. We say that it will deliver seven per cent. They have not been able to undermine that whatsoever. The member for Wentworth said at the dispatch box that it will deliver no rate of return and then the member for Cowper said it is going to deliver three per cent. They are just plucking figures like they are plucking technologies. They are just trying to find a way to undermine this project and do not really care if it relies on fact or not. They have wrapped themselves up in copper. They think this is the way of the future, but it is a technology only ever designed to deliver voice and has limited capacity in terms of the data delivery we are going to need in the future when there has been a 4,300 percentage point increase in data.


They say no-one else is doing this. What is Google doing in Utah? What is it doing in Kansas? Google is rolling out a network that it expects to make a profit off in all these parts of the world. Verizon are doing it in five states. We have all these other people out there doing this type of rollout. They have seen what we are doing right here in places like Gungahlin, Toowoomba, Bacchus Marsh, Hobart, Gosford, Townsville and my own neighbourhood of Blacktown, where we just turned on the NBN. This is seeing communities taken out of the dial-up world into one of superfast broadband.


The opposition are all here bagging it and trashing it, but when they get off the plane or get out of their car it is a different story. They become NBN cheerleaders. You have just witnessed them bagging it. What are the member for Mitchell, the member for Flynn, the member for Farrer, the member for Hume—the Deputy Speaker has also weighed in on this—the member for McPherson, the member for Stirling, the member for Swan and the member for Leichhardt saying? We have the member for McPherson saying that it was very disappointing that the NBN was not coming her way. The member for Farrer, Susan Ley, has said:


Broken Hill's residents are disappointed, as am I, but even more so the local business community which would have benefited from higher broadband speeds isn't getting the NBN.


There is another one. I am not going to quote the Deputy Speaker, but I will quote one of his colleagues. The member for Stirling said:


Without the NBN many families and businesses will have to continue to rely on slower connection speeds.


Michael Keenan is another NBN cheerleader. They bag it here, but when they get home they know what we know: this is a great technology— (Time expired)

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2013-06-19,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (16:20):  I am very pleased to rise to speak in this matter of public importance debate. The premise of this is that internet traffic is growing at a very sharp rate and therefore we urgently need the current deep fibre infrastructure build. That is the premise of the matter before the House this afternoon. In using the term 'deep fibre' we presume the member for Lyne is referring to a network architecture in which fibre goes all the way to the premises rather than to an intermediate point, such as the node. As the member for Lyne has made clear, the premise draws upon the forecasts that are provided regularly by Cisco. They most recently said that world internet traffic is expected to reach 1.4 zettabytes by the end of 2017.


I want to make three points in the time available to me. The first is that this matter for discussion draws too long a bow from what is contained in the Cisco forecast. The second is that, even if you accept the logic of this, it is predicated upon the assumption that the current build is going to be delivered on time so as to achieve this magnificent increase in capacity by 2017, when all the evidence demonstrates that that is a hopelessly unrealistic expectation. Thirdly, I want to make the point that the coalition's proposal to build out a national broadband network using fibre to the node and, to around 20 per cent of premises, fibre to the premises will deliver the necessary increases more quickly and more cost effectively.


Let us start with the proposition that the matter of public importance draws too long a bow from the Cisco forecast. I note that Mr Boal, of Cisco, a local executive, is quoted as saying quite specifically:


… we're agnostic on the access technology but clearly significant increase in capacity is required—


So any direct connection between the Cisco forecast and fibre to the premises or fibre to the node or any other technology, any other network architecture, is drawing too long a bow.


More interestingly, what Cisco says is that the average broadband residential speed in Australia today is nine megabits per second and by 2017 it will be 39 megabits per second globally and therefore, by implication, a very serious problem, we need to get our skates on et cetera. The point, when you dig into the data, is that the world speed is assumed to grow very, very sharply. Today the world speed, according to Cisco, on average is 11.3 megabits per second, not much higher than Australia's, and it is to reach that global target of 39 megabits per second by 2017. So the implication that Australia is in some way significantly behind the rest of the world does not follow from the Cisco analysis. In fact, what the Cisco analysis shows is that this is a set of forecasts which assume a very sharp growth in traffic volumes predicated in turn on an assumption that the average bandwidth and the average speed available, not just in Australia but also around the world, is going to rise very sharply.


Despite the sense of looming crisis that the member for Lyne was keen to generate, if you look carefully at what Cisco says, one of its points is that the rate of growth of internet traffic is slowing. It notes that global internet traffic increased fourfold in the last five years and in the next five years it will increase threefold. No dispute: these are still spectacular rates of growth, but the actual point is that you are seeing a slight reduction in the rates of growth.


But let us talk specifically about methodologies used in the Cisco forecast. What the Cisco paper says is:


… assumptions are tied to fundamental enablers such as broadband speed and computing speed.


Indeed, if you dig into the detail their methodology is to start with a number of users that they assume will be in place by 2017, then a number of minutes of video that the average user is assumed to watch, and then an assumed number of kilobits per second, which it is assumed that watching video will require. The point is that the video that you will watch will depend upon the infrastructure that is available. If you plug into a forecast a set of assumptions about bandwidth available not just in Australia but also around the world, then that will generate a set of forecasts about traffic volumes. But the traffic volumes here are the dependent variable, so I am afraid the member for Lyne has got his logic the wrong way around. This MPI is flawed in logic. It is saying we will have a problem because the volumes will be too big for the pipes. In fact, the volumes depend upon the pipes. That is quite clear from looking at the methodology that Cisco used.


One of the assumptions behind the MPI is that an increase in usage will follow when the speed that is available increases. Another Cisco paper notes that there are significant qualifications on that assumption. It says:


… there is often a delay between the increase in speed and the increased usage, which can range from a few months to several years.


Now the other thing that is significant in what the member for Lyne had to say was that he again gave us this article of faith from supporters of NBN Co. that one of the key reasons that we apparently must have two-way fibre is because upload speeds are jumping and jumping and jumping and there will be a need for symmetrical services. Nobody contests that the upload proportion of data is growing. But what is very interesting is that the Cisco report says:


With the exception of short-form video and video calling, most forms of Internet video do not have a large upstream component.


As a result, traffic is not becoming more symmetric as many expected when user-generated content first became popular.


That is a really critical point because that goes to one of the premises that we are constantly told underpins the fibre-to-the-premises model of the current government—that is, traffic is becoming symmetrical and we are hopelessly in the Stone Age if we do not immediately introduce fibre everywhere to respond to that. What Cisco is saying is that is not right; the assumption that data is increasingly symmetrical is actually not proved out by the data. But, unfortunately, so often in this debate about broadband we hear wafty assumptions that are not backed up by the data.


Let us be clear: the coalition are strong supporters of an improved broadband infrastructure. We are strong believers in the social and economic benefits that follow. Personally, I have worked in policy and in the private sector in this area since the mid-90s. I am a passionate believer in broadband and I am a passionate opponent of the wasteful, ill-conceived, poorly constructed broadband plan that the present government is pursuing, and I am deeply grateful that the coalition is pursuing a rational, cost-effective plan that will deliver broadband more quickly to most Australians.


One of the problems with the current government's plan, and this is turning to the second point I wanted to make, is that the implementation is absolutely hopeless. Despite the broad and wafty aspirations that the member for Lyne is articulating, let us look at the numbers. The first corporate plan of NBN Co. said that by 30 June this year there would be 1.3 million premises passed by fibre. That was then wound back just a little bit, with the second corporate plan that came out midway through last year saying the number would be 341,000. That was then wound back again, earlier this year, when the company issued a revised forecast that said: 'Whoops! Sorry, we're not going to make either the first number of the second number. We are now going to make a third, much lower, number, which will be somewhere between 180,000 and 220,000—but don't hold us to the numbers because we're visionaries.' And then we have the actual number, as at May this year, which is about 104,000. Members of the House: when we put aside the wafty aspirations and look at the hard numbers on what is actually being delivered, this government's plan is not advancing Australia towards where we need to be—even if we accept the premise from the member for Lyne that we have a bandwidth crisis and we must immediately respond with pressing urgency.


Let me turn, thirdly and finally, to the merits of the coalition's plan which will deliver speeds to all Australians of between 25 and 100 megabits per second by 2016 and 50 and 100 megabits per second by 2019. The coalition's fibre-to-the-node proposal will be rolled out more quickly and with less variability and in a more reliable fashion than the chaotic mess we have seen from a Labor Party which jumped into an over-ambitious plan driven by political motivations without properly analysing what they were getting into. Is it any surprise that when you had a network that was contrived for political reasons the actual execution of it turned out to be completely woeful? So if our policy objective is to build a broadband network which bests supports our prospects of meeting the agreed growth of data that will occur by 2017, the coalition's broadband plan is far and away the best and most reliable way to do it.

Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen—Government Whip) (16:31):  Very briefly, I rise to speak. What we have basically heard today in this MPI debate is how the coalition's plan will rob 74 per cent of Australians of fibre to the home, and that their plan for copper to the home, which is what they are making claims about, will actually mean that people will get slow speeds and they will not be brought into the 21st century. That is why what the member for Lyne is saying is exactly right when he says that fibre to the home will actually mean a better future for all Australians no matter where they live.



The SPEAKER:  Order! The time for the MPI has concluded. The times were actually mixed up and we have gone over.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (17:36):  I rise to speak on the Banking Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2013 currently before the House. But before I do I would like to place on the public record, being a new member in this House, that I had the privilege of witnessing three excellent, outstanding valedictory statements by men who have served not only this parliament but our nation very honourably. I would like to associate myself with their kind words. It steels me to be a better man in this place. By all standards, they are gentlemen to model oneself on. I compliment them on their efforts in the House and wish them well in whatever their endeavours may be into the future.



An honourable member:  I thank the member for Wright.




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  It is one of the more chivalrous duties undertaken. Now we are back to the business of bashing each other up again—the job at hand.


The bill currently before the House, the banking act, seeks to transfer funds of unclaimed money from bank accounts back to the Commonwealth, with refunds to authorised deposit-taking institutions—ADIs—if money is collected unnecessarily. Some background on the bill: it is an attempt by the government, in its 2012 MYEFO, to find savings to bolster their now-defunct commitment of delivering surpluses in the 2013 budget. The government announced an array of changes relating to unclaimed monies in bank accounts, life insurance accounts, superannuation accounts and corporations, which I will go to and break up as to where the pots of money are.


In basic summary, what this bill seeks to do is to allow this government—as an unintended consequence of delivering the sixth biggest deficit for this nation, of not being able to balance the books and of reckless fiscal management—to now sink to a low. It allows them to sink to a low where, as a measure to try to strengthen the financial position of this nation, we are going into the bank accounts and the savings accounts of hard-working, decent Australians and taking that money if it has lain dormant for a period of time which I will outline in my speech. They are taking that so-called 'unaccounted for' money and relocating it to the government coffers to try to bolster their financial position. Shame on this government, I say; shame.


The changes they seek to bring forward relate to the time at which the money is recognised under the relevant law as lost or unclaimed. These will be the provisions which this government will use in order to activate parts of this bill. The time periods for accounts to be treated as unclaimed monies will be significantly shortened by these amendments by the government. For bank accounts, it will be reduced from seven years back to three. If you have a bank account sitting there ,which had not had any activity in it for seven years, that would be picked up. I myself, as a holder of many accounts and having employed over 100 men and with 14 transports, had accounts that were taken under that seven-year rule. It was not a lot of money. At that time, you probably could have bought a car with the amount of money that was taken from my bank accounts. I can advise the House that the difficulties in trying to get that money back through the system, through the provisions that provide for that, are somewhat tiresome and clumsy. I had a team of internal accountants that worked for me full-time and it took virtually the entire dedicated team of my staff, that I paid, to try to get that money back. I lost some over that seven-year period, but this bill seeks to shorten that seven-year period to three years.


One of the unintended consequences of this bill, again, is that it mistakenly catches someone like a grandparent, an average grandparent, who may have the capacity to put some money away to help a grandchild or to bestow some money on a person later in life—a loved one. I am starting to get traffic now coming through my office—people are coming in and saying, 'Listen, I had $30,000 sitting in a bank account and it's gone! The government has taken it and it's sitting in a consolidated revenue account.' It is happening now. My offices are starting to raise these concerns. I say as a diligent member of this House: surely we have not fallen, as a parliament, to trying to prop ourselves up financially by raiding the bank accounts of our grandparents. It is a disgrace. Have we, as a nation with the wealth, the education, the great skills and resources we have, now fallen to a new low, in a way somewhat similar to Cyprus? When they raided the bank accounts of their population it was condemned. Their action was condemned by the Prime Minister in this House at that very dispatch box. The actions of Cyprus were condemned, but behind the scenes they knew a bill was coming before the House with which this government would do exactly the same thing—where they would take unclaimed money.


But they are not just going to pull up at having a crack at your bank accounts. Life insurance money, previously treated as unclaimed money after seven years, could also be claimed after a reduced three-year period. Superannuation accounts with balances of less than $2,000 or accounts of unidentifiable members that have been inactive for 12 months will be required to be transferred to the Commissioner of Taxation as well. The theory behind that is that one person might have had a couple of jobs. There was a period of time—a generation—where when you got a job, that was the job you served at for life. When you look at the demographics of our younger workforce, today we have a far more fluid workforce, where it is not unfeasible that one would have maybe five or six employers—serious employers—over the lifespan of one's capacity to work and contribute to the nation.


Superannuation accounts that are not collectively joined and no longer have contributions paid into them will by default meet the definition of dormant. These become a great revenue base for this government to prop up their fiscal inabilities. The period of time for inactive superannuation accounts and those of unidentifiable members before they are transferred to the Australian tax office will be reduced from five years to 12 months. 


Then there is the unclaimed property of corporations. The unclaimed property of a corporation could be assets held like artwork, paintings and other chattels. Those assets may not be owned by a single person or they may be left after creditors and others are paid when a corporation becomes defunct. Those assets also come under the auspices of this bill. Unclaimed property of corporations is now to be recognised directly in the Commonwealth Consolidated Revenue Fund upon receipt by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission as opposed to in the companies and unclaimed moneys special account.


I am going to share with you now the breakdown of the money. It totals roughly $886 million, which for this purpose I will round up to $900 million. That is the projected revenue that this bill intends to pick up. Firstly I talked about the dormant bank accounts. They will roughly come in at $92 million. If this is going to raise around $900 million and the cash component is just under $100 million, then the real bulk of this money is going to come from dormant superannuation funds. That is around $675 million over the forward estimates, with most of that being in the first 12-month period, 2012-13. The forecast for those funds is $513.5 million.


When you have a government that makes poor financial decisions you can see how they affect everyone. I want to share with the House the story of a friend of mine who has no political interest in the world whatsoever. Often we would get to the point of speaking about politics and he once said: 'It doesn't matter who is in government. It doesn't really affect me because I get paid the same whether Labor or Liberal are in.' I suggest that no-one can escape bills like this one. You will not be prejudiced on this if you have an allegiance to Labor or Liberal. If you have a dormant bank account or a dormant superannuation account, you are going to get caught in this, irrespective of your political persuasion. So superannuation contributors are the big losers.


Try to be proactive. My advice to the nation, to my electors in Wright, to mums and dads and to people who work in the electorate I represent is: if you have any dormant superannuation accounts, consolidate them into one single account which you are continually contributing to and that will keep that superannuation account at arms-length of being deemed to be dormant. I encourage you to do that pronto, with haste.


Before this bill got to this place there was a government-controlled Senate economics committee inquiry held into this bill. The government recommended that the bill be passed. The coalition members of the Senate economics committee gave a fairly scathing dissenting report on this bill before it came to this House. The coalition moved a series of amendments which sought to delay the implementation of both schedules 1 and 2, which are the cash and the superannuation components relating to bank accounts and the first home saver accounts. We wanted to delay those for a full year. We wanted to delay those until 31 December to give people time. We wanted to raise awareness so that they could get out in front. We wanted to save them the heartache of finding out that their money had been taken from their bank accounts.


The coalition also sought to delay schedule 4, which relates to superannuation accounts, for a full year to align with the deadline of the autoconsolidation necessary under the previous announcements of the SuperStream reforms that are due to commence on 1 January 2014. So we would have had them aligned with legislation that was already planned. This government gave over 300 commitments—some will argue it was over 500—to deliver a surplus. Because the desire of the government to deliver a surplus was so intense, bills like this had to be brought forward so the revenue could be counted in this reporting period. The government could not afford to wait, so those amendments were disregarded.


The bill we are dealing with today is a result of the unintended consequences of a government that has lost its way, by its own definition. The fiscal management of this government will be a legacy that will haunt them for many years. This does not serve the interests of every Australian. This is a bad bill. It has been badly thought out. The procedures and processes for this bill have been rushed. I condemn this bill for the intended heartache it will cause Australians.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2013-06-19,"



Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (17:52):  In addressing my observations about the Banking Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2013 I will cite three examples that have been brought to my attention and that I think are relevant to this bill. But I also want to discuss this bill in context. The context is this: it had been thought in the past that if money had remained in bank accounts unclaimed, if those accounts had been dormant for some seven years, that the legitimate holder may no longer be aware that those funds were there—they may have died; there may be any number of explanations—then that money should not be left in an account available to essentially benefit the institution that holds it, but the government should take it on trust.


Provisions have been included in the legislation to enable the money, if it has been found to be missing by the person who was the owner, to be able to reclaim it. And seven years seemed not unreasonable. What the government has sought to do is to reduce that period to three years. You ask yourself: what are the policy reasons for doing that? Given that seven years was there and it deals with the situation where people may have lost track of the funds, why does it need to be reduced to a period of three years? What is the logical reason for doing so? I cannot think of any logical reason for doing so, other than the government—not because they are putting the money into a trust account available for the person to whom it belongs to be able to reclaim at a later date and holding it in trust for them, that is not is what is happening; what is happening is the money is being paid into consolidated revenue—is taking the money that is unclaimed and, in effect, spending it. That is what is happening.


It may be that if the government is not broke at some later period people can claim it back—maybe—but the government needs to be in pretty good odour for that to happen. What we have is a government that has billions of dollars—$340 billion or $350 billion—worth of debt. This money is about taking the funds of Australians, ostensibly on the basis that they have been lost or unclaimed, and using it for the government's use. In any other situation it would be called theft. I make the point that it may not be unreasonable when there is a fairly long period of time, but what is the reason for reducing the time? The reason for reducing the time is it is going to put money into consolidated revenue and reduce the debt.


It seems to me that when people have not claimed funds for seven years, it may reasonably be the case that nobody is going to turn up and claim them. But I suspect, with the period being three years, there are going to be a lot of people anxious about that situation and wanting to get it back. I do not know the extent to which Treasury have tried to understand the nature of those claims and to take it into account and to put it as a contingency. I hope they have done that. And you might find that if they made that study and it was a contingency, then the $100 million that they are expecting to benefit is illusory.


I want to deal with some of the circumstances that do arise. The honourable member who spoke before me, the member for Wright, mentioned accounts that grandparents and others might establish in the names of grandchildren—maybe for school fees, maybe to help them when they get engaged or married—but, if they fall on some hard times, they may not be able to add any money to the account. That there has been no transaction for three years may not be an unreasonable period but, because there has been no transaction—an additional amount added or money taken out—these funds will be forfeited to the Crown. That is essentially what is happening. You have to ask yourself: is that likely to happen? I think it is likely to happen quite frequently. My wife does this for our grandchildren, and as long as we are in a position to be able to afford to contribute it may well be that we are not going to be affected by this. But if you do not know that you have to make a transaction every year on that account, or at least every three years, you will suddenly find that the funds that you expected have been stripped away.


I have had a number of people raising this matter with me. One was an 86-year-old lady whom I know very well. She has something like $8,000 deposited in an account. She is a pensioner; she has not been able to add or subtract from that account. The money was set aside for her funeral costs and that has been stripped away. She is alarmed at the prospect that that is happening in her case.


I have had a real estate agent talk to me. He runs a business of letting properties. In relation to the tenants, he takes a bond to guarantee that if the tenant vacates the property and leaves it damaged, there can be restitution. But if there is no damage at the end of the lease, or when the tenant leaves, the funds are paid out. He has been in the situation where he has hundreds of accounts for each separate deposit. It is not a large trust account; he has to keep them separately. So he put the funds separately in an account for those tenants but if the tenants stay in the property for over three years the bond is lost. How reasonable is that? In his case, there are hundreds potentially.


When you go through it and look at what is required you are surprised, as I was, by the nature of the bureaucracy that we are implementing in relation to these matters where, to get your hard-earned cash back, you have to search ASIC's MoneySmart website to find out that your unclaimed money has been taken. If the search discloses that it is there, you have got to take the OTN, the original transaction number, and then you have got to contact your bank and, in addition, with the original transaction number you may be required to provide proof of identification, so people are then asked to provide bank statements, passports, drivers licences. When the bank is satisfied that it has a claim from the rightful owner, it informs ASIC and the funds may then be returned.


This is a bureaucratic procedure that is being put in place because the government wants to deal ostensibly with its deficit and what it is essentially doing is taking the funds of Australians and appropriating them for the government's purpose. If you did that as a private person, so you expropriated somebody's account on the basis that they had not been using it, it would be fraud—but in this case it is the government. As I have said, there were arrangements that were in place. There is no suggestion they were not working appropriately. I do not think there is any evidence that there was a need for change and I have not heard any evidence of the need for change. What I have heard is that the government thinks it has found a way by which to obtain money for consolidated revenue by taking the bank accounts and the superannuation funds and the other deposits that have been identified for its purposes—a little over $900 million—and I suspect that the government will find that it will get far more claims from people that have had funds taken after a shorter period of three years and that this will not address the substantial issue which the government has advanced as being the reason for this measure.


In my view, there is no justification for it and it is appropriate to oppose the measure. I will continue to draw the attention of my constituents to the way in which this matter is being done, because I think that it is occasioning a very considerable anxiety amongst people who should not be losing their funds in these circumstances.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2013-06-19,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (18:03):  I find it rather amusing that here we are yet again in this House amending one of the government's own bills, amending a bill that they rushed through as part of a $900 million money grab, with a hand deep into the pocket of Australian workers and taxpayers to grab their money. I would have thought that if you were a hung government you would have actually done a lot more homework on your legislation that was introduced, to make sure that you were not put in this position of having to go back to a hung parliament yet again to amend your own legislation.


By way of background as to this bill that we are talking about, the Banking Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2013, what this government did, in seeking to prop up its bottom line because of its own mismanagement of economic affairs, was reduce the time frame by which the government could access Australian people's money in bank accounts. For bank accounts it reduced the period from seven to three years. For life insurance moneys, previously treated as unclaimed after seven years, the period was reduced to three years. Superannuation accounts with balances of less than $2,000 and the accounts of unidentifiable members that had been inactive for 12 months were required to be transferred to the Commissioner of Taxation Office. It was reducing from five years to 12 months the period of inactivity before which the superannuation accounts of unidentifiable members were transferred to the ATO and the unclaimed property of corporations was now to be recognised directly in the Commonwealth Consolidated Revenue Fund—impacting the underlying cash position of the Commonwealth—upon receipt by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, as opposed to the companies and unclaimed moneys special account. As I said, this is nothing short of in essence a fraudulent, rapid, expedition of accessing Australians' cash in accounts. There was nothing wrong with the time frames that were there. This is purely a measure to gain access in particular in the 2012-13 year to some $700 million to prop up the bottom line.


In one area in particular, as was so eloquently put by my colleague the member for Berowra, there are people who put money aside before they retire for a long-term purpose, thinking about the days ahead. Perhaps one of the saddest things would be a person, particularly a pensioner, who may now be living on their own because their partner is deceased and, as my colleague the member for Berowra said, they have put aside money for their funeral fund, not wishing to pre-purchase their funeral but making sure their affairs were in order. They might have lived beyond the three-year period but they have had the money in the account without any activity.


I was informed that the addition of interest to the account still does not make that account an active account. How hard would it be for the family of a person who has passed away to then access money that the government has taken to prop up its financial position? What process and paperwork would they have to go through to find this account, identify this account and recover the moneys from that account to pay for funeral plans? These are issues that have not been thought through by this government.


One of the other areas, as put by many members in this House, is where grandparents—indeed, parents—on the arrival of a child or grandchild have put away money in an account for that person. Quite often it is to be for them when they turned 18 or when they turned 21, hoping it was an investment that would grow and be there for that person. If that account has not been added to by the parent or grandparent—indeed, anyone else—now after three years that account becomes inactive and the government gets direct access to that money. It is not that this money is held in a trust account by the government; it actually goes straight off the bottom line of consolidated revenue.


I would ask the minister in his summing up to advise the House what the cost of bureaucracy will be in going through and processing these claims for payments. Will it outweigh the benefit that you would have received after seven years in relation to a bank account as against three years? The cost of bureaucracy is becoming something that is unsustainable in this government. I think what you have added to is the cost to government.


Another area I wish to talk about in particular is superannuation. I have been on the record congratulating the Keating government for introducing compulsory superannuation for people to look after their long-term affairs. But in the beginning, particularly in relation to the tourism industry, people moved from one job to another job to another job and each of those employers might have had separate superannuation funds. In the early days people could not actually move from one fund to another fund and therefore a lot of those accounts would have had under $2,000 in them. Those have now been consumed if they were inactive for 12 months. Young people, in particular, might have been transient or moving around or taken the overseas holiday for 12 months or two years. They come back and they find that all this money has been consumed. In relation to superannuation, where it might have been earning higher than the government approved rate, what will the government do to compensate people for the loss of earnings on that superannuation money? Nothing.


This bill would never have been under consideration if the government had been able to manage the financial affairs of this nation properly and adequately. This set of amendments would never have been before the House today if the government had put enough thought into what was going to happen when people started claiming money back. In fact, the purpose of this amendment is to amend the act to exempt reactivated accounts from being reported and transferred to the Commonwealth as unclaimed money and to allow the Commonwealth to provide refunds to authorised deposit-taking institutions if the money is collected unnecessarily.



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr BALDWIN:
  It is good, but the minister should have actually put some forethought into this before rushing in here with legislation, because so urgent was it to grab this money, particularly the $700 million in the financial year 2012-13 to prop up the bottom line accounts. 


I do not intend to hold the House up any further on this other than to say that we will be supporting these amendments because they are common sense. But I think the bill as a whole, even though it was passed, stinks, because it is the wrong thing to do to Australians to rapidly access their money when there was nothing wrong with the time frames that were there originally. This government need to get a little better at their housekeeping if they want to be the government they purport to be and the financial managers they purport to be. The record has shown that they have not been.

Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business) (18:12):  I want to thank honourable members who have contributed to this debate on the Banking Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2013. The bill exempts reactivated accounts from being reported and transferred to the Commonwealth. These are accounts that technically meet the current definition of unclaimed moneys or where there has been a recent transaction to indicate that the account is not unclaimed. Under current legislation banks are required to report or transfer to the Commonwealth all accounts that are unclaimed as at the applicable assessment date. In some cases banks, building societies and credit unions may have allowed customers to transact on accounts after the assessment date. This bill ensures that, where an account holder has reactivated an account by making a transaction after being assessed as unclaimed, the account will not be transferred to the Commonwealth unnecessarily. By reducing the number of accounts transferred to the Commonwealth, these changes will allow the government to focus its resources on reuniting accounts with their rightful owners, where the accounts are genuinely lost.


The bill also allows the government to return funds to a financial institution if the institution has inappropriately transferred an account to the Commonwealth or if the institution has reimbursed the account holder prior to a refund request being processed. This bill will assist the government to achieve its objective to reunite more Australians with their moneys and protect their money from erosion by fees and charges. I commend this bill to the House.

I say as a diligent member of this House: surely we have not fallen, as a parliament, to trying to prop ourselves up financially by raiding the bank accounts of our grandparents. It is a disgrace. Have we, as a nation with the wealth, the education, the great skills and resources we have, now fallen to a new low, in a way somewhat similar to Cyprus? When they raided the bank accounts of their population it was condemned. Their action was condemned by the Prime Minister in this House at that very dispatch box. The actions of Cyprus were condemned, but behind the scenes they knew a bill was coming before the House with which this government would do exactly the same thing—where they would take unclaimed money.


But they are not just going to pull up at having a crack at your bank accounts. Life insurance money, previously treated as unclaimed money after seven years, could also be claimed after a reduced three-year period. Superannuation accounts with balances of less than $2,000 or accounts of unidentifiable members that have been inactive for 12 months will be required to be transferred to the Commissioner of Taxation as well. The theory behind that is that one person might have had a couple of jobs. There was a period of time—a generation—where when you got a job, that was the job you served at for life. When you look at the demographics of our younger workforce, today we have a far more fluid workforce, where it is not unfeasible that one would have maybe five or six employers—serious employers—over the lifespan of one's capacity to work and contribute to the nation.


Superannuation accounts that are not collectively joined and no longer have contributions paid into them will by default meet the definition of dormant. These become a great revenue base for this government to prop up their fiscal inabilities. The period of time for inactive superannuation accounts and those of unidentifiable members before they are transferred to the Australian tax office will be reduced from five years to 12 months. 


Then there is the unclaimed property of corporations. The unclaimed property of a corporation could be assets held like artwork, paintings and other chattels. Those assets may not be owned by a single person or they may be left after creditors and others are paid when a corporation becomes defunct. Those assets also come under the auspices of this bill. Unclaimed property of corporations is now to be recognised directly in the Commonwealth Consolidated Revenue Fund upon receipt by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission as opposed to in the companies and unclaimed moneys special account.


I am going to share with you now the breakdown of the money. It totals roughly $886 million, which for this purpose I will round up to $900 million. That is the projected revenue that this bill intends to pick up. Firstly I talked about the dormant bank accounts. They will roughly come in at $92 million. If this is going to raise around $900 million and the cash component is just under $100 million, then the real bulk of this money is going to come from dormant superannuation funds. That is around $675 million over the forward estimates, with most of that being in the first 12-month period, 2012-13. The forecast for those funds is $513.5 million.


When you have a government that makes poor financial decisions you can see how they affect everyone. I want to share with the House the story of a friend of mine who has no political interest in the world whatsoever. Often we would get to the point of speaking about politics and he once said: 'It doesn't matter who is in government. It doesn't really affect me because I get paid the same whether Labor or Liberal are in.' I suggest that no-one can escape bills like this one. You will not be prejudiced on this if you have an allegiance to Labor or Liberal. If you have a dormant bank account or a dormant superannuation account, you are going to get caught in this, irrespective of your political persuasion. So superannuation contributors are the big losers.


Try to be proactive. My advice to the nation, to my electors in Wright, to mums and dads and to people who work in the electorate I represent is: if you have any dormant superannuation accounts, consolidate them into one single account which you are continually contributing to and that will keep that superannuation account at arms-length of being deemed to be dormant. I encourage you to do that pronto, with haste.


Before this bill got to this place there was a government-controlled Senate economics committee inquiry held into this bill. The government recommended that the bill be passed. The coalition members of the Senate economics committee gave a fairly scathing dissenting report on this bill before it came to this House. The coalition moved a series of amendments which sought to delay the implementation of both schedules 1 and 2, which are the cash and the superannuation components relating to bank accounts and the first home saver accounts. We wanted to delay those for a full year. We wanted to delay those until 31 December to give people time. We wanted to raise awareness so that they could get out in front. We wanted to save them the heartache of finding out that their money had been taken from their bank accounts.


The coalition also sought to delay schedule 4, which relates to superannuation accounts, for a full year to align with the deadline of the autoconsolidation necessary under the previous announcements of the SuperStream reforms that are due to commence on 1 January 2014. So we would have had them aligned with legislation that was already planned. This government gave over 300 commitments—some will argue it was over 500—to deliver a surplus. Because the desire of the government to deliver a surplus was so intense, bills like this had to be brought forward so the revenue could be counted in this reporting period. The government could not afford to wait, so those amendments were disregarded.


The bill we are dealing with today is a result of the unintended consequences of a government that has lost its way, by its own definition. The fiscal management of this government will be a legacy that will haunt them for many years. This does not serve the interests of every Australian. This is a bad bill. It has been badly thought out. The procedures and processes for this bill have been rushed. I condemn this bill for the intended heartache it will cause Australians.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2013-06-19,"



Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (17:52):  In addressing my observations about the Banking Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2013 I will cite three examples that have been brought to my attention and that I think are relevant to this bill. But I also want to discuss this bill in context. The context is this: it had been thought in the past that if money had remained in bank accounts unclaimed, if those accounts had been dormant for some seven years, that the legitimate holder may no longer be aware that those funds were there—they may have died; there may be any number of explanations—then that money should not be left in an account available to essentially benefit the institution that holds it, but the government should take it on trust.


Provisions have been included in the legislation to enable the money, if it has been found to be missing by the person who was the owner, to be able to reclaim it. And seven years seemed not unreasonable. What the government has sought to do is to reduce that period to three years. You ask yourself: what are the policy reasons for doing that? Given that seven years was there and it deals with the situation where people may have lost track of the funds, why does it need to be reduced to a period of three years? What is the logical reason for doing so? I cannot think of any logical reason for doing so, other than the government—not because they are putting the money into a trust account available for the person to whom it belongs to be able to reclaim at a later date and holding it in trust for them, that is not is what is happening; what is happening is the money is being paid into consolidated revenue—is taking the money that is unclaimed and, in effect, spending it. That is what is happening.


It may be that if the government is not broke at some later period people can claim it back—maybe—but the government needs to be in pretty good odour for that to happen. What we have is a government that has billions of dollars—$340 billion or $350 billion—worth of debt. This money is about taking the funds of Australians, ostensibly on the basis that they have been lost or unclaimed, and using it for the government's use. In any other situation it would be called theft. I make the point that it may not be unreasonable when there is a fairly long period of time, but what is the reason for reducing the time? The reason for reducing the time is it is going to put money into consolidated revenue and reduce the debt.


It seems to me that when people have not claimed funds for seven years, it may reasonably be the case that nobody is going to turn up and claim them. But I suspect, with the period being three years, there are going to be a lot of people anxious about that situation and wanting to get it back. I do not know the extent to which Treasury have tried to understand the nature of those claims and to take it into account and to put it as a contingency. I hope they have done that. And you might find that if they made that study and it was a contingency, then the $100 million that they are expecting to benefit is illusory.


I want to deal with some of the circumstances that do arise. The honourable member who spoke before me, the member for Wright, mentioned accounts that grandparents and others might establish in the names of grandchildren—maybe for school fees, maybe to help them when they get engaged or married—but, if they fall on some hard times, they may not be able to add any money to the account. That there has been no transaction for three years may not be an unreasonable period but, because there has been no transaction—an additional amount added or money taken out—these funds will be forfeited to the Crown. That is essentially what is happening. You have to ask yourself: is that likely to happen? I think it is likely to happen quite frequently. My wife does this for our grandchildren, and as long as we are in a position to be able to afford to contribute it may well be that we are not going to be affected by this. But if you do not know that you have to make a transaction every year on that account, or at least every three years, you will suddenly find that the funds that you expected have been stripped away.


I have had a number of people raising this matter with me. One was an 86-year-old lady whom I know very well. She has something like $8,000 deposited in an account. She is a pensioner; she has not been able to add or subtract from that account. The money was set aside for her funeral costs and that has been stripped away. She is alarmed at the prospect that that is happening in her case.


I have had a real estate agent talk to me. He runs a business of letting properties. In relation to the tenants, he takes a bond to guarantee that if the tenant vacates the property and leaves it damaged, there can be restitution. But if there is no damage at the end of the lease, or when the tenant leaves, the funds are paid out. He has been in the situation where he has hundreds of accounts for each separate deposit. It is not a large trust account; he has to keep them separately. So he put the funds separately in an account for those tenants but if the tenants stay in the property for over three years the bond is lost. How reasonable is that? In his case, there are hundreds potentially.


When you go through it and look at what is required you are surprised, as I was, by the nature of the bureaucracy that we are implementing in relation to these matters where, to get your hard-earned cash back, you have to search ASIC's MoneySmart website to find out that your unclaimed money has been taken. If the search discloses that it is there, you have got to take the OTN, the original transaction number, and then you have got to contact your bank and, in addition, with the original transaction number you may be required to provide proof of identification, so people are then asked to provide bank statements, passports, drivers licences. When the bank is satisfied that it has a claim from the rightful owner, it informs ASIC and the funds may then be returned.


This is a bureaucratic procedure that is being put in place because the government wants to deal ostensibly with its deficit and what it is essentially doing is taking the funds of Australians and appropriating them for the government's purpose. If you did that as a private person, so you expropriated somebody's account on the basis that they had not been using it, it would be fraud—but in this case it is the government. As I have said, there were arrangements that were in place. There is no suggestion they were not working appropriately. I do not think there is any evidence that there was a need for change and I have not heard any evidence of the need for change. What I have heard is that the government thinks it has found a way by which to obtain money for consolidated revenue by taking the bank accounts and the superannuation funds and the other deposits that have been identified for its purposes—a little over $900 million—and I suspect that the government will find that it will get far more claims from people that have had funds taken after a shorter period of three years and that this will not address the substantial issue which the government has advanced as being the reason for this measure.


In my view, there is no justification for it and it is appropriate to oppose the measure. I will continue to draw the attention of my constituents to the way in which this matter is being done, because I think that it is occasioning a very considerable anxiety amongst people who should not be losing their funds in these circumstances.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2013-06-19,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (18:03):  I find it rather amusing that here we are yet again in this House amending one of the government's own bills, amending a bill that they rushed through as part of a $900 million money grab, with a hand deep into the pocket of Australian workers and taxpayers to grab their money. I would have thought that if you were a hung government you would have actually done a lot more homework on your legislation that was introduced, to make sure that you were not put in this position of having to go back to a hung parliament yet again to amend your own legislation.


By way of background as to this bill that we are talking about, the Banking Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2013, what this government did, in seeking to prop up its bottom line because of its own mismanagement of economic affairs, was reduce the time frame by which the government could access Australian people's money in bank accounts. For bank accounts it reduced the period from seven to three years. For life insurance moneys, previously treated as unclaimed after seven years, the period was reduced to three years. Superannuation accounts with balances of less than $2,000 and the accounts of unidentifiable members that had been inactive for 12 months were required to be transferred to the Commissioner of Taxation Office. It was reducing from five years to 12 months the period of inactivity before which the superannuation accounts of unidentifiable members were transferred to the ATO and the unclaimed property of corporations was now to be recognised directly in the Commonwealth Consolidated Revenue Fund—impacting the underlying cash position of the Commonwealth—upon receipt by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, as opposed to the companies and unclaimed moneys special account. As I said, this is nothing short of in essence a fraudulent, rapid, expedition of accessing Australians' cash in accounts. There was nothing wrong with the time frames that were there. This is purely a measure to gain access in particular in the 2012-13 year to some $700 million to prop up the bottom line.


In one area in particular, as was so eloquently put by my colleague the member for Berowra, there are people who put money aside before they retire for a long-term purpose, thinking about the days ahead. Perhaps one of the saddest things would be a person, particularly a pensioner, who may now be living on their own because their partner is deceased and, as my colleague the member for Berowra said, they have put aside money for their funeral fund, not wishing to pre-purchase their funeral but making sure their affairs were in order. They might have lived beyond the three-year period but they have had the money in the account without any activity.


I was informed that the addition of interest to the account still does not make that account an active account. How hard would it be for the family of a person who has passed away to then access money that the government has taken to prop up its financial position? What process and paperwork would they have to go through to find this account, identify this account and recover the moneys from that account to pay for funeral plans? These are issues that have not been thought through by this government.


One of the other areas, as put by many members in this House, is where grandparents—indeed, parents—on the arrival of a child or grandchild have put away money in an account for that person. Quite often it is to be for them when they turned 18 or when they turned 21, hoping it was an investment that would grow and be there for that person. If that account has not been added to by the parent or grandparent—indeed, anyone else—now after three years that account becomes inactive and the government gets direct access to that money. It is not that this money is held in a trust account by the government; it actually goes straight off the bottom line of consolidated revenue.


I would ask the minister in his summing up to advise the House what the cost of bureaucracy will be in going through and processing these claims for payments. Will it outweigh the benefit that you would have received after seven years in relation to a bank account as against three years? The cost of bureaucracy is becoming something that is unsustainable in this government. I think what you have added to is the cost to government.


Another area I wish to talk about in particular is superannuation. I have been on the record congratulating the Keating government for introducing compulsory superannuation for people to look after their long-term affairs. But in the beginning, particularly in relation to the tourism industry, people moved from one job to another job to another job and each of those employers might have had separate superannuation funds. In the early days people could not actually move from one fund to another fund and therefore a lot of those accounts would have had under $2,000 in them. Those have now been consumed if they were inactive for 12 months. Young people, in particular, might have been transient or moving around or taken the overseas holiday for 12 months or two years. They come back and they find that all this money has been consumed. In relation to superannuation, where it might have been earning higher than the government approved rate, what will the government do to compensate people for the loss of earnings on that superannuation money? Nothing.


This bill would never have been under consideration if the government had been able to manage the financial affairs of this nation properly and adequately. This set of amendments would never have been before the House today if the government had put enough thought into what was going to happen when people started claiming money back. In fact, the purpose of this amendment is to amend the act to exempt reactivated accounts from being reported and transferred to the Commonwealth as unclaimed money and to allow the Commonwealth to provide refunds to authorised deposit-taking institutions if the money is collected unnecessarily.



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr BALDWIN:
  It is good, but the minister should have actually put some forethought into this before rushing in here with legislation, because so urgent was it to grab this money, particularly the $700 million in the financial year 2012-13 to prop up the bottom line accounts. 


I do not intend to hold the House up any further on this other than to say that we will be supporting these amendments because they are common sense. But I think the bill as a whole, even though it was passed, stinks, because it is the wrong thing to do to Australians to rapidly access their money when there was nothing wrong with the time frames that were there originally. This government need to get a little better at their housekeeping if they want to be the government they purport to be and the financial managers they purport to be. The record has shown that they have not been.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2013-06-19,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business) (18:12):  I want to thank honourable members who have contributed to this debate on the Banking Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2013. The bill exempts reactivated accounts from being reported and transferred to the Commonwealth. These are accounts that technically meet the current definition of unclaimed moneys or where there has been a recent transaction to indicate that the account is not unclaimed. Under current legislation banks are required to report or transfer to the Commonwealth all accounts that are unclaimed as at the applicable assessment date. In some cases banks, building societies and credit unions may have allowed customers to transact on accounts after the assessment date. This bill ensures that, where an account holder has reactivated an account by making a transaction after being assessed as unclaimed, the account will not be transferred to the Commonwealth unnecessarily. By reducing the number of accounts transferred to the Commonwealth, these changes will allow the government to focus its resources on reuniting accounts with their rightful owners, where the accounts are genuinely lost.


The bill also allows the government to return funds to a financial institution if the institution has inappropriately transferred an account to the Commonwealth or if the institution has reimbursed the account holder prior to a refund request being processed. This bill will assist the government to achieve its objective to reunite more Australians with their moneys and protect their money from erosion by fees and charges. I commend this bill to the House.

Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (19:00):  Last Friday night I held the third annual 'Hasluck heroes' community awards. It was a fantastic night of community celebration and a wonderful opportunity to acknowledge 36 local achievers from my electorate. In my role, I have the great privilege of witnessing firsthand some of the fantastic work of volunteers. Unfortunately, all too often these dedicated individuals go unrecognised and unacknowledged for the way that they build up our community and make it an even better place to live.


Our community would not be the same without our countless local volunteers and the fantastic contribution they make. With this in mind, I created the 'Hasluck heroes' awards to recognise people in our community who are making outstanding achievements. It want to take this opportunity to share a few of the stories of some of those outstanding achievers from my community.


Winner of this year's 'Hasluck heroes' environmental achievement award was Unice Robinson, who has a strong passion for the environment that is admired and respected by everyone around her. Unice founded the Friends of Mary Carroll Lake, an environmental group that seeks to preserve Mary Carroll Park in Gosnells. Unice organises regular working bees for the Friends of Mary Carroll Lake to keep the site clear from rubbish and weeds, making the area a safe, family-friendly recreational place for my community. Unice is also teaching local students at Gosnells Primary School the value of the local natural bushland area. They are now able to identify some of the local plants and have developed a respect for protecting native bushland.


Kenwick Primary School student, Emilio Davey, and the local environmentalist, Eleanor Stratton, are two of the other environmental achievers who I recognised on Friday evening.


Another local achiever is Elsie Brown who was awarded this year's 'Hasluck heroes' senior achievement award. Elsie has been a resident and volunteer at Amaroo Village aged-care services for the last 18 years. I do not think that she has slowed down at all during that time. Elsie illustrates the very best of volunteering, putting the interests of others ahead of her own. Elsie cooks, cleans, shops and provides transport for fellow residents. Elsie's friendly nature and bubbly personality lifts the spirit of those she visits. In a society where more and more senior Australians feel isolated and lonely, Elsie's work is of critical importance.


Elsie is not the only senior from my electorate who is doing wonderful things in our community. I would like to mention John Boldock, Gael Connell, Shirley Fitzhum, Cindy Garlett and Geoff Wiltshire.


I am always impressed with the calibre of sports people that my community produces, and it is also an honour to recognise some of these at the 'Hasluck heroes' awards. This year's 'Hasluck heroes' sports achievement award winner, Caitlin Parker, has represented WA three times at the national titles in boxing, where she has won all three gold medals. Caitlin was not alone in her outstanding achievement, and it was also an honour to recognise Jess Anstiss, Melanie Birch, Jesse Halkett, Trent Harris, Ellie La Mante and Courtney Muggridge for their sports achievements.


The number of young people in my community who are volunteering is also impressive. This year's 'Hasluck heroes' youth achievement award went to 15-year-old Kaede Fleet, who has already made a significant contribution to our local community with her volunteer work with the Gosnells Youth Advisory Council and at her local school, Thornlie Senior High School. This year she has helped to organise Gozzy Rock 2013 and leadership programs for local youth, as well as Anzac Day services and numerous fundraising efforts at her school. She is also passionate about raising awareness about the nature of bullying, and has filmed, edited and promoted an antibullying video to raise community awareness about this important issue.


In addition to Kaede it was an honour to recognise the hard work of Briony Downes, Amy Rickard and Halei Greaves, who did an outstanding job fundraising for the cystic fibrosis 65 Roses Challenge this year. Additionally, Kiara Hicks and Paige Dittmer have both been volunteering with organisations in our community.


My community is home to some great community organisations, and on Friday night I was able to recognise several of these. This year's 'Hasluck heroes' community group award winner is the Arvosi Group, which is a group of volunteers who entertain at seniors' clubs, nursing homes and community functions. The Arvosi Group brightens the days of local seniors as they perform, and I have heard many positive reports about their work. I would also like to mention MIDLAS, the Gosnells District Neighbourhood Watch Association, the Gosnells PCYC, the Kalamunda Community Learning Centre and the Lesmurdie & Districts Community Association, who were all finalists.


Finally, I would like to acknowledge Fred Smith, who is the president of the RSL, for the volunteer achievement award. He has been volunteering for many years for the RSL and the Kalamunda SES. Thank you.

Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (09:30):  I rise this morning to pay tribute to a local champion of mental health services in her area, Ms Karly Cousins, and to speak more broadly on the very important issue of mental health. I do so with a sense of optimism. It is true that mental illness can have tragic and life-changing consequences. Many of us know of people in our network of family and friends who have been touched in some way by mental illness, but we do know that with the right support and early interventions many people with mental illness will go on to lead a rich and fulfilling life.


Reflecting on my time in this House over the past 12 years, there have been remarkable developments in how we as a nation have tackled the issue, with the rightful ebbing away of stigma and a determined effort to escalate the issue as a policy priority as a result of efforts by all sides of the political divide. Many local campaigners and my colleagues in this place have spoken publicly and courageously of their own experiences. It takes a lot of courage to open up to a stranger about a tragedy in your own family, about your desperate concern for a loved one or indeed about your own struggles, but many individuals around the country have shared these with me and, I am sure, with other members of parliament to try to improve the situation for others.


There is of course, though, still so much more that needs to be done in many communities. I have been inspired on this issue by a number of my own constituents in the electorate of Dickson and that has strengthened my resolve to continue to improve front-line services. The experience and needs of the constituents were pivotal to the $1.5 billion policy I was able to announce prior to the last election in my role as shadow health minister. Today I would like to pay tribute to a local champion further afield. Karly Cousins has been tireless in her efforts for increased mental health services, particularly after-hours services, on the Fleurieu Peninsula in South Australia. I had the great fortune of meeting Karly and her wonderful young family at a forum with the member for Mayo, Mr Jamie Briggs. She had an important story to tell and is determined to make a difference. The community is very fortunate to have someone with her commitment to such a worthy cause. Karly has presented me with a petition of some 5,793 signatures. It is being considered by the Standing Committee on Petitions and is certified as being in accordance with the standing orders.


I am particularly pleased to commend Karly on her extraordinary efforts. She is a young lady who has gone through an enormous amount of personal pain for her family. She has risen above that not only for the benefit of her own situation but for the benefit of the local community. She is a remarkable young person. I am very pleased to table the petition and to commend Karly on her extraordinary efforts.




The petition read as follows—



To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives


This petition of concerned Fleurieu Peninsula residents and, certain citizens of Australia, draw the attention of the House to the prevalence of suicide and the lack of mental health services on the Fleurieu Peninsula in South Australia.


This petition is a continuation of the Facebook group 'Petition for Mental Health Services on the South Coast', which has received overwhelming support from the local community.


We therefore ask the House to reassess existing mental health services on the Fleurieu Peninsula and increase funding for mental health services and their accessibility on the Fleurieu Peninsula.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2013-06-19,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh—Second Deputy Speaker) (10:02):  Before I start, I acknowledge that in the chamber here today we have yourself, Deputy Speaker Hall, the Chair of the Health and Ageing Committee, and the Deputy Speaker the member for Swan, who is the Deputy Chair of the Health and Ageing Committee. It gives me great pleasure to speak on this particular report, which is very dear to me in terms of my seat. When I was first elected in 2004 one of the very first speeches that I made was on dental care, so to see this report tabled this week with some very good recommendations in it is very important to all of Australia. For a seat like mine—the electorate of Hindmarsh, which is one of the oldest seats in the country—dental care is a high priority and a big issue.


The report speaks about the accessing of dental care by all people—children, families and older Australians. Currently, over 90 per cent of adults in Australia show some form of tooth decay. That is, 90 per cent of the adult population should be seeking the services of dental care or treatment. Yet, for many Australians the costs of accessing private dental services are constrained because of the cost of the services, their availability et cetera.


During many of my doorknocking sessions and consultations that I have with constituents, dental care is one of the topics that is raised on a regular basis. I have heard some horrendous stories of people needing but not being able to access the services. When I was elected back in 2004 I raised this issue on a number of occasions. In 1996 we saw public waiting lists across the country rise to about 650,000 people not being able to access dental care. It is an issue that affects many people.


It is also a health issue. One of the things that amazes me—as I am sure it does you, Deputy Chair, and the deputy chair of the committee—is that, if you break a bone, you have access to health services immediately. If you break a tooth, it is viewed in a different way. Yet a broken tooth can bring on a whole range of secondary illnesses and diseases. We know that, if you do not have healthy teeth, it affects other areas of your health.


Many people gave evidence to the committee, from public servants to dental experts, dental hygienists and a whole range of other people. All the information was accessed and the committee came up with some very good recommendations. For example, one of the areas that we investigated was enabling dental hygienists, dental therapists and oral health therapists to hold Medicare provider numbers so that they can practice independently as solo practitioners within the scope of practice parameters stipulated by their professional practice registration standards. The provision of Medicare provider numbers to these practitioners could be piloted, and we could see how that would work. I think that would be a really good recommendation, especially for some of the rural areas. These people do some great work, and it would mean they could provide more services to ensure that people are getting that first treatment that is really required to prevent further decay and to prevent further issues.


There are people on low incomes who cannot access services. During my regular doorknocking sessions, many people over the years have told me that they are concerned that there is no sustainable scheme—or, for many, no scheme at all—in place. The Grow Up Smiling package, which the government has announced, is a great initiative of $2.7 billion over the next six years for a capped benefit entitlement of $1,000 per child over a two-year period for basic dental services. This will include X-rays, fillings, check-ups and extractions, and around 3.4 million children between the ages of two and 17 will be eligible under this scheme.


We heard during the inquiry how important it is to ensure that preventative measures are put in place as well. It is not about just treating tooth decay and diseases that people are already suffering from; it is important to prevent these things. The way to do it is through this particular scheme, which will put prevention measures in place before teeth decay and before we get into the issue of secondary decay and a whole range of other things. It also means parents do not have to worry about juggling the cost of dental care for their children. It is very important.


I commend the report. It is a great report. As I said, I would also like to acknowledge: the member for Shortland and the great work she did as chair; the member for Swan, as deputy chair; of course, our committee secretariat, Alison Clegg, Renee Toy, Siobhan Leyne, Emma White, Belynda Zolotto, Fiona McCann and Kathleen Blunden; and all the other members on the committee.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:08):  I rise to speak on the Bridging the dental gap report, which I spoke about in the main chamber, along with the chair, when the report was tabled. I recognise and acknowledge the speech just made by the member for Hindmarsh, who was the Chair of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing until he was elevated to higher office. I thank him for his acknowledgement during his speech about the Bridging the dental gap report.


The report was short and quick, but it needed to be done by the government to get something in place on dental services, which, as we have just heard from the member for Hindmarsh, are so important not only to adults, children and people with chronic disease but to people in rural, remote and regional areas in Australia. One thing that came out of the report is that we need to have a united front in this area to make sure that the services and outcomes for people with dental and oral health issues are positive. We need to make sure that the states are all on board and that everyone works together to get the best outcomes for those people.


During the inquiry we travelled to Dubbo, to Charles Sturt University. I would like to acknowledge that that is one of the best remote and rural services I have ever seen. If that is a model that could be rolled out across the country it would be most beneficial, particularly, to remote rural and regional areas. We heard how the Royal Flying Doctor Service dispense their oral and dental health treatments out into the really remote areas, where Indigenous oral health is probably at its worst but, in particular, the visit to Dubbo's Charles Sturt University was a highlight. The people who were being treated on the day were getting free treatment by the students who had gone past their second year of training, and they will be treated by them until the students graduate. While we were there we heard that the first batch of graduations is going to happen this year. The environment was light, friendly and very professional. We spoke to some of the people who had had some treatment, and they were happy to use this free service with the interns and to bring their children along to use those facilities as well. It provides a much needed service for a remote and rural area.


In closing, I again commend this report to the House and I congratulate the committee and the secretariat for the work they did. I would also  like to take this opportunity to thank the current chair and the previous chair of the committee for working cooperatively with me over this parliament. It is good that we have not seen a dissenting report to any of the reports that we have written. I think that that is probably unique within the parliament. Again, I would like to thank both the chair and the previous chair.

Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh—Second Deputy Speaker) (10:02):  Before I start, I acknowledge that in the chamber here today we have yourself, Deputy Speaker Hall, the Chair of the Health and Ageing Committee, and the Deputy Speaker the member for Swan, who is the Deputy Chair of the Health and Ageing Committee. It gives me great pleasure to speak on this particular report, which is very dear to me in terms of my seat. When I was first elected in 2004 one of the very first speeches that I made was on dental care, so to see this report tabled this week with some very good recommendations in it is very important to all of Australia. For a seat like mine—the electorate of Hindmarsh, which is one of the oldest seats in the country—dental care is a high priority and a big issue.


The report speaks about the accessing of dental care by all people—children, families and older Australians. Currently, over 90 per cent of adults in Australia show some form of tooth decay. That is, 90 per cent of the adult population should be seeking the services of dental care or treatment. Yet, for many Australians the costs of accessing private dental services are constrained because of the cost of the services, their availability et cetera.


During many of my doorknocking sessions and consultations that I have with constituents, dental care is one of the topics that is raised on a regular basis. I have heard some horrendous stories of people needing but not being able to access the services. When I was elected back in 2004 I raised this issue on a number of occasions. In 1996 we saw public waiting lists across the country rise to about 650,000 people not being able to access dental care. It is an issue that affects many people.


It is also a health issue. One of the things that amazes me—as I am sure it does you, Deputy Chair, and the deputy chair of the committee—is that, if you break a bone, you have access to health services immediately. If you break a tooth, it is viewed in a different way. Yet a broken tooth can bring on a whole range of secondary illnesses and diseases. We know that, if you do not have healthy teeth, it affects other areas of your health.


Many people gave evidence to the committee, from public servants to dental experts, dental hygienists and a whole range of other people. All the information was accessed and the committee came up with some very good recommendations. For example, one of the areas that we investigated was enabling dental hygienists, dental therapists and oral health therapists to hold Medicare provider numbers so that they can practice independently as solo practitioners within the scope of practice parameters stipulated by their professional practice registration standards. The provision of Medicare provider numbers to these practitioners could be piloted, and we could see how that would work. I think that would be a really good recommendation, especially for some of the rural areas. These people do some great work, and it would mean they could provide more services to ensure that people are getting that first treatment that is really required to prevent further decay and to prevent further issues.


There are people on low incomes who cannot access services. During my regular doorknocking sessions, many people over the years have told me that they are concerned that there is no sustainable scheme—or, for many, no scheme at all—in place. The Grow Up Smiling package, which the government has announced, is a great initiative of $2.7 billion over the next six years for a capped benefit entitlement of $1,000 per child over a two-year period for basic dental services. This will include X-rays, fillings, check-ups and extractions, and around 3.4 million children between the ages of two and 17 will be eligible under this scheme.


We heard during the inquiry how important it is to ensure that preventative measures are put in place as well. It is not about just treating tooth decay and diseases that people are already suffering from; it is important to prevent these things. The way to do it is through this particular scheme, which will put prevention measures in place before teeth decay and before we get into the issue of secondary decay and a whole range of other things. It also means parents do not have to worry about juggling the cost of dental care for their children. It is very important.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2013-06-19,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (10:28):  The Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013 seeks to establish a legislative scheme for the investigation of alleged wrongdoing in the Commonwealth public sector and to provide for protective mechanisms for current or former officials who make qualifying disclosures under the regime.


Clearly, a bill of this nature is fairly topical when issues about a right to know what your government is doing, and about the way legitimate whistleblowers might be protected within the Commonwealth Public Service, have been around for some time. It is important to note that the Labor Party, prior to the 2007 election, promised that they would bring legislation of this type forward. Here we are, with 5½ days left of the second parliament of which the Labor Party has been able to form government, and they introduce it. Clearly, they are introducing this legislation not because they felt that it should apply to them, regardless of the fact that they made an election commitment that it would be a case, but so that it will apply to the next government. This is an indication that they do not take these issues as seriously as they should. A commitment was made that legislation of this type would be brought forward in 2007. That we are now in 2013, literally at the end of this parliament, and the government has finally got around to bringing legislation of this type forward is, I think, a very good representation of the way this government governs, and of the fact that commitments made by the Labor Party prior to elections never seem to be a very high priority for them once they come to office.


The question of Commonwealth enactment of whistleblowers legislation has been around for a long time, as I said. In 2008, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs—which, incidentally, was then chaired by the current Attorney-General—was tasked with examining whistleblower protection models and reporting its findings to the parliament. That committee reported in January 2009. The government did not respond until March 2010, agreeing substantially with the committee's recommendations and undertaking to introduce a bill in the course of that year. So, the committee was tasked to inquire into this issue in 2008. It reported at the beginning of 2009. The government responded a year or 14 months later, and they substantially agreed with the recommendations from that committee. They promised that a bill would be introduced in 2010. Yet here we are, in the middle of 2013, debating this legislation. The fact that we are only now debating this legislation, after all these commitments have been made to bring it forward, is a very good indication about where the Labor Party prioritises it and that this government was not necessarily prepared to have legislation brought forward that allowed for Commonwealth whistleblowing.


The scrutiny that this bill will apply comes in a number of different ways. Firstly, it will promote the integrity and accountability of the Commonwealth public sector. It will encourage and facilitate the making of public interest disclosure by public officials. It will ensure that public officials who make public interest disclosures are supported and protected from adverse consequences related to disclosures. It will ensure that disclosures by public officials are properly investigated and dealt with.


A public interest disclosure is a disclosure of information by a public official that is: a disclosure within the government to an authorised internal recipient, concerning suspected or probable illegal conduct or other wrongdoing; a disclosure to anybody, if an internal disclosure has not been adequately dealt with, and if wider disclosure satisfied public interest requirements; a disclosure to anybody of substantial imminent danger to health and safety; and a disclosure to an Australian legal practitioner for purposes connected with the above matters. It should be noted that conduct is not disclosable conduct if it relates to political or expenditure matters with which a person disagrees, the conduct of a judicial officer performing judicial functions, or the conduct of intelligence agencies in the proper exercise of their functions and powers.


The bill has been referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which is due to report on 25 June. A range of issues have been canvassed, including whether the bill properly maintains parliamentary privilege, whether it is appropriate to exclude members of parliament and their staff, and whether the exclusion in respect to intelligence agencies is too wide.


The introduction of whistleblower legislation is one of the principal aims of the Australia's Right to Know campaign, along with freedom of information reforms, journalist shield laws, and resistance to government regulation of the press—all of which is supported by the coalition.


I also want to briefly touch on the Public Interest Disclosure (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013. This bill makes amendments to the Ombudsman Act 1976, Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 and Public Service Act 1999, to provide for the investigation and any other processes consequent on the making of a public interest disclosure. I also note that the government has introduced amendments at the last minute—a practice that is happening very widely—and these amendments are going to be supported by the opposition, although it does reflect on the chaotic manner in which these final two weeks of the parliament are being run. It is indicative of the way the Labor Party runs the country, when they introduce their own legislation and then subsequently seek to amend it before it has even had a chance to be debated in one house of the parliament.


We do not oppose the passage of these bills through the House, but obviously, considering that they are the subject of a Senate inquiry and that inquiry is not due to report for another week, if that inquiry does come up with something that we believe warrants further consideration we would reserve our right to make amendments within the Senate.


The story of these bills is not a great reflection of the way the Labor Party governs. An election commitment in 2007, it has been implemented at the final end, after two terms of governance, in 2013. A parliamentary committee reported to the House at the beginning of 2009. The government accepted those recommendations after quite a long period of time, 14 months, and said that they would legislate to implement them. Yet here we are, over 3 ½ years later, debating this legislation at a time when, clearly, it is hardly going to apply to this government at all. It will apply only to whoever gets to form the next government after the next election. I think that is a very poor reflection on the Labor Party. It is a very poor reflection on the way that they run the business of this House.


We do support this bill, as we support other measures to make sure that we have integrity within the Commonwealth Public Service, but we do reserve our right to have a look at the recommendations that will be made by that Senate committee and to deal with it appropriately within the Senate after that.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2013-06-19,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle—Parliamentary Secretary For Homelessness and Social Housing and Parliamentary Secretary for Mental Health) (10:36):  I am very pleased to support the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013 and the Public Interest Disclosure (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013, which together represent the first stand-alone whistleblower protection scheme at the federal level. I want to congratulate the Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, for the work that he has done personally to reach this stage.


In keeping with the approach of this government to a range of important reform tasks, this bill arrives as the culmination of a process whose key feature was the inquiry, chaired by the now Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, of the House Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into whistleblowing protections within the Australian government sector. I was very happy to make a contribution to that inquiry in 2008. As someone involved with the creation of the United Nations Ethics Office, which included a whistleblower protection program, and in my previous role as the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, I appreciate the value and the importance of a proactive and embedded approach to organisational ethics. This is the only way to achieve entrenched ethical practice and entrenched anticorruption mechanisms, and to succeed it must proceed in a thorough whole-of-organisation approach. 


Whistleblower protection is a matter of basic organisational good health as, without adequate protection for disclosures made in relation to the poor function of any department officer or organisation, it is much harder to discover and address wrongdoing, misconduct and corruption. Thus, the key feature of the approach taken in Australia is the recognition that the ultimate objective of whistleblower protection law and policy, properly understood, is not the protection of whistleblowers as such. Protection is a crucial strategy for achieving the main objective: to encourage the disclosure of wrongdoing, fraud, waste, misconduct, abuse, corruption and imminent danger et cetera in an appropriate way so that something can be done about it. Practical concern about the public interest, rather than moralism, is the key. Of course, public officials who report wrongdoing must have robust protections to ensure that they do not suffer adverse consequences for making a report.


Whistleblower protection schemes have been operating at the state government level in Australia for many years now, successfully. There is now a broad acceptance in Australia of the public interest justification for effective and practical protection of responsible whistleblowers and for whistleblowing activity by public officials and others occupying positions of trust. There appears to be no serious suggestion in any quarter that those who genuinely disclose official corruption, fraud, theft, criminal conduct, abuse of office, serious threat to public health and safety, official misconduct, maladministration or avoidable wastage of public resources should not receive protection from retaliation by those involved. On the contrary, organisations that fail to protect genuine whistleblowers and permit or take reprisal action against them usually face severe censure. 


In addition, Australia has been the focus of attention by the committee reviewing Australia's implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Legislating a strong whistleblower protection mechanism is seen as a key part of Australia's compliance with that convention. So the time has well and truly come for this bill, for these protections and for this encouragement of public interest disclosures. 


The Dreyfus report was delivered in February 2009 and the government made a detailed response to the inquiry in 2010. The Dreyfus report, the government response and this bill would not have been possible without the pivotal research work carried out by Professor AJ Brown of Griffith University and other colleagues as part of a collaborative national research project called Whistling while they work. Professor Brown, as well as integrity advocates from the Accountability Round Table—the Hon. Tim Smith QC and Howard Whitton—have continued to provide advice and assistance with respect to the development of the bill, and I want to thank—

Ms PARKE:
  As I was saying before the interruption, the Dreyfus report, the government response and this bill would not have been possible without the pivotal research work carried out by Professor AJ Brown of Griffith University and his colleagues as part of a collaborative national research project called Whistling While They Work. Professor Brown, as well as integrity advocates from the accountability roundtable the Hon. Tim Smith QC and Mr Howard Whitton, have continued to provide advice on and assistance with the development of the bill. I thank them sincerely for their efforts and their hard work.


While this bill is very welcome, and while it represents yet another significant achievement in terms of the governance improvements delivered by this government, I will say that there is scope for further enhancements in this area in the future, including whistleblower protection in the private sector. A number of the big corruption scandals of recent years involving the operation of Australian companies and government agencies, both overseas and in Australia, would not have come to light without the bravery and integrity of whistleblowers in the public and private sectors. It is only right that such courage be protected and supported. 


The provision in this bill requiring review of the act in two year's time is very welcome. In the meantime, I congratulate the Attorney-General once again and commend the bill to the House.

Mr MELHAM
 (Banks) (11:14):  I rise to support the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013 and the Public Interest Disclosure (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013. The Parliamentary Library, in preparing its research paper, Bills Digest, into the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013 had the following to say on page 4:


… the Commonwealth is the only Australian jurisdiction that does not have legislation dedicated to facilitating public interest disclosures and protecting those who make them. Since the 1990s there have been a number of unsuccessful attempts to introduce more comprehensive whistleblower protection laws with a series of parliamentary and non-parliamentary inquiries and a number of private members Bills, most of which were initiated by the Australian Democrats and the Greens. However these Bills all lapsed due to a lack of Government support.


It is pleasing that the bills before the committee today have the support of the government and the opposition.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—

Mr MELHAM:
  The bills we are discussing today have their genesis in a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which tabled a report in February 2009. The government in introducing the legislation largely implements the government response to that report.


It is important to point out that the chair of the committee at that time was the current Attorney-General who in effect tabled these reports and delivered the second reading speech. In the second reading speech on the bill, he listed the framework of the bill in three parts. The first is to encourage and facilitate all Commonwealth public officials to report suspected wrongdoing. The second is to make sure that reports of suspected wrongdoing are properly handled by agencies and in a reasonable time frame; and, thirdly the bill protects public officials who report suspected wrongdoing from adverse consequences as a result of reporting their concerns.


In his second reading speech on the consequential amendments bill, the Attorney points out that the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security will have oversight functions for the public interest disclosure scheme. Amendments proposed to the Public Interest Disclosure (Consequential Amendments) Bill will support this oversight function.


The Ombudsman will be able to investigate a public interest disclosure made to the Ombudsman where the wrongful conduct relates to an agency that is not an intelligence agency or the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The Ombudsman will also be able to investigate handling by agencies of public interest disclosures. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security will be able to investigate a public interest disclosure made to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security where the wrongful conduct relates to an intelligence agency. 


Further down, these investigative functions are complemented by other measures in the public interest disclosure bill. The Ombudsman will assist agencies and public officials in the operation of the scheme, including through the conduct of educational awareness programs. It is important that agencies and officials have a clear understanding of how the scheme works in order for it to operate effectively.


I think that is the right balance in relation to reporting and, in relation to the Inspector-General and the Ombudsman. I think there is a history there which gives the public confidence in relation to them dealing with complaints and also gives the complainants confidence that their complaints will be properly and appropriately dealt with in a confidential and sensitive way.


Because we have not had this sort of legislation in the federal jurisdiction before, I would anticipate that there will be a need for tweaking over time. That happens at a state level in state jurisdictions and that is why I think it is good and important that these bills have the support of the government and the alternative government. The signal we need to send is: 'The policy decision has been made. This is the way we are going. There is no turning back.'


I want to pay compliment to the Attorney-General, because I know how hard he has laboured in the time that he was chair of the House of Reps legal committee, parliamentary secretary and now Attorney-General to guide this legislation through the proper processes of the bureaucracy and government. We need to accept that some compromises have been made—I do not necessarily want to go into those compromises; it is the principles I am interested in.


People should be able to make a confidential complaint secure in the knowledge that it will be properly handled and that they will also be protected and not discriminated against.


What disturbs me is that one can look at the history of this case at other levels of government and one always sees the same thing happen: a complaints is made but, in a number of instances, those making the complaint are discriminated against. Some of it is passive discrimination: they are left to their own devices, left to flounder and they are not protected. So we need to be conscious of that, if we are to have information properly brought to the relevant authorities.


The other cautionary note I would make is that I am not one who has a lot of time for frivolous complaints. Because frivolous complaints can undermine the whole system. In New South Wales, for instance, we have an Independent Commission Against Corruption with a chequered history. But I get sick and tired of reading in the newspaper, listening to the radio or watching the TV, and hearing about a complaint where the ink is not even dry that has been made to ICAC. The reference to ICAC is of itself very damaging to the individuals concerned, and it might be a complaint without substance and you do not hear about afterwards, other than someone being referred to ICAC. 


So we need to be careful in developing this model to set up protections in relation to false complaints. Because, I think, in a number of instances I do not think it is in the public interest that certain things are made public. In other instances, it is in the interest that certain things are made public. That is a matter of having confidence in the organisations themselves. This gung-ho attitude—and it happens, frankly, in relation to a lot of councils in New South Wales—is where people just shoot from the hip and say, 'I have referred the matter of an inappropriate development application to ICAC,' and all you find is that it is a faction fight in the council.


I flag these concerns—and I am not talking about specific pieces of the legislation; I am just talking about the principles that I support. I very strongly support whistleblower legislation. I think people should be entitled to bring that appropriate conduct before authorities. But what we do not want is workplace faction fights where, maybe on balance, decisions are made one way that could have been made another or whatever. Airing those—how to you filter those out is obviously a matter for the appropriate authorities—can drain much needed resources, because there are going to be limited resources in relation to the level of complaints. I am not saying that at a national level we are immune from these things; we are not. But I think that at a state and local government level they are more vulnerable to the sort of conduct that we have had evidence on day after day from ICAC in New South Wales. Because it is a different role for the local councils and for some state officials. We tend at a federal level—certainly as politicians, I am talking about here—to be more removed from the process. That is not to say that we are not.


So I am happy to support this legislation. I am pleased it has actually been introduced into this place, because it has been a long time coming. I urge support for it in its current form in the full knowledge that it will need to be tweaked over time as experience is gained.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (11:54):  I am very pleased to be speaking on this important piece of legislation. I am also very pleased to be following the member for Banks in this debate, who brings to the debate and the subject matter decades of experience as a parliamentarian and, before that, years of experience at the criminal bar. The contributions that he makes must be listened to.


Of course, the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013 does not stand alone. It is part of a package of reforms that have been introduced by the government since winning office in 2007 which go to the issues of integrity and disclosure. I reference the reforms to the freedom of information provisions within this country, which put in place for the first time a presumption in favour of disclosure, and the abolition of the rorts that were occurring under the previous government such as the use of conclusive certificates, which were used as a device—if not a vice—to ensure that documents and information that should properly be provided to the public on request were prohibited. In equal measure the reforms that this government has put in place in the area of lobbying and lobbyists, to ensure there is greater transparency and greater regulation in this area, also take up public integrity measures, which is a great step forward in ensuring that there is a register of lobbyists for those who come to this place seeking to influence parliamentarians. In addition to that, there are prohibitions on ministerial staff engaging in lobbyist work for a period of time after they leave their ministerial employment.


The legislation before the House today is about whistleblowers, and it is very welcome. For our public servants, this protection for those making an authorised disclosure in the public interest has been a long time coming—some say too long, and I will join them. Every state and territory in Australia, as well as in a whole range of overseas jurisdictions, has legislation that provides protections for whistleblowers. I hope that the Commonwealth jurisdiction will soon join them. My own advocacy for these measures commenced before I came to parliament when I was the national secretary of the Community and Public Sector Union, the union that provides representation to the men and women who work in the public sector and in public sector entities. The CPSU has long supported the development of legislation to put in place a process to protect public interest disclosures. I am sure the union will join with me in welcoming the fact that this bill is being debated in the House today.


The Public Interest Disclosure Bill will ensure that there are appropriate processes in place and protections offered to facilitate the disclosure of wrongdoing, misconduct and corruption. A key objective of the scheme will be to foster and promote a culture in the Australian public sector which supports speaking out in the face of wrongdoing and maladministration. The whistleblower legislation will facilitate reporting and will provide for investigation of serious wrongdoing in the public sector. It will protect whistleblowers who make disclosures in accordance with the scheme. The scheme will provide protections to whistleblowers who make disclosures directly to the media, either following an internal disclosure where the relevant criteria have been satisfied or, in a much rarer occasion, where the discloser believes there is an imminent danger to public safety which justifies direct disclosure without prior internal investigation within government.


In developing this framework the government has built upon the foundations of the February 2009 House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report of the inquiry into whistleblowing protection within the Australian government public sector. The government's detailed response to that report was also known as the Dreyfus report. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work put into this policy area over many years by the now Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus. Of course, he was not alone. Before him, and in the other place, Senator the Hon. John Faulkner also dedicated his time and expertise towards developing and advocating for a solid policy framework in this important area.


The government and the parliament, through committees, have also had the benefit of the expertise of Australia's leading experts in this area, including Dr AJ Brown of Griffith University. The three-year research project led by Dr Brown has been an important reference point for the parliament seeking to ensure that best-practice legislation was put forward. In his report Whistling while they work, Dr Brown and his colleagues conducted research across thousands of workplaces by means of survey work and direct interviews and held their own seminars and produced discussion papers. That work has been invaluable to this policy process. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of Dr AJ Brown and his colleagues.


Parliamentarians in this place have known for some time that whistleblowers need a better framework of protection. Over the past 19 years there have been numerous reviews and attempts made to introduce this type of legislation at the Commonwealth level. This work started with the 1994 report of the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing, which was entitled In the public interest. Legislation to give effect to that Senate work ended with the election in March 1996 of a coalition government. Very limited protection was introduced in the Public Service Bill that was then introduced in 1997; indeed, many commentators described it is the weakest protection framework for whistleblowers anywhere in the Commonwealth. This limited protection came into force in 1999 and is still there in section 19 of the Public Service Act. In the interim, many private members' bills were put forward, including by Senator Andrew Murray, the former senator from Western Australia, in 2001, 2002 and 2007. Regrettably, those bills never enjoyed support from the coalition government at the time; each of the three bills proposed by Senator Murray had lapsed.


Upon election to government in 2007, Labor once again took this matter up. While it has taken longer than expected to get here, we now have before the parliament best-practice legislation that will apply broadly across the entire Commonwealth public sector. I am confident that given this history, which created many quasi-experts in this era and in earlier parliaments, the bill achieves the goals of those who believe that the public sector is stronger if corruption and maladministration is exposed or if there is the potential for exposure of corruption and maladministration. We enjoy a very robust Commonwealth Public Service which is free from the sorts of maladministration and corruption that are often typified in other places. Nothing in what I have said today should be taken as casting aspersions upon those men and women who work in the Australian Public Service.


The bill contains a broad range of conduct that constitutes disclosable conduct for the purpose of the scheme that is put forward. This conduct is set out in subclause 29(1) of the bill. It includes conduct that contravenes a law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory; conduct that contravenes a law of a foreign country which is applicable to the agency, public official or service provider; conduct that perverts, or is engaged in for the purpose of perverting or attempting to pervert, the course of justice, or conduct engaged in for the purpose of corruption of any other kind; conduct that constitutes maladministration, including conduct that is based in part on improper motives, is unreasonable, unjust, repressive or negligent; conduct that is an abuse of public trust; conduct that constitutes scientific misconduct as described in item 6 of the table; conduct that results in a wastage of public money or public property; conduct that unreasonably results in a danger to the health or safety of one or more persons or is unreasonably likely to increase the risk of such danger; conduct that results in, or increases, a risk of danger to the environment; and other conduct as prescribed in the Public Interest Disclosure rules. Deputy Speaker, you can see the scope of the legislation. The proposed legislation is very broad indeed.


Why is the bill important? Quite simply, the bill is important because it is a critical plank in ensuring that our Australian Public Service maintains a culture of openness, a culture of transparency and a culture of good governance. We put great trust in our public institutions and in our public servants. Nothing is of greater importance than that public administration is carried out in a way that is free from maladministration and corruption. We expect the very highest of ethical standards as is set out in the APS Values. In regard to the Public Service, there have been three key objectives of this government: firstly, to rebuild trust and the accountability of ministers and their staff; secondly, to uphold the Westminster tradition of public service independence and neutrality; and, thirdly, to deliver a more open and responsible government committed to serving the public interest. In that vein, the new Australian Public Service Values have just been released by the Attorney-General this week.


This government came to office in 2007 committed to rebuilding the integrity of government and the Australian Public Service. I believe that our commitment to greater protection of public servants will be met in the reforms before the House today. We are nearing the end of a parliamentary sitting. I am very hopeful that this important legislation passes through this House with support from all sides of politics. I am also very hopeful that in the time available to those in the other place they have the opportunity to consider and pass this bill into legislation. Nothing can be more important to the confidence of the Australian public in our public institutions than that we complement the already existing measures, which are built around ensuring that we have a framework for integrity and disclosure, with the measures before the House today.


I commend the legislation to the House.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2013-06-19,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (12:06):  Officials must have the right to disclose misconduct, maladministration or incompetence, and communities must have the protection afforded by such outspokenness. In other words, so-called whistleblowing is an important check on public administration which needs to be allowed, even encouraged. Those that would blow the whistle need to know they are doing the right thing and will ultimately be protected from reprisals. In essence, I think this bill does achieve that.


It has been a very long road to get to here on this very important issue. At the Commonwealth level, comprehensive public interest disclosure legislation was first recommended by the Liberal chaired Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing, in 1994. But it had always been left to the minor parties to roll their sleeves up and try to progress real reform. Bills were introduced unsuccessfully by the Greens in 1993 and then by the Democrats in 2002 and in 2007.


Regrettably though these were all false starts, and it was not until the election of Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister, with Senator John Faulkner as Special Minister of State, that the prospect genuinely hardened of us finally seeing Commonwealth whistleblower legislation enacted. It was even more of a prospect when the Prime Minister's 2007 commitment was reinforced in 2009 by the parliamentary committee chaired by the now Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus. That committee provided a detailed and bipartisan blueprint for Commonwealth legislation.


The 2010 federal election offered more good news, this time in the Gillard government's agreements with the Greens, along with the members for Lyne and New England and me, to promote open and accountable government and to improve the processes and the integrity of the parliament.


This bill, if enacted by the parliament, finally will get the job done. It will realise the aspirations of Liberal, Greens and Democrats senators and deliver on the promises of this and the previous Labor government. It will also deliver on our G20 commitment to the anticorruption action plan. But, most importantly, it will genuinely strengthen public integrity in this country.


I am hopeful the opposition will support the government's bill. The conservative side of politics actually has a reasonable record in this regard. In fact, it was the Liberal government in New South Wales in 1994, the Liberal and National parties in Queensland in 2006 and the Liberal government in Western Australia in 2010 which drove important whistleblowing reforms in those jurisdictions at that time, all of which gives me heart and confidence that this bill will have the support of the whole parliament and indeed all of the crossbench.


Having said that, nothing is perfect and this sure is not perfect. I have campaigned with others for a number of amendments to be made, many of which have been. I would single out two potential amendments which remain unaddressed and take this opportunity to speak to the Attorney-General, who has joined us, and make one final plea that the government consider two important amendments, which I know the Attorney-General is already aware of. 


Compensation for detriment caused by institutional failures to support and protect whistleblowers should be included, rather than simply the inclusion of compensation for direct reprisals, which I understand the bill currently allows. I would ask the Attorney-General to do what he can to put the power of the Ombudsman beyond doubt, and I know others have asked him this. It is something we discussed by telephone only today. 


I believe the bill as it stands is deficient in a number of other ways and I have discussed these publicly, in this place and with the Attorney-General. It is regrettable that the bill excludes the case of wrongdoing by members of parliament and ministers. I do not understand why this cannot apply to all public officials, because it is certainly the expectation of the community that members of parliament and ministers should not be beyond scrutiny. They should have been included in this bill and so too should the staff of members of parliament. It is regrettable that they are not. It is a reasonable public expectation that not only should members of parliament be open to public scrutiny but also their staff should be.


Something close my heart is that the bill should include intelligence officials and material. It is regrettable they have been carved out. I do not think that was necessary. It would have been possible to craft this bill in a way that would have allowed for the careful disclosure of wrongdoing by intelligence officials. I am thinking of my own experience a decade ago when I was an intelligence official and spoke up about what I saw as a wrongdoing. I was able to do that in a way that did not disclose any sensitive information or put the national security of this country or any other country at risk.


I lament the fact that this bill does not pass what I call the Allan Kessing test. Just to remind people, Allan Kessing was the customs official working at Sydney Airport who, in 2003, wrote a very important report on security at the airport. That material was leaked—it was obviously sensitive material—to the media in 2005, and Allan Kessing was convicted of the leak in 2007. It is something, I understand, he denies to this day. There is no doubt that Allan Kessing acted in the public interest by trying to shine a light on shortfalls in security at Sydney Airport. In my opinion, he is a good man who was acting in the public interest. But this public interest disclosure bill provides him no protection, and it would have provided him no protection back then if it had been in place.


This is for at least two reasons. One, he was convicted of disclosing intelligence material. As I have already described, intelligence material and intelligence officials have been carved out from the protection of this bill. Second—arguably—there was no imminent threat to life. This is a provision in the bill where someone can go directly to the media if there is imminent danger to people. I disagree, but it could be argued that there was not an imminent threat to life. So there are two reasons for it failing the Allan Kessing test. 


Nor would it pass the Andrew Wilkie test. I came to public prominence and was propelled into public life a little over a decade ago when, a week before the invasion Iraq, I spoke out publicly about what I saw as the misconduct of the Howard government and, in particular, that the Prime Minister and senior ministers were misusing intelligence information to justify an unwarranted war.


This bill would not have protected me at the time because, again, I was an intelligence official discussing intelligence matters. I was also making a complaint publicly against the Prime Minister and ministers. I think two of the most high-profile whistleblower episodes in recent years involved Alan Kessing and Andrew Wilkie. In both cases, this bill would have provided no protection to those two men.


Having said all of that, we have travelled a very long road and finally got there with something which is substantially a good piece of legislation. I applaud the government for finally getting us to this point. It has been a long time—nearly 20 years—since we took the first steps in this place. In particular, I would like to thank the Attorney-General. I do not want this to be taken as a criticism of his predecessor, but there was a time in this parliament where this seemed to be moving dreadfully slowly and, from what I knew of the work that was being done, it was seriously deficient. The Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, has turbocharged this process, and I think he personally deserves great credit for that. He is ultimately very much responsible for getting us over the line, hopefully, at this last-minute—notwithstanding the shortfalls in your bill, Attorney-General!


I would also like to single out Dr AJ Brown, Professor of Public Law at Griffith University. Dr Brown has helped a number of jurisdictions with their whistleblower legislation or their public interest disclosure legislation. I would go so far as to say that I cannot think of any other person who has done so much single-handedly to enhance the integrity of public administration in this country, in particular as far as public interest disclosure of wrongdoing goes. I want to record to show that we would not have got to this stage and we would not have a bill in the shape it is in if it were not for Dr Brown and the work he has done—not just with this bill but also with helping to draft my own bill on a similar matter. That bill, unfortunately, will not be realised, but I think it has provided a benchmark or a test for the government's bill and it has helped to add to the pressure on the government to see these reforms through. That was very much Dr Brown's work, so good on him.


This is a significant day for me personally. I was propelled into the public spotlight over a whistleblowing episode. It was something that cost me my job, many friends and a lot of money, and it was not easy. But of course my story has a happy ending, and I am as proud as punch to be standing here in the parliament talking about finally getting whistleblower legislation through. For me this is a good day, but I am not just speaking for myself; I am speaking for thousands of whistleblowers in this country. Regrettably, Australia is a very tough place to be a whistleblower. Most whistleblowers in Australia get little public attention and little media attention. They lose their job, they lose their families and they lose their money. Some lose their minds and some even lose their lives or take their own life.


You would think that in a country such as ours, built on the foundations it is, we would be a bit more disrespectful of authority and a bit more admiring of people who speak truth to power and truth to authority. Remarkably, we are not, and many whistleblowers are dragged down by the community. Maybe they are seen as dobbers; maybe they are seen as dobbing on their mates and not being team players. I do not know what it is, but it is a tough country in which to be a whistleblower. That is one of the reasons we need this sort of legislation. We need to empower people in public administration to speak up when they see wrongdoing and to speak up when they see maladministration or incompetence. We should celebrate what they do, not drag them down. We should give them protection against reprisals, and then we should celebrate their achievement in the community.


In 2002, Time magazine in the United States had three women as Time magazine's People of the Year. They were three whistleblowers. You would never see that in Australia. Maybe one day we will see that sort of acclaim for people who speak truth to power. But, Attorney-General, this bill is a really solid stepping stone to turning this issue around in this country in the future. Thank you, Attorney-General.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2013-06-19,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Attorney-General, Minister for Emergency Management, Minister for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (12:19):  I welcome the contributions of all members to the debate on the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013 and the Public Interest Disclosure (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013. The Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013 has an object of promoting integrity and accountability in the Commonwealth public sector. The bill will achieve this by establishing a single comprehensive scheme to support inquiry into wrongdoing in the Commonwealth public sector and those who report it. It is the first stand-alone legislation for this purpose at the federal level.


I thank the parliamentary committees for their inquiries and reports on the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs together received more than 30 submissions on the bill. Both those inquiries recommended that this bill be passed, with the Senate committee's recommendation subject to certain amendments being made. I welcome these contributions and will be moving government amendments that are designed to further enhance the operation of the scheme.


A main purpose of the bill is to establish clear procedures for allegations of wrongdoing to be reported by public officials and for findings of wrongdoing to be rectified. The emphasis on the scheme is on the disclosure of wrongdoing being reported to and investigated within government. To this end, the bill places obligations on principal officers of agencies to ensure that public interest disclosures are properly investigated and that appropriate action is taken to deal with recommendations relating to their agency. In short, these are obligations to act on disclosures of wrongdoing and to fix wrongdoing where it is found. A well-implemented and comprehensive scheme should lead to a discloser having confidence in the system, and remove incentive for the discloser to make public information to parties outside government.


Recourse for making disclosures outside government should be exercised with reserve when reported wrongdoing is not being properly investigated and rectified, and when other public interests will not be undermined. This is reflected in the requirements to make a qualifying protected external disclosure. Amendments that I will be moving to the bill will make some changes to the qualifying requirements for public interest disclosures. External disclosure is not the only recourse for a public official who is dissatisfied with the manner in which their disclosure has been handled. It is also open to an official to make a complaint to the Ombudsman or to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security at any stage of the process for dealing with a public interest disclosure.


I clarify that the bill applies to the intelligence agencies. A public official within an intelligence agency can make a protected disclosure about wrongful conduct in their agency. The disclosure can be made to an authorised officer in the intelligence agency or to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. A public interest disclosure concerning the conduct of an intelligence agency will be required to be investigated and dealt with in the same way as a disclosure concerning an agency that is not an intelligence agency. The activities of intelligence agencies are governed by the Intelligence Services Act 2001 and the Australia Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. Under those acts, intelligence agencies must seek a direction or authority from the appropriate minister for agency use of special powers and other sensitive activities for that purpose. The responsible minister must be satisfied that any activity undertaken by an intelligence agency is in accordance with the function of that agency in addition to other factors set out in the legislation.


The purpose of clause 33 of the bill is to make clear that intelligence agencies lawfully conducting activities in accordance with their functions as defined by the Intelligence Services Act 2001 and the Australia Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 cannot form the basis for a public interest disclosure. The question of whether or not conduct engaged in by an intelligence agency is in the proper performance of its functions is itself a matter that can be reviewed by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. 


The restrictions in the bill relating to intelligence agencies apply to external disclosures. Information that is 'intelligence information' cannot be disclosed outside government and no protection is afforded for any public disclosure of this kind of information. Information that concerns the conduct of an intelligence agency can also not be disclosed outside government and does not qualify for a protected 'external disclosure', but may be the subject of an 'emergency disclosure'. In that case, the restriction on public disclosure of 'intelligence information' would still apply.


The restrictions on public disclosure of intelligence information and the conduct of intelligence information are supported by the risk that very sensitive information could be improperly or unwittingly publicly disclosed. Inadvertent or inappropriate disclosure of intelligence information may compromise national security and potentially place lives at risk. Australian intelligence agencies also have obligations to their foreign partners to maintain the confidentiality of information shared with them.


Some argue that the bill should apply to disclosures by and about members of parliament and to staff engaged by them. On this matter, the bill implements the government's response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report on whistleblower protection. In that response, the government said that allegations of wrongdoing by members of parliament should be addressed by the parliament. This recognises that members of parliament and their staff perform roles that are different to Commonwealth public sector agencies and their staff.


Some criticism has also been made that the bill does not apply to federal judicial officers. It would not be appropriate for the scheme to apply to judicial officers as it would impinge on the constitutional independence of the federal courts. Allegations of wrongful conduct by federal judicial officers can be investigated through the complaints framework established by the Courts Legislation Amendment (Judicial Complaints) Act 2012 and the Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (parliamentary Commissions) Act 2012.


There has also been some criticism that the bill may be difficult to understand for public officials making a disclosure. The bill places obligations on principal officers of agencies to establish procedures for facilitating and dealing with public interest disclosures. These procedures must comply with standards that are determined by the Ombudsman. It is part of the oversight functions for the Ombudsman and the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security to give assistance to current and former public officials making a disclosure as well as to agencies to comply with the scheme. I am able to advise that the Ombudsman proposes to publish guidance on the office's website that will supplement the legislation and standards. This guidance will further assist public officials considering making a disclosure as well as agencies in complying with the scheme.


The Public Interest Disclosure Bill and the Public Interest Disclosure (Consequential Amendments) Bill represent an important reform to strengthen the process in which wrongdoing in the Commonwealth public sector is handled, and to strengthen the protections for those who report wrongdoing. I commend the bills to the House.


Question agreed to.

Review of operation of Act



(1) The Minister must cause a review of the operation of this Act to be undertaken.


(2) The review must:


   (a) start 2 years after the commencement of this section; and


   (b) be completed within 6 months.


(3) The Minister must cause a written report about the review to be prepared.


(4) The Minister must cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the Minister receives the report.


The government amendments to the Public Interest Disclosure Bill will improve the operation of the bill and clarify certain provisions. Proposed amendments will implement substantially the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee as well as a number of suggestions arising from submissions made to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs and to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.


A number of amendments are proposed that will change the requirements to qualify for a protected public interest disclosure. These amendments serve to simplify and clarify some of these requirements and to implement recommendations 2, 3 and 7 of the Senate committee report.


These include amendment (21), which will change the criteria for establishing when an investigation or report is taken to be inadequate for the purpose of qualifying for a protected 'external' disclosure. Concerns were raised that the criteria in clauses 37 to 39 would be difficult to apply and should be based on a subjective assessment by the discloser. Amendment (21) will have the effect that inadequacy will be met if a discloser believes on reasonable grounds that the part 3 investigation was inadequate, or a response to an investigation was inadequate, or if a part 3 investigation has not been completed within the required time limit. Only one of these grounds would need to be established to meet the inadequacy requirement for an 'external' disclosure.


To give balance to the list of factors that must be taken into account for the purposes of the public interest test for an 'external' disclosure, further factors will be added to the list in subclause 26(3). These include factors favouring disclosure and reflected in the objects of the bill. The existing listed factors weighing against public disclosure of information align with exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act and will be retained.


Amendments (19) and (20) would amend the criteria to qualify for a protected 'internal' or 'external' disclosure so that a disclosure could qualify for protection where the information tends to show disclosable conduct as well as where the discloser believes on reasonable grounds that the information tends to show disclosable conduct. It will no longer be a requirement to qualify for a protected 'internal', 'external' or 'emergency' disclosure that the disclosure not be contrary to a 'designated publication restriction'. However, it remains important that the protection framework in the bill does not undermine the policy supporting confidentiality of non-publication orders and directions of the kind identified as 'designated publication restrictions' in the bill.


The approach in the amendments is that a discloser will lose the immunity protections in clause 10 of the bill where the discloser knows that the disclosure contravenes a designated publication restriction and does not have a reasonable excuse for that contravention.


Making a report of wrongdoing in the workplace can take courage. Public officials need confidence that they will not be exposed to detriment in any way as a consequence of raising concerns about wrongdoing. A number of amendments will further strengthen the protections in the bill for public officials who make qualifying disclosures. Amendment (6) corrects an omission so that the immunity protections given in clause 10 of the bill would only be lost if the discloser knowingly makes a false or misleading statement. This change implements recommendation 4 of the Senate committee report. The penalty for the offences of taking a reprisal or threatening to take a reprisal against a person who has made a disclosure will be increased to two years imprisonment or 120 penalty units or both.


Instituting proceedings in a court for redress for alleged detriment as a result of making a public interest disclosure is a decision that most people would not take lightly. Amendment (8) will serve to ameliorate reservations a public official may have to bringing proceedings under the bill arising from exposure to pay a defending party's costs. Under this amendment, a current or former public official who brings an action in the Federal Court or Federal Circuit Court for a remedy under the bill could not be ordered to pay the defending party's costs unless the court is satisfied they instituted the proceedings vexatiously or acted unreasonably to cause the other party to incur costs. A court could exercise its ordinary jurisdiction to award costs against a defending agency party. Some amendments will serve to enhance the oversight roles for the ombudsman and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.


Authorised officers in agencies will be required to give the ombudsman and the inspector-general certain details about a disclosure at the time a decision is made on how the agency or agencies will handle the disclosure. This obligation supplements an existing requirement for agencies to give information to the ombudsman about public interest disclosures at the end of each financial year, and that would be used to inform the ombudsman's annual report on the operation of the act.


As the bill now stands, to qualify for a protected internal disclosure a public official must make the disclosure to an authorised officer within the agency. Amendment (19) and related amendments will implement recommendation 1 of the Senate committee's report so that a public official can also make a public interest disclosure to a person who is their supervisor or manager. To complement that amendment, a supervisor would be required to give the information they have received to an authorised officer in their agency where the supervisor has reasonable grounds to believe that the information tends to show disclosable conduct.


The Senate committee suggested that disclosure to a supervisor includes people who are in an indirect supervisory or management relationship. This approach has not been adopted. The concept of a person who indirectly supervises someone in the Commonwealth public sector is potentially very broad. As a supervisor will have an obligation to refer suspected disclosable conduct to an authorised officer, this measure is not intended to apply to a person who would not ordinarily be considered an official's supervisor.


It remains an obligation under the bill for a principal officer to ensure there are a sufficient number of readily accessible authorised officers in an agency and to ensure that public officials are aware of the identity of each authorised officer in their agency. An official who does not want to make a disclosure to their supervisor could make a disclosure to an authorised officer.


Amendment (72) will implement recommendation 5 of the Senate committee report by omitting clause 81 from this bill. Amendment (73) will implement recommendation 6 of the Senate committee report that a review of the operation of the act be undertaken two years after it has commenced. This review will provide a good opportunity for the procedures in the act to be examined, as well as for consideration to be given to widening its application including to members of parliament and to staff.


I commend the amendments to the House.

Mr BANDT

Review



(1) The Minister must, as soon as practicable after the second anniversary of the commencement of this section, cause a review to be undertaken of the operation of this Act.


(2) The persons undertaking the review must give the Minister a written report of the review within 6 months of that second anniversary.


(3) The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after its receipt by the Minister.


The purpose of these amendments is to clarify the way that an ombudsman can investigate a whistleblower and their claim and how it can be treated by the agency concerned. The position underpinning these amendments is, obviously: supporting the principle of whistleblowing and empowering people to take a stand to do what is right and make a positive and lasting contribution to society.


This is exactly what whistleblowers do and the Greens unequivocally support their protection under law. But we want a whistleblower scheme that assures people that they will not be the focus of investigation but rather that their allegations will be. However, the way that this bill is drafted shows greater preoccupation with protecting Public Service institutions than with public servants themselves. The government's amendments improve this imbalance, but we still have concerns because the bill sets up so many trip-wires for the whistleblower to navigate and, with one wrong step, they can lose their legal protection. In this respect, we wish that the bill was closer to the legislation that was passed in the ACT as part of the agreement between the Greens and the Labor Party, which we believe provides a template for simplicity and effectiveness.


The amendments address a number of issues and I will go through those briefly. First is the question of MPs and their staff. An obvious flaw in the bill is that it does not cover MPs and their staff. Our amendments include them in the operation of this legislation. Members of parliament are imposing standards and obligations on all those working for the Public Service, except themselves.


This legislation, as currently framed, will do nothing to challenge the public perception that politicians are more interested in arranging their affairs to suit themselves than in vigorously pursuing the public interest. These amendments will bring MPs, ministers, speakers, presidents and their staff into the scheme so that they may raise concerns about misconduct, maladministration and corruption before the consequences escalate.


Also addressed by these amendments is the question of intelligence agencies. The blanket exemption on externally disclosing all information created or obtained by an intelligence service is so broad it would cover the most remotely incidental and inane material and even covers disclosing material that has already been publicly released.


Our moderate amendment simply takes this blanket exemption out and leaves in place the long list of exempt material that would threaten investigations, operational matters and broader national security interests. Without this amendment, our intelligence agencies will be more vulnerable to maladministration and corruption than any other public agency because there are no protected avenues for intelligence officers to disclose information to a third party when internal investigations have been fruitless or thwarted by senior management.


These amendments also address the question of act-of-grace payments. Whistleblowers often undergo great personal and financial strain once they have decided to come forward, and this legislation, despite the objects of the act, does not provide enough incentives for someone thinking about doing the right thing and speaking out.


One way that the Greens want to provide incentives is for the minister to have an explicit and broad but non-compellable power to make payments to those whistleblowers who, through their disclosures, have saved the government money either through preventing revenue loss or enabling it to be reclaimed.


There is also a broad power to reward the discloser in the public interest. Many jurisdictions have improved their public service efficiency and reduced waste through offering payment to disclosers. We should do the same so that there is a chilling effect on those who might engage in wrongdoing but do not in knowledge that their colleague might be rewarded if they expose them. I commend the amendments to the House.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2013-06-19,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Attorney-General, Minister for Emergency Management, Minister for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (16:06):  The government does not support this set of amendments and, in fact, has moved an amendment similar to amendment (16), which would establish in the bill a requirement for the minister to undertake a review of the operation of the bill two years after it has commenced.


The government does not support the act-of-grace amendment—amendment (1). That would authorise a minister to make payments to a person who has made a public interest disclosure where public moneys are reclaimed or where it is in the public interest. The emphasis of the scheme in this bill is on disclosures of wrongdoing being reported to and investigated within government.


This bill focuses on removing disincentives to making public interest disclosure by affording robust protections to public officials who come forward to report wrongdoing. I note that the whistleblower protection report tabled by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which has very much informed the development of this bill, did not make a recommendation that incentives or payments should be made to public officials making disclosures.


The government does not support amendment 2. That would remove the word 'imminent' from the criteria for a protected emergency disclosure. The criterion, as it has been drafted in the bill, conforms with the government's response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs whistleblower protection report. In recommendation 21 of that report, the committee referred to disclosures being made to the media where a matter has been previously the subject of an internal disclosure and has not been acted on in a reasonable time having regard to the nature of the matter and the matter threatens 'immediate, serious harm to public health and safety.'


The government response on this aspect, which is, again, reflected in the bill, is that a discloser needs to believe on reasonable grounds that the information concerns a substantial and imminent danger to the health or safety of one or more persons. Again, the focus of the bill is on disclosures being handled within government. A substantial but not imminent threat to public safety may be disclosable conduct for a protected external disclosure if the requirements for that disclosure are met.


The amendments that deal with actions by ministers, senators and authorised officers of an agency that is a house of parliament being disclosable conduct—generally, the government does not support the proposed amendments that would apply this scheme to members of parliament or their staff or actions taken by a minister or a presiding officer. Members of parliament and their staff perform roles that are different to Commonwealth public sector agencies and their staff. This difference warrants further detailed consideration, which could be undertaken upon a subsequent review of the operation of the act, which is provided for in the amendment we have moved—a review of the act two years after its commencement.


There are some amendments relating to what is to occur following an inadequate response to investigation by the minister. Again, the government does not support these amendments. The government has moved amendments that will omit from the bill clauses 38 and 39, which deal with when responses to investigations under part 3 or other investigative powers are taken to be inadequate. The government amendments would instead provide different criteria relating to whether a discloser believes on reasonable grounds that a response to an investigation was inadequate. The government amendments would preserve the principle that a response to a disclosure investigation is taken not to be inadequate to the extent that the response involves action that has been taken by a minister or a presiding officer. This is consistent with the position in the bill that the scheme not apply to conduct of a minister or members of parliament.


Coming to the amendments that deal with intelligence information, as I said in my summing-up remarks this bill does apply to intelligence agencies. A public official within an intelligence agency can make a protected disclosure about wrongful conduct in their agency. The restrictions in the bill that relate to intelligence agencies apply to external disclosures. Information that is intelligence information cannot be disclosed outside government and no protection is afforded to any public disclosures of this kind of information.


The amendments proposed to the definition of intelligence information would effectively remove paragraph 41(1)(a) of that definition as a separate ground—that is, information that has originated with or has been received from an intelligence agency. Information received from an intelligence agency has to remain undisclosed. It is very important, and that is why those amendments are not supported.


A broad approach to what constitutes intelligence information is necessary to avoid subjective misconstruction of the harm that could arise through public disclosure of this kind of information. A discloser may inaccurately assess or be unable to accurately assess the harm that could arise to operations through public disclosure of sensitive intelligence information. Inadvertent or inappropriate disclosure of intelligence information may compromise national security and potentially place lives at risk. Also, Australian intelligence agencies have obligations to their foreign partners to maintain confidentiality of information shared for the purpose of assisting those agencies to fulfil their national security functions.


Amendment (16), the final amendment in this set, is not supported. As I have indicated the government has moved an amendment to the bill that would make provision for a review of the operation of the act within two years.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The question is that the amendments be agreed to.

Currently under the bill, only significant and imminent acts that are likely to affect the health and safety of one or more persons can be disclosed to a third party—a journalist or a member of parliament, for example—immediately, without going through internal procedures first. Our amendment will allow an external disclosure to occur immediately where there is a substantial threat to the environment. For instance, under the current wording an oil rig that is likely to pollute an entire marine environment could not be publicly revealed unless it affected the health of the workers, too. This amendment will include the environment as an emergency disclosure and will also restrict disclosures on serious matters that have either already happened or where a time frame is not known to the discloser.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The question is that the amendment be agreed to.


Question agreed to.


Bill, as amended, agreed to.


Ordered that the bill be reported to the House with amendments.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2013-06-19,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (10:28):  The Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013 seeks to establish a legislative scheme for the investigation of alleged wrongdoing in the Commonwealth public sector and to provide for protective mechanisms for current or former officials who make qualifying disclosures under the regime.


Clearly, a bill of this nature is fairly topical when issues about a right to know what your government is doing, and about the way legitimate whistleblowers might be protected within the Commonwealth Public Service, have been around for some time. It is important to note that the Labor Party, prior to the 2007 election, promised that they would bring legislation of this type forward. Here we are, with 5½ days left of the second parliament of which the Labor Party has been able to form government, and they introduce it. Clearly, they are introducing this legislation not because they felt that it should apply to them, regardless of the fact that they made an election commitment that it would be a case, but so that it will apply to the next government. This is an indication that they do not take these issues as seriously as they should. A commitment was made that legislation of this type would be brought forward in 2007. That we are now in 2013, literally at the end of this parliament, and the government has finally got around to bringing legislation of this type forward is, I think, a very good representation of the way this government governs, and of the fact that commitments made by the Labor Party prior to elections never seem to be a very high priority for them once they come to office.


The question of Commonwealth enactment of whistleblowers legislation has been around for a long time, as I said. In 2008, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs—which, incidentally, was then chaired by the current Attorney-General—was tasked with examining whistleblower protection models and reporting its findings to the parliament. That committee reported in January 2009. The government did not respond until March 2010, agreeing substantially with the committee's recommendations and undertaking to introduce a bill in the course of that year. So, the committee was tasked to inquire into this issue in 2008. It reported at the beginning of 2009. The government responded a year or 14 months later, and they substantially agreed with the recommendations from that committee. They promised that a bill would be introduced in 2010. Yet here we are, in the middle of 2013, debating this legislation. The fact that we are only now debating this legislation, after all these commitments have been made to bring it forward, is a very good indication about where the Labor Party prioritises it and that this government was not necessarily prepared to have legislation brought forward that allowed for Commonwealth whistleblowing.


The scrutiny that this bill will apply comes in a number of different ways. Firstly, it will promote the integrity and accountability of the Commonwealth public sector. It will encourage and facilitate the making of public interest disclosure by public officials. It will ensure that public officials who make public interest disclosures are supported and protected from adverse consequences related to disclosures. It will ensure that disclosures by public officials are properly investigated and dealt with.


A public interest disclosure is a disclosure of information by a public official that is: a disclosure within the government to an authorised internal recipient, concerning suspected or probable illegal conduct or other wrongdoing; a disclosure to anybody, if an internal disclosure has not been adequately dealt with, and if wider disclosure satisfied public interest requirements; a disclosure to anybody of substantial imminent danger to health and safety; and a disclosure to an Australian legal practitioner for purposes connected with the above matters. It should be noted that conduct is not disclosable conduct if it relates to political or expenditure matters with which a person disagrees, the conduct of a judicial officer performing judicial functions, or the conduct of intelligence agencies in the proper exercise of their functions and powers.


The bill has been referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which is due to report on 25 June. A range of issues have been canvassed, including whether the bill properly maintains parliamentary privilege, whether it is appropriate to exclude members of parliament and their staff, and whether the exclusion in respect to intelligence agencies is too wide.


The introduction of whistleblower legislation is one of the principal aims of the Australia's Right to Know campaign, along with freedom of information reforms, journalist shield laws, and resistance to government regulation of the press—all of which is supported by the coalition.


I also want to briefly touch on the Public Interest Disclosure (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013. This bill makes amendments to the Ombudsman Act 1976, Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 and Public Service Act 1999, to provide for the investigation and any other processes consequent on the making of a public interest disclosure. I also note that the government has introduced amendments at the last minute—a practice that is happening very widely—and these amendments are going to be supported by the opposition, although it does reflect on the chaotic manner in which these final two weeks of the parliament are being run. It is indicative of the way the Labor Party runs the country, when they introduce their own legislation and then subsequently seek to amend it before it has even had a chance to be debated in one house of the parliament.


We do not oppose the passage of these bills through the House, but obviously, considering that they are the subject of a Senate inquiry and that inquiry is not due to report for another week, if that inquiry does come up with something that we believe warrants further consideration we would reserve our right to make amendments within the Senate.


The story of these bills is not a great reflection of the way the Labor Party governs. An election commitment in 2007, it has been implemented at the final end, after two terms of governance, in 2013. A parliamentary committee reported to the House at the beginning of 2009. The government accepted those recommendations after quite a long period of time, 14 months, and said that they would legislate to implement them. Yet here we are, over 3 ½ years later, debating this legislation at a time when, clearly, it is hardly going to apply to this government at all. It will apply only to whoever gets to form the next government after the next election. I think that is a very poor reflection on the Labor Party. It is a very poor reflection on the way that they run the business of this House.


We do support this bill, as we support other measures to make sure that we have integrity within the Commonwealth Public Service, but we do reserve our right to have a look at the recommendations that will be made by that Senate committee and to deal with it appropriately within the Senate after that.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2013-06-19,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle—Parliamentary Secretary For Homelessness and Social Housing and Parliamentary Secretary for Mental Health) (10:36):  I am very pleased to support the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013 and the Public Interest Disclosure (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013, which together represent the first stand-alone whistleblower protection scheme at the federal level. I want to congratulate the Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, for the work that he has done personally to reach this stage.


In keeping with the approach of this government to a range of important reform tasks, this bill arrives as the culmination of a process whose key feature was the inquiry, chaired by the now Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, of the House Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into whistleblowing protections within the Australian government sector. I was very happy to make a contribution to that inquiry in 2008. As someone involved with the creation of the United Nations Ethics Office, which included a whistleblower protection program, and in my previous role as the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, I appreciate the value and the importance of a proactive and embedded approach to organisational ethics. This is the only way to achieve entrenched ethical practice and entrenched anticorruption mechanisms, and to succeed it must proceed in a thorough whole-of-organisation approach. 


Whistleblower protection is a matter of basic organisational good health as, without adequate protection for disclosures made in relation to the poor function of any department officer or organisation, it is much harder to discover and address wrongdoing, misconduct and corruption. Thus, the key feature of the approach taken in Australia is the recognition that the ultimate objective of whistleblower protection law and policy, properly understood, is not the protection of whistleblowers as such. Protection is a crucial strategy for achieving the main objective: to encourage the disclosure of wrongdoing, fraud, waste, misconduct, abuse, corruption and imminent danger et cetera in an appropriate way so that something can be done about it. Practical concern about the public interest, rather than moralism, is the key. Of course, public officials who report wrongdoing must have robust protections to ensure that they do not suffer adverse consequences for making a report.


Whistleblower protection schemes have been operating at the state government level in Australia for many years now, successfully. There is now a broad acceptance in Australia of the public interest justification for effective and practical protection of responsible whistleblowers and for whistleblowing activity by public officials and others occupying positions of trust. There appears to be no serious suggestion in any quarter that those who genuinely disclose official corruption, fraud, theft, criminal conduct, abuse of office, serious threat to public health and safety, official misconduct, maladministration or avoidable wastage of public resources should not receive protection from retaliation by those involved. On the contrary, organisations that fail to protect genuine whistleblowers and permit or take reprisal action against them usually face severe censure. 


In addition, Australia has been the focus of attention by the committee reviewing Australia's implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Legislating a strong whistleblower protection mechanism is seen as a key part of Australia's compliance with that convention. So the time has well and truly come for this bill, for these protections and for this encouragement of public interest disclosures. 


The Dreyfus report was delivered in February 2009 and the government made a detailed response to the inquiry in 2010. The Dreyfus report, the government response and this bill would not have been possible without the pivotal research work carried out by Professor AJ Brown of Griffith University and other colleagues as part of a collaborative national research project called Whistling while they work. Professor Brown, as well as integrity advocates from the Accountability Round Table—the Hon. Tim Smith QC and Howard Whitton—have continued to provide advice and assistance with respect to the development of the bill, and I want to thank—

Ms PARKE:
  As I was saying before the interruption, the Dreyfus report, the government response and this bill would not have been possible without the pivotal research work carried out by Professor AJ Brown of Griffith University and his colleagues as part of a collaborative national research project called Whistling While They Work. Professor Brown, as well as integrity advocates from the accountability roundtable the Hon. Tim Smith QC and Mr Howard Whitton, have continued to provide advice on and assistance with the development of the bill. I thank them sincerely for their efforts and their hard work.


While this bill is very welcome, and while it represents yet another significant achievement in terms of the governance improvements delivered by this government, I will say that there is scope for further enhancements in this area in the future, including whistleblower protection in the private sector. A number of the big corruption scandals of recent years involving the operation of Australian companies and government agencies, both overseas and in Australia, would not have come to light without the bravery and integrity of whistleblowers in the public and private sectors. It is only right that such courage be protected and supported. 


The provision in this bill requiring review of the act in two year's time is very welcome. In the meantime, I congratulate the Attorney-General once again and commend the bill to the House.

Mr MELHAM
 (Banks) (11:14):  I rise to support the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013 and the Public Interest Disclosure (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013. The Parliamentary Library, in preparing its research paper, Bills Digest, into the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013 had the following to say on page 4:


… the Commonwealth is the only Australian jurisdiction that does not have legislation dedicated to facilitating public interest disclosures and protecting those who make them. Since the 1990s there have been a number of unsuccessful attempts to introduce more comprehensive whistleblower protection laws with a series of parliamentary and non-parliamentary inquiries and a number of private members Bills, most of which were initiated by the Australian Democrats and the Greens. However these Bills all lapsed due to a lack of Government support.


It is pleasing that the bills before the committee today have the support of the government and the opposition.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—

Mr MELHAM:
  The bills we are discussing today have their genesis in a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which tabled a report in February 2009. The government in introducing the legislation largely implements the government response to that report.


It is important to point out that the chair of the committee at that time was the current Attorney-General who in effect tabled these reports and delivered the second reading speech. In the second reading speech on the bill, he listed the framework of the bill in three parts. The first is to encourage and facilitate all Commonwealth public officials to report suspected wrongdoing. The second is to make sure that reports of suspected wrongdoing are properly handled by agencies and in a reasonable time frame; and, thirdly the bill protects public officials who report suspected wrongdoing from adverse consequences as a result of reporting their concerns.


In his second reading speech on the consequential amendments bill, the Attorney points out that the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security will have oversight functions for the public interest disclosure scheme. Amendments proposed to the Public Interest Disclosure (Consequential Amendments) Bill will support this oversight function.


The Ombudsman will be able to investigate a public interest disclosure made to the Ombudsman where the wrongful conduct relates to an agency that is not an intelligence agency or the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The Ombudsman will also be able to investigate handling by agencies of public interest disclosures. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security will be able to investigate a public interest disclosure made to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security where the wrongful conduct relates to an intelligence agency. 


Further down, these investigative functions are complemented by other measures in the public interest disclosure bill. The Ombudsman will assist agencies and public officials in the operation of the scheme, including through the conduct of educational awareness programs. It is important that agencies and officials have a clear understanding of how the scheme works in order for it to operate effectively.


I think that is the right balance in relation to reporting and, in relation to the Inspector-General and the Ombudsman. I think there is a history there which gives the public confidence in relation to them dealing with complaints and also gives the complainants confidence that their complaints will be properly and appropriately dealt with in a confidential and sensitive way.


Because we have not had this sort of legislation in the federal jurisdiction before, I would anticipate that there will be a need for tweaking over time. That happens at a state level in state jurisdictions and that is why I think it is good and important that these bills have the support of the government and the alternative government. The signal we need to send is: 'The policy decision has been made. This is the way we are going. There is no turning back.'


I want to pay compliment to the Attorney-General, because I know how hard he has laboured in the time that he was chair of the House of Reps legal committee, parliamentary secretary and now Attorney-General to guide this legislation through the proper processes of the bureaucracy and government. We need to accept that some compromises have been made—I do not necessarily want to go into those compromises; it is the principles I am interested in.


People should be able to make a confidential complaint secure in the knowledge that it will be properly handled and that they will also be protected and not discriminated against.


What disturbs me is that one can look at the history of this case at other levels of government and one always sees the same thing happen: a complaints is made but, in a number of instances, those making the complaint are discriminated against. Some of it is passive discrimination: they are left to their own devices, left to flounder and they are not protected. So we need to be conscious of that, if we are to have information properly brought to the relevant authorities.


The other cautionary note I would make is that I am not one who has a lot of time for frivolous complaints. Because frivolous complaints can undermine the whole system. In New South Wales, for instance, we have an Independent Commission Against Corruption with a chequered history. But I get sick and tired of reading in the newspaper, listening to the radio or watching the TV, and hearing about a complaint where the ink is not even dry that has been made to ICAC. The reference to ICAC is of itself very damaging to the individuals concerned, and it might be a complaint without substance and you do not hear about afterwards, other than someone being referred to ICAC. 


So we need to be careful in developing this model to set up protections in relation to false complaints. Because, I think, in a number of instances I do not think it is in the public interest that certain things are made public. In other instances, it is in the interest that certain things are made public. That is a matter of having confidence in the organisations themselves. This gung-ho attitude—and it happens, frankly, in relation to a lot of councils in New South Wales—is where people just shoot from the hip and say, 'I have referred the matter of an inappropriate development application to ICAC,' and all you find is that it is a faction fight in the council.


I flag these concerns—and I am not talking about specific pieces of the legislation; I am just talking about the principles that I support. I very strongly support whistleblower legislation. I think people should be entitled to bring that appropriate conduct before authorities. But what we do not want is workplace faction fights where, maybe on balance, decisions are made one way that could have been made another or whatever. Airing those—how to you filter those out is obviously a matter for the appropriate authorities—can drain much needed resources, because there are going to be limited resources in relation to the level of complaints. I am not saying that at a national level we are immune from these things; we are not. But I think that at a state and local government level they are more vulnerable to the sort of conduct that we have had evidence on day after day from ICAC in New South Wales. Because it is a different role for the local councils and for some state officials. We tend at a federal level—certainly as politicians, I am talking about here—to be more removed from the process. That is not to say that we are not.


So I am happy to support this legislation. I am pleased it has actually been introduced into this place, because it has been a long time coming. I urge support for it in its current form in the full knowledge that it will need to be tweaked over time as experience is gained.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2013-06-19,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (11:54):  I am very pleased to be speaking on this important piece of legislation. I am also very pleased to be following the member for Banks in this debate, who brings to the debate and the subject matter decades of experience as a parliamentarian and, before that, years of experience at the criminal bar. The contributions that he makes must be listened to.


Of course, the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013 does not stand alone. It is part of a package of reforms that have been introduced by the government since winning office in 2007 which go to the issues of integrity and disclosure. I reference the reforms to the freedom of information provisions within this country, which put in place for the first time a presumption in favour of disclosure, and the abolition of the rorts that were occurring under the previous government such as the use of conclusive certificates, which were used as a device—if not a vice—to ensure that documents and information that should properly be provided to the public on request were prohibited. In equal measure the reforms that this government has put in place in the area of lobbying and lobbyists, to ensure there is greater transparency and greater regulation in this area, also take up public integrity measures, which is a great step forward in ensuring that there is a register of lobbyists for those who come to this place seeking to influence parliamentarians. In addition to that, there are prohibitions on ministerial staff engaging in lobbyist work for a period of time after they leave their ministerial employment.


The legislation before the House today is about whistleblowers, and it is very welcome. For our public servants, this protection for those making an authorised disclosure in the public interest has been a long time coming—some say too long, and I will join them. Every state and territory in Australia, as well as in a whole range of overseas jurisdictions, has legislation that provides protections for whistleblowers. I hope that the Commonwealth jurisdiction will soon join them. My own advocacy for these measures commenced before I came to parliament when I was the national secretary of the Community and Public Sector Union, the union that provides representation to the men and women who work in the public sector and in public sector entities. The CPSU has long supported the development of legislation to put in place a process to protect public interest disclosures. I am sure the union will join with me in welcoming the fact that this bill is being debated in the House today.


The Public Interest Disclosure Bill will ensure that there are appropriate processes in place and protections offered to facilitate the disclosure of wrongdoing, misconduct and corruption. A key objective of the scheme will be to foster and promote a culture in the Australian public sector which supports speaking out in the face of wrongdoing and maladministration. The whistleblower legislation will facilitate reporting and will provide for investigation of serious wrongdoing in the public sector. It will protect whistleblowers who make disclosures in accordance with the scheme. The scheme will provide protections to whistleblowers who make disclosures directly to the media, either following an internal disclosure where the relevant criteria have been satisfied or, in a much rarer occasion, where the discloser believes there is an imminent danger to public safety which justifies direct disclosure without prior internal investigation within government.


In developing this framework the government has built upon the foundations of the February 2009 House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report of the inquiry into whistleblowing protection within the Australian government public sector. The government's detailed response to that report was also known as the Dreyfus report. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work put into this policy area over many years by the now Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus. Of course, he was not alone. Before him, and in the other place, Senator the Hon. John Faulkner also dedicated his time and expertise towards developing and advocating for a solid policy framework in this important area.


The government and the parliament, through committees, have also had the benefit of the expertise of Australia's leading experts in this area, including Dr AJ Brown of Griffith University. The three-year research project led by Dr Brown has been an important reference point for the parliament seeking to ensure that best-practice legislation was put forward. In his report Whistling while they work, Dr Brown and his colleagues conducted research across thousands of workplaces by means of survey work and direct interviews and held their own seminars and produced discussion papers. That work has been invaluable to this policy process. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of Dr AJ Brown and his colleagues.


Parliamentarians in this place have known for some time that whistleblowers need a better framework of protection. Over the past 19 years there have been numerous reviews and attempts made to introduce this type of legislation at the Commonwealth level. This work started with the 1994 report of the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing, which was entitled In the public interest. Legislation to give effect to that Senate work ended with the election in March 1996 of a coalition government. Very limited protection was introduced in the Public Service Bill that was then introduced in 1997; indeed, many commentators described it is the weakest protection framework for whistleblowers anywhere in the Commonwealth. This limited protection came into force in 1999 and is still there in section 19 of the Public Service Act. In the interim, many private members' bills were put forward, including by Senator Andrew Murray, the former senator from Western Australia, in 2001, 2002 and 2007. Regrettably, those bills never enjoyed support from the coalition government at the time; each of the three bills proposed by Senator Murray had lapsed.


Upon election to government in 2007, Labor once again took this matter up. While it has taken longer than expected to get here, we now have before the parliament best-practice legislation that will apply broadly across the entire Commonwealth public sector. I am confident that given this history, which created many quasi-experts in this era and in earlier parliaments, the bill achieves the goals of those who believe that the public sector is stronger if corruption and maladministration is exposed or if there is the potential for exposure of corruption and maladministration. We enjoy a very robust Commonwealth Public Service which is free from the sorts of maladministration and corruption that are often typified in other places. Nothing in what I have said today should be taken as casting aspersions upon those men and women who work in the Australian Public Service.


The bill contains a broad range of conduct that constitutes disclosable conduct for the purpose of the scheme that is put forward. This conduct is set out in subclause 29(1) of the bill. It includes conduct that contravenes a law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory; conduct that contravenes a law of a foreign country which is applicable to the agency, public official or service provider; conduct that perverts, or is engaged in for the purpose of perverting or attempting to pervert, the course of justice, or conduct engaged in for the purpose of corruption of any other kind; conduct that constitutes maladministration, including conduct that is based in part on improper motives, is unreasonable, unjust, repressive or negligent; conduct that is an abuse of public trust; conduct that constitutes scientific misconduct as described in item 6 of the table; conduct that results in a wastage of public money or public property; conduct that unreasonably results in a danger to the health or safety of one or more persons or is unreasonably likely to increase the risk of such danger; conduct that results in, or increases, a risk of danger to the environment; and other conduct as prescribed in the Public Interest Disclosure rules. Deputy Speaker, you can see the scope of the legislation. The proposed legislation is very broad indeed.


Why is the bill important? Quite simply, the bill is important because it is a critical plank in ensuring that our Australian Public Service maintains a culture of openness, a culture of transparency and a culture of good governance. We put great trust in our public institutions and in our public servants. Nothing is of greater importance than that public administration is carried out in a way that is free from maladministration and corruption. We expect the very highest of ethical standards as is set out in the APS Values. In regard to the Public Service, there have been three key objectives of this government: firstly, to rebuild trust and the accountability of ministers and their staff; secondly, to uphold the Westminster tradition of public service independence and neutrality; and, thirdly, to deliver a more open and responsible government committed to serving the public interest. In that vein, the new Australian Public Service Values have just been released by the Attorney-General this week.


This government came to office in 2007 committed to rebuilding the integrity of government and the Australian Public Service. I believe that our commitment to greater protection of public servants will be met in the reforms before the House today. We are nearing the end of a parliamentary sitting. I am very hopeful that this important legislation passes through this House with support from all sides of politics. I am also very hopeful that in the time available to those in the other place they have the opportunity to consider and pass this bill into legislation. Nothing can be more important to the confidence of the Australian public in our public institutions than that we complement the already existing measures, which are built around ensuring that we have a framework for integrity and disclosure, with the measures before the House today.


I commend the legislation to the House.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2013-06-19,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (12:06):  Officials must have the right to disclose misconduct, maladministration or incompetence, and communities must have the protection afforded by such outspokenness. In other words, so-called whistleblowing is an important check on public administration which needs to be allowed, even encouraged. Those that would blow the whistle need to know they are doing the right thing and will ultimately be protected from reprisals. In essence, I think this bill does achieve that.


It has been a very long road to get to here on this very important issue. At the Commonwealth level, comprehensive public interest disclosure legislation was first recommended by the Liberal chaired Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing, in 1994. But it had always been left to the minor parties to roll their sleeves up and try to progress real reform. Bills were introduced unsuccessfully by the Greens in 1993 and then by the Democrats in 2002 and in 2007.


Regrettably though these were all false starts, and it was not until the election of Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister, with Senator John Faulkner as Special Minister of State, that the prospect genuinely hardened of us finally seeing Commonwealth whistleblower legislation enacted. It was even more of a prospect when the Prime Minister's 2007 commitment was reinforced in 2009 by the parliamentary committee chaired by the now Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus. That committee provided a detailed and bipartisan blueprint for Commonwealth legislation.


The 2010 federal election offered more good news, this time in the Gillard government's agreements with the Greens, along with the members for Lyne and New England and me, to promote open and accountable government and to improve the processes and the integrity of the parliament.


This bill, if enacted by the parliament, finally will get the job done. It will realise the aspirations of Liberal, Greens and Democrats senators and deliver on the promises of this and the previous Labor government. It will also deliver on our G20 commitment to the anticorruption action plan. But, most importantly, it will genuinely strengthen public integrity in this country.


I am hopeful the opposition will support the government's bill. The conservative side of politics actually has a reasonable record in this regard. In fact, it was the Liberal government in New South Wales in 1994, the Liberal and National parties in Queensland in 2006 and the Liberal government in Western Australia in 2010 which drove important whistleblowing reforms in those jurisdictions at that time, all of which gives me heart and confidence that this bill will have the support of the whole parliament and indeed all of the crossbench.


Having said that, nothing is perfect and this sure is not perfect. I have campaigned with others for a number of amendments to be made, many of which have been. I would single out two potential amendments which remain unaddressed and take this opportunity to speak to the Attorney-General, who has joined us, and make one final plea that the government consider two important amendments, which I know the Attorney-General is already aware of. 


Compensation for detriment caused by institutional failures to support and protect whistleblowers should be included, rather than simply the inclusion of compensation for direct reprisals, which I understand the bill currently allows. I would ask the Attorney-General to do what he can to put the power of the Ombudsman beyond doubt, and I know others have asked him this. It is something we discussed by telephone only today. 


I believe the bill as it stands is deficient in a number of other ways and I have discussed these publicly, in this place and with the Attorney-General. It is regrettable that the bill excludes the case of wrongdoing by members of parliament and ministers. I do not understand why this cannot apply to all public officials, because it is certainly the expectation of the community that members of parliament and ministers should not be beyond scrutiny. They should have been included in this bill and so too should the staff of members of parliament. It is regrettable that they are not. It is a reasonable public expectation that not only should members of parliament be open to public scrutiny but also their staff should be.


Something close my heart is that the bill should include intelligence officials and material. It is regrettable they have been carved out. I do not think that was necessary. It would have been possible to craft this bill in a way that would have allowed for the careful disclosure of wrongdoing by intelligence officials. I am thinking of my own experience a decade ago when I was an intelligence official and spoke up about what I saw as a wrongdoing. I was able to do that in a way that did not disclose any sensitive information or put the national security of this country or any other country at risk.


I lament the fact that this bill does not pass what I call the Allan Kessing test. Just to remind people, Allan Kessing was the customs official working at Sydney Airport who, in 2003, wrote a very important report on security at the airport. That material was leaked—it was obviously sensitive material—to the media in 2005, and Allan Kessing was convicted of the leak in 2007. It is something, I understand, he denies to this day. There is no doubt that Allan Kessing acted in the public interest by trying to shine a light on shortfalls in security at Sydney Airport. In my opinion, he is a good man who was acting in the public interest. But this public interest disclosure bill provides him no protection, and it would have provided him no protection back then if it had been in place.


This is for at least two reasons. One, he was convicted of disclosing intelligence material. As I have already described, intelligence material and intelligence officials have been carved out from the protection of this bill. Second—arguably—there was no imminent threat to life. This is a provision in the bill where someone can go directly to the media if there is imminent danger to people. I disagree, but it could be argued that there was not an imminent threat to life. So there are two reasons for it failing the Allan Kessing test. 


Nor would it pass the Andrew Wilkie test. I came to public prominence and was propelled into public life a little over a decade ago when, a week before the invasion Iraq, I spoke out publicly about what I saw as the misconduct of the Howard government and, in particular, that the Prime Minister and senior ministers were misusing intelligence information to justify an unwarranted war.


This bill would not have protected me at the time because, again, I was an intelligence official discussing intelligence matters. I was also making a complaint publicly against the Prime Minister and ministers. I think two of the most high-profile whistleblower episodes in recent years involved Alan Kessing and Andrew Wilkie. In both cases, this bill would have provided no protection to those two men.


Having said all of that, we have travelled a very long road and finally got there with something which is substantially a good piece of legislation. I applaud the government for finally getting us to this point. It has been a long time—nearly 20 years—since we took the first steps in this place. In particular, I would like to thank the Attorney-General. I do not want this to be taken as a criticism of his predecessor, but there was a time in this parliament where this seemed to be moving dreadfully slowly and, from what I knew of the work that was being done, it was seriously deficient. The Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, has turbocharged this process, and I think he personally deserves great credit for that. He is ultimately very much responsible for getting us over the line, hopefully, at this last-minute—notwithstanding the shortfalls in your bill, Attorney-General!


I would also like to single out Dr AJ Brown, Professor of Public Law at Griffith University. Dr Brown has helped a number of jurisdictions with their whistleblower legislation or their public interest disclosure legislation. I would go so far as to say that I cannot think of any other person who has done so much single-handedly to enhance the integrity of public administration in this country, in particular as far as public interest disclosure of wrongdoing goes. I want to record to show that we would not have got to this stage and we would not have a bill in the shape it is in if it were not for Dr Brown and the work he has done—not just with this bill but also with helping to draft my own bill on a similar matter. That bill, unfortunately, will not be realised, but I think it has provided a benchmark or a test for the government's bill and it has helped to add to the pressure on the government to see these reforms through. That was very much Dr Brown's work, so good on him.


This is a significant day for me personally. I was propelled into the public spotlight over a whistleblowing episode. It was something that cost me my job, many friends and a lot of money, and it was not easy. But of course my story has a happy ending, and I am as proud as punch to be standing here in the parliament talking about finally getting whistleblower legislation through. For me this is a good day, but I am not just speaking for myself; I am speaking for thousands of whistleblowers in this country. Regrettably, Australia is a very tough place to be a whistleblower. Most whistleblowers in Australia get little public attention and little media attention. They lose their job, they lose their families and they lose their money. Some lose their minds and some even lose their lives or take their own life.


You would think that in a country such as ours, built on the foundations it is, we would be a bit more disrespectful of authority and a bit more admiring of people who speak truth to power and truth to authority. Remarkably, we are not, and many whistleblowers are dragged down by the community. Maybe they are seen as dobbers; maybe they are seen as dobbing on their mates and not being team players. I do not know what it is, but it is a tough country in which to be a whistleblower. That is one of the reasons we need this sort of legislation. We need to empower people in public administration to speak up when they see wrongdoing and to speak up when they see maladministration or incompetence. We should celebrate what they do, not drag them down. We should give them protection against reprisals, and then we should celebrate their achievement in the community.


In 2002, Time magazine in the United States had three women as Time magazine's People of the Year. They were three whistleblowers. You would never see that in Australia. Maybe one day we will see that sort of acclaim for people who speak truth to power. But, Attorney-General, this bill is a really solid stepping stone to turning this issue around in this country in the future. Thank you, Attorney-General.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2013-06-19,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Attorney-General, Minister for Emergency Management, Minister for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (12:19):  I welcome the contributions of all members to the debate on the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013 and the Public Interest Disclosure (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013. The Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013 has an object of promoting integrity and accountability in the Commonwealth public sector. The bill will achieve this by establishing a single comprehensive scheme to support inquiry into wrongdoing in the Commonwealth public sector and those who report it. It is the first stand-alone legislation for this purpose at the federal level.


I thank the parliamentary committees for their inquiries and reports on the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2013. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs together received more than 30 submissions on the bill. Both those inquiries recommended that this bill be passed, with the Senate committee's recommendation subject to certain amendments being made. I welcome these contributions and will be moving government amendments that are designed to further enhance the operation of the scheme.


A main purpose of the bill is to establish clear procedures for allegations of wrongdoing to be reported by public officials and for findings of wrongdoing to be rectified. The emphasis on the scheme is on the disclosure of wrongdoing being reported to and investigated within government. To this end, the bill places obligations on principal officers of agencies to ensure that public interest disclosures are properly investigated and that appropriate action is taken to deal with recommendations relating to their agency. In short, these are obligations to act on disclosures of wrongdoing and to fix wrongdoing where it is found. A well-implemented and comprehensive scheme should lead to a discloser having confidence in the system, and remove incentive for the discloser to make public information to parties outside government.


Recourse for making disclosures outside government should be exercised with reserve when reported wrongdoing is not being properly investigated and rectified, and when other public interests will not be undermined. This is reflected in the requirements to make a qualifying protected external disclosure. Amendments that I will be moving to the bill will make some changes to the qualifying requirements for public interest disclosures. External disclosure is not the only recourse for a public official who is dissatisfied with the manner in which their disclosure has been handled. It is also open to an official to make a complaint to the Ombudsman or to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security at any stage of the process for dealing with a public interest disclosure.


I clarify that the bill applies to the intelligence agencies. A public official within an intelligence agency can make a protected disclosure about wrongful conduct in their agency. The disclosure can be made to an authorised officer in the intelligence agency or to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. A public interest disclosure concerning the conduct of an intelligence agency will be required to be investigated and dealt with in the same way as a disclosure concerning an agency that is not an intelligence agency. The activities of intelligence agencies are governed by the Intelligence Services Act 2001 and the Australia Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. Under those acts, intelligence agencies must seek a direction or authority from the appropriate minister for agency use of special powers and other sensitive activities for that purpose. The responsible minister must be satisfied that any activity undertaken by an intelligence agency is in accordance with the function of that agency in addition to other factors set out in the legislation.


The purpose of clause 33 of the bill is to make clear that intelligence agencies lawfully conducting activities in accordance with their functions as defined by the Intelligence Services Act 2001 and the Australia Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 cannot form the basis for a public interest disclosure. The question of whether or not conduct engaged in by an intelligence agency is in the proper performance of its functions is itself a matter that can be reviewed by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. 


The restrictions in the bill relating to intelligence agencies apply to external disclosures. Information that is 'intelligence information' cannot be disclosed outside government and no protection is afforded for any public disclosure of this kind of information. Information that concerns the conduct of an intelligence agency can also not be disclosed outside government and does not qualify for a protected 'external disclosure', but may be the subject of an 'emergency disclosure'. In that case, the restriction on public disclosure of 'intelligence information' would still apply.


The restrictions on public disclosure of intelligence information and the conduct of intelligence information are supported by the risk that very sensitive information could be improperly or unwittingly publicly disclosed. Inadvertent or inappropriate disclosure of intelligence information may compromise national security and potentially place lives at risk. Australian intelligence agencies also have obligations to their foreign partners to maintain the confidentiality of information shared with them.


Some argue that the bill should apply to disclosures by and about members of parliament and to staff engaged by them. On this matter, the bill implements the government's response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report on whistleblower protection. In that response, the government said that allegations of wrongdoing by members of parliament should be addressed by the parliament. This recognises that members of parliament and their staff perform roles that are different to Commonwealth public sector agencies and their staff.


Some criticism has also been made that the bill does not apply to federal judicial officers. It would not be appropriate for the scheme to apply to judicial officers as it would impinge on the constitutional independence of the federal courts. Allegations of wrongful conduct by federal judicial officers can be investigated through the complaints framework established by the Courts Legislation Amendment (Judicial Complaints) Act 2012 and the Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (parliamentary Commissions) Act 2012.


There has also been some criticism that the bill may be difficult to understand for public officials making a disclosure. The bill places obligations on principal officers of agencies to establish procedures for facilitating and dealing with public interest disclosures. These procedures must comply with standards that are determined by the Ombudsman. It is part of the oversight functions for the Ombudsman and the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security to give assistance to current and former public officials making a disclosure as well as to agencies to comply with the scheme. I am able to advise that the Ombudsman proposes to publish guidance on the office's website that will supplement the legislation and standards. This guidance will further assist public officials considering making a disclosure as well as agencies in complying with the scheme.


The Public Interest Disclosure Bill and the Public Interest Disclosure (Consequential Amendments) Bill represent an important reform to strengthen the process in which wrongdoing in the Commonwealth public sector is handled, and to strengthen the protections for those who report wrongdoing. I commend the bills to the House.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.
