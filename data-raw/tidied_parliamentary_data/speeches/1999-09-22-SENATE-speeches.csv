When we were last considering this group of amendments I was on my feet, so I might just finish off my remarks in support of those amendments. This is the amendment to do with the government's attempt to reduce the total income paid to CDEP recipients who are also recipients of the parenting payment (single). I outlined the basic case last time—I do not want to bore the chamber by going on 
 too much—but I want to come to the key point, and that is that I think the government's measure is one that seeks to reduce the income to 4,000 sole parents and, in large part, to Aboriginal sole parents who choose to work on CDEP projects as well. The measure would effectively reduce their income by up to $100 a fortnight and we think that is a measure that cannot be justified.
I know that there has been some reliance on the Spicer report into CDEP in terms of equalising conditions, but on my reading of the report he did not actually recommend this measure. I think what is more important is that we look at the key issue of the impact on recipients. The chamber would be aware that single sole parents in Aboriginal communities are among the most disadvantaged people in our society. A recent research paper by Anne Daly on the plight of indigenous sole parents and other indigenous families highlighted that indigenous sole parents make up 40 per cent of all indigenous families with children under 15. They support more children than non-indigenous sole parents, often without further income support because of informal or foster care arrangements.
Twenty-five per cent of indigenous sole parents care for foster children compared with 14 per cent for indigenous couples and just 9 per cent for non-indigenous sole parents. They have lower levels of education and are less likely to be in employment compared with other indigenous families and non-indigenous sole parents. Forty-three per cent of non-indigenous sole parents are in employment compared with just 25 per cent of indigenous sole parents. On average, they have lower family incomes compared with indigenous couple families and non-indigenous sole parents, while supporting more children.
So we are talking about some of the most disadvantaged people in society supporting children. The effect of the government's measure is, as I say, to reduce their income by $100 a fortnight—sometimes a bit more, sometimes a bit less—all in the guise of bringing conditions into line. We do not think this taking everyone down to the lowest common denominator is justifiable—certainly not in this case. I know the minister also 
 relied on the support of ATSIC and I understand that they have supported the measure on the basis of the package presented to them by government, which has other beneficial measures that I have conceded in terms of CDEP for Aboriginal people. But this chamber has to make the decision whether this measure is one that it wishes to support. I do not think there has been a cogent argument advanced for the chamber to take from these 4,000 highly disadvantaged people the income support that we are currently providing. We took that view when dealing with the youth disability allowance supplement the other day. I think that was the correct decision by the committee and I hope we will make the same decision here.
While bringing CDEP recipients into some sort of common arrangement, this does discriminate against Aboriginal people on CDEP in the sense that they lose their free income area as compared with other parenting payment (single) recipients. I do not think the government's justification is warranted. As I say, these are some of the most disadvantaged people in our society caring for children. I do not think we ought to be reducing the already fairly meagre income that they receive without a much better case being presented by the government.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-22,"—This is probably one of the more substantial measures in the bill in terms of the number of people potentially affected. As often happens in this type of legislation, it presents the committee with a bit of a cleft stick situation. There is a significant positive measure contained in this schedule which enables CDEP recipients to get access to the social security add-ons such as rent assistance, telephone allowance, the health care card, et cetera, that other social security recipients receive. But, as Senator Evans has outlined and as these opposition amendments seek to address, the schedule also leads to a reduction in the overall total income for a significant number of sole parent pensioners or parenting payment (single) recipients—around 4,000 according to Senator Evans. If the minister believes that figure is incorrect, I would encourage her to indicate it. Those 4,000 
 parenting payment (single) recipients will be up to $100 a week worse off, which is not an insignificant amount of money for anybody, let alone somebody on a low income.
Nonetheless, it is a situation where one would suspect the government's attitude is to present this as a package and put it as an `all or nothing' approach, which would mean that beneficial measures which would also make a significant difference may be lost. Rent assistance can be quite a significant payment and a number of people would miss out on that positive measure—I am not sure of the total number of people affected by that; I am sure the minister could outline it. So it pits one group against another, which is a far from ideal situation. But that is what we are faced with, so that is what we have to address.
I have a couple of questions and I would be interested to hear the answers from the minister, because they concern something I have been giving consideration to in listening to the arguments that have been put forward. Firstly, can the minister confirm the number of parenting payment (single) recipients that will be affected by the measure—whether it is 4,000? Secondly, what on average is the total income of those people currently in receipt of the maximum CDEP payment and parenting payment on top of that? And, thirdly, can the minister confirm whether that does lead to a cut of around $100 a week?
I have just had circulated an amendment which is not on the running sheet. I take on board the minister's comment about late circulation of amendments in social security legislation, but these things happen sometimes. I foreshadow this amendment—I may or may not proceed with it—which is an attempt at a grandfathering amendment to ensure that those who are currently under this arrangement would not be disadvantaged whilst meeting the long-term aims of the government of having a uniform approach to income treatment for CDEP recipients. This may be a way through the situation that we are faced with.
Whilst I understand and support the concerns put forward by Senator Evans, I am also concerned that the positive measure contained in this schedule will be lost, which is an 
 outcome I am not keen to see. I cannot recall if I have asked this before, but I ask if the minister could indicate the origin of this particular measure to do with sole parents—whether it was contained in the Spicer report along with the other aspects that are part of this schedule.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—I understand that the opposition amendments Nos 1 to 7 purport to reverse the government's proposal in relation to lone parents. If the opposition amendments were to succeed, the cost would be $6.102 million in 1999-2000, $14.92 million in 2000-01 and $14.92 million in 2001-02, totalling $35.943 million over four years. Four thousand lone parents would retain their current entitlements as a result of the amendments. On average, the loss would be $80 per fortnight—not $100 per week which I think is what Senator Bartlett said.
I know that ATSIC has made it very clear that there is some resentment in communities that there is double-dipping by a protected class of people. Therefore, I fear that the attempt at a solution by Senator Bartlett would not resolve that problem, which is that it is seen as unfair that some people get two payments when others doing the same work do not. For my part, I am more concerned about the fact that women are often not considered eligible or not encouraged to be part of the CDEP projects when there are other people who are seen as more needy in the community in terms of income support. The CDEP money goes to those who have not already got income support, and one can understand the thinking behind that.
Senator Evans might like to take on board the fact that my advice is that opposition amendments Nos 9 to 32 appear to accidentally—I say `accidentally'; I presume it is not deliberate—reverse the government's proposal to commence the CDEP add-ons measure with effect from 20 March. That is, they conflict with our requests Nos 1, 2 and 3 which set the new commencement date, and requests Nos 2 and 3 were already agreed to by the committee on Monday. I say that the revised 
 commencement proposed by the opposition appears to be accidental because they did not announce such an intention during the debate at the second reading stage, and it appears to be an accidental result of attempting to remove all reference to pensions.
Senator Chris Evans interjecting—
—I am just giving you the opportunity to hear both, Senator Evans. In doing so, your amendments, in conjunction with opposition amendment No. 8, which we will come to shortly, appear to accidentally deprive pensioners of the entitlement to new CDEP participation. But I understand it also means that the net result would be that the scheme would come into effect on 20 September, which of course was the original date. But I understand that probably your drafting is defective. I do not think you mean that. I do not quite know how you want to resolve that now, but you would need time to take advice, I would think.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-22,"—I appreciate that the minister is trying to be helpful. My understanding of the drafting advice was that the revisions that I moved this morning overcame those difficulties and made them consistent with your amendments. I am not sure whether you are saying that the revisions that we just moved by leave do not do that or whether you are operating on the basis of the impact that would have occurred if we had proceeded yesterday. It would be helpful if you could clarify that.
There is no intention to change any of your arrangements in relation to the timing of benefits. We tried to restrict the debate on this occasion to this question of the CDEP entitlements of recipients of parenting payment (single), so there is no intention to do that. I think you are aware that the complicated drafting required was requested last night to try to make sure that we had consistency between the government's amendments, which relate to the timing issues, and our policy intent, which is to retain that payment. As I say, I am not sure whether you are saying that the original draft failed to achieve that or whether this morning's revised amendments fail to achieve that. Perhaps you could clarify 
 that. But I certainly put on record there is no intention to change any of those entitlements. It was purely our intention yesterday to single out this area for question and debate and acceptance of what we saw as a necessary change to the timing arrangements because of the delay in the passage of the bill.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—Mr Chairman, I am waiting to receive advice on the opposition's amendments. I do not know whether they achieve a solution to the problem or not. I do not know how we can proceed at this minute without that advice. It is a pretty significant defect if it remains a defect. For example, we would have a great problem with the administration of Centrelink as a purely mechanistic issue which is not to be swept aside. It would mean that some of Centrelink's operations would require untested manual processes and things like that. I am sure you do not want that.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-22,"—Mr Chairman, I just indicated to the minister that that was not the intention. Also, advisers from the opposition met with her advisers yesterday evening to try to make sure that we did not have any unintended consequences and that we had an agreement that would isolate out this issue. So I do not think there is any need for us to debate this, other than the fact that we need to get it right. There are, though, substantive policy issues in debate here that we could continue with while we work out whether or not we have got the technical amendments on timing correct or not.
I am interested in Senator Bartlett's contribution. I am not sure what his position is as a result of that, but I know he asked the minister a range of questions which he wanted answered, some of which I think she responded to. I am happy to have this debate about where we are going in terms of the principal issues, and we can come back to whether we have achieved technically what we thought we were going to achieve. But, as I say, I would be interested in hearing from Senator Bartlett what he intends to do. Is he proceed 
 ing with this amendment that I have recently received, No. 55, or is this a separate issue?",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-22,"—The amendment which is on sheet 1547—which I have just had circulated—is, as indicated by my drafting advice, a successful attempt at a grandfathering protection so that the new arrangements for parenting payment (single) would not apply to those who are currently in receipt of that payment but only to future recipients, so that people who have structured their lives around the level of payment they are currently receiving will not have to make the significant adjustment to the $80 a fortnight drop in income which will occur overnight when the measure comes into place—I think 20 March is now the date aimed at. My amendment attempts to try to find a way through the difficulty that is presented here in terms of not putting at risk the positive aspects that are contained within the schedule, which is, I suspect, what may otherwise occur.
 One of the questions I asked the minister—I do not think she answered, unless I was temporarily distracted—was whether or not this measure relating to sole parents was contained as a recommendation in the Spicer report. Another issue on which I would be interested in the minister's comments is in relation to the bill as a whole. There are a number of other measures which we have not got to yet in other schedules, some of which, without pre-empting the views of the chamber, may well end up being opposed and removed. One of the issues that ATSIC have raised with me is the issue of the positive aspects of this measure contained in schedule 2 actually coming into being. One issue is in terms of the bill as a whole and whether, if the chamber makes other amendments, the government would be of a mind to hold up the bill because of changes that may be made to other schedules as well. An indication of the government's attitude to that would be helpful also.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—In answer to Senator Bartlett's question about Mr Spicer, 
 I am advised that Mr Spicer made it absolutely clear in his report that double dipping should be ended. Going back to the matters I was discussing with Senator Evans, perhaps I should go on, Senator Evans, to draw your attention to opposition amendment No. 8, because it has presumably unintended consequences, and the measures that we were discussing regarding amendments Nos 9 to 32 are consequent on the outcome of amendment No. 8.
My advice is that if amendment No. 8—the next one on the list—succeeds, the CDEP supplement will be payable only to those on allowance type payments. Presumably, that is an unintended result, as you did not announce that during the second reading debate. This amendment and others consequential upon it should be opposed. The consequential amendments to be opposed on this basis are the opposition amendments on sheet 1391 and amendments Nos 9 to 32 inclusive. My concern is that you would effectively be removing the $20 amount for people on pensions. I do not suppose you meant to do that.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-22,"—While Senator Evans is getting advice on that, I would certainly say that, from my reading of the amendments and the bill—whilst we are not actually debating opposition amendment No. 8, it is obviously linked to the ones we are debating—it does appear to me that the minister's advice on her last comment is correct. As I understand it, if we knocked out that particular section, all pensioners—and there is a list of pensions there: widow pension, wife pension, disability support pension, age pension, any of these—would cease to be entitled to receive the CDEP participant supplement. That appears to me to be the consequence of that. That is something that I have concerns about because, as I understand it, the thrust of what we are debating here is simply the impact on parenting payment (single) recipients.
I would like to make a point in response to comments made by the minister a couple of moments back in relation to women's participation in CDEP projects and how that may be affected by the various proposals that are 
 being put around. I would have thought that the foreshadowed amendment of the Democrats to grandfather or to protect current recipients would not have an impact on the problem of women's participation—if it is a problem—because these people are already participants in CDEP and, regardless of whether this bill exists or not in its entirety, one would assume that they would continue to participate. The issue really is about the treatment of the income support payments for scheme participants into the future. The aims of my amendment are to not lead to an income drop for those who are already receiving particular incomes and to enable the future structure of the scheme to operate in the way that the government intends.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—I think Senator Bartlett is trying to do the right thing by women in those communities. But I think it would be pretty ineffectual, from my reading of remote indigenous communities, where the labour market is pretty inflexible. The only source of income for most people in communities is either welfare or CDEP. Those people currently employed under CDEP in a remote community, where there is only so much work and not much change in the potential work force, are going to continue to get the work, and the people who are excluded now are likely to continue to be excluded if they continue double dipping. I think that the amendment, whatever it might say, would result in those who are being discriminated against—if you want to put it that way—now because they are already in receipt of sole parent income support continuing to be discriminated against in terms of getting a job with CDEP.
I share your concern about these people, but I think the quickest way to have them share in the dignity of employment in indigenous communities would be to put them on the same basis as everybody else in their community. The resentment that is occasioned by them having two sources of income where other people do not would be removed. They would be competing for a job on a much 
 fairer basis with everybody else in their community. It is pretty well recognised by the indigenous community—perhaps it was an unforseen consequence of some legislative effort years ago; I do not know the history of how it happened—as grossly unfair to have one group of people in a small and close community treated so distinctly differently from everybody else when we are talking about the opportunity to have the dignity of a job.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-22,"—I just want to address a couple of the issues. Firstly, I object to this claim of double dipping. I think that is a bit unfair.
—Two sources of income.
—Two sources of income, yes. These are the most disadvantaged people in Australia—Aboriginal single parents supporting children. To accuse them of double dipping is an abuse of language and an unfair implication by use of that language. What we are saying is that these people receive, in addition, about $100 per fortnight for participating in work under the CDEP scheme to support their community. They receive the same single parenting payment that every other person receives. What they get by way of advantage for this alleged double dipping is $100 per fortnight in recognition of their sole parent status and their need to support their children.
I understand what the minister is saying, but I think the language ought to be a bit more responsible. It is not double dipping; they are currently entitled, under the provisions of government legislation, to that income in recognition of their status. Senator Bartlett, you ought to recognise that. If there is such a problem with these people getting access to the work force, how come there are already 4,000 of them in this situation? There has been no evidence advanced for the propositions that the minister puts to us other than that there is some concern and women are being disadvantaged.
All I know is that these women will be disadvantaged, from the day you pass the government's proposition, by $100 a fort 
 night. They regard that as a disadvantage to them and their children.
—Eighty.
—Eighty—it depends on the number of children, as I understand your brief, Minister. As I said to you before, single sole parent Aboriginals have more dependent children than most sole parents. So we are talking about some of the most disadvantaged people in Australia.
What we do know is that this government measure will reduce the income payable to them. Set against that, we have the government's arguments about a level playing field and some concern about relationships inside communities. On balance, what is more tangible? What is more real? What is more tangible and real to me is their capacity to support those children and the income support that they receive. For us to accept that we ought to reduce that, we would need to have a fairly tangible and cogent argument put—and I have not heard it yet.
I do not consider it double dipping. We have considered that those sole parents in Aboriginal communities who volunteer to be involved in CDEP deserve that sort of support. We may well make a judgment in the Senate that they do not deserve that support. That is fine; it is a judgment we will make. What I say, on behalf of the Labor opposition, is that we do not make that decision because we do not think it appropriate or fair. To suggest that somehow this is causing enormous problems and that women are being prevented from participating is proved false by the fact that you have 4,000 people clearly in this situation already.
There may well be difficulties. ATSIC may well have concerns about how that is operated. But I also note that there are other implications for ATSIC. Senator Bartlett has already hinted at what they may be—that this is a take it or leave it package. ATSIC's view may well be that there are a range of beneficial measures contained in this bill, but they have been told, `Take it or leave it'. They have to support all the measures or nothing at all. I do not know that, but I suspect that is the case. I suspect that influences their view. I suspect that is now starting to influence the 
 view of Senator Bartlett and the Democrats. Again, that is a political judgment for them.
If you look at this measure in isolation—which we need to do—and if you look at it from the perspective of those 4,000 single Aboriginal parents, there is a very real case to be answered. That is: why should they have their benefits reduced by a significant amount, reducing their capacity to care for their children because they will have much less income as a result of this measure?
I do not know about the grandfathering clause, Senator Bartlett. If you are not going to support us in opposing the government's measure, then I guess I would have to go with the grandfathering clause as the soft option—the second best alternative. But I would urge you to consider whether or not the minister has made the case for this entitlement to be removed and whether or not you really do think that these people are double dipping. I maintain they are not. Every other sole parenting recipient in Australia is entitled to earn an income up to those income levels if they participate in work. These people are participating, through the CDEP project, in work. Why should they be treated any less favourably?
You have the government saying, `On the one hand we want to have a level playing field in terms of CDEP but on the other hand we want an uneven playing field in terms of parenting payment single.' You can choose which level playing field you think is more appropriate. It just so happens that the one the government supports on this occasion saves them millions of dollars and disadvantages single parent Aboriginal families. I, on balance, prefer the other view. That argument has been articulated before.
In terms of the procedural issue that the minister raises, we think that our amendments achieve what we have stated to be our objective, which is that the status quo apply for sole parent pensioners and that they do not receive the CDEP supplementary benefit. We do not intend that they get an advantage from receiving the $20 CDEP supplement. We are saying that we want to exclude them from that on the basis that they retain the status quo. That was the intention of those amend 
 ments. I am happy to enter into discussions with your officers if they say that is not achieved. We were not seeking to delay the payment of that to other groups and we were not seeking to further benefit those who receive a parenting payment single. That was the intention. I think you said that was what we were doing. If that is the case, I agree.
I note there is some excitement among the many advisers you have here today. I am glad to see you have more numbers here. I hope that helps the process.
—I'll send some over to you to help you.
—Minister, I find it is quantity, not quality, on these occasions. That is no slur on the advisers present. As I said, our intention and the drafting instructions to the clerks were that the amendments be drafted so that the status quo applied to those in receipt of parent payment single, that the other measures the government announced proceeded as planned and that the changes you wanted in terms of timing proceeded as you intended. I think I have made that perfectly clear. We are not arguing about a policy issue there, so I hope we can just get to what we think we are achieving and resolve it.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—It is getting harder to resolve, because Labor's amendments would actually introduce double dipping for pensioners who were joining CDEP in the future—because the CDEP scheme is being opened up to all pensioners from 20 March next year. In other words, the double amount of assistance that single parents are getting now would become the norm for all pensioners from 20 March next year. Whether that is what you intended or not, that is what is going to happen as a result. I am fascinated that you are prepared to countenance double dipping but you are not prepared to countenance triple dipping. Well done! You are moving! The add-on of the $20 would obviously mean triple dipping, in your eyes.
Essentially what we are dealing with here is the unintended consequence of the conver 
 gence of two systems: the traditional social security income support system and the CDEP system. We have got a group which, if your amendments go through, will be larger still, come 20 March next year. We have got a group of people who have entitlement to two lots of assistance from the taxpayer. Nobody else in Australia has that. I particularly wanted you to hear me to the end of this answer, and then perhaps Senator Bartlett might have something to say, and that will give you the chance to get some advice.
It is not just bureaucrats in ATSIC who believe this needs fixing. The board of ATSIC believes it. You would have seen or certainly would know of the letter that Gatjil Djerrkura wrote to Senator Lees. I quoted from it two days ago.
—You didn't send it to us.
—That is a pity, because—
—That is your decision.
—It is not my decision. It has nothing to do with me. This is the board of ATSIC that has written. One of the sentences in it is this:
The board acknowledges the government's strong argument—
they are talking about lone parent pensioners—
that the introduction of new income treatment arrangements will address the potential double funding by government of CDEP participants who are also lone parent pensioners.
Specifically, the penultimate paragraph goes into the question of lone parents in some detail. It is not a question of the bureaucrats in ATSIC. It is the board of ATSIC that has wanted to see this ended and the new scheme introduced. If there is anything that the Labor Party has talked about over the years, it is the need to listen to indigenous people's views on their futures. This is a clear case where the Labor Party is prepared to ignore that advice.
Our government has been particularly concerned about sole parents in indigenous communities. Our government has put a massive effort in already, and is continuing 
 to, in order to do something about the terrible domestic violence in indigenous communities which leads so often to sole parenthood. So do not accuse us of not having the concerns of sole parents in indigenous communities at heart. We are actually trying to make a difference. We are making a massive effort in this. That violence is something that have I watched grow in indigenous communities around Central and Northern Australia and North Queensland over the time that you were in government.
It is now time that the women in those communities were listened to, and this government has been listening to them and involving them in consultations about how best to deal with this scourge in their community. You might have had a darned sight fewer sole parents if that had been done earlier. It makes me very cross to think of the wasted lives, the damaged bodies, the children scarred psychologically and the continuation of the cycle of domestic violence in those communities—a cycle which could have been stopped earlier or could have been prevented.
If you really care about sole parents, support the government's endeavours in that and do not try a cheap shot about whether we have concern for some of the most deprived people in our society: we do have. Their lives are vital, as well as this double income support which they are getting from the federal taxpayer.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-22,"—I should put on the record in perhaps a bit more detail the Democrats' beliefs in relation to this area and also some of the philosophical points that have come up, just to ensure that they are clearly on the record. Firstly, whilst I understand the minister's argument, I do think that the phrase `double dipping' is a pejorative one which implies some sort of inappropriate motive on the part of the recipient. I am not saying that the minister believes that, but I do think that in this area of welfare payments there is often a lot of potential community negativity that is able to be tapped into in relation to welfare recipients and that it is best to avoid language that might play on that by implying some inappropriate motive on behaviour. This is 
 clearly a legitimate entitlement that people currently have, and these are not wealthy people, by any stretch of the imagination—as Senator Evans has outlined.
The minister, in responding to some aspects of the opposition's amendments, talked about the cost if they were passed. I think it was $14 million a year, roughly, in a couple of years time. As I say repeatedly with regard to social security legislation, I am certainly not of the view that it is not important to try to limit government expenditure and to try to save government money where appropriate. But it is important to emphasise that, when we are using figures like those, it is not just a matter of saving taxpayers $14 million or whatever the amount of money is but that it also means $14 million is not been provided to people who are, generally speaking, amongst the most disadvantaged. If you put it in that context, it takes on quite a different light: it is $14 million of assistance that would otherwise be provided to disadvantaged people but that will not be provided. Again, it is important in terms of the issue of language.
The comments that Senator Evans was making about the different choices of level playing field also need noting and responding to. Again, I quite understand the rationale of what he is putting forward but, if you were to extend that logic fully, then the opposition would really need to extend the current income treatment that sole parents receive to all other income support payments in relation to CDEP. If it is a philosophical or an ideological principle, then it would make sense for it to apply across the board rather than to just one group of people. I know that the amendments are not seeking to do that but, if we are following through that principle, we would need to do that; and I do not think that anyone is suggesting that we should do that.
I do think it is appropriate that there be consistency of treatment. I have spoken many times about the need for a consistent approach, the removal of anomalies and the simplification of the Social Security Act. I have also spoken many times about how we should not do that in a way that reduces people's entitlements rather than increases 
 them. This clearly is a situation where, for whatever historical reason it appeared, CDEP income for sole parents is treated in a way that is different to any other social security recipient. That is clearly an anomaly.
I note the specific statements of ATSIC chairman, Gatjil Djerrkura—a person for whom I have a lot of respect—on the treatment of sole parents receiving a pension like payment. That is something that does need to be taken on board. Nonetheless, I come back to the basic point that I have continued to try to make on this issue which is that those sorts of principles are important, budgetary expenditure is important, consistency of treatment is important and simplified acts is important, but we also need to remember that we are talking about people here. We need to try to ensure that we are not disadvantaging people, particularly people who are already amongst the least well off. That is the particular rationale behind the foreshadowed amendment of the Democrats.
There are a couple of other points I would like to make. Firstly, I point out to Senator Evans that amendment No. 8, which is to oppose section 1188D, still reads to me like it will affect a whole group of people rather than just parenting payment (single) which, from my understanding of his comments, is not the intent.
Secondly, in response to the minister's comments about the resentment that may be out in the community towards the perceived special treatment of some sole parents, I do not know how strong that is. I guess that is one of the things you cannot quantify. The discussions I have had with ATSIC people do not recall that being raised as an issue. One thing you can quantify is that these women will be $80 a fortnight worse off. When you are balancing up whether you want to be $80 a week worse off but perhaps have a little less perceived resentment in the community, I imagine most people would prefer to keep their $80 a fortnight unless that resentment is completely overpowering. I have certainly had no evidence at all that that is the case. I do not accept that as an argument in itself for significantly reducing the entitlements of 
 people who are currently receiving these payments.
As Senator Evans pointed out, if there was some problems with these women being able to access employment through CDEP because of this treatment then there would not be 4,000 currently in this situation. That may be a problem that is stopping others getting in, but it is certainly not stopping the 4,000 that are already there. Again, I do not see that as a valid argument.
To put on the record the Democrats' response to these amendments, the view I have formed after listening to the various arguments that have been put forward and the responses to those is that the best course of action from the Democrats' point of view is not to support the opposition amendments at present, unless Senator Evans comes up with a stunningly brilliant contribution in a few seconds time.
—Again.
—Yet another one, yes. I do believe, nonetheless, that it is important to try to ensure that these 4,000 people—I presume they are predominantly women—are not disadvantaged by this change and do not have a significant drop in their existing income in a few months time. For that reason, I hope that the Senate will consider giving support to the amendment I have foreshadowed.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-09-22,"—I would like to speak to the opposition amendments. In doing so, I will go through a few issues that I believe are very pertinent to CDEP in North Queensland. I believe the program was trialled in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. There are areas where it is functioning very well to the benefit of the communities.
In North Queensland it would appear, after having actually spent time in the communities discussing the issue, to have a downside that I do not believe was perceived or intended by the people who passed the original legislation and established the scheme. In North Queensland the CDEP is referred to as sit down pay. It has introduced a mentality into the communities whereby people no longer believe that 
 they need to go out and work on the stations or, for that matter, in the programs that are being established by their own councils. They merely say, `We sit home and get paid as well.'
There appears to be a lack of actual contact with the people in the communities by the people who are progressing both the legislation and the schemes. If you go into a local community—say, Pormpuraaw, and I have actually been there—the local people will pay $250 for a slab. You say, `What is a slab?' A slab is a carton of beer. That can actually be purchased in either Chillagoe or Mareeba for approximately $20, driven out to the communities—not necessarily by white people; quite often by Aboriginal people—and then sold on-site. They will also sell a cap. You say, `What is a cap?' A cap is the quantity of spirit you can pour into the cap from a bottle of Johnny Walker.
Senator Bartlett says the people in the community will suffer, that if this payment is taken away from them, it will impact on their economic management. With the greatest of sincerity to Senator Bartlett, I would like him to show me any Aboriginal person in a community who sits down and works out a budget of what they are going to do with their pensions or their pay. In reality, it does not happen. The CDEP was genuinely intended to assist these people. I do not believe it does today. We can, and I believe this chamber should, continue to debate the issues on their merit as they are put forward, but I think we also need to have a practical look at their application.
Look at Hopevale: there are people in Hopevale who have been paying rent for the last 36 years. They will continue to do that until they die—never, ever owning those homes. We look at the communities up there and wonder why they do not have any pride in the places they live in.
I do not believe that it is for us, with the greatest of intent, to provide these people with what we believe is a social answer to their problem. We need to get out there and talk to the people. I spent four days in Pormpuraaw. I have seen the local people picked up, taken down to the local police station, held over 
 night, dried out, given a meal and sent home. That is the reality of what is happening in our communities.
We need to do two things. First, listen to the people in the communities and find out what they need to do to assist themselves. Second, if they are willing, assist them with some economic forms—in other words, give them the ability to take control of their lives and give them some purpose for living where they live. If, however, they choose to go back to their own traditional way of living, we need to listen to them as well.
I understand what the opposition is trying to do to preserve these payments to these people. There is resentment within the communities, where some of the communities are seen to be getting two payments—and you actually have to be in the community on a payment day to really understand what happens. If the opposition's amendments are successful and that $14 million that is being spoken of is moved into economic development within the communities for the community as a whole, it would bring the communities closer together and actually assist in progressing what we are trying to do.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-22,"—There are a couple of issues I wish to address. First, on this procedural question: I guess if the Democrats are voting against the amendments, it becomes a largely academic issue. But I would say to the minister that we have tried to cooperate in terms of getting a debate about the principles and not the technicalities. We met with her advisers yesterday and, as I said, we have tried to get the debate back to the question of principles. I was here until 10.30 last night and from 7.30 this morning. If you had a problem and you thought we had an unintended consequence, given that I put on the record three or four times yesterday what our intentions were, I think we would have been better suited trying to sort this out outside of the chamber prior to us coming in.
You always talk to me about the need for prior consultation, good manners, et cetera. I would suggest to you that, if the government thinks there is an unintended consequence of an opposition amendment, you would be 
 better off picking up the phone and talking to me about it. It seems to me that, rather than waste the time of the chamber here as we have again this morning, we could have had that discussion and fixed that.
I have been very straight about what our intention is. I have said it about eight times in the Hansard. I accept there may be a problem with an unintended consequence arising from our amendment. I am not sure how many people who actually receive the age pension are working on CDEP, or how many who receive the disability pension are working on CDEP. I suspect the figures are fairly small. In any event, if there is a problem, all I am saying is that we ought to be able to sort that out. Rather than come in and try to score a political point, it seems to me that we would have been better served trying to sort that out.	I want to concentrate on the political issues and the principles.
Minister, you alleged there was some sort of cheap shot. There is no cheap shot involved. I wanted us to focus though on the impact of this measure. While Senator Harris made some very optimistic and hopeful statements about what could be done with the money instead, the reality I want to focus on is that these amendments deprive Aboriginal single parents of income. We have to focus on that. If the Senate makes that decision, I am prepared to accept that but I want to make sure we focused on that. That is why the opposition opposes this measure; we just cannot see the justification for reducing their benefits.
I do not want to labour the point. I do not suspect I am going to suddenly come up with a brilliant argument that convinces Senator Bartlett. He has clearly been influenced in recent times to review the Democrats' position and he has come up with a second-best option in terms of the grandfathering clause.
I do think it would be useful if the Democrats tabled in the Senate the letter to Senator Lees from ATSIC. I have only just been handed a copy of that letter. ATSIC did not choose to write to the opposition. But I noticed that the minister, in quoting, did not quote the whole paragraph from ATSIC; I think it is important that the whole paragraph 
 go on the record so that ATSIC's position is not misunderstood. As I understand it, the letter starts:
While the board has expressed concern over the potential impact of the new income treatment arrangements for lone parent pensioners on CDEP, the board also acknowledges . . .
And it goes on. To be fair to ATSIC and Gatjil Djerrkura, the letter ought to be tabled, because it has become part of the debate here today. I do not feel that I should seek to do it; it is not a letter to me. But I think that would be useful.
I also want to put on the record that the opposition has been approached by a range of CDEP groups who have a different view from ATSIC about the impact of this measure. Of course, that is their right. They have a different perception of the impact. The opposition has been influenced by their views, but also by the discussions we had yesterday with ATSIC in which they briefed the opposition's advisers about their attitude to the bill. What we found particularly telling was that they could not suggest to us that there would be any greater participation in CDEP by sole parents as a result of these measures. That was quite telling in terms of our response: we do not expect that the sorts of things that the minister talks about, such as prevention of women participating in the schemes, will be altered by this. Certainly ATSIC did not put any argument to that effect. I think it important that ATSIC's position go on the record. I would appreciate it if Senator Bartlett would table ATSIC's letter so as to have their position clearly stated, rather than my reading certain bits and the minister reading other bits of their correspondence.
I put on the record that I am pleased that the minister is starting to listen to ATSIC and the views which they express. I hope this reflects a change of heart by the government more generally in terms of listening to what ATSIC and Aboriginal people have to say. I do take what they say seriously. I did not until recently have a copy of their letter but, as I say, they did not write it to me. In any event, I will not delay the Senate any longer on the basis of the arguments.
The Labor Party still thinks the government has not made a case for reducing the entitlements of these single parents. They are among the most disadvantaged, and we do not think that the arguments about tensions in the community or levelling the playing field warrant that reduction. That is a judgment people have to make. Given that the Democrats will not be voting for our amendments, I suspect the issue about the unintended consequences falls away, so I do not think we need to worry about resolving that.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—Obviously I do not speak for Senator Bartlett, but I would suggest that there is absolutely no reason for him to need to table the ATSIC letter, as the ATSIC letter was handed to Senator Evans's adviser by my staff two days ago in the Senate. So the opposition has in fact been in possession of the ATSIC letter—
—I have not seen it.
—You gave the distinct impression that the opposition had not had the benefit of a copy of it. The fact is that your adviser, who is presently sitting in the box, was given a copy two days ago.
—He may well have been; I have not seen it.
—I am happy to pick up the phone to you to avoid the waste of time we have had this morning. I am not saying this in a spirit of a lack of charity; I am just saying to you that I only got the advice this morning. It is a classic outcome of what I mentioned in my second reading speech two days ago. If the opposition are dealing in, say, taxation law or social security law and think that they can drop pages of amendments on the Senate as the second reading debate is proceeding and expect to get proper scrutiny by people who have got the ability to assess the implications in a very technical system, they are setting themselves up to look foolish in terms of unintended consequences.
I am not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything, but if you believe in good govern 
 ment—and I know this, having been in opposition for far too long myself—if you have amendments of a technical nature, it is better to come into the chamber with those amendments having been looked at thoroughly by somebody who can give you advice on them. My office twice wrote to the opposition offering briefings on this legislation, with no response, and I understand that a briefing was given yesterday. Those amendments could have been printed earlier and therefore been available—
—Your amendments came out yesterday.
—You have had amendments from us for a long time.
—Your amendments came out yesterday.
—You have had amendments from us for a long time. I am talking about your long list. We have just had two weeks in which the Senate has not been sitting. It was a pretty reasonable time to have your amendments looked at and to have the Senate prepare a running sheet. The Senate yesterday had to prepare two running sheets as a result of getting your list of amendments in a very, very short time. Maybe you do not believe in good government when you are not in government; maybe that is what you are on about. But surely a responsible opposition would still believe in the government of the day putting down legislation which is able to be administered and which is not producing unforeseen consequences.
—Your hypocrisy is breathtaking.
—No matter how Senator Evans squawks from the opposition benches, the reality is that doing the Senate the discourtesy of getting so many technical amendments at the last minute—some of which have been demonstrated to have been absolutely unacceptable, I am sure even to himself, and certainly to the rest of the chamber—is something to be avoided in the cause of good government and not wasting at least an hour of the Senate's time. I am glad to see that commonsense is prevailing.
—The question is that the amendments and the request for amendments (R10) be agreed to.
Question resolved in the negative.
—The question now is that schedule 2, item 53, section 1188D stand as printed.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-22,"—I move Democrats amendment No. 1 on sheet 1547:
Schedule 2, page 40 (after line 6), at the end of the Schedule, add:
55  Application
	 The amendments made by items 48 to 53 (inclusive) do not apply to a person who, on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent, is receiving parenting payment at the rate applicable for a person who is not a member of a couple. The provisions of the Social Security Act 1991  continue to apply to such persons as if the amendments made to that Act by items 48 to 53 (inclusive) had not been made.
The issues relating to this amendment have already been addressed, so I will not go on about it at great length. Basically the outcome will be that the Senate accepts the rationale of the change that the government is making in relation to the treatment of sole parents' income but protects the income of those that are currently on the CDEP Scheme so that those 4,000 people, as I understand it, will not experience that significant reduction in their income but new participants in the scheme will come on board as part of the new arrangements.
I will just make a couple of comments. I am quite happy to table the letter from Gatjil Djerrkura. I did not have a copy with me but I will table the copy that Senator Evans has kindly given to me. I had obviously seen a copy of it previously. It was sent to Senator Lees at the end of August and it was passed on to me as the party's social security spokesperson and I responded to that. I am happy to table that letter so that is on the record.
Senator Evans spoke about being approached by a number of CDEP groups about their concerns which are different to ATSIC. As he 
 said, it is entirely appropriate for different people to have different views. I personally have not and, as far as I am aware, none of the Democrats have been approached by those groups. Without giving advice to ATSIC, if they send letters to the Democrats it would probably be a good idea for them to send them to the opposition as well. Usually when I meet with people about legislation I encourage them to talk to all parties. Much as I like to put the view out there that all wisdom resides with the Democrats, it does not hurt for them to talk to other parties as well. It probably would have been a good idea for ATSIC to send a similar letter to the opposition. But, conversely, I did not receive any representations from people involved in individual CDEP operations putting a contrary view. So I am going on the information and views that were expressed to me.
There were a couple of comments today about us having wasted time this morning. Whilst a bit of toing-and-froing about unintended consequences and dropping amendments at the last minute may not be that productive, I do think outlining the policy principles in relation to this issue is important and I do not see that as a waste of time. I think it is something worth emphasising.
I try to take a fairly low key approach, if you like, to social security legislation, as I do with immigration legislation—both are areas in which public passions can be quite easily inflamed, sometimes in a negative way if one wants to stir things up—and I try to avoid too much fiery rhetoric because I do not think it is constructive in areas such as these. It is nonetheless important to put on the record in a dispassionate way that what we are dealing with, as this amendment is, is indigenous sole parent pensioners and we are trying to ensure that their income is not significantly reduced.
I take on board Senator Harris's comments before, whatever validity there might be in his comments about how various people budget or do not budget and spend their money. I think moving to significantly reduce the income of people who are already not well off cannot do anything other than have a negative impact on them. While there may be other measures that may mitigate that to some 
 extent, reducing people's income by $40 a week or more when they are not well off to start with should not be dismissed. It is a significant action, and it has an impact on human beings—human beings who are amongst the most disadvantaged. That basic point needs to be made and this Democrat amendment, which hopefully does not have any unintended drafting consequences, moves to protect those people.
—Do you wish to incorporate that letter?
—I have asked to table it.
—I believe if you incorporate it, it may be better.
—I am happy to do that. I seek leave to incorporate that letter.
Leave granted.
The letter read as follows—

Chairperson

Parliamentary Leader

Parliament House
CANBERRA  ACT 2600
(31 AUG 1999)
Dear Senator Lees
I am writing to you seeking your support in securing the passage of the Further 1998 Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security) Bill 1999 which I understand is scheduled to be introduced for debate in the Senate during this week's sittings.
As you may be aware, the above Bill relates to the implementation of the Government's 1998 CDEP Budget Initiative, which will provide benefits to participants on the Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) Scheme. The Budget Initiative seeks to address inequity issues experienced by participants on the Scheme. These issues were identified in both the independent review of the CDEP Scheme (the Spicer Review) and the report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Budget Initiative will provide CDEP participants with access to the CDEP Participant Supplement (CPS) as well as access to add-on benefits.
The original implementation date for the Initiative was 20 March this year. I am most concerned that any further legislative delay of this measure will result in significant confusion for CDEP organisa 
 tions and participants and will genuinely disadvantage CDEP participants who would yet again be prevented from accessing the CPS and add-on benefits.
The ATSIC Board has given its in-principle support to the package of measures contained in the Initiative and considers that the successful implementation of the Initiative on 20 September 1999 is important for providing access to the above benefits.
While the Board has expressed concern over the potential impact of the new income treatment arrangements for Lone Parents Pensioners on CDEP, the Board also acknowledges that this is an equity issue between the income treatment arrangements afforded to other pensioners and those on CDEP. The Board acknowledges the Government's strong argument that the introduction of new income treatment arrangements will address the potential double funding by Government of CDEP participants who are also Lone Parent Pensioners.
In conclusion I would urge you to do all in your power to ensure that the Senate considers the Bill in this week's sittings and to support its passage without amendment.
Yours sincerely

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-22,"—I thought I would perhaps hear from the minister as to what her attitude is. But, as I indicated on behalf of the opposition earlier, our preferred position obviously was to support our amendments which protected the position of sole parents in terms of the government's intentions in their entirety.
This amendment is an attempt by the Democrats to afford some protection to those currently in receipt of both the parenting payment (single) and CDEP yet obviously does not do anything for the longer term situation of sole parents involved in CDEP. But it does seek to address one of the chief opposition's concerns, which I have stated earlier, which is to try to protect the income level available to these most disadvantaged parents and children. Our approach to this has always been to seek to protect their position and to argue that the arguments for simplicity and level playing fields do not overcome the impact on the individuals affected by this measure—that is, that they have their income reduced by a significant amount, which then has a detrimental effect on their families.
The Democrats position, as I understand it, will at least protect those 4,000 or so single parents who are currently involved in CDEP and who receive the parenting payment (single). The opposition intends to support that amendment because it goes some way to achieving the policy outcome that we sought to achieve when we entered this debate and which we think is important. While we would have preferred our amendments being carried, which would have protected the position of all single parents involved in CDEP in future years, this at least has the advantage of ensuring that parents currently in receipt of the parenting payment do not have their income reduced by in the order of $100 per fortnight, which would have an immediate impact on their capacity to care for their children and to support their families. That was at the core of our concern about this measure so, to the extent that the Democrat amendment does that, we support it. It is a second-best option, but it is one that we are prepared to support.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—The government will not be supporting the Democrats' amendment. The social policy reform of which this is a part has come through an independent review by Mr Ian Spicer, who recommended that this matter be reformed. On the specific area of people receiving two payments, the proposal has been endorsed by ATSIC, as the letter which has now been incorporated in Hansard  demonstrates. In plain equity terms, it is unfair that some people in a community should be treated so very differently from everybody else, none of whom you would say were rich. They are all on the same level of welfare dependency and are all bordering on poverty. The arguments which have just been made are not acceptable.
The effect on women is one that concerns me. Senator Bartlett, of all people, having worked in social security in the past, would well understand how a good social policy is a simpler policy—in terms of administration, the ability of people to access their due entitlements, et cetera—and that, wherever 
 grandfathering occurs, you get complexities in administration and a less clearly defined system for people to access their entitlements. It is particularly not good social security policy to increase the number of people who are grandfathered for any reason. It is usually done for a political purpose, and that is what is happening in this case. The package has come forward from the government after independent inquiry by Mr Spicer and after endorsement by the elected representatives of the indigenous communities. I would have thought that would weigh heavily on senators' minds. We need to endorse it here, but the government recognises that we will not win this vote.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-09-22,"—I rise to indicate that I will be opposing the amendment but, in doing that, I would like to clarify the reasons why. It may seem unfair to oppose a motion that intends to assist and protect the people whom you are directing that payment to. The reason I clearly oppose the amendment is that it does not achieve the intended outcome. I tried very briefly before to describe what happens in a community on the day a pension cheque arrives. You really have to be there and experience it to understand what happens. There is resentment within some of the communities. Some of the communities work exceptionally well on the program, but others do not, and in those communities the program has a very adverse effect on the people whom we are intending to help.
Senator Evans's comment about my suggestion of having this amount of money appropriated to schemes that would economically help the communities is an indication either that I am not articulating very well or that he does not agree with the idea of people having dignity. We are putting an amount of money into communities without taking the next step of ensuring that it gets to the women and children whom it is intended to get to. In communities like Pormpuraaw and Kowanyama, it does not have that effect. It goes into the community and is spent in the way that the communities in those areas traditionally spend it. It does not get to help the mothers to go down to the local store to buy provi 
 sions for their children—that is, provided the local community store has the funds to purchase those goods so they can buy them.
I believe we need to listen to the people in the communities as to how we help them, not impose our ideologies on them. There are ways in which we can help them. We can help them have the integrity of their artwork so that their artwork is not pilfered by people who put it into the tourist shops in Cairns and areas like that with no benefit to the communities from where it has been pilfered.
These are the areas where we need to assist these people. I believe it would be far more effective to take the amounts of money that we are talking about and turn them around into programs that will actually help all of the communities. We also need to look beyond the communities. A substantial number of Aboriginal people live in the wider community and their needs, in some cases, are as great as, if not greater than, those in the community. Though it may seem a contradiction in terms, my reason for opposing the amendment is that I believe it would be far better to have the equality of the single payment for these people within their communities, to take that additional money and to put it into a process that those communities collectively believe will assist them more.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-22,"—I speak briefly in response to comments in relation to the amendment. Firstly, I think Senator Harris's comments to a large extent relate more broadly to the CDEP and his views on the operation of that. This issue is obviously a small part of an aspect of the treatment of income relating to the CDEP. I will not necessarily respond to his broader comments about the worth or otherwise of the CDEP as it operates. I have visited a number of indigenous communities myself, both in Queensland and in the Northern Territory. I certainly have some understanding of the situations there, although I would not claim to be an expert by any means.
Whilst I very much endorse the view that just giving people money is not the answer and there are a lot of other issues that need to be incorporated, I am very wary of a view which is taking hold that money is not unim 
 portant. Money does come in reasonably handy. It is not the only thing one needs. Despite some of the romantics out there who think love is all you need, I think money does come in handy occasionally as well. Personal income and basic income support payments are a crucial component of giving people the opportunity to have some control over their lives and some dignity. I certainly do not suggest that it is the only thing, but it is important not to undervalue the basic and crucial aspect of ensuring that people have enough money to live on.
The Minister for Family and Community Services made some comments about good social policy. I understand what she is saying in relation to that, but I do think it is important to remember that social policy is not just about reviews, academic aspects and coming up with something that makes logical sense but also about the impact on people. I know she is not saying it is not, but I want to keep emphasising that in this type of legislation more than most we are dealing with issues that impact very much on people.
I acknowledge that grandfather clauses make for administrative messiness, but they also serve more than a political purpose in the narrow sense of the word. I do not think they are totally politically driven a lot of the time. They are a mechanism for smoothing out the negative consequences of change, and that applies in many areas. It is frequently used for that purpose where a change is recognised as being appropriate but a smoothing mechanism is put in place to try to ensure that people are not crunched along the way as the change is made. Whilst it might not be pure social policy, it is still good social policy in the sense that it does prevent negative impacts on individual people.
Finally, I want to emphasise that the Democrats have not changed our position since Monday as a result of being leaned on by anybody or anything like that. In the comments I have made throughout this debate, I have outlined our concerns about the impact of this measure, but I have certainly not committed us to a particular approach. We have had to balance up the competing claims and the very strong representations from 
 ATSIC wanting the measures to get through. Although it has not been categorically stated, it is clearly an attitude of the government's that we are dealing with a package in the schedule of the bill. There are some very positive measures in it which I know ATSIC and the indigenous communities are very keen to have commence and come into operation. There was very much a real risk here of losing those good measures, and that obviously had an impact on the Democrats' approach on this issue.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-22,"—I move opposition amendment No. 33 on sheet 1391:
(33)	 Schedule 3, page 47 (after line 4), after item 42, insert:
42A  At the end of section 665
	 Add:
	 (4)	 A person is not qualified for an employment entry payment under this Part if the person is qualified for a special employment advance under Part 2.22A and has made a claim under section 1061EP in respect of the same employment.
I wish to address my remarks to the general question of employment and education entry payments in debating this amendment and hopefully not repeat them with every amendment. The government's legislation seeks to abolish the employment entry payment, which is a non-refundable grant, and replace it with a repayable advance called the new special employment advance, which is in effect a loan. With the current system, the employment entry payment is a non-refundable payment, and the government's proposal is to change that into effectively a loan. The government also seeks to abolish the education entry payment and, to the best of my understanding, not replace that at all for recipients of allowances.
The opposition are attempting to protect the employment and education entry payments and come some way towards supporting the part of the government's approach that allows a bit more flexibility in what they call the special employment advance. We are seeking to protect the employment entry payment and to provide the option of the advance for those who find it preferable. As I understand it, the government are saying it is preferable that people take an advance if and when they 
 require it and not be entitled to the payment. We say there is some merit in the approach of giving it a bit more flexibility because some people may require the larger amount which is available under the advance. We accept that that may be useful on some occasions.
But I think there is a fundamental flaw in the sense that it means that people entering employment are entering into further debt at a time when they may well have been unemployed for some time and have acquired a great deal of debt either to institutions or to family and friends. For a lot of people the idea of getting into further debt will not be a terribly attractive one. But, in the sense that the government's approach provides the option for those people, we think that may well be a measure that allows more choice and more flexibility. However, we do not see the argument for the employment entry payment being abolished. We think that there are real costs associated with starting employment and that the payment provides a useful addition to helping people make the transition from unemployment to employment. The payment was introduced in 1991 and has provided some assistance to those people. We do not see the argument for that being removed.
I admit it is small and I admit that it is not necessarily an incentive for people to take employment but it provides a very tangible assistance for them when taking up work. It provides them with some opportunity to ease that transition into employment and to meet some of the costs associated with starting employment. For that reason, we support the employment entry payment. Our amendment seeks to provide some flexibility. If the government wishes to offer this advance scheme as an addition then we are prepared to support that, but we are not prepared to see the employment entry payment abolished. We think it is a very worthwhile and useful measure that assists people in the transition from unemployment to work. We are a bit perplexed as to why, apart from being a cost cutting measure, the government would seek to remove it.
In terms of addressing the education entry payment at the same time, I know this is the subject of later amendments but it is a related measure in terms of the debate. We do not understand why the government wants to abolish the education entry payment. We think it provides very useful assistance to people wishing to study.
I would be interested to hear from the minister what the rationale is for removing that payment, because we think it just removes a key incentive for people to actually seek to further their skills. The payment provides some assistance for people who are enrolling in study. When we are talking about unemployed people, I thought the whole thrust of government policy—and I think this is a bipartisan approach—was to encourage people to improve their employment skills in order to make themselves more employable and to be able to take on better and more rewarding jobs. We are a bit unclear as to why the government would want to remove that payment which facilitates that movement from unemployment to study, allowing people to better themselves. We will be opposing that measure.
As I say, while we seek to come some way towards the government's approach in terms of employment entry payments, we seek to maintain the current entry payment for those who wish to access it. Apart from being a savings measure, I do not understand the reason for removing that entitlement. We think both payments provide some incentives for people to better themselves by seeking employment and seeking study, and we think the abolition of both of those entry payments would be a counterproductive measure.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—The government's intention is to introduce a special employment advance because it will greatly extend the coverage and the provision of advance payments to income support recipients taking up work. Applicants for the SEA will need to demonstrate that either they have earned income from casual work but have not yet received that income, or they 
 have received a definite offer of employment of at least six weeks duration but do not have sufficient financial resources to take up that employment.
Senator Evans just now was asking for the rationale behind the introduction of this measure. I say to him that the Working Nation departmental evaluation of the employment entry payment scheme, which was initially introduced as an incentive provision, has indicated that it does not appear to be a major force in influencing customers' decisions to take up work. In addition, the scheme is complex. There are differences in the rates and the conditions attaching to the scheme that depend on the customers' payment types.
For example, you do not get an employment entry payment if you are going into part-time work, because usually if you are going into part-time work you are still on part Newstart allowance and you cannot therefore get an employment entry payment. You can get an employment entry payment only once in 12 months, and for people who are struggling to get back into the work force the ability to take up a succession of part-time jobs throughout the course of a year is very important. So, having had your employment entry payment once, you are then precluded from getting it again during the course of that year.
Now, with the special employment advance, you can get it any time you need it. It is very much more flexible, it is a bigger sum of money and it is available for that transitional phase from perhaps being long-term unemployed, or certainly unemployed, into more sustainable long-term employment. I think those are very good reasons for saying the special employment advance is the right way to go. It builds on the purpose behind the employment entry payment, but it is a much better arrangement. There is also a separate group of people who have been in casual work and who have not yet been able to receive that income. Teachers are a classic example of this. There has, I think, been a lot of lobbying of successive governments over a number of years to try to fix that because they are deemed to have received income that they have not in fact received. So the special 
 employment advance is useful for that group of people as well.
I do not think that there is any virtue in retaining the employment entry payment when you have got a larger payment that is available any time you need it, compared with the employment entry payment which is available only once in a year. For the employment entry payment to not be available for people who take up part-time work and are still on part Newstart allowance seems to me to be a pretty deficient kind of employment entry payment because it is a much more likely way that a lot of people will get back into the work force. They will not easily go straight from unemployment, especially if it is long-term unemployment, into a full-time job. They are much more likely to put their foot on the escalator again through the means of part-time work. To do that and not be eligible for the employment entry payment seems a bit of a nonsense to me. I think this is an important reform. You do not need to retain the employment entry payment.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-22,"—In speaking to the opposition amendment I will also speak to the foreshadowed ones that are coming up next and which relate to the same issue, just to get my comments out of the way all at once. Initially, in response to the minister's comments about the review and the current operation of the employment entry payment, if there are problems or deficiencies in the way the payment currently operates I would have thought the better way to go would be to address those deficiencies rather than scrap it altogether.
In relation to the special employment advance that is being proposed, I have great reservations about that. The opposition's amendment does not knock that out so that is not an issue to explore further, but it is very different from the employment entry payment. The opposition's amendment will, as I understand it, enable that advance to operate whilst retaining the employment entry payment, thus giving people the option. Down the track, if the advance operates as well as the government seems to think it will, it may be justifiable to revisit the issue of the employment 
 entry payment if the employment advance operates in a more effective way.
But there are a couple of big differences about the advance as opposed to the employment entry payment as it currently exists. Firstly, it is an advance. It is not a payment; it is a loan which needs to be repaid. As I said in my contribution at the second reading stage, I have great reservations about the introduction of the principle of social security payments being put forward as advances or loans rather than as entitlements. This is only a very small measure in the grand scheme of the operation of the Social Security Act. But, as I said at the time, there is such a thing as the thin end of the wedge, and I have concerns that this may be one of those circumstances where, once this principle is established in the act, it will be extended to a wide range of other payments over time, and the concept which has actually been floated by some commentators in recent times that social security payments should follow the way of HECS fees and be a debt or a loan that is recoverable rather than a payment that is paid through entitlement is the sort of approach I would have great reservations about.
Having said that, the operation as detailed here in the explanatory memorandum shows the difference. The concerns or the problems that the minister outlined about people taking up part-time work may well be genuine—I am sure they are genuine—but that is not the whole story in relation to the employment entry payment. I think if you look at the explanatory memorandum and how it will operate you will get a clearer idea of the main motivation here—that is, that the outlays from the special employment advance would, in a few years time, be less than $1 million a year, yet the savings from the employment entry payment being abolished are $18 million.
The memorandum does not mention the modifications to the education entry payment which I understand is being done as well. I would have thought there were some cost or savings implications there. I do not know if they are folded into the total of the employment entry payments as outlined in the explanatory memorandum, but I assume they are also being claimed as a savings measure. For 
 those reasons that I have outlined, the Democrats support the aim of the opposition in this amendment and the next couple of amendments.

This is to give effect to our concern that the education entry payment not be abolished. I think Senator Bartlett asked a question in his earlier contribution which I was also going to ask the minister, which went to the question of how much the government thinks it would save by that. It is not clear to me from looking at the explanatory memorandum what the financial impact of that measure would be, so I would be interested in her advice about that.
I think I put the opposition's argument on this in addressing the earlier amendment. It is essentially that we see no justification for removing a payment to assist people in moving from unemployment to education. We think it is a very important part of the overall policy direction of encouraging people to improve their skills and their employability, and we see no justification for removing that payment. But, as I say, I am not clear on exactly how much the government intends saving if that is carried. I may be missing it, but it was one of the issues that occurred to me—and Senator Bartlett, quite rightly, raised 
 it—so I would be interested to know what the answer is.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech

"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-09-22,"—As with some of the other issues in relation to this bill, we need to look further than just the wording of what is being proposed, which is to partially remove some of the employment entry payments. We need to look at the history of that process. In some cases, but not all, people have been paid their entry payment, gone out and purchased shoes or uniforms to participate in employment and then a week or two weeks later walked away from that employment. I am not saying that they are doing that solely to get the entry payment; I am highlighting one of the outcomes of that process.
I believe—and maybe the minister can assist me here—the intention of replacing that with a special employment advance is that the person, once in the work force, is then required to pay that advance back. Of the two systems, I believe that the government's position in reducing the availability of the entry payment—which the person can take with no obligation whatsoever to pay it back and no obligation to continue in the employment which that entry payment assisted them 
 to get—and replacing it with an advance to the tune of $500, which they are required to repay, is a healthy situation on two counts. Firstly, it will give that person far more support to continue in their employment. Secondly, it requires that person to have the personal discipline to budget to pay that back. In relation to society that is a far better process to be following.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—In answer to Senator Harris, it is not unusual where people do get advances currently in social security that, depending on their personal circumstances, the rate of payment of an advance can be negotiated, and it is constantly. If somebody were to take the full $500 of their special advance—and they do not have to take the full amount—it would usually be repaid at the rate of 14 per cent of their payment. Therefore, it would take about six months. I do not think that is unfair, when it is the taxpayer helping them to get back into the work force. It is more generous, as I said earlier, than the employment entry payment.
What I particularly like about it is that it is available to a number of people who currently cannot get the employment entry payment because they are still on a part Newstart allowance and are taking up part-time work. If that job does not pan out—which sometimes does happen, for a variety of reasons—then they can come back again and get another advance. They are not restricted to one a year if they are going into that stage in their lives when they are trying valiantly to take a succession of part-time jobs to get back into the work force properly again. I think it is a pretty fair kind of thing—fair to the taxpayer and fairer to the person than what is currently provided with the employment payment which we are proposing now to abolish with the introduction of this measure.

The crisis payment is a very important initiative. It will provide a person eligible for income support with a non-refundable payment that is equal to one week of extra payment to which they would otherwise be entitled. Examples which would qualify a person for the crisis payment include where they have been released from jail or they have been forced to leave home as a result of an extreme circumstance such as domestic violence. The payment in part recognises the costs incurred by a person who has to re-establish a new home.
It is vitally important for those two groups of people—somebody fleeing from domestic violence or somebody released from jail—to be provided with a hiatus by their opportunity to access income support from Centrelink or to go into a job. The advice I have had is that, quite frequently, this is when you get petty crime, with people without any money at all trying to quickly get themselves a bit of spare cash. I know women are very delighted to hear of this crisis payment. I have been talking to women around the country and they think it will be a godsend for people fleeing from violence.

One Nation believes that mandatory imprisonment and severe punishment for offenders involved in violent crimes, organised crime and drug trafficking are essential. The protection of our citizens and the prevention of repeat offences should be of the utmost concern and be foremost in the determination of appropriate sentencing. Lengthy custodial sentences should be the only reward for those offenders. We must protect our society.
Over 25 per cent of prisoners admitted to Queensland jails are fine defaulters. It is expensive and counterproductive to jail these offenders. In the light of that in Queensland, the National-Liberal coalition has introduced a private member's bill that reflects one of One Nation's policies, that fine defaulters should be kept out of jail. Further, they should have their income or social security garnisheed at its source, to ensure the fine payment. In case of extreme hardship, they should be sentenced to community service.
By not jailing fine defaulters except as a last resort, it is anticipated that in Queensland there would be a saving of approximately $12.6 million from the Corrective Services budget. It costs the state taxpayers in Queensland approximately $45,000 per annum to incarcerate a prisoner. In Queensland, Pauline Hanson's One Nation state parliamentarian 
 teams have been influencing the government's simplistic policies to bring them up to date with the expression of the will of the people. It comes as no surprise that we have to implement simplistic policies in this chamber that are obviously driven by economic expediency and not by the needs of a particular disadvantaged group within our community.
This government is proposing to halve the allowance currently provided for newly released prisoners. This crisis payment was introduced to provide some assistance to persons who had a very high level of need. This help was in the form of a current special benefit prison release payment, which twice provided a one-week payment. This payment was designed to assist newly released prisoners to obtain accommodation and transport facilities and to meet living expenses while integrating into the community. The proposed one-off crisis payment, being a one-week payment, provides less financial assistance.
A research program was conducted recently in Queensland by the Prisoners Legal Service Inc., and I congratulate them on their work and their findings. The Prison and Debt project was designed to inquire into the effects of imprisonment on the debt levels of prisoners and to ascertain the nature and extent of any flow-on social or criminological effects of indebtedness in the prison population to families and prisoners in the wider community. The project's desired outcome was to identify and remedy the detrimental effects of imprisonment on prisoners' debt levels. The project identified that debt levels for prisoners increase while they are in jail and that their debts frequently rise to such levels that they cannot repay them or effectively manage them upon release. A key finding of the report was that 49 per cent of those interviewed admitted to committing further crimes upon release, in order to repay burgeoning debt.
The report identified that most prison sentences served in Australia are short. The Prisoners Legal Service identified that over 21 per cent of people serve less than three months. Sentences this short can, however, have serious ramifications, including the loss of job, home, car or all personal possessions 
 with the growth of debt. Debts of imprisonment are often additional to debts that prisoners are already experiencing difficulties with or cannot repay. It is worth reminding the Senate that 25 per cent of prisoners are fine defaulters. It is reasonable that a proportion would have paid their fines, if finances had been available. So we have a cat chasing its tail.
The community suffers by the release of significant numbers of prisoners with an unpaid level of debt, a debt they cannot repay. The effect is in terms not only of a possible increase in the crime rate but of an increase in the number of despairing citizens who may not commit a crime but are forced to live on the edge of society. These are the people who prick our conscience when we leave our restaurants or shows and see them cold, lonely and hungry, wandering the streets.
Many of the simplest of remedies, if implemented, will contribute to ensuring that the families of prisoners are enabled to maintain a stable family unit. A newly released prisoner deserves to be given an opportunity to return to society with the means to regain their dignity. They deserve to be given a chance to overcome their punishment and to reunite with their family's lives.
A case study by the Prisoners Legal Service in Queensland demonstrates why One Nation has a policy committed to keeping fine defaulters out of jail. I wish to relate this case study. A single parent with a two-year-old child was left struggling to pay three loans, for a car, furniture and a housing loan bond. She obtained part-time work but did not declare it on her benefit form and kept drawing her full benefit. When Centrelink became aware, she began to pay back the money, selling her TV and stereo and falling behind in other bills. She was charged with fraud and, by the time she fronted the court, she had paid all the money back to the government. She received a three-month sentence and was taken immediately to the watchhouse. Her mother cared for her son, but relations between mum and the daughter were strained. 
Prisoners are not allowed to phone government departments from jail. She incorrectly received two further payments from Centrelink but was unable to call them from jail to cancel the payments. Her flat was broken into when she was in jail. Intruders lived in the flat for about three weeks, gaining access to her bankcard signature and thereby withdrawing her Centrelink overpayments. They trashed the flat and left a large phone bill. On release from jail, this lady had a debt to Centrelink and a debt to the Department of Housing and owed money for gas, electricity and telephone. The chances of being reunited with her son were minimal, as she could not obtain a private flat to rent.
Do not think that One Nation is going soft on crime. We are not. We firmly believe that perpetrators of heinous crimes deserve to have the law book thrown at them. The rights of the victims and their families must be taken into account during sentencing. We firmly believe that prisoners should face punishment, restitution and rehabilitation in that order. However, state governments continue to jail fine defaulters. We are only exacerbating an already untenable position. These sentences create disastrous changes in many people's lives, including the loss of jobs, homes and personal possessions. Increasing debt levels make the punishment out of all proportion to the debt. Then the federal government withdraws the little support it was offering.
The Catholic Prison Ministry states that they believe that people will usually make the choice to live a lawful lifestyle when they are supported in an environment affirming their self-worth and providing for their basic needs. The crisis payment at its current level goes some way towards assisting newly released prisoners, who have paid their debt through their time in jail, to be given some opportunity to successfully move back into society.
The government's approach always seems to be based on how they can save money—which group is the least vocal and least respected in the community; where is the little Aussie who can be squeezed a little more tightly? The upper crust hardly have to worry about the potential of re-offending as they live in blue ribbon seats and are insulated 
 from this problem. The average Aussie, however, must take it on the chin, grin and bear it and then grizzle as insurance companies refuse to re-insure their properties. I would invite senators to stay in homes in Goodna and Darra where insurance companies have refused to insure vehicles, homes and contents. We have a government whose only intervention is to decrease the level of support available to a newly released prisoner so that they can integrate back into the community.
Let Pauline Hanson's One Nation point out some costs. We need effective strategies that could lessen the distress caused by those who are incarcerated. This government seems to only know how to slash and burn and allocate funds to those most disadvantaged. On introduction into jail it would make sense for Centrelink to provide all prisoners with a form to be filled out by those receiving benefits thus advising of their sentence. Thereby, Centrelink would avoid paying funds incorrectly and would avoid incurring the cost of reclaiming those payments. Centrelink would allow three months breathing space for prisoners after release before commencing to deduct payments from them in order to facilitate a smooth transition into mainstream life. The Child Support Agency could provide prisoners with a form to be filled out by those with a debt to CSA advising of the sentence, thereby saving the tax department unnecessary costs in catching the defaulters.
These recommendations are just some commonsense approaches provided in the excellent report of the Prisoners Legal Service in Queensland. We cannot and will not support any cutback in crisis payments to newly released prisoners. Unlike some in the government, we continually care for those in need. We want to see them given a chance to retain their self-esteem and self-worth. We do not want to see more displaced, homeless Australians.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—I can see that Senator Harris has his heart in the right place for prisoners. Unfortunately, a lot of his speech and certainly his allegations were ill 
 founded. There are no savings at all in this proposal. We are not halving the allowance, as he said. In fact, the amount of money going to the prisoners remains the same. We are bringing it forward so that they have it when they come out of jail. It is a benefit to prisoners. It is helping them.
They get three weeks pay as they did before, but before they got it after they got out of jail. Now they will get one week as they go out of jail and two weeks as soon as they have signed on the dotted line. If they are in real hardship they can get an advanced payment. I am sorry, Senator, but I am afraid some of the things you said were based on a misunderstanding.
If you doubled the rate of the crisis payment for all people, it would cost nearly $2.4 million a year. If you simply did it for prisoners you would be up around $500,000 on top of what is paid now. There is no way that we are trying to cut money to the prisoners. We believe that the society is not served by having prisoners leave prison with no money to buy food or get shelter. That is why we are introducing the measure. We are bringing the payment up front so that they get it earlier.
I am distressed that you would think that that is what we are doing. It is a beneficial measure. It is a beneficial measure for, say, people whose homes have been caught in a bushfire and who suddenly need an immediate payment. It is a beneficial measure for people who are escaping domestic violence. I would have thought you would have endorsed it wholeheartedly. It is a new measure, but it is not cutting any money from the prisoners. It is bringing their payment forward so that they do not leave jail without anything in their pocket to buy a bus fare.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-22,"—The Democrats agree with a lot of what Senator Harris said and the intent of his amendment. The government should be congratulated for introducing a crisis payment. It is extending much needed assistance to a fairly small group of people, but, nonetheless, a group of people who will very much benefit from the measure. Sometimes we deal with measures that only deal with a small group of people and may seem fairly insignificant in 
 the scheme of things, but for that small group of people and those individuals it can make an enormous amount of difference. The fact that the numbers are not huge should not detract from that.
I would like a bit more clarification from the minister in relation to the way things operate currently for released prisoners, as opposed to how things will operate under this new crisis payment. I have received representations from the Welfare Rights Network about the impact of this measure on prisoners. I am not criticising the positive aspects of the measure in relation to other people, but certainly they had concerns that it would lead to a disadvantage for some newly released prisoners compared to their current situation.
The excellent report Senator Harris quoted extensively from is one that bears close study. It is an important area. I am not sure I would agree with the full thrust of all of Senator Harris's rhetoric about prisoners and our jail system, but his concerns and the concerns put forward by the Queensland Prisoners Legal Service are very important. Regardless of your views about crime and punishment and law and order, I think everyone in the community would recognise, even from a self-interest point of view, that it is totally counterproductive to release people back into the community in a situation where they are in extreme hardship or very pressing debt. A very small amount of extra assistance at that time when they re-enter the community can save an enormous amount of money down the track by making it less likely that they will re-offend and more likely that they will have an opportunity to re-establish themselves in the community. Obviously, that is not only in their interests but in the interests of the entire community.
So the principle that Senator Harris outlined is one that I wholeheartedly agree with. Personally, I think where necessary, extra assistance should be provided to released prisoners over and above others for the reason I just outlined—that it is in the community's interest to ensure people are able to get back on their feet as effectively as possible. It is in no-one's interests to have people re-offend or go into a situation of poverty. Indeed, it is 
 never in the community's interests to have anyone in ongoing and entrenched poverty.
Just returning to the issue of how the system works now: my understanding—which the minister can correct and I am sure will correct if it is incorrect—is that currently people can receive the special benefit prison release payment, which is designed to provide immediate cash assistance. That recognises that newly released prisoners can incur delays in obtaining employment or social security payment, and it provides up to one week of payment of special benefit at twice the normal rate. That is my understanding of how things are able to operate now, whereas the proposed one-off crisis payment contained in this schedule will provide only one week's payment at the normal rate. That is where Senator Harris was coming from in suggesting that they will get half of what they currently get now.
That is my understanding from what I have been advised. If that is the case, then certainly I would be supportive of Senator Harris's amendment—for the reason of restoring the situation as well as for the broader reason that it is in the community's interest to provide extra assistance for released prisoners to some extent over and above the detail that I have asked about now.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—I just double-checked in case I had in any way misunderstood or misled anybody. The fact is, as I told Senator Harris, the level of assistance available to released prisoners claiming a social security allowance will not change under the new arrangement—the level of assistance is three weeks pay for three weeks. The difference is when they get it. Released prisoners will get the equivalent of three weeks payment in the first fortnight after release, as they do currently. They will get the crisis payment plus one week's pension or benefit when they are released, with the remaining week's pension or benefit at the end of the first fortnight. Pensioners who are released from prison will receive the same level of assistance as allowees.
Senator Harris, you may be interested to know why this was necessary. With the New South Wales truth in sentencing legislation, prisoners can now be released at midnight, and this will prevent the hardship that is occasioned by people being put outside the jail door with no money at all. You made the suggestion in your speech about filling in a Centrelink form, et cetera. When we were in opposition, we found that the previous government did not know people were in jail and were continuing to pay them—sometimes for years. That obviously was not a system that could continue and, as part of our major effort against fraud and ensuring compliance in the social security system, we introduced data links and exchange of information with the corrective services around Australia so we could prevent that happening. Prior to that, the Commonwealth did not know when people were in jail. Now we have the ability to get this money to people earlier than previously. We are not changing the level of money that they are entitled to.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-09-22,"—Thank you, Minister, for conveying that the government's intention was to move towards ensuring that these payments did not continue while prisoners were in jail. As I explained earlier, unfortunately it is still happening. So if there is a form that is supplied by Centrelink, we need to go back and look at that process. In this lady's case, her predicament was that not only was she paid those two payments while she was in jail but somebody accessed her flat, accessed her cards and actually withdrew that amount. So the reality is that the problem still exists at this time and that definitely needs addressing.
To come back to the reason for the amendment that we have moved, it has been clearly indicated to us, not only by the Catholic Prison Ministry but also by other people that we have spoken to, that on their reading of the bill the prisoners will be disadvantaged.
—They will not be disadvantaged.
—I appreciate the minister saying that they will get one of the payments earlier, and I commend the government for that. But it will also leave the 
 prisoners in a situation where, two weeks out of jail, they will have a longer period while they are waiting for another payment. I still commend the amendment to the chamber, based on the understanding of both the Catholic Prison Ministry's interpretation of this bill and the interpretation of other agencies that we have discussed the issue with.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—I would like to very briefly say that I am disappointed that the people who came to you do not appear to have come to me; I might have been able to explain this to them. They are labouring under a misapprehension, and they have obviously advised you accordingly. People will not in any way be disadvantaged, either in level of payment or in timing of receipt of payment. They will be advantaged; it is solely to their benefit. I am disappointed that they have misread that. That is the fact of the matter.
If you have any examples of where the connection between information going from the state corrective services department to Centrelink is not working properly or where there is some associated crime being committed as a result of somebody being in jail, you might come and talk to me about it to see whether there is anything that we can do to make the system even better.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-22,"—At the risk of breaking my duck, I indicate that the opposition are inclined to support the government and oppose the request on the basis of the explanation given by the minister, which was that the level of funding under the crisis payment arrangements will not disadvantage prisoners and that they will get money earlier to assist in their transition. On that basis, while I appreciate the points Senator Harris made, we are inclined to accept the government's argument that they have adequately dealt with those concerns under the schedule dealing with the crisis payment. We will be voting with the government on this occasion.

—We now move to Democrat 
 amendment No. 2 on sheet 1544. The question is that schedule 5 stand as printed.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-22,"—I would like to speak to this schedule and indicate the reasons why the Democrats are opposed to it. It relates to the newly arrived residents waiting period, which is a topic that I have spoken on a number of times in this chamber over the last couple of years. I will not go into a fully-fledged storm of outrage. As I said earlier on, I try to approach social security issues and immigration issues—this one combines the two—in a non-inflammatory way, although I must say that this particular aspect of the two-year waiting period is one that I do have a bit of trouble retaining a dispassionate approach to, because I find it one of the more distasteful aspects of social security policy over recent years. The measure itself is only a small aspect of that, and there is an argument of consistency in relation to the measure which the government has put forward to promote consistency in the application of the waiting period. It relates to applying the newly arrived residents waiting period to aspects of the Health Insurance Act and health care cards.
Whilst it might not sound like a particularly significant thing, it is a measure that will, according to the explanatory memorandum, in a couple of years time save around $13½ million. As I repeatedly point out, saving taxpayers' money is a good thing. But taking assistance away from people in need is not a good thing. In many aspects, this whole issue of the two-year waiting period is a false economy. Not providing assistance to people when they are first settling in the country can make it a lot more difficult for them to establish themselves and can often lead to greater cost, not just to the public purse but to the social fabric down the track.
The two-year waiting period is a measure that the Democrats have consistently opposed, and we continue to oppose it. I know that the ALP initially opposed the measure, and it came into being through the support of Senator Harradine. At one stage an attempt of mine to repeal it was unsuccessful because of the vote of Senator Harradine. We had a brief Senate committee inquiry into it, by which 
 time we came back here and I had another attempt at repealing it; Senator Harradine had been convinced but unfortunately the ALP had ceased to be convinced. So once again the measure remained in place. That was a source of some disappointment to me, I must say, but obviously I did not argue quite as expertly as I thought I had. Perhaps I had assumed, given Labor's previous support for the position of removing the two-year waiting period for special benefits, that that position would be retained.
In the Senate committee inquiry, the ALP produced a suggestion, which I think was repeated here in this chamber, that there would be a need to review the two-year waiting period and its impacts after a couple of years. That couple of years has now passed and we certainly think that it would be a good idea to assess more broadly the impact that the two-year waiting period is having across the board.
Certainly a lot of information has been provided to me from people who are working out in the community with migrants that it is having a significant negative impact—it is generating hardship for a number of people, for a number of families. Again, that number may not be huge but, for those who are suffering hardship as a result of this measure, telling them that they are only a small number does not really help them very much. It is still a measure that is causing very significant suffering, and I think it sends out some very unhelpful messages more broadly about some of the stereotypes about migrants coming here to go on social security and bludge off the Australian community and things like that—some of those more distasteful suggestions that are voiced on this issue from time to time. I think this measure gives implicit support to some of those comments from other people.
The Democrats continue to be very concerned about the impact of the two-year waiting period. This schedule has only a small impact on that in terms of its extension to health related issues. I will refrain from moving another amendment to try to change the two-year waiting period to enable access to special benefit because I can reasonably 
 assume what the outcome would be in the chamber. Nonetheless, I indicate that the Democrats' concerns are still as strong as ever.
I urge all other parties to reconsider this issue in terms of the actual impact it is having on people in this community. As I say, with this schedule in particular—the specific measure we are opposing—it is another $13½ million of assistance in health issues which can be amongst the most important areas of need for people in the community. Oftentimes they can find a way of getting by in terms of income but those extra health costs, particularly if they have children, can really make the difference. I am assuming that the Democrats will be unsuccessful in getting this schedule deleted from the legislation, but I urge all parties to keep considering this issue and the real impact that it is having on families out in the community at the moment.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—Very briefly, I will respond to Senator Bartlett. Most of his contribution was directed to the wider issue of the two-year waiting period generally. The schedule that we have before us now relates purely to New Zealanders. If the Democrats were to be successful in their opposition to this schedule, it would mean that, despite an agreement between the governments of New Zealand and Australia, Australians would have to serve a two-year waiting period in New Zealand for benefits in New Zealand but New Zealanders coming here would be able to access benefits straightaway.
I do not think that is something the Australian community would think was fair. We see it as fair that all migrants or anybody coming to live in our country should be treated the same unless they are refugees or humanitarian migrants. This has been negotiated between the two governments so that there is equal treatment of the citizens of both countries in each of the countries. I am surprised that the Democrats would want to have Australians treated one way in New Zealand and New Zealanders able to access benefits straightaway in Australia. The government does not 
 support the Democrats' opposition to this schedule at all.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-22,"—I wish to oppose schedule 9. This is the changes the government proposes to the liquid assets test. Schedule 9 tightens the rules under which people can be precluded from receiving social security benefits for up to 13 weeks on the basis of their liquid assets. The schedule provides that a person who is engaged in full-time study cannot be regarded as unemployed for the purpose of the liquid assets test waiting period. The changes will have the effect of making an individual wait up to an additional 13 weeks for unemployment benefits if they elect to study before seeking employment. If someone makes the decision to study, they may face a maximum waiting period of up to 26 weeks rather than just 13 weeks if they decide to go straight on to unemployment benefits. We see this as a disincentive to study and acquire new skills and we have much the same concerns as we did about the education entry payment.
I understand what the government's rationale is but, as we understand it, the provision will deny 2,500 Newstart recipients access to the allowance and about 60 sickness allowance recipients access in a year. These are people who might otherwise be caught by the government's proposal and be denied access to the allowances. It seems to us that there is no question of double dipping here. It is a question of whether you provide encouragement for people to study and not put potential barriers in the way of people moving from study to employment or to seeking employment.
We think that the impact of this measure is to actually make it less attractive for people to seek to study and puts another barrier or consideration in their way in terms of them seeking to study and then seeking to join the work force. We do not think that disincentive is a good thing. We think the current provision is a better way of treating students moving between study and the work force. We do not think the government's proposition is good policy, and we will be opposing it. We would be better off leaving the current situation as it is and allowing students to move from study to employment without this further barrier.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—Since the liquid assets test was previously before the parliament, we have found that the way the legislation has been interpreted by the tribunals means that it is not being applied consistently. As a result of that, schedule 9 is to provide consistency across payment types, which seems a pretty fair way of approaching something. We in this chamber do not generally endorse payments or add-ons to payments being treated in different ways or special conditions for payments being very different across payment types. This measure simply ensures consistency in the application of the liquid assets waiting period. In addition, a person transferring from Austudy payment to a Newstart allowance would not normally have to serve a liquid assets test waiting period, because they would be considered to have been in receipt of an income support payment for a continuous period. The government therefore do not intend to support the opposition's proposal to oppose schedule 9.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-22,"—The Democrats are also concerned with the impact of schedule 9. It is, again, small in the scheme of things—$1.5 million in a couple of years time—but it will have an impact on some individual people. It often seems to be the case when we are rationalising inconsistencies and providing for uniform treatment that it ends up being a savings measure rather than a cost, and this is another example of that. More broadly, the Democrats' view is that this provision will act as a disincentive to study by increasing the amount of time that people who undertake study will have to wait to access income support. As is frequently said by people from all parties in this chamber, providing incentives for people to undertake education is a very important aim. This measure will act in the opposite direction and, for that reason, the Democrats will not support it.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—I recognise 
 that I am not going to win this vote, and it is a pity. In our view, a loophole has now been opened by virtue of a decision. It will be used by more people now that it is available. This schedule was an attempt to close that loophole. I point out that an AAT decision recently held that a person could be unemployed while undertaking a full course of study. The effect of that decision for Newstart claimants is that education leavers with liquid assets in excess of the established limits can avoid the application of the liquid assets test waiting period despite having significant liquid assets. To me, that is a nonsense, and I would have thought most Australians would have thought it was a nonsense too. I am disappointed that the parties in this chamber are prepared to see a loophole open that will only be pushed wider as it becomes known. Nevertheless, I hear the views of the other parties.

"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-09-22,"—In opposing schedule 10, I cannot support a pensioner education supplement amendment that so callously removes what is in reality a small payment to some of the disadvantaged members of our community. It has been identified that 97 per cent of the greatest losers will be sole parents. The remaining losers will be carer payment recipients. The government always commends itself on caring for carers but then, in the next breath, it removes a small benefit from a group of people who are prepared to stay home to look after their loved ones. I cannot support a motion that primarily removes from support for sole parents an opportunity to improve their mental or physical wellbeing and, in doing so, prepare for their future and for the future of their children.
It would appear the Liberal Party's economic rationalists are at it again in what will be a short-term gain for the government's coffers—approximately $6.5 million in 2001-02—and long-term pain for the people who will eventually be required to move back into the work force. Those people will find their skill levels seriously depleted in an environ 
 ment that all sides of politics agree is changing rapidly, particularly with our new technology. The irony is that, in the long term, governments will pay more, as they will have to offer training and educational opportunities for those who will now be both long-term unemployed and unskilled.
The government is saying that, if you study only 25 per cent to 50 per cent of a full-time course, your costs are automatically halved. Depending on the course, you may well find that you still have to travel as many days as you did previously. Your books can vary significantly in cost from subject to subject, but you will still need to the same amount of books and, as of 1 July, you will also have to manage a goods and services tax. The funds are not designed to provide a pat on the back for using your initiative and pursuing further education whilst forced to stay at home. They were to assist—and I stress the word `assist'—in keeping your skills, knowledge and abilities to a level that works towards keeping you work ready.
The skills obtained from further educational opportunities also provide social and emotional benefits. Single parents and carers in particular often become isolated from mainstream society. Educational opportunities provide these community members with an ability to mix with others both older and younger than themselves. It is not unusual to find that students find new support networks that can assist them in developing new parenting, caring and recreational outlets that assist in maintaining a healthy mind and body.
The reduction of payments to part-time students who study between 25 per cent and 50 per cent of the full-time course demonstrates a lack of commitment by the government to provide worthwhile educational opportunities to all members of the community. It demonstrates simplicity in the way this determination has been made in that part-time study does not necessarily equate to a lesser amount of outlay for the student. It impacts on those people whom this government has indicated it particularly cares about—that is, the carers. It does nothing to support sole parents who have a genuine desire to either keep their skills up to date or improve their 
 skills in many areas, including work, parenting and social skills. For this reason, I will not support the schedule.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—The pensioner education supplement measure will amend the rate of payment to better reflect the study load being undertaken by a pensioner. It is not a question of economic rationalism; it is just straight commonsense. If you are doing a half load, you do not get a full-time supplement. If you are doing a full-time load, you get a full-time supplement. Pensioners on a study load of 50 per cent or greater will continue to get the full rate of PES, which is $60 a fortnight, while pensioners undertaking a study load of between 25 per cent and 50 per cent will get the half rate of PES, which is $30 a fortnight.
The pensioner education supplement for disability support pensioners and veterans affairs pensioners will remain unchanged. In passing, I suggest that people who are getting income support as a parenting payment (single) or carers who are getting a carers payment would, one would presume, find it pretty difficult to take on a full-time study load and still maintain their caring role. I think the reality is that a large proportion of people would in fact be taking a half load or maybe even less because the role of carer is very demanding. It is unrealistic to think that you can take on a full study load and be a full-time carer at the same time.
The government are very supportive of carers, as Senator Harris has acknowledged. In each budget since we came into government, we have done things that needed to be done to help carers. We continue to have a very keen concern for them. Carers and people on parenting payment (single) can also get access to the JET scheme—the Jobs, Education and Training scheme—which helps people get the skills to get into the work force, to get off welfare dependency, to be self-sufficient and to have the dignity of being self-reliant. The government are totally committed to the concept of people being able to improve their state, educational ability and 
 skills. We just think it is pretty rational—if that is what economic rationalism is—for people to be paid for the amount of study that they are doing. That is what this reflects. It reflects the amount of study against the amount of supplement. At the same time, people are still getting their full pension payment in social security. There is no effect on that. I think it is a very reasonable thing to do. I think the taxpayer would, too.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-22,"—This section deals with the pensioner education supplement, which is a non-taxable supplementary payment of $60 per fortnight for pensioners who qualify as either full-time students or concessional study load students. It is designed, as I understand it, to assist pensioners towards financial independence through participation in education courses. It is another incentive towards education. The government is proposing to cut that payment to $30 for those who have only a part-time study load. Whilst it may seem logical on the surface that you get half the payment if you are doing half the study, I do not see this payment as operating in that way. I see it as a basic incentive payment for pensioners, regardless of their study load, to undertake education.
If you are going to apply a pure logic principle, I cannot see the purely rational reason why the government is exempting disability support pensioners from this measure. It has said that it is in recognition that people have less capacity to increase their study loads in response to this change. That may be the case. For the reasons the minister just outlined, I am sure many carers would also have difficulty in increasing their study loads in response to this change. I cannot see any simple logical reason why disability pensioners should retain the full payment despite studying part time while other pensioners now have their payment cut in half. My understanding is that this will impact on nearly 8,000 recipients of the pensioner education supplement. I cannot see a reason why that payment should be reduced. It would clearly provide less assistance in the purpose that the payment was designed for, which is to assist pensioners to undertake education.
It seems to me to be basically a cost cutting measure that will hit the pensions of sole parent pensioners and carers. The Democrats believe that we need to be doing all we can to assist people in undertaking education. This will reduce the income of a significant number of people by $30 a fortnight for a reason that seems fairly flimsy to me. The Democrats will be joining Senator Harris of One Nation in opposing this schedule.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-22,"—I must say that I am a bit torn on this proposal. I think it is fair to say that the Labor Party accept that there is a sound basis for the sort of approach the government has adopted. If you look at the Austudy pensioner education supplement that the payment is being based on in terms of the study load, it has a basic logic to it—that the commitment given to study will be dependent, and the costs associated with it will be dependent, in part on the amount of study undertaken. So we have an inclination to say that there is some sense to that. We obviously have had a great deal of criticism of the government's approach in terms of support for sole parents and the cuts to JET and what we see as the government's under-utilisation of work in that regard.
—There has been an expansion of JET—it has been expanded.
—You made early budget cuts to JET, Minister. As I understand it, Centrelink is not meeting its targets for the number of participants in the scheme, after the government's cutbacks. So we do think the government needs to do better in support for sole parents who are making the transition from welfare to work. The Labor Party is concerned to have a much better strategy for that transition, particularly for sole parents, so I have some sympathies with the concerns raised about this being a measure that seems to be cost cutting rather than achieving any great benefit for those seeking to undertake study.
On balance, the Labor Party has agreed to support the government's position because of the rationale of having the allowance based on a connection with the amount of study undertaken—that is, a payment that is made 
 in recognition of the costs associated with that study. I think Senator Bartlett raised a question which I was going to raise that I would appreciate the minister answering, and that is the question about the disability support pension and why that is treated differently. I would like to understand the government's rationale for that. It is clear in the explanatory memorandum that that is exempted and I am not quite sure that I understand why. The minister adds that there is also a second exemption for veterans. I think it would be useful, both for me and for the record, for the government to explain the rationale for that. On balance, the Labor opposition will not be opposing the schedule.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-22,"—Essentially, the thinking behind the exemptions was that it is often very difficult for people with disabilities to undertake a full-time study load. From memory—I could not vouch for this for certain because it is a while since I looked at the detail of this—a fairly small proportion of people who had disabilities were taking a full-time load, and this was coupled with the fact that they usually have greater costs in accessing a service like education. I think that was the main reason for the exemptions.
—And the veterans?
—I think part of the rationale there was largely that they tend to be older people who also frequently have problems with mobility. It concerned only those veterans who were recipients of the invalidity service pension or invalidity income support supplement paid under the veterans' act. So it was very much focused on people's invalidity.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-09-22,"—It is pleasing to note Senator Newman's recognition of the impact of the workload on carers and single parents, but I would still like to highlight the outcome of what the government are intending to do. First of all, in reality, it is going to become a disincentive to people who have this heavy workload of caring for their children or a close relative to embark on these educational 
 programs. As a result of that, in the long term the costs will be greater to the government. If they had provided this extra assistance to these people and helped them to be able to further their education while they were carers or while they were single parents, these people would be in a far better position to enter the work force at the end of that period. I believe that, while the government may be making some short-term gain in implementing this reduction, in actuality they are creating a higher cost in the long term.
It is therefore very difficult to understand the rationale and the compassion of the government in reducing this payment to these people. They obviously need all the incentives that we can give to assist them to keep up with the changes in technology. These changes are immense now and I believe they will continue to have a more substantial impact on a person's ability to become re-employed. Therefore, I believe the government is, in actuality, being short-sighted in moving this reduction in assistance.
—The question is that schedule 10 stand as printed.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—We now move to government amendment No. 17 on sheet FC206 revised.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-09-22,"—Today I propose to speak in a continuing debate on the topic of regional development in Australia. When I last spoke on this area, I was speaking about the need for us to move to a system in this country where regions are given assistance to lift themselves up by their bootstraps. The research shows that, rather than top-down assistance on a massive scale as we saw under the Whitlam government with the creation of the failed growth centres concept, what will work a lot better across regional Australia—and in particular in smaller centres which are struggling in such difficult economic circumstances—is an approach where their leadership is developed and honed towards growing their own economies. The role of government in that case is one of assisting that leadership 
 and those attributes of a particular area to develop.
Last time I was talking about the town of Walcha on the New England in New South Wales and how government decisions, state and federal, could mean the difference between the death of that town and dynamic, robust growth. Today I want to start by talking about another small centre, Hamilton, in western Victoria, before going on to looking at a wider region. I visited this area several weeks ago at the invitation of David Hawker who is the member for Wannon. He wanted me to visit in particular the educational facilities in his area. However, I actually managed to get an overview of the area. It is a very interesting contrast to see the ways in which different types of government assistance over time have impacted on the western Victorian district.
One of the major intervention impacts was in the early 1980s when the then government supported the establishment of the Alcoa aluminium smelter in that region at Portland. The problem with that project was that the government had taken power from the eastern Gippsland area and taken it right across to western Victoria. It was good for regional development in that area, but it raises a question about major government intervention if it then creates a situation that might put a particularly large company at some economic risk.
What people have to understand about the aluminium smelting process is that aluminium is really just solid electricity. There is so much power going into smelting aluminium that the best and most efficient place to put the smelter is very close to the power stations. The reason why the fourth largest aluminium plant in the world is at Tomago in Newcastle is that there are an enormous number of power stations in that area. Down in Hamilton and in that area in western Victoria we had that type of government intervention, but we really need to develop more than that. Governments cannot save the economy of those regions by constantly putting in large projects because often those larger projects employ only a few hundred people. What we need is a more dynamic, sustainable, grassroots, 
 bottoms-up type approach to support the economy in these areas.
I went to have a look at what Hamilton had going for it. It was, in the past, a major wool area in this country. I have been to a number of wool areas; they all seem to claim that they are the home of the world's finest wool, and Hamilton was no exception. But of course the wool industry has fallen on hard times, and in a lot of the wool-growing areas and on a lot of grazing land they are growing blue gum timber. It is a very fast growing timber and gets to full maturity in 12 years. That industry employs people when you plant the trees and it employs people when you cut them down, but it does not employ many people in between. So they need to look at their strengths in this small area—this town of 10,000.
When I met with the people there—I met with the community leaders the night before and then did inspections the next day—I discovered that Hamilton has a tremendous capacity in the area of education. Not only has it got excellent high schools but also it has an excellent interface between education and the rural industry. It has set up training and extension programs for agriculture that not only serve western Victoria but also serve the whole of Australia. The programs are growing out of that area. The RMIT university has established a centre there for the work and projects of the university which could be extended a lot further to provide education on a more comprehensive basis for people in western Victoria. Other universities have set up campuses on such a basis in some of the smaller centres, and when speaking to the people at RMIT we really encouraged them to do further work in that area.
But the fascinating thing about education in that area is the high schools. The high schools in that region are unique in that one is a boarding school—the last one west of Melbourne, so it certainly has a comparative advantage there—and there is a range of high quality private schools. I met with all the principals—again, with the local member, David Hawker—and that seemed to be a necessary catalyst. It was an idea they had thought about for some time, but when we had the meeting all the ideas they had seemed 
 to jell in a cooperative arrangement. So they are going to do cooperative things in marketing, particularly marketing themselves to other countries as an area in regional Australia you can come to to get a high quality high school education and then move on to university. They are also looking at cost sharing in a number of ways, such as across the three schools in subjects that are not in particularly high demand. A number of the languages come to mind: different campuses could offer different languages and then students from the different campuses could, say, attend Indonesian or German or whatever the language class was. You would then get a critical mass in terms of size of class. They are looking at some of the economies in that area. It is a matter of these smaller areas identifying their strengths and then growing those strengths.
I want to move now to a contrasting area. The resource base of the western Victorian area, particularly Hamilton, was fairly light in terms of its diversity. I will move on to one that has terrific diversity and potential, but it has lost many jobs: I refer to the Upper Hunter. With the downsizing of BHP there has been a major focus—by state and federal governments and all sorts of groups—on the Lower Hunter and what is happening there. But in the Upper Hunter there are major problems because of the number of ways in which its economy is adjusting and shifting. It is a very strong economy but it is going through a lot of technological change and a lot of adjustments to our competitive market position.
I want to briefly move through the strengths of the Upper Hunter and the way in which industry is going. Its primary driving force is coal. Coal in the Hunter and the Upper Hunter has a terrifically bright future. This is shown by the fact that the coal loader at Newcastle has been expanded. They would not put $90 million into a new coal loader if they did not think we were going to have increased production. Production will increase, but what is happening is that new mines are opening up and are creating employment but they are high-tech operations and they do not employ as many as the older mines used to employ, and in this highly 
 competitive coal market some of the older, less efficient mines in the same area are shutting down. So you have got mines opening up and mines shutting down, and the net effect is on employment in that, because of high-tech procedures, you have got a drop in the work force.
The second area—and it feeds off the coal mines—is power generation. There are two major power plants in the Upper Hunter, including the very high-tech Bayswater Power Station. Again, power has moved into a competitive market. We are competing particularly with Victoria. One of the effects of creating greater efficiencies in a power station—this has occurred in the last 18 months—is that the number of people it used to take to manage one power station now manage two. The work force has gone from 1,400 to 700 in that time. So that competitive market we have in Australia which is driving down power prices and improving the economy has an effect which we have got to take very much into account—the fact that a smaller, more efficient work force creates an employment problem for us.
The third area—and I now am moving on to areas where government can actually make a bit of a difference—is the area of forestry and timber. The regional forest agreements, RFAs, that have been brought in by the Carr government are shutting down major timber towns across the Hunter Valley—towns like Dungog, places like Bulahdelah. The focus of quite a number of towns was the timber industry and sawmills in those towns. The way the RFAs have been set up means there is not a sufficient supply of timber for many of those towns, and already the mills are shutting down and people are losing their jobs.
This is something that, if we got the balance right in terms of sustainable development in timber, we could actually change. People in the Gloucester area in the Hunter Valley have told me, for example, that they had it set up in such a way that they could log timber and not have to return to the same coup for 200 years. That is a sustainable system. But, for some strange reason, in the RFA process in the Gloucester area they 
 locked up so much timber that it has not become viable for that area—something the state governments certainly could do something about in terms of jobs.
The other area that has been a victim of changing technology and changing markets in the Upper Hunter has been the abattoirs. A high-tech abattoir has been developed at Scone, and that is expanding and doing well. The nearby town of Aberdeen had an older, more inefficient abattoir, which closed with the loss of 450 jobs. This is a one-company town. This was the major job generator in Aberdeen. The state government has tried to come in to assist in various ways, but that abattoir is going to remain closed.
The state government, which has the primary responsibility for regional development, has had great difficulty in responding in an area of very rapid technological change and very rapidly changing markets. We have in the Hunter the Minister Assisting the Premier on Hunter Development, Richard Face. He set up a beyond 2000 Upper Hunter committee which has been running for two years and was publicised widely in the news a few weeks ago. When asked the basic question, `How many new jobs has the committee generated?' his answer was, `None in that area.' That was a very disappointing outcome.
One area that has some hope in the Upper Hunter—and it has tended to have some fluctuations over time—is where federal government involvement occurs with the large military base at Singleton. When I went up to meet the mayors and the general managers I heard that there had been a reduction in activity at the base. But we do have the results before us now of what is actually happening at Singleton, and I am pleased to report that the actual number of training days—because Singleton is a training base—the number of personnel involved, the amount spent, all of those things, are very much on the up at the moment. Given the current military situation, I think that is likely to continue. So, there is that base underlying the Upper Hunter.
The meeting I had with the mayors and with the general managers discussed quite a number of projects. We had a look at some 
 big projects that are coming into the area. The conclusion that we reached, really, was that these create jobs in the hundreds; what is needed is jobs in the thousands. We are only going to get that through involvement and development of small business in that area. In my next speech in this area I will continue with that story.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Australia </title>,Matters of Public Interest,4,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-09-22,"—My question is to Senator Minchin, Minister for Industry, Science and Resources. Is it not the case that, by retaining the R&D tax concession of 125 per cent while reducing the company tax rate to 30 per cent, the government has cut the real value of the R&D tax concession by one-sixth? Given the substantial falls in business expenditure on R&D since your 1996 cut to the R&D tax concession, did your department make any assessment of the implications for business expenditure on R&D of this further cut in the value of R&D tax concession? Will the minister release any such assessment?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Business Tax Reform: Research and Development </title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-09-22,"—Madam Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. I will actually go back to the original question, which the minister failed to address. Did your department make any assessment of the implications for business expenditure on R&D in relation to this further cut? Will the minister release any such assessment? Has your department modelled it?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Business Tax Reform: Research and Development </title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1999-09-22,"—When we came into government we found we had a $10,000 million deficit and massive debt. We also found that we had significant rorting of the R&D tax concession involved in the process of syndication. Unlike the Labor Party, which sat around for 13 years doing nothing, we acted when we came to office both to correct the problems in the deficit and to remove the rorting involved in syndication. That involved a cut in the R&D tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. It was a necessary action to ensure the sharing of the burden of dealing with Labor's incredibly irresponsible approach to the deficit.
I might point out that it costs $300 million annually to restore the 150 per cent tax concession. Labor has not made any attempt to indicate how on earth they are going to find $300 million to put the tax concession back up to 150 per cent. They just blandly 
 say, `Put it back to 150 per cent.' Nowhere do they say how that is going to be paid for.
What we have done is to provide to business the most fantastic reforms of business tax ever in this country, something Labor did not do in its 13 years. We are reducing the company tax rate to 30 per cent—one of the lowest tax rates in our region and one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the developed world. That of itself will provide a very significant incentive to engage in R&D expenditure. I need only quote to you, Senator Conroy, Tony Cutcliff of the Institution of Engineers on the impact of business tax reform. He said:
The business tax reform will result in a rush of foreign money into high technology, more local R&D, more jobs for engineers, a halt to the brain drain and a healthier, more certain climate for domestic investment in start-up companies.
Mr John Mullarvey, Executive Director of the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee, said:
The lowering of the company tax rate to 30 per cent gives companies increased scope to think about medium and long-term benefits of higher investment in R&D and this is essential if we are to encourage more and better linkages between business and our research centres.
What we have put together in this tremendous package that we released yesterday does retain the 125 per cent R&D tax concession. The lowering of the company tax rate and the tremendous reforms of capital gains tax, which the Labor Party has supported, will lead to greater investment in and support for R&D.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Business Tax Reform: Research and Development </title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1999-09-22,"—What is clear from industry surveys and others is that you cannot attribute the recent falls in business expenditure on R&D to the lowering of the tax concession. I am as concerned as anybody to see business expenditure on research and development increase. We are doing as much 
 as we can to bring that about. We are actually increasing the amount that we spend on support for R&D.
What we have seen from survey after survey is that the recent falls in business expenditure on R&D—
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order and it goes to relevance. The minister had four minutes to address the question. He now has a further minute, which is almost up, and he is yet to address the question. The answer that he is giving is not addressing the question. I ask you to direct him to answer the question.
—The minister is entitled to answer the question in the way he sees fit. I presume he is relating it to the issue of R&D announcements.
—Madam Deputy President, what is clear from all the surveys and our work in our own department is that there is no clear evidence that the recent fall in business expenditure on R&D is a function of the lowering of the R&D tax concession to 125 per cent. There are a whole range of reasons why business expenditure on R&D has fallen. One is the low commodity prices in the minerals sector. The minerals industries in Australia are the primary spenders on R&D, and their recent difficulties have obviously led to them spending less on business R&D.

Reasons for Urgency:  The introduction and passage of the above bills in the 1999 Spring sittings is crucial as commencement of key elements of the tax reform package are contingent on these appropriations. They include important elements of the government's compensation arrangements and environmental measures.
Results if bills are not dealt with in these sittings:  Passage of the bills in the Spring sittings would provide greater certainty to community and business regarding the commencement date of the GST and the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-22,"—I rise to speak on the Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999 , which seeks to make a number of amendments to the Aged Care Act 1997. The most significant of these is the inclusion of accommodation charges in the act. We all remember the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, appearing on A Current Affair  to announce the backdown on the government's aged care policy, but we are only now seeing the legislation to implement that backdown.
Until now the accommodation charges he announced have been implemented through subordinate legislation, without the proper scrutiny of parliament. We are now also told that, because of his ad hoc arrangements, residents paying the charge have been denied basic protections. Labor opposed the introduction of the accommodation charge. We had very serious concerns about the equity of requiring pensioners to pay thousands of dollars a year for nursing home care. Those 
 concerns remain. However, as those charges have been implemented, we support any move to introduce better protection measures for residents paying the $12 a day fee. We do have serious concerns that the protections introduced in this bill do not go far enough, and we will be moving amendments to increase residents' rights in relation to accommodation, bonds and charges. The government abrogated its responsibility two years ago by introducing the charges without those protections. 
The bill makes a number of technical amendments to address problems with the act, which include providing for the refund of accommodation charges to residents who were in homes prior to October 1997—honoured only after Labor pressured the government to fulfil its commitments to those residents—ensuring that people were not liable for fees and charges before they have even agreed to move into a facility, clarifying the situation where a person admitted to a facility has a mental impairment, formalising reduced qualifying periods for co-residents, and broadening the definition of `family'. Labor supports all of these amendments. They are a belated attempt to fix up some of the problems with the Aged Care Act—problems that the government has been aware of for more than 18 months now.
Unfortunately for older Australians, while the bill does fix up some of the many technical problems associated with the government's Aged Care Act, many significant problems with the act are not addressed by this bill and will remain. These problems include: difficulties with the government's income tested fee, which has caused significant distress to older Australians and their families and is forcing providers to divert resources away from the care of residents; problems over the use of capital funding in the sector; an inability to appropriately deal with poor providers, including the closure of poor providers and provisions for the investigation of residents' complaints; significant difficulties being experienced by providers with the government's new resident classification scale; difficulties in accessing aged care, as the ratio of places to people aged 70 and over has declined over 
 the last three years and waiting times have increased; a blow-out in the budget for aged care, which has occurred alongside the reduced access because of the government's misdirection of taxpayers' dollars; the continued implementation of the government's coalescence policy, which has been described by the Productivity Commission as inappropriate and inequitable; and providers in some states facing very serious problems arising from workers compensation premium increases without any support from the government, which is resulting in a reduction in the quality of care to residents.
These and a number of other problems have emerged as a result of the failure of the government's aged care reforms. The hasty changes introduced in fright in 1997 are now falling apart. They have reduced access to residential aged care, and they have forced providers to compromise on the quality of care delivered to residents. They are failed reforms. These problems are causing distress to older Australians and their families and, in some cases, are forcing providers to reduce the quality of care delivered to residents. What is inexcusable is that the government has known about these problems for some time, yet it has done nothing to address them.
The two peak provider organisations in the sector have raised serious concerns about the minister's inaction in relation to the issues confronting the industry. A recent journal included a headline article from the chief executive officer of one of those organisations, entitled `Government inactivity', that indicated that `issues currently affecting the operation of the aged care facilities are reaching crisis point.' Uniting Community Services has also stated that the minister's inaction in relation to the comprehensive Productivity Commission report into the nursing home sector is a time bomb and that older Australians deserve better.
This bill provided the government with the perfect opportunity to respond to the concerns of residents and their families and to providers and employees in the aged care sector, yet it has merely sought to recycle an 18-month-old bill that does nothing to fix the many problems that have emerged over the last 18 
 months. Because of the government's inaction, Labor will move amendments to the bill to attempt to address some of the issues facing this sector as a result of the failure of the aged care reforms.
The only reason we are debating this bill today is that Labor put pressure on the government to meet its commitment to residents in nursing homes before 1 October 1997. These residents were promised by the Prime Minister that they would not have to pay the $12 a day accommodation charge, but nothing was done to implement that promise. It was only after pressure from the Labor opposition and questions in the parliament in April that Senator Herron finally committed the government to meeting those commitments to those residents in the 1999-2000 budget.
One and a half years after the government introduced its aged care reforms, the government finally undertook to honour its commitments to them. Unfortunately, many of those residents have since passed away. Because of the government's reluctance to implement its commitments, not one of them has received any refund of the potential millions of dollars they have paid in total in accommodation charges—charges that they should never have paid.
Almost two years after the reforms were introduced, these residents are still required to pay the $12 a day charge. They are still facing financial pressure—pressure to sell their homes and somehow come up with the $12 a day charge when the government has promised they would not have to pay the charge. This is a tragic situation caused by the government's reluctance to act. These residents rightly feel cheated by the government, and the government failed to respond by introducing this bill until June 1999. This, of course, is consistent with its reluctance to debate aged care. The government seems desperate to keep aged care off the political agenda, given the history of losing two ministers in trying to implement these reforms.
I have raised the government's inaction in relation to aged care on a number of occasions in the past. The history of this 
 government's failure in aged care was discussed broadly in the house when this bill was debated in June, and I will not seek to repeat some of that debate today. But the earlier bill that the government introduced was then withdrawn by it. Knowing the problems being experienced by residents and providers, the government chose to drop the bill that sought to fix some of the problems. Facing an election, the government put its own political interests ahead of the interests of aged care residents. Eighteen months later, under pressure from Labor, the government finally sought to introduce legislation when it took the opportunity to recycle the 1998 bill.
The provisions to provide for the refund of accommodation charges to pre-October 1997 residents, inserted at our insistence, are the only major changes to the bill tabled in March last year. Given the history of inaction, it is not surprising that the minister has failed to address a number of significant problems within the Aged Care Act that have become apparent over the last 18 months. In the context of this bill, I will be highlighting just three of the problems now facing the aged care sector: the income tested fee, capital funding and how we deal with poor providers.
In terms of the income tested fee, there have been numerous reports in the media recently about the problems with the government's income tested fee. We have heard that aged care residents are receiving a series of letters from the department, sometimes within a matter of days, each indicating a different level of fee. In one case the department sent three letters to a resident in two days, advising of three different levels of fee. Understandably, residents are confused and upset by this inconsistent advice. Residents, many of whom are pensioners, are rightly distressed when they are then hit with bills for thousands of dollars as a result of the department's confusion.
At the same time, providers are complaining about the complexity of the fee which is requiring more and more staff resources to administer. This means more staff filling in forms and less time caring for residents. These problems flow from the government's bungled implementation of the fee, which was 
 criticised in the recent Audit Office report. That report identifies significant problems with the fee's implementation and ongoing complexity in its administration.
In the face of all these problems, it is not surprising that we have also been getting reports that the department is advising people to divorce to avoid the income tested fee. You know a system has failed when the department's officers advise people to divorce to avoid it. These problems were raised by the sector with the government over a year ago, yet the minister has done nothing to relieve the distress of residents and their relatives. She did not take the opportunity provided by this bill to address those problems. It is just not good enough. Residents continue to receive confusing advice and continue to be upset by large bills for backdated fees that they did not even know they had to pay. Labor calls on the government to urgently introduce legislation to resolve the many problems with the income tested fee and thereby relieve the distress of residents and their families.
I turn to the question of capital funding. A few weeks ago I mentioned an example which graphically demonstrates the failure of the government's arrangements to fund capital improvements in the residential aged care sector. A Victorian nursing home provider closed his facility after it appeared he did little or nothing to improve the infrastructure of the facility. Residents at the nursing home had been paying the government's $12 a day accommodation charge. The Commonwealth had been paying on behalf of other residents the equivalent through the concessional resident supplement.
In total up to $200,000 could have been paid to the provider to fix up the nursing home, yet he was under no obligation to spend any of that money on capital works, and it appeared that he did not do so. Instead he chose to leave the industry and pocket the funds. The minister cannot guarantee residents or taxpayers that one dollar of the $200,000 was actually spent on improving the nursing home.
Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case. In Victoria, in particular, there have been a 
 number of recent instances where aged care facilities have closed their doors. In all these recent cases, the provider has been under no obligation to spend the funds collected from residents through an accommodation bond or charge on capital improvements. In all cases, the provider has been under no obligation to spend taxpayers' money collected through the concessional resident supplement on capital improvements. In all cases, the provider can simply pocket the money and walk away with hundreds of thousands of dollars. This bill does nothing to prevent that circumstance recurring.
While the providers who close down their facilities in these circumstances are few and represent the small minority of irresponsible providers in the system, there are other providers who are using the funds raised through the accommodation bonds and charges to cover ongoing costs. Under the current system, they are perfectly entitled to do so. These providers have the interests of residents at heart and are compensating for a lack of recurrent funding by dipping into their capital funding stream. Unfortunately for the provider, this has long-term consequences as these providers will have little or no means of refurbishing their facilities in five or 10 years time.
The current system is disguising the crisis in ongoing funding that many providers are facing—a crisis that the Productivity Commission identified in its recent report into nursing home funding. Some providers are sacrificing future capital reserves to meet current costs. Accommodation charges were introduced to fund capital improvements. We do the residents, the providers or the taxpayers no favours by refusing to quarantine those funds. I think this highlights a significant failing of the current Aged Care Act.
The funds collected from residents are not quarantined specifically for capital improvements. Attempts were made by both Labor and the Democrats at the time the act was passed to tighten accountability for the use of these funds. However, they were resisted by the government and the current arrangements have proved to be ineffective. At the time Labor raised the very possibility of the situa 
 tion that has unfolded with providers simply incorporating the capital funds into their daily budgets. The minister has proudly produced graphs showing the amounts the new user-pays fees raise and claims that this will meet the capital needs of the sector, but she cannot guarantee that one dollar of that money is actually spent on capital improvements.
Nursing home residents have been told they must find $12 a day to fund the capital development of the aged care sector when many of them simply cannot afford it, and the government has not put any accountability arrangements in place to ensure that the money is directed to improving their accommodation. It must be remembered that accommodation bonds and charges are only half the picture. We know that 47 per cent of residents are not paying any accommodation bond or charge. In this case the Commonwealth pays the provider $12.34 a day through the concessional resident supplement. There is no provision in the current Aged Care Act that defines what that money should be used for. Providers are able to simply pocket that money. This year the Commonwealth will spend $142 million on the concessional supplement, next year it will be $169 million and the year after that $181 million, yet we have put no conditions on how that money should be used. Given that the concessional resident supplement is paid when the resident cannot afford an accommodation bond or charge, the clear intention is that the supplement be used for capital improvement. The Aged Care Act does not reflect that intention. We will move amendments to try to ensure that funds raised from residents through their accommodation bonds and charges are used for capital improvements and that taxpayers' dollars spent on the concessional resident supplement are similarly used for that purpose.
Where a provider closes a facility, forcing residents to relocate to other facilities, the provider will have to ensure that the money is used for those purposes or refund it to taxpayers and residents if it has not been used on capital improvements. A provider should not be allowed to accumulate these funds, knowing that they will close down, do no 
 capital improvements and simply walk away with the money. That is a very real issue as accreditation approaches. The current arrangements encourage providers in this situation to do no capital improvement. Our amendments will require providers to refund any moneys collected through the accommodation bonds or charges or the concessional resident supplement when that money has not been or will not be spent on capital improvements. If a resident pays $12 a day to the provider for that purpose and the provider chooses not to spend that money on improving the facility, the resident is entitled to a refund of the money.
The recent cases in Victoria also highlight another significant problem in the government's Aged Care Act—how to deal with poor providers. The department have indicated to me that there are a small number of providers that they would like to close down but cannot because of difficulties with the act. As a result, the government is now proposing an amendment that will allow for the gradual wind-down of a facility when it wants to revoke a provider's approval to operate. While I can understand the rationale for this amendment, it raises significant issues over the care of residents in a facility that is being wound down and poses real risks to their health. These residents will potentially be left for an extended period in a facility that has been assessed as not providing an adequate level of care. Given the shortage of alternative places in some areas, the resident may have to wait for months as the facility is gradually wound down. In this situation, there is a clear need to ensure that these residents are being appropriately cared for. We should not set up a situation where we leave residents in a facility under the control of a provider who is known to have acted irresponsibly in failing to provide appropriate care to residents.
The problem will only get worse as the January 2001 accreditation deadline approaches and some providers make a decision to leave the industry and make as much money as they can in the process. They will be looking to cut staff hours and reduce the level of care provided to residents. They will be 
 looking to cut back on the quality of food and generally looking to save costs. It has to be remembered that residents are potentially in a very vulnerable position. Some of them may have no relatives within the area to regularly visit them, some may be suffering dementia, all of them are physically frail. I find it appalling that the government is now proposing an amendment to allow a known poor provider to continue to operate for six or 12 months, while the facility is gradually wound down, without providing extensive additional protections for the residents. The provider knows they are being closed down and therefore has every reason to try to extract the most money they can from the facility in the time remaining, which means reducing the quality of care to an intolerable minimum. I have serious concerns about the provisions in the act in relation to the investigation of complaints. Many people have noted the current provisions do not ensure that complaints are promptly and thoroughly investigated. To rely on these provisions in the case where a known poor provider is allowed to continue to operate a facility is inviting disaster. The Labor opposition will move amendments to ensure that the care of residents in this situation is monitored by a departmental officer who will report directly to the minister.
We will also move amendments that seek to protect the interests of employees when a nursing home is closing down. We know of a number of instances where staff have been left owed large amounts of money—termination and leave pay—by providers exiting the industry without meeting their obligations. The department has the ability to prevent the sale of the licence if those debts are not met, and we think it is an important reform to provide for those employees. The government has accepted the need to protect employees in these situations in other industries, and we think it should accept its responsibilities in the nursing home industry as well.
I look forward to contributing in the committee stage of the debate to this important legislation. We have tried to highlight that we do not think this legislation goes far enough as a legislative response to the problems 
 confronting aged care. Many of the problems have not been addressed. We think the government should have a much more comprehensive response to the issues confronting the industry. We will attempt at the committee stage to deal with some of those, but we really do require a more comprehensive legislative response, and we require a government commitment to address the issues in the industry rather than delay, defer and hope that somehow they will go away. There are real problems that need to be addressed, and I urge the government to start being accountable and to start addressing those concerns of the industry.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-09-22,"—The Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999 , which we are considering today, introduces a number of amendments to the Aged Care Act 1997 and the Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Act 1997 to finetune the aged care structural reforms which were introduced in October 1997. In addition, it addresses some administrative and procedural issues which have become evident since that time. It also introduces a number of protection measures for older Australians living in residential aged care facilities, which the Democrats particularly welcome. We are happy to support this bill today.
Since the government first announced its sweeping reforms of the funding and operation of residential aged care facilities in 1996, the Democrats have worked very hard to improve the government's policy reform package. Our goal has always been to ensure that the final package was one which would ensure that the needs of those requiring residential aged care both now and in the future would be met. What we have always wanted is a system which is sustainable while offering high quality care to all Australians, regardless of their capacity to pay.
In determining our position in the aged care debate since 1996 we have carefully weighed up each proposal against its likely impact on the ability of elderly Australians to access high quality residential care and the long-term financial viability of the residential aged care sector. The Democrats gave qualified support to the government's initial aged care reform 
 package, because we understood the urgent need to inject funding for capital maintenance and improvements into residential aged care facilities. We negotiated a number of improvements to the original proposal, including an additional $40 million in subsidies for concessional residents. We wanted to ensure that all Australians could continue to access high quality residential aged care, regardless of their ability to pay for it.
Recently, the Democrats also played a crucial role in paving the way for the introduction of an accreditation system for residential aged care facilities, which was proposed as part of the government's 1996 aged care reform package, with funding for all non-accredited aged care facilities to cease from 1 January 2001. While the majority of aged care providers supported an accreditation process, the details of the legislation were not agreed to until the Democrats brokered a roundtable discussion between providers and the minister. As a result of this meeting, the minister has agreed to address the major concerns of the aged care sector, including making a commitment that residential aged care facilities with up to 19 beds will pay no fee for accreditation, and those with 20 to 25 beds will pay only a tapered fee on an ongoing basis.
The Democrats are proud to have been able to play a central role in resolving the impasse between the government and the aged care providers over the accreditation process for aged care facilities. I believe the introduction of accreditation will be a big step forward for those needing residential aged care. It should lead to continuous improvements in the industry and ultimately a higher standard of care and facilities for older Australians.
On reading the House of Representatives Hansard, I notice that the opposition have used the debate surrounding this bill as yet another excuse to beat up the government on aged care. No doubt, they will turn their attack on the Democrats in the Senate as well. Before the senators in the ALP start with the kind of tiresome rhetoric and half-truths we have heard time and time again, let me just take the opportunity today to remind them that the ALP had 13 years in government to 
 address the problems in aged care, and they did not.
The ALP did virtually nothing, despite the findings of the Gregory report, which was commissioned by the Keating government. The ALP did nothing, despite the fact that its own independent report estimated that approximately $1 billion in today's figures was needed just to get the existing nursing home stock up to scratch. Let us not forget that, when it comes to aged care, the opposition has a very poor record indeed. In fact, it has failed dismally.
Let us also not forget that, going into the last election, the only promise the ALP could come up with in relation to aged care was to abolish all nursing home fees and replace them with $500 million of public money to be paid to the sector over three years. I invite ALP senators here tonight to explain to us exactly how this $500 million was going to meet the current and ongoing funding needs of the aged care sector. In fact, I challenge the opposition to change their approach when it comes to aged care. Perhaps just for this bill, rather than resorting to rhetoric and half-truths to bag everything and everyone on what they have tried to do, why not try something different? Why not use this as an opportunity to tell the rest of us what the ALP aged care policies would be if they were in government?
Before the government gets too complacent from all of this criticism of the opposition's approach to aged care, let me take a few minutes to draw attention to one particular shortfall of the government, and that is the government's lack of response to the findings of the Productivity Commission's report into nursing home subsidies. Despite receiving in January of this year the Productivity Commission's findings that the government's funding index in relation to nursing home subsidies is wrong, the government has failed to give any indication as to when it will respond. We find that unacceptable.
Here, yet again, we have an example of a government setting up its own objective independent body to look into what is to be done in the area of aged care, only to ignore its findings. The whole point of this inquiry 
 was to determine whether the proposed coalescence of nursing home subsidies should proceed or be replaced by another funding methodology. The Productivity Commission did not endorse the government's coalescence proposal. Despite this, in setting nursing home subsidy rates from 1 July this year, the government went ahead with its proposal anyway.
The Democrats call on the government to end the current angst in the aged care sector in relation to this matter today by making it very clear exactly when and how the findings of this report will be responded to. It is worth noting that the findings and recommendations of this Productivity Commission inquiry have wide industry support. The Democrats will continue to work with all of those involved in the aged care sector—both providers and those who represent the consumers of aged care—to achieve an improved level of care for the residents of aged care facilities. As the measures contained in this bill today are supported by all of those involved in the industry, we are happy to support them today too.
The ALP have a series of amendments to this legislation. While the Democrats have some sympathy with the sentiment which obviously lies behind some of those changes, we will not be able to support them, because neither we nor the industry saw them until just a short time ago. As a result, there has been inadequate time for meaningful consultation. Indeed, those whom I have spoken with in the industry have said that they have not had a chance to look at them or consider them in any depth. In fact, they urged us to reject the amendments and not delay the bill.
We will be seeking clarification from the government on some of the issues raised by the ALP's amendments. However, I say to the opposition that they do themselves absolutely no favours when they hand complicated amendments to us—and to the industry—at the last minute. It leaves the Democrats with no choice but to vote against them, because it would be completely irresponsible for us to support changes which may bring with them negative unintended consequences which nobody has had time to consider.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,1999-09-22,"—I rise to speak on the Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999 . I wonder if the government have heard of the International Federation of Ageing and their Declaration on the Rights and Responsibilities of Older Persons. As Ageing International reveals on, page 15 of their fall edition, these include:
12. To obtain health care in order to maintain or regain the optimum level of physical, mental and emotional well being and to prevent or delay the onset of illness.
13. To access social and legal services to enhance capacity for autonomy and provide protection and care.
14. To utilise appropriate levels of institutional care which provide protection, rehabilitation and social and mental stimulation in a humane and secure environment.
15. To exercise human rights and fundamental freedoms when residing in any shelter, care and treatment facility, including full respect for their dignity, beliefs, needs and privacy and for the right to make decisions about their care and quality of life.
One could rightly assume that the government are not listening to the voices of elderly Tasmanians or to the International Federation of Ageing, as a lack of funding in public health and legal aid means that preventable health and legal representation on civil matters are achievable only by the wealthy. Or are they punishing the elderly in Tasmania for the last election result? Nothing else could explain the callous indifference the government is showing to the elderly in need of residential care in my state.
This bill represents inertia on the government's behalf as, after 18 months of representations made, reports given and letters written, it seems that little is getting through. I know numerous letters have been written by Aged Care Tasmania Incorporated outlining the undue pressure any cuts in funding would mean to the Tasmanian aged care industry and, importantly, to those they serve so well.
Reducing the funding to the elderly that need care is not like targeting those on unemployment benefits or other easy targets that make up the daily feeding frenzy on talkback radio. They cannot be labelled as unworthy of 
 assistance or as somehow undeserving. Yet, apart from the minor cosmetic changes, this bill delivers little and, in the case of elderly Tasmanians, does nothing to address the problems raised over the last 1½ years.
This bill had a quasi launch on 5 March 1998, when it was tabled as the Aged Care Amendment Bill 1998. The Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999 that is now being discussed is the old bill with a couple of crisis measures thrown in—and that is about it. What caused the crisis measures, the add-ons, to the original? Was it a result of well set out, planned policy objectives—other than the reduction of $500 million from the sector in 1996-97? The crisis measures were directly related to the government's own `reforms'—a word they use, but I would not—in slash and burn policies that typify this government.
Remember when they wanted to take the family home and then quickly gave it back? Some people were badly hurt by that. This bill partly compensates them with ex gratia payments. It also seeks to stop those that had to pay for not being there. Confusing, yes, but as a direct result of these glorious reforms the elderly had to pay fees for a service they had not received. The complete stupidity of this oversight is a common occurrence in the government's policies. We get used to it, but the frail and elderly should never have to.
This policy also fixes another huge oversight in previous reforms. Currently the government is unable to act on a fraudulent provider without closing the service. These fraudulent providers are currently still operating as, due to the government's ineptness, shonky operators are still running some of the homes.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-09-22,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document. 

I would like to make some comments about the Airservices Australia corporate plan document dated July 1998 to June 2003. I and a number of others, both in this place and in the other place, have been critical of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, and before him Mr Vaile, for their failure to properly deal with a number of important transport matters. There is plenty of evidence to draw on to support that charge.
A report of the House of Representatives entitled Planning not patching, by the Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform Standing Committee, was tabled in November 1997. We are, as yet, to get a government response to that report. We have still not received a response from Mr Anderson to the Tracking Australia report from the same committee. It was tabled in August of last year. The Revitalisation rail report of the rail projects task force was released in April this year, but we have heard nothing yet from Mr Anderson. A key report from the shipping reform working group was completed in April of this year and provided to Mr Anderson. It still sits on his desk. The Hawke review on air safety responsibilities was completed in December of last year—on time—but we have heard nothing.
We are now told that a final BASI report on the class G airspace trial will not be released until the end of the year. The draft was circulated to interested parties for comment ages ago. These are all very important reports that are of vital interest to key transport sectors in this country, but they have all been simply put to one side, just as the interests of rail, sea and air transport in this country have been put to one side by Mr Anderson.
While we on this side of the chamber are expected to argue publicly on behalf of these key sectors of the economy, it is not often that the chair of a public authority openly and stridently criticises his own minister. Things are clearly very bad when that happens. But that is what I discovered when I read the covering letter to the report we are now considering. Firstly, I draw the attention of the Senate to the date of that letter. It was dated 11 February 1999. One could be forgiven for thinking that this report has been 
 sitting somewhere on Minister Anderson's desk waiting for clearance for eight months. Perhaps he could not find it under the other reports.
In his letter that commences the report, Mr Forsyth says that the corporate plan was originally submitted in May last year. After all, the plan does cover the period commencing June 1998, and today's date is 22 September 1999. So it seems that Airservices clearly met its deadline. Mr Forsyth advised Mr Anderson that the original plan had to be withdrawn because it could not reflect the Department of Transport's structural review. That review was completed and provided to the former minister in March 1998. The department met its deadline with the Airservices review, and so I assume that that report just sat around in Mr Vaile's office and then Mr Anderson's office.
Despite so much time passing, because the report is now more than a year late, Mr Forsyth was forced to tell Mr Anderson that it was still incomplete. Mr Forsyth states:
As you are aware, Airservices is in a state of flux because of the government's indecision on some of the planned reforms.
I must say that that was an extraordinary statement for a chair to make in a report to his minister, a report that he knows will be tabled in parliament. It is a statement usually saved for the privacy of a ministerial office.
The fact that Mr Forsyth has reached such a level of frustration gives an insight into the level of frustration the rest of the transport sector in this country is feeling with this minister and this government. Later in the same letter Mr Forsyth tells the minister:
If the government does not deliver on these aspects—
and I interpose here that he is referring to the structural reforms—
momentum will be lost and the reforms will fail. The financial consequences of such a failure will be significant.
It is clear that the desire of the Airservices chairman is for the organisation to be privatised. That would be the view of the government too, if it thought that it could get away with such—

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1999-09-22,"—I was not intending to speak on this report. The report, to a degree, speaks for itself. But some of the things that the previous speaker has mentioned were so outrageous as to require some comment. Of course, Mr Anderson is one of the most efficient ministers of a very large number of very efficient ministers in the government. The work that he does in all aspects of transport is enormous. It is a very complex portfolio and, of course, Mr Anderson has a range of matters to deal with, particularly now with his role as Deputy Prime Minister. But he can be well proud of the work that he has done in the transport area.
Rail reform has gone ahead in leaps and bounds since this government took over. The previous government, the Labor Party government, spoke for 13 years about the things they were intending to do, but of course they never got around to doing anything. Roads, under the Labor regime, went backwards; the disastrous state that many of the roads are in around Australia is the result of something that grew up in the 13 sad years that Labor was in power. In aviation, Mr Anderson has introduced a number of initiatives. He has had a number of very difficult problems to look at, not the least of which being the second Sydney airport, an issue that the Labor Party were never quite able to deal with in the 13 years that they were in government. They kept putting it off and putting it off. Senator O'Brien would well know about those things.
Mr Anderson has perhaps not received the credit he should have for the tremendous job that he did to help reduce transport costs to rural and regional Australia. This came about as a result of the tax reform package, which the Labor Party opposed—a package that was going to reduce substantially the cost of 
 transport for those of us who live in the country.
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I know that the hour is late and that the minister has felt that he has had to come to the defence of this embattled minister; but the issue here is that we are discussing the Airservices Australia corporate plan for July 1998 to 2003. The minister is now starting to talk about the GST and the tax package and its effect on rural Australia, and I really think that that is a very long way from the document that is supposed to be under discussion.
—If I may speak on the point of order, I am actually responding to the previous speaker who was speaking on this report, and I assume that he must have been speaking along the correct lines.
—I rule that the minister is in order.
—The strength of my argument in opposing the point of order was obviously well known to you before I mentioned the words. In response to what Senator O'Brien was saying in suggesting that Mr Anderson was not doing his job—and he went on with a long list of complaints about Mr Anderson—I point out that Mr Anderson is doing a great job in air services as well as in all other areas of the portfolio.
One of the reasons I say Mr Anderson is doing such a good job is the tremendous work he did in getting the tax reform package back on track when the Labor Party opposed it. The Labor Party opposed the proposal we put forward to bring cheaper and better transport to rural and regional Australia, whether it be rail, road or air transport. As a result of their opposition, Mr Anderson has had to spend an enormous amount of time getting a new package together which has, in the end, provided a tremendous outcome for the people of rural and regional Australia. In so many ways, Mr Anderson has done a remarkable job as the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. The good things happening in aviation now and the good things that will 
 occur in times to come are as a significant result of the work done by Mr Anderson.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Airservices Australia </title>,Documents,21,1,speech

"Watson, Sen John",LP,1999-09-22,"—Tonight I wish to refer to the operations of the EPAS Fund—that is, the Employees Productive Award Superannuation Fund. The previous Labor government developed a retirement incomes policy to address the problems arising from an ageing population, caused primarily by the baby boom generation moving into the age pension age over the next couple of decades. The superannuation guarantee was central to that policy and the 1992 superannuation guarantee charge legislation has seen all employers contribute the superannuation guarantee to registered superannuation funds on behalf of employees since that time.
The charge commenced at three per cent of an employee's pay and has steadily risen to seven per cent today. Award superannuation has also played a significant part in employee savings and, together with the superannuation guarantee, cemented the need for supervision and regulation of the superannuation industry. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, sometimes referred to as the SI(S) Act, substantially increases the level of prudential protection provided to the superannuation industry and represents a substantial strengthening of the security of superannuation savings and the protection of the rights of superannuation fund members.
Since 1 July 1998, APRA—the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority—is the Commonwealth agency which is now responsible for prudential regulation of banks, life 
 insurance companies, general insurance companies and superannuation funds, having taken over the functions from the previous Insurance and Superannuation Commission, ISC, for insurance and superannuation, and from the Reserve Bank of Australia for banks. In the case of superannuation funds, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority aims to ensure that the trustees are aware of their obligations to members and manage the funds in their care prudently in the interests of members. A great responsibility is put on trustees.
I am going to outline tonight that in this particular case the trustees have not acted prudently. APRA does not guarantee the performance of financial institutions but has the power to require them to observe prudential standards and to intercede if it believes the interests of depositors, policy holders or members are at risk. They look at approved deeds and the performance of funds. I am afraid they slipped in this particular case.
Consumer issues, however, such as the information or advice provided about financial products or the resolution of consumer complaints about financial services or charges, are primarily the responsibility of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, ASIC. Where their responsibilities overlap, APRA cooperates particularly closely with ASIC.
When trustees of superannuation funds invest members' money there should be at least three major objectives. They are: to achieve above average investment performance with an acceptable level of risk; to gain results which compare more favourably than those available on deposit; and to increase the value of member's contributions by achieving a rate of interest, over the long term, exceeding the rate of inflation.
The investment strategy must therefore be based on these objectives. In choosing a range of asset classes, a trustee or trustees should have regard to the advice of professional investment advisers. To keep the fluctuations in any one market to a minimum, the asset classes, for example, could include a mix of cash on deposit, bonds, property and shares. Investing through a range of managers also 
 helps to reduce the risk of fluctuations even further.
You can imagine my absolute despair when I was made aware recently of problems with the EPAS Fund—the Employees Productive Award Superannuation Fund—an industry fund used by employers in the accommodation industry. When we go to the 1998 annual return, it declared a negative return of 43 per cent. A statement dated 30 December 1998 was mailed to members stating that a negative crediting rate of 43 per cent had been applied to all their contributions, effectively cutting their earnings or their hard earned savings in half. Naturally, this raised concerns from members.
The fund owner, Mr Terry James, had been trustee and chairman until his resignation in October 1998. Investigations reveal that on 1 July 1996 APRA, concerned the fund was too heavily committed in property investment, directed the appointment of Mr Gerald Parker as trustee in order to diversify funds invested. It appears there were at least 20 interrelated companies with directors common to many companies. So the question really does have to be asked: why did APRA approve such an arrangement of 20 interrelated companies? This is just not good enough. This is not good oversight by APRA and it is not good oversight by the trustees in the discharge of their responsibilities to the members.
But worse, members' inquiries to EPAS Ltd are answered with the words, `This is commercially privileged information,' and very little useful information is forthcoming. On 29 July 1998 Gerald Parker notified members that EPAS Ltd now had four trustee directors, bringing diverse experience to the board. Too little too late. On the same day in a notice to all members issued by EPAS Ltd as trustee, the question was asked, `Why did the fund have so much invested in property?' The answer was:
The history of the EPAS Fund saw the Fund invest in loans. Mostly these loans were secured by mortgages over property. In a move to increase the performance of EPAS for its members, the present Trustee Directors, demanded that the loans be repaid.
A fair enough action. It continued:
Those borrowers who defaulted on their EPAS loans have been taken over and either sold or retained ready for prudent sale.
A major problem was the purchase and refurbishment of O'Hara's Resort Hotel in Launceston, Tasmania. It alone accounts for $7 million of members' moneys. On top of the substantial property asset losses, EPAS also reported a loss of $918,000 in share dealings in 1998. I remind honourable senators this was at a time of strong share growth.
Who is responsible for this total mismanagement of the members' funds? Clearly, I point the finger at the trustees, because trustees have greater liabilities than directors of corporate companies. They have their personal assets at stake. I think it is time that delinquent trustees are made an example of by the authorities. Why hasn't APRA taken action against these delinquent or former trustees to show the need for separate and prudent management of super funds? The blame rests principally on the trustees. I believe they are liable and they should be sued. The question on everybody's lips is: why hasn't APRA taken a more punitive action when clearly it has such powers and when clearly the former directors were so delinquent in the discharge of their responsibilities?
A central principle of the SIS legislation is that trustees are primarily responsible for the viability and prudent operation of superannuation funds. The SI'S legislation imposes fiduciary duties on trustees to act in the best interest of the members. The EPAS Fund, with 12,000 members, should never have been directly investing in property assets and resorts and had such arrangements with 20 other operations with common directors.
The 1998 accounts show an amount of $4,254 directed to `trustees indemnity insurance'. So the trustees have some sort of money they can call upon if they are sued. Why haven't they been sued? Where is APRA in relation to this particular amount? It is doubtful of course that any insurance claim could completely recoup all the money these members have lost, but at least they should be trying.  
With award superannuation and superannuation guarantee, many people do not think about the amount of money their employers contribute on their behalf to a superannuation fund. If they do, rarely do they wonder if the money is safe. It is up to this Senate and the regulating authorities to ensure that the money is safe. The disaster is horrifying for every member who stands to lose money. Both APRA and ASIC, with the APRA appointed trustee, are working together to review an untenable situation.
