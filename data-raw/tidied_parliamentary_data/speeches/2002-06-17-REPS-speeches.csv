"Lloyd, Jim, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	notes the passing of Australia's last Anzac Gallipoli veteran, Mr Alec Campbell, and records its sympathy to his family;
(2)	acknowledges the service and sacrifice of all Gallipoli veterans;
(3)	notes the increasing number of young Australians who attend Anzac Day dawn services both in Australia and overseas; and
(4)	encourages all Australians to ensure that the Anzac legend continues to be recognised and honoured.
It is a great honour that my private members' business motion has been selected for debate in this chamber today. I was privileged to attend the funeral service of our last Anzac veteran, Mr Alec Campbell, in Hobart on Friday, 24 May 2002. I wish to pass on my condolences to Mr Campbell's wife and family and to thank them most sincerely for allowing all of Australia to share that very personal moment with them. All of Australia stopped at that time, not only out of respect for Mr Campbell but out of respect for the Anzac legend and the sacrifices that a whole generation of young people made at that time.
Many hundreds of people attended that funeral. One of them most people would not know: a young Central Coast student by the name of Laura Grumley from Gosford High School. Laura was one of the eight Simpson Prize winners two years ago who attended the 85th Anzac Day services at Gallipoli and Lone Pine in Turkey. Prior to her departure as a 15-year-old student she had the opportunity to meet and speak with Mr Campbell. She was so moved by that meeting, her trip to Gallipoli and the spirit of the Anzac legends and what they represent that she paid her own way to Hobart to attend, with her father, Mr Campbell's funeral. I can assure honourable members that Laura's actions highlight so much of our young people's respect for the Anzac legend.
On Anzac Day this year, I, along with a number of my colleagues—the member for Forde and the member for Bass, who are in the chamber at the moment, and also the Deputy Prime Minister—had the real privilege of attending the Anzac Day services at Gallipoli. I have to say that it was one of the most moving and emotional days of my life. People said to me before I went to Gallipoli that it really would change the way I thought about things, and it certainly did. It was an amazing experience. It is difficult to put into words the feeling, but what really impressed me so much was the 15,000 mainly young Australians who had made quite a considerable effort to be there as well. Attending the Anzac Day services at Gallipoli is turning into a pilgrimage for young Australians.
It is not easy to get to Gallipoli. Turkey is a long way away, it is expensive to travel there and to actually get to the Gallipoli Peninsula takes quite a deal of effort. To attend the dawn service most of those young people had to backpack six or seven hours in a bus and probably had to be at Gallipoli by about nine or 10 o'clock the night before. They had to sit overnight in subzero temperatures while waiting for the dawn service. It is really symbolic in some small way of the sacrifices that our young soldiers made on the Gallipoli Peninsula.
To watch the light grow during the dawn service, to look behind us to where the hills were and to imagine our young soldiers landing on that beach and trying to scale the cliffs with the Turkish forces there was very sobering for us. After the dawn service we then travelled to a number of services along the Gallipoli Peninsula, and they culminated, to my mind, in the Australian service at Lone Pine, which was held at 12 noon. I did not quite know what to expect when we were going to Lone Pine, although we had had the opportunity of being there the day before. It was an amazing ceremony and I had the privilege of reading some of the service. I wish I could speak for a lot longer on this—I could speak for many hours on it—but I have to say how proud I was of the 15,000 mainly young Australians who were there honouring our Anzac legends. I can assure all Australians that the principles that our young diggers fought for are in good hands with this generation. They were deeply respectful, and during the service at Lone Pine you could have heard a pin drop: there was not one sound from any of the people that were there. (Time expired)

"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—I congratulate the Chief Opposition Whip on putting forward this motion on our Anzacs. It is fitting that the Parliament of Australia recognises and honours the passing of the last Anzac. It is my view that this should have been a condolence motion, put forward by the Leader of the House, to enable all members to speak to it. I find it somewhat ironic that the monarchist Leader of the House could allow a condolence motion for the Queen Mum and a motion celebrating the Jubilee of Her Majesty The Queen to enable all members to speak but only allow a limited motion to note the passing not just of the last Gallipoli veteran but of an era and of a generation of men who witnessed death, horror, destruction and the terrible carnage of war on a level and of a nature that we cannot even begin to comprehend. The same generation of men established a standard of courage, gallantry, mateship, humour, disdain for authority, larrikinism, individuality and love of freedom that grew to become the Anzac legend. It is indeed fitting that they should have been given the full respect of this parliament.
I extend my condolences to the family of Mr Alec Campbell. I extend my deep respect to all who served, suffered and died in that terrible military maelstrom of human catastrophe. In saying that, I recognise the terrible pain and suffering that was felt by those in Australia whose loved ones—fathers, brothers and sons—were so far from home. 
Some years ago I visited Gallipoli and was shown around by a Turkish guide. It is a tribute to Turkey that this battlefield is so well kept and maintained. The bond between Turkey, Australia and New Zealand is strong, and all Australians should recognise and respect that fact. In his book, A Fortunate Life, Albert Facey described a number of his experiences. On the landing, he wrote:
Suddenly all hell broke loose; heavy shelling and shrapnel fire commenced. The ships that were protecting our troops returned fire. Bullets were thumping into us in the rowing-boat. Men were being hit and killed all around me.
When we were cut loose to make our way to the shore was the worst period. I was terribly frightened. The boat touched bottom some thirty yards from shore so we had to jump out and wade into the beach. The water in some places was up to my shoulders. The Turks had machine-guns sweeping the strip of beach where we landed—there were many dead already when we got there. Bodies of men who had reached the beach ahead of us were lying all along the beach and wounded men were screaming for help. We couldn't stop for them—the Turkish fire was terrible and mowing into us. The order to line up on the beach was forgotten. We all ran for our lives over the strip of beach and into the scrub and bush. Men were falling all around me. We were stumbling over bodies—running blind.
The sight of the bodies on the beach was shocking. It worried me for days that I couldn't stop to help the men calling out. (This was one of the hardest things of the war for me and I'm sure for many of the others. There were to be other times under fire when we couldn't help those that were hit. I would think for days, `I should have helped that poor beggar.')
About the armistice he wrote:
I will never forget the armistice—it was a day of hard, smelly, nauseating work. Those of us assigned to pick up the bodies had to pair up and bring the bodies in on stretchers to where the graves were being dug. First we had to cut the cord of identification disks and record the details on a sheet of paper we were provided with. Some of the bodies were rotted so much that there were only bones and part of the uniform left. The bodies of men killed on the nineteenth (it had now been five days) were awful. Most of us had to work in short spells as we felt very ill. We found a few of our men who had been killed in the first days of the landing. 
This whole operation was a strange experience—here we were, mixing with our enemies, exchanging smiles and cigarettes, when the day before we had been tearing each other to pieces.
He goes on to write about mateship:
I think that it would be true to say that all the men who were at Gallipoli wanted to stay with their comrades. It wasn't that anyone wanted to be a hero, it was just that we were very close after four months together under such terrible conditions. A sort of love and trust in one another developed in the trenches. It made us all very loyal to each other.
That is where the legend of Anzac was born, and I think it is true to say that the legend of Anzac is indeed the spirit of Australia. 
I attended 17 Anzac services at schools this year. Every one of them was a privilege to be at, and it was a great honour for me to watch those young Australian students conducting their services. As we look back we must look to the future. Young Australians today have as much courage and as much character as any other generation of Australians. Let us just pray and hope that their challenges will never, ever again take them to the shores of a place like Gallipoli. To all of the Anzacs, I simply say: rest in peace.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Anzacs</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Elson, Kay, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—It is a special honour to support the motion before the House on our Anzacs. Like all Australians, I was saddened by the recent passing of our last Anzac Gallipoli veteran, Mr Alec Campbell. Our sympathy goes to his family, and our enduring gratitude as a nation goes to Mr Campbell and his many brothers in arms who fought so valiantly against incredible odds. 
Alec Campbell was symbolic of a very different time: an era when the essence of our young nation was forged through the bravery and deeds of our young men serving abroad in conflicts the likes of which the world had never known before. From the heroic actions of our servicemen have sprung the many values, ideals and characteristics that make us Australian; and nowhere was that brought into sharper focus than at Gallipoli. The Gallipoli campaign cost 8,709 Australian lives—an incredible sacrifice for a nation so young. That there is now no living reminder of this brave battle does not mean that the men who sacrificed so much for us will be forgotten. Far from it. Long before Mr Campbell's passing, we were witnessing a renewed commitment to honour the Anzac legend. It is a commitment that has been taken up by the younger generation of Australians, as evidenced by their ever-increasing numbers at Anzac Day marches across the nation, and it is a commitment reflected in the pilgrimage made by thousands of young Australians to Gallipoli on Anzac Day each year. 
I was very honoured this year, along with the member for Robertson, the member for Bass and the Deputy Prime Minister, to be a part of the services at Anzac Cove and Lone Pine. It was an experience that defies description. To see the cliffs, the beach and the rugged terrain, and to imagine the terrible odds that our soldiers faced, gives you the incredible realisation that the Anzac legend is solidly based on courage and sacrifice. I was heartened to see that so many young Australians attended the Anzac Day services at Gallipoli. I congratulate them on their impeccable behaviour and for the heartfelt respect that they displayed during the many services on the day. I took the opportunity to talk to many of these young Australians, and it was clear that they included a stop at Gallipoli as part of their world travels, as they saw it as an important mark of respect for all of our Australian servicemen. These young Australians have a very great appreciation for the sacrifices made by the generations before them. They have a very personal commitment to ensuring that the memory of those who served our nation continues to be honoured. Certainly my experience in talking with these young people at Gallipoli mirrored my experiences over many years in my electorate, where I have seen increasing numbers of young people and their families attending Anzac Day services and paying their respects. I think that right now, when we have soldiers serving Australia overseas as part of the international war on terrorism, it brings home the fact that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. It reminds us all of the sacrifices made by generations past so that we may enjoy the freedoms that we currently have. It reminds us of the debt of gratitude we owe.  
I am very pleased to strongly support this motion before the House. It is important that we continue to encourage all Australians to continue to recognise and honour the Anzac legend, remembering that the legend was forged through the brave actions and incredible spirit of those young men who landed at Gallipoli and built upon by the many deeds of our service men and women in all conflicts. I am incredibly heartened by—and this motion recognises this—the fact that there are increasing numbers of young Australians at Anzac Day services here and overseas. I think that for many young Australians it goes without saying that they feel very real pride in, and a debt of gratitude to, our veterans. I hope and certainly expect that we will see that deep personal commitment being passed on to their children, their grandchildren and so on for many more generations. So, while Alec Campbell and his brothers in arms have all passed on with the inevitable march of time, I have no doubt that their memories will live forever.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Anzacs</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—The passing of Alec Campbell means that the legend of Gallipoli passes into history and from the memory of any living person. Alec was a marvellously authentic representation of that generation. He was a marvellously authentic Australian, a man who accepted responsibility—he accepted responsibility before his time, in fact, to go to Gallipoli and fight, and he accepted responsibility for his society when he returned. He accepted responsibility for organising the work force as a strong trade unionist and trade union leader. He enjoyed life: he loved it and he lived it like an Australian with his love of sport which manifested itself in his taking part in several Sydney to Hobart yacht races. He was an authentic representative of his generation and, as such, it is fitting that he should be the last focus of the living part of the Anzac legend. With his passing the Anzacs pass into legend and history, and from living memory. I join with others who have spoken here today in expressing my condolences to his family. But they must be awfully proud.
We Australians, along with our New Zealand brothers and sisters, are really the only ones who incorporate that terrible campaign into our history and our national psychology. A fellow who is probably the best military historian in the English language, John Keegan, beautifully expressed this aspect of ourselves recently in the book First World War. He took a look at the campaign and had understandably critical comments to make of it, but then he talked of the contemporary battlefield. He wrote:
Few British make the journey; those who do, and find their way to ANZAC's tiny and terrible backgrounds at Lone Pine, Russell's Top and Steele's Post, never fail to be moved by the appearance of young Australians, men and women, who have trekked across Europe to see where their grandfathers and great grandfathers fought and often died. Two-thirds of the Australians who went to the Great War became casualties and the first of the nation's Great War heroes won their medals in the two square miles above ANZAC cove. Their grandchildren and great-grandchildren often bring those medals back with them to Gallipoli on their pilgrimage, as if to reconsecrate the symbols of the ANZAC spirit, a metaphor for that of the nation itself, on sacred soil.
Those beautifully expressed words capture exactly what the Anzac legend means to us here in Australia. It is the central, core element of our national psychology. That is attested to as thousands of Australians each year vote with their feet by visiting the battlefields such as the historian has there recorded. Probably the most moving experience of what is now on my part a fairly lengthy political career was when I witnessed the 75th anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli. There were enough Anzacs there to make up a company. We had 100 of them with us at that commemoration. It was extraordinary to see them sitting down with old Turkish diggers who had fought in the same conflict. Though neither could speak the other's language, they understood each other perfectly. It was moving, too, to see thousands of young Australians participating in that ceremony at a battlefield that is visited, whether it is Anzac Day or not, because it is now so deeply impacted in our national psyche.
In conclusion might I say that our commemoration of that battlefield is not yet complete. I recommend that the government start the process of taking up the Australian submarine, AE2, which has been found by the Turks. I hope that by the time of the centenary of Gallipoli in 2015 there will be an appropriate interpretation centre there, too, for it. Fortunately or unfortunately, the submarine's success in penetrating the Dardanelles is what caused the Australians to hang onto the beaches. I commend the government for undertaking that joint consideration and I hope it comes to a successful conclusion.

"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2002-06-17,"—It is indeed a privilege and an honour to support the member for Robertson's private member's motion here today on our Anzacs. The fact that an entire nation mourned the passing of Mr Alec Campbell at 103 years of age is testament to all who have fought for this great country, and indeed to all of those who put themselves forward but through no fault of their own did not actually face enemy fire. It is of particular pride and significance to me that four members of the Australian Army Band Kapooka, from the home of the soldier in Wagga Wagga in the Riverina electorate, travelled to Hobart to combine with the Australian Army Band Hobart and the Australian Army Band Melbourne to perform a great tribute to farewell our last Anzac. Australian Army Band Kapooka members Rachel Westacott, Russel Paynter, Danny Beeton and Mick Beeton were honoured to be selected to pay tribute to a figurehead for those who gave their all.
As the mother of three sons and grandmother of three grandsons, I look at the baby face of a 16-year-old child and shudder at the thought of my boys ever having to witness the atrocities of war and I give thanks to Alec Campbell and 8,700-odd other young Australian men just like him who died during the eight months that saw another 19,000 of our brave hearts wounded. As I was preparing and looking at the speeches for today, I read Richard Reid's Gallipoli 1915 to take me back to some of the areas that were a part of us during that horrific time. One of the pages shows the words of Signaller Ellis Silas from the 16th Battalion of the AIF in Gallipoli, 11 May 1915. He said:
The roll is called. How heartbreaking it is. Name after name is called. The reply: a deep silence which can be felt despite the noise of the incessant cracking of rifles and screaming of shrapnel. There are few of us left to answer, answer our names. Just a thin line of weary, ashen-faced men behind a mass of silent forms once our comrades. There they have been for days. We have not had time to bury them.
Some of the words inside this book bring tears to one's eyes and thoughts that can lead back to the experiences of our young Australians who have passed away. One could stand almost anywhere on Australian soil and slip away into a place in time where hell was a massacre on a beach with cries from the wounded, gunfire that sounded just like Guy Fawkes Day and the unimaginable screaming of shells.
The thoughts of one young man, Private Roy Denning from the 1st Field Company Engineers in the AIF, were as follows:
I thought I was justified in being proud of being Australian ... give me Australians as comrades and I will go anywhere duty calls, and I hope to be pardoned for saying so, being one myself.
You were pardoned and you were justified, Private Denning. Australians are very proud of the history that unfolds before them. No prouder day was held this year than Anzac Day, when I witnessed one of the largest Anzac marches ever to be held in the city of Wagga Wagga. Right across my electorate of Riverina, we saw our children marching with wonder in their eyes, a new understanding and a new recognition of the type of people that had lost their lives on other soils in other countries to save the way of life that they were experiencing now.
The addresses that were held across my electorate of Riverina and every electorate in Australia would have had the same passionate message of how fortunate we are as Australians that those who have gone before us and the likes of Alec Campbell delivered to Australians the quality, the safety and the future of a great nation. These Australian people can be well remembered. We can ask our country to always remember the sacrifice that went forward from all of the people who fought in the Great War, a war that involved the loss of so many of our young people. All I can say is: lest we forget. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Anzacs</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—I support the motion moved by the member for Robertson with much pleasure and pride, not only because of the significance to this country of each of the elements of this motion but also because Alec Campbell was born and spent much of his working life in my electorate and because I was one of the proud and, might I say, well-behaved young Australians who attended the Anzac services in Gallipoli this year.
For each of his 103 years, Alec Campbell could always lay claim to being just a fraction older than our nation—our federated nation—but during the final years of his wonderful life he was more than that. He became the symbol of the very essence of our nation's spirit. Of course, this was an Australian spirit that did not actually exist when he was born. It was yet to be forged at far off places like Anzac Cove and Lone Pine by young men like Alec Campbell. Much of that which we hold dear about being Australian, those things in which we pride ourselves, are part of the Alec Campbell story—the story of a fresh-faced boy who travelled to the other side of the world to fight for his country.
As history records, Gallipoli was not the theatre of war which claimed the most Australian lives, nor was it a great victory, but Gallipoli was the site and occasion at which Australia found something to be forever proud of. Alec Campbell became more than a 16-year-old boy lying about his age to go to war. He was more than a brave soldier who endured the horror of war. Alec Campbell became part of the definition of the spirit, courage and humour of Australia. Like so many of the brave Australians who survived the Gallipoli campaign, Alec Campbell returned home to play an active role in our young nation's development. In particular, he was passionately involved in pursuing the rights of Tasmanian workers. He rose to become president of both the local branch of the Australian Railways Union and the Launceston Trades Hall.
I was both honoured and fortunate to attend the Anzac Day services at Gallipoli this year—the last Anzac Day when an original Anzac remained alive. I joined those people who made the pilgrimage to attend the dawn service at its new site at North Beach, where it has been moved to provide for the numbers that now attend. Ten or so years ago the crowd was in its hundreds; this year it is estimated that 15,000 people from many nations attended. How do we account for the huge growth in numbers not only at Gallipoli but also at Anzac Day services around Australia? How is it that Alec Campbell and his comrades in arms have become part of the evolution of what it is to be Australian?
This year, as dawn broke over the almost perpendicular cliffs against which so many young hopes and lives were dashed 87 years ago, I began in the very smallest way to understand the futility of the landing. But one cannot really comprehend what it would have been like in a storm of bullets, noise and death. For me, the amazing thing was not how many lost their lives but how many actually survived. It is incredible that they did not give up. We now know that throughout the campaign they and the Turks developed a grudging respect for each other. The Turks, who were defending their homes, could never understand what the Australians were doing there. Many did not even know where Australia was, just as our boys probably knew very little about Turkey when they left our shores.
These days, on Anzac Day each year, the main Australian service takes place at Lone Pine at noon. In 1915, at the Battle of Lone Pine, 2,000 Australians died in a furious attack launched on 6 August. Six days later, the worst of the fighting was over and the Australians had captured this strategic Turkish position—one of the few allied victories during the campaign. Many diggers who were not actually assigned to battle duties had begged for the opportunity to support their comrades. The Victoria Cross was awarded to seven Australian soldiers, two posthumously.
The 10,000 Australians who attended the service at Lone Pine in 2002 were up most of the night, catching what sleep they could on a very cold peninsula, before attending the dawn service and then trekking up to Lone Pine. They spent the morning as typical Australians would spend a morning: they were singing, they were chatting; they were enjoying the sun and they were enjoying the camaraderie of being there with people who were joined in their cause. When the official party arrived—members who have spoken today were part of that party—Lone Pine was awash with national pride. The crowd sang the national anthem. They cheered and spontaneously cleared a path for the dignitaries. They shed tears as wreaths were laid for the fallen and they reserved the loudest applause for a Turkish veteran—which I think was one of the most gratifying things about being there. The strange bond forged by their forebears with the enemy had certainly not been lost on this new generation. They were very proudly Australian, celebrating their Australianness at the site where Australian nationhood and nationalism was forged. The experience left no doubt in my mind why Alec Campbell and Gallipoli now mean so much to us. Having attended his funeral in Hobart recently, I can see why his family are so incredibly proud of him as well.

"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—I rise not only to support the motion by the member for Robertson but also to dedicate this speech to the memory of Lance Corporal John Gillespie, `dust-off' medic of the 8th Field Ambulance, missing in action 17 April 1971, South Vietnam. It is important we remember that the spirit of Anzac does not end at Gallipoli but that it begins there. The last Anzac, Alec Campbell, was 103 when he left us on 16 May 2002—the last man to set foot on the beaches of Gallipoli with a rifle in his hand and the last man that could claim to be the custodian of the Anzac legend. Before him, Ted Matthews, the last Anzac to actually storm Anzac Cove on Gallipoli beach at dawn on 25 April in 1915, went to join his mates at the age of 101, on 10 December 1997. Now they have gone and there is no-one else left alive who saw those bloody beaches and smelled the stench of death wafting over the parapet walls into the trenches. Who really knows how they felt and what it was like to wake up in the morning and stare death in the face?
Anzac Day is a glorious ceremony and hundreds of thousands of Australians proudly join the veterans of many conflicts to celebrate the common spirit that touches us all. It is an experience that bonds us—even those newly arrived in the country from other countries who are moved by the passion we show in honouring our war dead; that is, until we woke one morning and found that Alec Campbell was the last Anzac. There were no more. And when he was gone, what would be left? Who would personify the legend? All of a sudden, Alec Campbell took on a new proportion. At 103, he was older than the Federation of Australia. For a time he was Australia and all the nobility that we felt about it. We feted our veterans, we paraded them—as if in a kind of ritual act of desperation to stop them going. Too late, we realised that it was only a matter of time before a cherished link with our past would be no more.
I remember the full-page photograph on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald recently of a small, forlorn looking figure, in a uniform that was much too large for him, holding a rifle which, with bayonet fixed, was almost as long as he was tall, his face a serious pout—a seriousness that belied his 16 years on this earth when the photograph was taken those many years ago. The Edwardian uniform reflected a life that we can only begin to imagine from those grainy photographs, but now there is no-one to tell us what it was really like. What compelled Alec Campbell to volunteer for God, king and country? What sense of idealism drove him—or was it just a sense of adventure born of the naivety of youth? When interviewed two years ago, Alec Campbell said, `It's so long ago I don't remember.' However, he did go back to those shores, along with a handful of comrades, and we as a nation started to realise that, like the grains of sand running through our fingers, disappearing into an indistinguishable void, these last heroes of our time were not going to be around much longer.
He was ultimately a humble man with simple views. He had seen the brutality of war and he was not impressed. His reluctance to participate in Anzac Day parades, although he did, revealed that there was no glory in war, only sadness. The photograph of him at 103, framing the one of his youth, told a different story. It was that of a wizened old man—there was no shadow of the exuberance of the 16-year-old boy soldier—now with shoulders stooped and eyes glazed, the weariness of war cloaking him like a mantle, and only his medals to show the glory imagined by those that came later. 
We have revered the legend of Anzac, and rightly so. Many an Australian soldier today, and his father before him, was inspired by the deeds of Anzac. They were inspired to go on and fight for their country, rightly or wrongly, just like the original Anzacs did. Such a sense of duty is not a commodity that can be bought. It is a spirit that grows in an individual, coming as it does from the likes of Alec Campbell and his mates, now long gone. It is their memory and their deeds that sustain us, for, without such examples to inspire us, from where will we gain the sense of nobility and the selflessness we need to put our country ahead of ourselves? No, this is not something that can be replaced. Alec Campbell's passing is a milestone in this country's history, and it also asks the question: have we learned anything from it? He has passed the torch to us, and we are obliged to carry it for him. Let us learn from this experience and hold dear those memories for future generations. They need a role model so that they too can aspire to nobler ideals than just those of the flesh. From the lyrics of Eric Bogle's song:
But the band plays “Waltzing Matilda”,
And the old men still answer the call,
But as year follows year, more old men disappear,
Someday, no one will march there at all.
That dreaded day is here.
I am heartened on each Anzac Day to see more and more children of our veterans putting on their fathers', uncles' or grandfathers' medals and marching side by side with the otherwise dwindling ranks. The dawn services are becoming more moving, and I believe that the ever growing band of young people now attending will indeed pick up the torch. It is this sense of involvement, this act of participation, that gives meaning to the moment. We the Australian people are custodians of memory. We have an obligation to honour their memory.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—I rise to join with others in mourning the death of Alec Campbell. In the last week of sitting, about 20 Indonesians—public servants, journalists and judges—were on a six-week study tour in Australia. I happened to be with them, and we had a very good exchange. But I asked them the question: what is it that you enjoyed most about being in Australia? I was really taken aback by their response, which was that for them it was being in Australia at the time of the passing of a national hero—Alec Campbell. I think, like me, every Australian in the group was absolutely touched by that response, because indeed Alec Campbell's passing was also the passing of an era.
But what is it that we celebrate about Anzac Day and Gallipoli, in particular? I do not think that anyone here can have a sense of what they went through. It was not the first heroic battle that Australians had fought in; that distinction probably rests with our engagement in the Boer War, which we do not tend to celebrate. But let us look at the statistics: 50,000 young Australians were at Gallipoli; 8,141 lost their lives and a further 17,970 were wounded, bringing the total casualty rate to 26,111. More than one out of every two people was a casualty in that engagement. It was no great victory. In fact, it was an appalling disaster. Perhaps the finest effort was the extraction with no loss of life at the end of the campaign. But the ground is soaked in blood. If anything, I think the thing we remember is the loss of innocence of those that participated and the bonding of those that stood shoulder to shoulder in such an awful, bloody campaign—a campaign no government would survive today.
I have always been struck by the words of Kemal Ataturk. When in 1934 he wrote a tribute to our Anzacs, he said:
Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives ... You are now lying in the soil of a friendly country. Therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side now here in this country of ours ... You, the mothers, who sent their sons from faraway countries wipe away the tears. Your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace after having lost their lives on this land. They have become our sons as well. 
I think they are tremendously generous words. I have a degree of satisfaction knowing that at the Rooty Hill RSL in Sydney we not only have a cenotaph to commemorate those that fell on the Australian side but also agreed to accept a memorial to the Turkish soldiers—other RSLs declined to do that.
As others have said, the Anzac spirit that permeates this country and the loss of blood that has so soaked those shores have given us a tradition, but we should not be frightened of making new traditions. We should not be frightened of standing up for our own traditions. We should not tug the forelock to mother countries; we should not be servile to those upon whom our security depends. This loss of innocence is the birth of a country: a free country, an independent country—a country that we are so very proud of. I hope that the Anzac tradition will live on, but I hope that as Australians we will, in this new century and in this new millennium, make new traditions, keeping holy that Holy Grail but being prepared to adapt and change with the times. Alec Campbell and his family must be so proud. (Time expired)

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—It is with a great deal of satisfaction that I rise today to inform the House that my constituents Les and Heather Emerson will finally receive the compensation they so richly deserve. Senator Coonan announced last Friday, after an unnecessarily long and drawn out process, that the government had finally come to the decision that everybody had been calling for in the case of the collapse of Commercial Nominees, the superannuation trustee for around 480 small superannuation funds, including Les Emerson's. I am, however, bewildered as to why the government has placed a cap on the compensation at only 90 per cent of the loss when the legislation does not require this cap at all. The government is being cheap with this payment. The Emersons should be compensated 100 per cent for the losses they have incurred.
This case has dragged on for over 18 months, and the Emersons have faced enormous hardship over that period as they have fought for their rightful entitlement. The government have now come up 10 per cent short. Nevertheless, the payment is welcome and will allow the Emersons to resume their normal lives and relax in retirement, knowing that they have the funds to support themselves. However, I urge the government to rethink their mean-spirited cap of 90 per cent and pay out the full 100 per cent as the legislation allows.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Greenway Electorate: Commercial Nominees of Australia</title>,Statements by Members,2,1,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that one of the 3,000 islands excised from the Australian migration zone is Milingimbi Island, which at low tide is only one to two kilometres from the Australian mainland? Prime Minister, doesn't this demonstrate that your flawed excision policy is just an invitation to people smugglers to go the extra 1,000 to 2,000 metres to reach the Australian mainland? ",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration: Border Protection</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—As to the first part of the question, I will have a look at the map. The question allows me to point out something that we on this side of the House have always believed and that is that Labor is weak on border protection. That is the reality.
—The policy is flawed.
—The Leader of the Opposition! The Prime Minister has the call.
—It defies all logic that the Labor Party, having supported the act of parliament under which this regulation has been made, would now change its position, and the only thing that has intervened has been a federal election. If it was all right to excise Ashmore Reef and Christmas Island and if it was all right to see the enormous benefits in terms of the deterrent effect of that policy, why isn't it, in the face of the evidence made available to the Leader of the Opposition, okay to excise these further islands? The only thing that has changed is that the Leader of the Opposition is under heat from his own party and he is going weak at the knees. He is going very, very weak at the knees. We in this parliament, with the support of the opposition, passed an act of parliament last year which not only excised Christmas Island and Ashmore Reef but also gave authority for the minister, by regulation, to excise further islands. The Leader of the Opposition supported it last year but he is opposing it this year. He is going weak on border protection. He has been rolled by the New South Wales—
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order which goes to relevance. The question was: why isn't this an invitation for the people smugglers to reach the mainland—
—The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.
—Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition is going to water on border protection. The reason he is doing that is that the Labor Party have never really believed in a strong border protection policy. They went through the last election parading this fiction that there was only a tissue paper between our policy and theirs. The then Leader of the Opposition would stand up and say, `The government and the opposition are shoulder to shoulder on strong border protection policy.' That strong border protection policy has meant that there have been no boat arrivals over the last six months. So that policy having worked, what has the Leader of the Opposition now set out to do? He has set out to undermine it, and he wants to undermine it because he does not believe in a strong border protection policy.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Is he aware that, on 11 June, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs refused to rule out excising parts of the mainland from the migration zone and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs also refused to rule out mainland excisions on 12 June? Given these statements, will the Prime Minister rule out legislating to excise parts of the mainland or is it the Prime Minister's plan to excise Darwin, North Queensland and Western Australia or even to resurrect the World War II Brisbane Line?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration: Border Protection</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—It is a measure of the desperation of the Labor Party on this issue that they are reaching back to invoke wartime references to the Brisbane Line. I want to make it clear that there is no intention—and there never has been—to excise any part of the Australian mainland. That is an absolutely ludicrous proposition. You cannot escape the rub—you voted for something which you are now trying to destroy. It is as simple as that. Last year it was okay to excise Ashmore Reef and Christmas Island but this year, with the election behind you, with the hot breath of the state conferences of the Queensland and New South Wales ALP breathing down your neck, you are now buckling at the knees. You are going to water, as we always knew you would, on border protection.  
The Australian people have a very clear situation in front of them: on the one hand, they have the Liberal and National parties who believe in strong border protection; on the other hand, they have an Australian Labor Party who, for political expediency, will pretend in an election campaign that they support us but who, with the election campaign behind us, are prepared to do everything they can to send a green light to the people smugglers. What the Labor Party are doing is sending a message to the people smugglers that they have cracked the bipartisan wall. 
—You are!
—The bipartisan border protection wall is being undermined and cracked by the actions of the Leader of the Australian Labor Party. The action announced by the minister last week was taken under an act of parliament that the Australian Labor Party voted for. They voted for this. No matter how much they now protest, interject and obfuscate, nothing can alter the fact that, under the leadership of the member for Brand, the Australian Labor Party voted for this measure. The regulation was made by the minister under an act of parliament that was voted for by the Australian Labor Party. That can lead to only one conclusion, and that is: Labor are weak on border protection. Labor are weak on border protection. That sends a very clear signal to the Australian public and to the world that, if you want strong border protection laws in this country and if you want consistency in the national interest, never trust the Australian Labor Party because, when there is a bit of pressure applied to an Australian Labor Party leader, that leader will buckle at the knees, he will go to ground, he will go to water, he will cave in and he will flash a green light not to the interests of the Australian public but to the interests of international people smugglers. Labor are weak on border protection.

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—I seek leave to move a motion forthwith concerning the ratification of the statute of the International Criminal Court. I move that this House calls on the government to ratify the statute of the International Criminal Court forthwith and that this House resolves—
—The member for Griffith, I interrupt you because I understood your first statement was that you were seeking leave. I was looking for an indication and now have an indication that leave was denied.
Leave not granted.
—Therefore, I wish to move suspension of standing orders.
—Mr Speaker—
—The member for Brand will be aware that, although he had risen, I was not sure whether he was expecting me to give priority to the member for Griffith.
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Is it not the case under the standing orders that, in the normal course of events, a person who wishes to seek leave to move a particular motion should stand, seek leave and then read the terms of the motion before an inquiry is made of the other side of the House as to whether or not leave will be granted? In which case, would it not be normal under the standing orders for the honourable member on his feet to have a chance to read his motion before the question of whether or not he has leave is properly ascertained?
—The member for Brand makes a valid point of order. The fact that it is private members' business Monday is not the reason for the standing orders to be suspended, but it was the reason that I was anxious to indicate whether or not leave had been granted.
—I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Griffith from moving a motion relating to the ratification of the statute of the International Criminal Court.
The ratification of the International Criminal Court is of fundamental importance to the parliament.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	notes that:
(a)	Western Sydney is one of the fastest growing regions in Australia with a high proportion of young people;
(b)	currently there is a negative perception of young people in Western Sydney, which is a mistaken view since Western Sydney is no different to any other region with regard to youth problems and youth achievements;
(c)	there needs to be public recognition of the achievements of young people which is linked to high self esteem and minimises anti-social behaviour;
(d)	lack of access to educational facilities, especially information technology, has resulted in an imbalance of academic achievements; and
(e)	there is insufficient provision of community and recreational facilities for young people in Western Sydney;
(2)	urges the Government to:
(a)	research methods of providing adequate access to computer facilities for the disadvantaged in Western Sydney in order to close the digital divide; and
(b)	provide urgently needed youth community facilities in the Western Sydney area to address the social needs of young people; and
(3)	acknowledges the work of the Blacktown Youth Orientation in drafting this motion and bringing these issues to light. 
It is with a great deal of satisfaction that I rise to speak on this motion before the parliament. It arose out of a seminar held in my office last year, involving students from a number of local high schools in Greenway. The points in the motion were arrived at during a brainstorming exercise conducted by members of my electoral staff and the participating students. As the last paragraph of the motion indicates, it was the young people themselves who wrote the words of this motion. They should be congratulated on their efforts. The motion concerns the perception of youth in the area and the availability of resources and funding allocated to improve educational and recreational facilities for young people in Western Sydney.
As a federal member, I am always pleased to be involved in assisting the various organisations who are providing character building support for young people—organisations such as schools, sporting clubs, scouts, guides, air leagues, CMF units and church groups, to name a few. I am always delighted to see in the streets of my electorate schoolchildren from many cultural backgrounds—African, Middle Eastern, Asian, European, Pacific Islander and our Indigenous people—communicating in a non-discriminating fashion. I see a tall, gangling African schoolgirl with sparkling eyes and glittering white teeth, looking down and speaking with a fellow school student from an Asian background—or was it Anglo-Saxon? It does not matter; the companionship is there.
I welcome in this debate the member for Fowler as well as the members for Macquarie and for Mitchell. I also acknowledge in the public gallery Councillor Barbara Gapps, the ex-officio member of the Blacktown Council youth committee. Collectively we represent the fastest growing residential area in Australia. We, along with all the other elected representatives in our area, have an enormous responsibility to work towards making our part of the world, Western Sydney, a place for young people to grow up and prosper in. I recognise in this speech the many thousands of young people in our region who are striving for self-improvement. I speak of Mark Grima, who has been involved in scouting for around 13 years. Most of that time he has been with the 1st Quakers Hill-Doonside Scout Group. On Christmas Day this year Mark will be leaving to attend the 20th World Jamboree in Thailand. This is the second opportunity that Mark has had to represent his country. Four years ago Mark, as he described in a letter to me, had the honour `of being the only representative from the Greater Western Sydney region at the World Jamboree in Chile.' Mark is a good example of a young person striving to achieve his ambitions. He also wrote:
As an 18 year old who only completed the HSC last year I am finding the financial burden of this event a bit much. I am working two casual jobs (K-Mart in Blacktown and Snowgum in Parramatta) to help pay for the event. 
I would like to think that the Australian government is willing to make a financial contribution to the Australian contingent attending the jamboree. I also speak of Pilot Officers Michael Leonard and Ross Lavies, both of whom attended local high schools and progressed through the Blacktown Air League squadron where they obtained their restricted glider's licence at the age of 15 and then progressed to their restricted powered licence. I speak of Toni Collette, the Oscar-nominated actress who started her acting career on the stage of Blacktown Girls High School. She also spent time as a peer leader helping young students, including one of my electorate staffers, Nicole.
I speak of Ehsan Fallahi, a representative of Western Sydney on the Prime Minister's Youth Roundtable, who attended Wyndham College at Quakers Hill and who today is one of only two Australian representatives attending the global youth summit at the University of Sunderland in the United Kingdom. This summit, which is entitled `Citizen You', will be the culmination of a special exchange program linking every Commonwealth country with partner communities spread throughout the United Kingdom. Ehsan believes that this is a great opportunity to express his concerns and share his views and experiences with a wide range of young people from around the world. Ehsan expects this summit will provide him with valuable feedback which he says he `can then put into practice not only locally but also to promote awareness at a federal level'. 
Those young people I have mentioned by name, as well as the unnamed, untold others who are improving their lives and the lives of those around them, are our future. We need to listen to them, we need to listen to their concerns and ambitions and we need to act. A short while ago three young students from the University of Western Sydney came to me with a proposal as part of a project they were working on at the university. They would run a small campaign on any issue I wanted as part of their communications and public relations course. I chose youth issues. The students—Kirsty Magee, Laura Petherbridge and Nyanna Lawton-Kirtsanis—conducted a survey of young people in the area regarding their attitude to politics, politicians and the issues they felt were important. The issues raised in their survey do not differ much from the issues we are discussing in this motion which, as I have said, was drafted by young people at a youth forum held in my office. Those issues are the perception of young people, the need for better education and the need for basic facilities such as recreational facilities.
While it is not expressly listed in the motion, one of the hot topics for discussion at the BYO was the need for a skateboard park in Blacktown. That issue came out again in the survey. The survey has reinforced the Blacktown Youth Orientation, two very different sources telling me—and, through this motion, the parliament—that there is a great deal of work to be done building the future for our young people in Western Sydney. There were also a few other points raised by the youth of Greenway in this survey: the need for better and more affordable child care, the need for better public transport and the need for more programs to limit drug and alcohol abuse.
I think the most important thing to come out of the Blacktown Youth Orientation, the seminar in my office and this report by Kirsty, Laura and Nyanna is the issue of perception. Providing services and facilities is one thing. It is fairly simple to do once the money has been allocated. You go out and build the facilities that are needed—the skateboard park, the extra basketball courts and the youth service centres. More computers in schools is a simple product of more money and I am pleased to see the IT rollout to schools announced by the New South Wales government in the recent budget. Changing perceptions—changing attitudes—is far harder to do. Stereotypes are so hard to break down, particularly when they are entrenched in the minds of many. When that stereotype is wrong, as I believe it is for the youth of Western Sydney, it is all the harder. I have hope and faith in the people like Ehsan Fallahi, Mark Grima, Pilot Officers Lennard and Lavies, Toni Collette and young people just like them, all from Western Sydney and all helping to change the perception of young people from our area. 
I believe that the programs run by local schools whereby young people visit nursing homes and spend time with the residents there help break down the perception barriers. They give young people a chance to talk to the older residents of the area, to share their life experience and to learn. They also help the older residents learn about the hopes and concerns of young people. These programs are very valuable in helping change attitudes and build our communities.
This motion goes part of the way to telling the young people of Western Sydney that their efforts are not wasted, that they are being heard and that attitudes and perceptions are changing, however slowly. The future is up for grabs and it is the young people of today who will be marking their names in the books of history that are yet to be written. The pigeonholing of people based on their geographical location I believe will become a thing of the past. And if it does not, then I believe it is the people of Western Sydney who will win out in the end.
I am indebted to the young people who attended the Blacktown Youth Orientation in my office who drafted this motion for debate today. I look forward with great interest and enthusiasm to this year's Youth Orientation, which I hope to be hosting in August. I think it will be bigger and better than last year. I look forward to the future and the world that these young people from my own area can and will create. The foundations are already there and the buildings will look magnificent once they are finished.

"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—I would like to thank the member for Greenway for the opportunity that his motion provides to focus on the benefits of Western Sydney, the resources of Western Sydney and the contribution of its residents. I acknowledge the love that the member for Greenway has for the residents in his electorate. I also acknowledge and commend the Blacktown Youth Orientation for drafting this particular motion and taking the initiative of bringing it to the House. I think the very fact that they have done this—that they have had the motivation to do this—is an encouraging sign. It runs contrary to the media stereotypes that we so often see. I am greatly encouraged that these young people are showing that they are motivated, engaged, positive and interested in what goes on in their community.
As the member for Greenway would know, I too am very committed to Western Sydney, for two reasons. One is because the area that I currently serve as the member for Macquarie includes the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury area, both parts of Western Sydney. I will return to that in a moment. But as the member for Greenway knows as well I grew up in an area that is now the area that he represents. I grew up in Blacktown and attended Blacktown North Public School—
—A great school.
—and Blacktown Boys High School—both great schools. I have much to be thankful for in terms of the education that I received at the start of my life in those schools. I have many fond memories of my 25 years in Blacktown.
Since then, I have spent close to 20 years teaching young people in high schools throughout various parts of Western Sydney. In that teaching I have learnt a lot about what motivates and inspires young people and, sadly as well, what discourages young people and causes too many of them to despair of hope and of opportunities. I have been greatly encouraged by many of the young people who I have taught during that time in both government and non-government schools throughout a number of suburbs in Western Sydney.
There is no doubt that Western Sydney is a key region in terms of the social and economic contribution that it makes to this country. The Western Sydney area includes the local government areas of Auburn, Bankstown, Baulkham Hills, Blacktown, Blue Mountains, Fairfield, Hawkesbury, Holroyd, Liverpool, Parramatta and Penrith. Already, the geographic centre of Sydney in terms of population is west of Parramatta and this region that we now define loosely as Western Sydney has as a region the third largest regional economy within Australia in terms of GDP, contributing some $35 billion a year to the national GDP. This economy—the economy of Western Sydney—is underpinned by about 60,000 businesses and a population of over 1½ million people. 
It is estimated that by the year 2001—in just 15 years time—when Sydney's population will have reached 4½ million to five million people, over two million of these people will live in the Western Sydney region in the local government areas that I have just mentioned. What makes Western Sydney tick is very much part of what makes Sydney and Australia tick. The future of Western Sydney is very much the future of Sydney, the problems of Western Sydney are very much the problems of Sydney and the views of Western Sydney have a very large influence on the views of Sydney as a whole.
I agree with many of the points that the member for Greenway has included in his motion. I agree, for instance, with his emphasis on the need for education for young people. If there is anything that provides the hope for transition from youth to adulthood with responsibility, independence and self-sufficiency, it is quality education that leads to quality employment. I notice in part (1)(d) of the motion that the member mentions a `lack of access to educational facilities, especially information technology'. There are a few points that I would like to make about the lack of education that the member for Greenway mentions.
Firstly, with regard to schools, it is worth pointing out that the coalition government have done an enormous amount in terms of their capacity to influence school education. In this year's budget we have increased funding for schools by another 6½ per cent, to $6.6 billion. We have increased funding again by almost six per cent for public schools and that will bring a total increase of 52 per cent in federal direct funding for public schools since we have been in office. In fact, we have been doing more in regard to the increase in funding for public schools than the New South Wales government has been doing. This last year we increased funding to state schools by 5.7 per cent; the New South Wales government only increased funding by 2.5 per cent. If the New South Wales government had simply matched our increase in funding, we would have another $146 million in public schools in New South Wales, much of which would be in public schools in Western Sydney.
I notice the member mentioned computers in schools. As well as this direct funding, I would just like to point out the commitment of the Commonwealth government through the computers for schools initiative. This initiative provides surplus Commonwealth government computers and IT equipment to schools across Australia to enable students and teachers to access IT technology and to have the ability to engage in that. The member for Greenway would probably be aware that just two weeks ago a number of computers and items of IT equipment were sent by the Commonwealth government to the Blacktown District office of the Department of Education and Training for distribution. That involved 61 computers and 13 boxes of peripherals—$30,000 worth—sent just two weeks ago on 6 June to the Blacktown District office for distribution to local schools. They will be distributed according to the formula: 70 per cent to public schools, 20 per cent to Catholic schools and 10 per cent to independent schools, roughly to match the proportion of students enrolled in those various types of schools. So this government are committed to assisting access to IT technology in whatever way we can.
I would add that we are very strongly committed to enhancing opportunities for vocational education. The number of vocational education places in schools has increased exponentially in the last six years since this government have been in office. We have seen a record number of apprenticeships—330,000 apprenticeships—compared to a 30-year low that had been reached under the former government. That is a commitment to providing access to training that will link into the workplace for young people in places such as Western Sydney. Just last month in the budget we committed extra incentives to help employers take on young people as apprentices, including $750 extra in incentives to employers who would provide an apprenticeship while a young person is still at school and an extra $750 incentive if they would then employ that young person when they left school. In addition to that, there is $1,000 extra incentive for employers who would provide apprenticeships in emerging high-tech and IT industries—and these are the sorts of areas that the member for Greenway mentioned. So these are extra incentives by this government for employers to take on young people to assist them to get a foot in the door, to assist them to get training, to assist them to move into employment in those emerging high-tech industries. 
While we are talking about employment, just look at the record over the last few years. When this government came into office we still had a legacy of 8.6 per cent unemployment that was left by the former government. In the last six years, over 900,000 jobs have been generated—many of those in Western Sydney, many of those in my electorate. The unemployment rate across the country has fallen in the last six years from 8.6 per cent to 6.3 per cent. I am pleased to say that my electorate—the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury—have benefited, with unemployment now down to around 4½ per cent in the Blue Mountains and around 3½ per cent in the Hawkesbury. My electorate of Macquarie—that part of Western Sydney that covers the Hawkesbury and Blue Mountains—is benefiting from the strong jobs growth that this government have managed to generate by strong emphasis on economic growth and low interest rates and on encouraging business so they can provide opportunities for our young people. I agree with the member for Greenway: our young people have enormous potential.

"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—In supporting this motion I would congratulate the honourable member for Greenway for his initiative in sponsoring the Blacktown Youth Orientation Forum and for his concern for the young people of Western Sydney. The Fowler electorate has much in common with Greenway and I am sure that the concerns of youth in the Blacktown area would be shared by young people in areas such as Liverpool, Cabramatta and Bonnyrigg. I can say that I have had similar views expressed by young people in my electorate to those reported in the orientation forum.
Fowler does, however, have an added factor. Along with the negative perception of Western Sydney, we face a media bias caused by sensationalist reporting of drug and crime gangs associated with our schools. It seems that every time there is a drug or crime issue in any school in Sydney the media head straight for Cabramatta to get a background shot of Cabramatta High School. In one Sunday paper recently, four high schools in the Fowler area were featured as the centres of drug and gang activity, but my checks with schools and police revealed that the story was nothing but a beat-up. The hundreds of students who attend these schools had to suffer the slur of having their schools falsely accused of being crime and drug dens when the truth is that they are anything but that.
Many of the kids at those schools come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Their parents often speak little or no English. They have very few resources at home. But they work hard to overcome their lack of English skills and the overall shortage of resources at home and at their schools. The staff at their schools are some of the most dedicated and hardworking teachers in the state and those same schools produce students with academic achievements well above other schools. But all that can be undone by an ignorant journalist who only wants a cheap headline. After reading what you do about Cabramatta in the press, you can only wonder what a prospective employer thinks of someone with `Cabramatta High School' on their CV. They should see that as a plus. They should see graduates of our schools as being resourceful, hardworking and able to overcome disadvantage—young people capable of making their way in a tough world and achieving success in spite of the odds. What more could an employer want? 
I do not suggest for a moment that our community does not have its problems. It will take a lot to overcome those problems. In the meantime, we could use some positive bias towards our area if we are to do the best by our young people. We could also use help in funding facilities for young people to give them a fairer chance of success in life. The motion today identifies two important needs in Western Sydney. The first of these is access to computer facilities. For education and future employment, information technology skills are essential, but many homes within my electorate do not have even basic computer equipment. The reason is that they cannot afford it. While schools are increasing their capacity, their hours are limited and students need access out of hours. Community facilities which offer extended hours for computer and Internet access would be a great help.  
The other need is for community facilities to meet the social needs of young people. Last year, I was pleased to participate in the opening of a basketball court in Cabramatta. It was not a very fancy facility—just an open court in Cabra-Vale Park—but, before it was available to the young people of Cabramatta, there was only a rough car park to play on, and even then it was only available when the cars had left. It was a much-needed facility and is now well used. But sporting facilities are not the only need. Many parts of Fowler have high levels of medium-density housing. Homes are small, so young people cannot bring friends home. There is a pressing need for social meeting places where young people can meet in a safe environment for leisure activities. I congratulate the member for Greenway for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Western Sydney</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1,speech
"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—I am delighted to participate in this debate and I want to thank the member for Greenway for bringing it on. Federal members in Western Sydney have an important leadership role in regard to our youth, and we ought to be taking up the challenge of encouraging federal, state and local authorities to pay attention to the needs of our youth. Nobody else seems to be able to fill this function of drawing attention to the needs of youth as well as federal members can, if they wish to do so. To have a forum within our office or some other public place, often in cooperation with state and local governments, where we can start to draw out the issues of concern to young people, I think is a leadership role that we ought to willingly accept. 
The problems in Western Sydney are significant but that does not mean to say that Western Sydney is a hopeless basket case. It is a most wonderful area and I really resent, with other members, the tag that is so often given to it. The people, both the older residents and the young people, have so much going for them that they have almost built a counterculture which says, `We are the West; we are proud of it; we can do it and we are better than the rest.' I endorse and support that attitude which says, `Yes, we ignore those critical comments; we ignore those people that want to put us down; we ignore those that want to say that we are second best. We will rise above that and go on and create a reputation for commitment, for hard work, for willingness to be able to overcome adversity.' I believe that that is the true heart of Western Sydney and that is the way the people feel about their opportunities. When people put down the west, it is something that I will always speak against. It is not a true representation of Western Sydney.
There are some areas that do need attention. Transport is a continuing worry for young people, because it is very hard for them to get around and they are mostly reliant on private bus services. Travelling can be a difficulty. That is something that is constantly raised with me. The problem of a lack of facilities is often raised in the region. I find amongst my colleagues in local government an unwillingness to look at these issues and see how we can enter into a partnership to provide facilities for the youth. I guess that part of the problem is that young people are only young for a short period of time and local governments have longer-term plans and therefore make commitments for longer-term projects. I do not agree that that is necessarily a good process. 
There is great cultural diversity. Employment opportunities have changed, as my colleague has said. I have noticed that, within the area of Fairfield, for instance, since 1995 unemployment amongst youth has dropped from 30.1 per cent to 22.6 per cent. It is still too high and we still need to work on it with lots of energy and lots of commitment. This government has initiated a number of programs in the family services area—for families and for relationships between fathers and their families. Right across the west, these programs are running and there are commitments of multimillion dollars. I think that we need to lift the awareness of some of the programs available to the west. In family relationships, in family education services, there was a commitment in 1998 of $6.1 million, and that is a continuing commitment. There will be more announcements this week. There are the contact orders pilot scheme and the Youth Activities Services— there are nine activities across Western Sydney under the YAS program. I have met recently with the people operating that program. They were in my electorate and it was a really wonderful occasion to spend time having a sandwich with them and working out what their priorities are. It was particularly helpful to me, and I have given that information to the minister. There is the Reconnect services program operating in Penrith, the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury.  
These are all terrific programs, but we all need to take a continuing role of support for our young people. The way that that is best done is to draw them together as the member has, to find out what their needs are, to find out how we can assist them and to devise programs. Often their needs are hard to define and it takes the skill of an older person or somebody in a position of responsibility to work out precisely how we can assist them. I want to thank the member for raising these issues. I participated in a forum of this type last week, with great benefit.

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—The state of Tasmania—and my electorate of Bass is no exception—is facing a critical shortage of dentists. Sadly, it is just another example of the myriad of problems which regional areas face. We, like so many other locations outside the mainland capital cities, have shortages of doctors, nurses, veterinary surgeons and a whole range of specialist medical positions. The Tasmanian government has called for a joint Commonwealth-state working party to consider the establishment of a dental school in Tasmania. I join with the state government in this call and urge the Minister for Education, Science and Training to immediately proceed with an initial investigation. The school would be located within the medical faculty at the University of Tasmania in Hobart. I do not make this call simply to see a new university course located within my electorate, although I am always pleased to see those. It is a far more wide-ranging issue than that. 
Tasmania is the only state without a degree course in dentistry. The ramifications are significant. In my electorate there are dentists in the largest population centre, Launceston, but with the exception of a recently opened practice in Scottsdale there are no other private practitioners. For example, the George Town area, with a population of in excess of 4,500 people, is without a permanent dental service. Whilst all states are experiencing a shortage of dentists, it is Tasmania where the shortage is most noticeable. The national average ratio of dentists to population is 43 per 100,000 people; in Tasmania it is just 26.5. It is a matter of great concern for all Tasmanians, and one which has not gone unattended by their state government.
The dental action plan announced by the Tasmanian government in the state budget will, amongst other initiatives, enable the state to offer flexible incentive packages to boost the government's own efforts to recruit more dentists in conjunction with the private sector. The plan will also enable the retraining of 30 dental therapists over the next four years to work with adult clients under supervision. But, whilst admirable and essential and going some way towards alleviating the problems we in Tasmania face, these measures will not solve the problem. 
The problem is that there is no culture of tertiary education in dentistry in Tasmania. Without a dental school in the state, there is not the same interest shown in dentistry as there is in other degrees, such as degrees in medicine—and we have our own fine medical school. Those considering a tertiary education in the medical sciences but who wish to stay in Tasmania cannot currently pursue a study of dentistry. Those who are committed to studying in the area must go elsewhere and then we are left with the problem of trying to get them to come back. And that is not easy.  
Only the smallest numbers of Tasmanians studying dentistry are indicating their intention to return home after graduation. The state government has looked at the reasons why potential candidates to practice dentistry are reluctant to come to Tasmania and in particular to practice in country centres. Whilst many have been happy to acknowledge the significant lifestyle benefits which Tasmania has to offer, it is not enough. We are currently, it would appear, not able to offer the financial incentives provided in other states. The state's new initiatives will address this issue, and in part the overall problem. But the only long-term solution is the establishment of a dental school in Hobart. We need to provide opportunities for would-be Tasmanian dentists to study at home and for those from elsewhere who would join them to be so exposed to our wonderful lifestyle that they would want to stay as well. There is no question that our chances of recruiting dentists will increase if they study within the environment in which they will work. Familiarity, we believe, is likely to breed commitment.
The shortage is impacting on both the public and private sectors. It means that a start on implementing this long-term solution must begin immediately. In the report to health ministers of November 2000, the average waiting time in Tasmania for public dental health care had risen from 30 months in 1997 to 48 months in 2000. In just three years the average waiting time had risen by 18 months. Whilst a good proportion of this can be attributed to the Howard government's decisions in 1996 to withdraw funding for dental services and abolish the Commonwealth Dental Health Program, it is exacerbated by the basic shortage of dentists.
Since the election of the current state government in 1998, the neglect of the capital needs of the state's dental services has been addressed. The mobile based children's dental service, whilst having served the state extremely well, possessed ageing infrastructure. The state government responded by investing $1.2 million in community based family dental clinics throughout the state. These provide permanent all-year access to dental services and extended hours of operation and encourage the greater involvement of parents in their children's dental care. The clinics also provide individual care programs for children with high dental needs.
The commitment of the state government has not ended there. In this year's state budget there is an allocation of $1.32 million not only to provide for the initiatives I mentioned earlier to attract more dentists and retrain dental therapists but also to reduce the backlog of Tasmanians who are waiting for dentures and to extend the partnership with the private dental sector to provide emergency care. For example, 1,000 Tasmanians who are currently waiting for dentures will receive them.
Tasmania continues to do its best. Under its new dental action plan, as I have mentioned, dental therapists will be offered the opportunity to engage in further training and education to enable them to work with adults as well as children. In order to ensure that services to children continue whilst dental therapists retrain, the state government will provide funds to enable backfilling through additional recruitment. 
Had the Australian Labor Party been elected to government last November, one of its major initiatives would have been its plan for dental health. Now, as in November 2000, low-income Tasmanians along with their fellow Australians pay more, wait longer and have less access to affordable dental care than to any other form of public health service. Under its plan, Labor would have developed a truly national approach to dental health to restore and upgrade services and in particular to ensure that low income earners would have access to the most basic of health care.
Labor would have signed a new national dental agreement in 2002 and, in partnership with the states and territories, the initial priorities would have been emergency treatment, preventative work and work force development. Labor would also have taken some direct action to address the shortages in the dental professions through a national dental work force strategy. Part of its brief would have been to attract a more diverse group of people into dentistry as a career. Specifically, in conjunction with the Australian Dental Association and our universities, the national dental work force strategy would have examined work force innovations such as vocational training for new graduates to broaden their experience and to define pathways to postgraduate specialisation and incentive programs and bonded scholarships to boost the supply of dentists in rural and remote areas, clarifying the role of dental auxiliaries and agreeing on the best way in which they could be used to complement the work of dentists. But this government decides to leave it all to the states. 
Some might argue that this is acceptable as a result of the division of powers between the Commonwealth and the states, but the problem is that the playing field is not level. Whilst each of the other states has a dental school at which its students can train and from which it can recruit its dentists, Tasmania does not have that luxury. Opportunities for further education and acquisition of new skills by practising dentists are also diminished without a dental school. Thus, even if Tasmania succeeds in initial recruitment, it may fail in retention. Without a dental school, Tasmania also suffers the disadvantage of not being able to offer the same extent of free or subsidised dental services to the less well-off, which can be provided by the mainland states in the process of training their undergraduates. My state is approaching an enormous problem with a significant disadvantage.
If the federal government chooses not to engage in a partnership with the states on dental health, it should at least acknowledge its obligations to provide all the states, particularly those which are prepared to take action to address a major problem, with an even playing field. A tertiary dental course for Tasmania is not an unreasonable ask; it is not an unreasonable request of a government which contributes to the provision of one in each of the other states. I urge the minister to take the first step—a step which might lead Tasmanians to believe that they have the same opportunity as their counterparts on the mainland to receive basic dental care when they need it.
In the time available to me, I would like to refer to a comment made by the member for Wentworth in his speech on my private members' business motion. In it, he indicated that the Australian Maritime College had received university status. Whilst we would love to see the Australian Maritime College achieve university status—and that is something that we have all been working towards—that is not the case now. The Maritime College is currently facing some kind of threat that, instead of receiving university status themselves, they may be subsumed by another university and then not granted any independence at all. I would like to see them with university status. I believe the member has probably inadvertently misled the House. I urge him, if he is interested in the future of the Australian Maritime College, to make representations to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, and the Prime Minister to ensure that not only does the Australian Maritime College become a university but that it becomes a university in such a manner as to retain its autonomy—that it is not simply subsumed by a larger organisation desperate to get some of the funding.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Health: Dental Services</title>,Grievance Debate,10,1,speech
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—This is the opposition's first response to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002. Essentially the bill attempts to impose the obligation, before an industrial organisation takes industrial action, of a secret ballot and that in reality by the scheme of the act seems to be envisaged by way of a secret postal ballot. I will go through the very complicated proceedings during my speech but perhaps not so much before this dinner adjournment. The government likes to portray modern trade unions as being made up of these ideological lemmings who are at the beck and call of these dictators who are out to seek and wreak havoc on Australian industries.
—You've got the message then!
—I can assure the minister that in my experience it is not the case and that it is a big decision to take industrial action, particularly with mortgage burdens as they exist in capital cities these days. For any worker to contemplate the loss of a day's pay or several days pay or longer is a very big decision. Workers do not go out on strike lightly; in fact, it is my experience that—if not more often than not, certainly frequently—a decision to take industrial action or to continue with industrial action is taken despite the advice of the union leadership. There is a good case in point, although he has a reputation as a pretty tough trade union official: Doug Cameron, of the Manufacturing Workers Union, recommended to mass meetings of Qantas employees that they accept a resolution of issues in dispute between the work force and Qantas, and he was rolled by the meetings of members. That is something that frequently occurs.
I also want to emphasise that trade unions are democratic organisations. Unlike corporations, all executive officers of trade unions must be elected; they cannot be appointed. Unions cannot engage professional chief executives; they must be elected. Unlike corporations elections, elections within industrial organisations must be supervised by the Australian Electoral Commission; indeed, more often than not, there is a presumption in the legislation that they will be conducted by the AEC, with the commission acting as a returning officer. So elections are very strictly conducted—indeed, controlled—by very far-reaching provisions that enable the Federal Court to conduct election inquiries. Those inquiries are not conducted as party-party litigation; they are literally inquiries where the Federal Court dispenses with the rules of evidence to ascertain whether an illegality or irregularity has occurred in the electoral process. 
A whole body of authority has developed which imposes very strict requirements of fairness and transparency in trade union elections. So, from the point of view of electoral democracy, unions are very democratic organisations. Certainly there is no comparison between the provisions that apply in respect of the election of officers of industrial organisations and those that exist in respect of the election of officers of corporations or the appointment of executive officers. In addition to that, the Workplace Relations Act—historically the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and then the Industrial Relations Act—has required the rules of industrial organisations to provide for the control of committees of management by the members of the organisation. This is the requirement of institutional democracy or participatory democracy. Under the rules members are able to challenge decisions of the executive, usually by way of a plebiscite—that is, a certain number of members can call for a decision made by the executive or committee of management to be reviewed.
The point I want to make is that there are already structures in place; indeed, the provisions of the legislation which deal with the internal governance of trade unions contains the objects. The objects are to encourage the democratic control of organisations and to encourage members of organisations to participate in the affairs of the organisations as well as the efficient management of organisations, but these provisions have not been put into that part of the act which is based on those objects but placed very much in the context of the resolution of dispute provisions contained earlier in the act.
In that context, we are looking at some pretty convoluted provisions. We have perhaps reached a new era in legislation in the country whereby no longer will Collins Street lawyers and Phillip Street lawyers be content with whimpy sections such as section 170VBK or even section 170WHD. If this legislation passes, they will be in great ecstacy presenting their submissions and referring to section 170NBCQ. They will even have the opportunity to refer to paragraphs of subclauses of parts of section 170NBGBC.
—Sounds like the name of a trade union, doesn't it!
—I suppose the acronym does. The minister is on the record as saying that he is fully post-Marxist, but this bill will introduce an extraordinary amount of bureaucracy. Indeed, it has been put to me that the extent of bureaucracy contained in these provisions would make Yuri Andropov blush with embarrassment.
I want to stress in my speech that if these provisions are approved, they will be imposed on top of existing very strict provisions on enterprise bargaining in relation to notice provisions, identifying the subject matter of the dispute and appropriate time limits. In 1993 the Keating government permitted industrial action either by an organisation or by employees in pursuit of enterprise negotiations, but it was on the basis of very strict requirements regarding these notice provisions. The former legislation had very sensible provisions that enabled the commission to control the process by directing the parties to negotiate in good faith.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
—Earlier, before the dinner adjournment, I set out those provisions of the legislation which require the democratic control of trade unions and stated the fact that members must have the ability, under the rules of trade unions, to control committees of management by way of calling plebiscites and so forth. So there is already ingrained in the act this concept of participatory democracy rather than electoral democracy. In other words, rather than simply electing the officials, the rules must provide for a review of decisions of the committee of management.
In addition, there are very strict requirements in the act with regard to taking industrial action to initiate a bargaining period and taking industrial action to progress an industrial dispute. At this point one of our real regrets is that, because of a diminished role of the industrial commission as an independent umpire, increasingly we are seeing both parties taking to the law of the jungle in order to advance their interests. On the one hand, unions are resorting to direct industrial action, because they cannot get an arbitrated outcome; on the other hand, there are many more examples of employers engaging in lockouts often for several months at a time. So we say it is imperative that whatever government is in power the provisions of good faith bargaining should be restored in this legislation. But, be that as it may, the provisions are not there any longer. The government's philosophy is that third-party intervention in the workplace is inappropriate. We, of course, have a different view.  
In order to initiate this direct action there are very strict requirements, and I will outline those. Firstly, a bargaining period has to be validly initiated. Secondly, employers or employees are required to give at least three days written notice with the nature of the proposed action. Thirdly, the industrial action has to be preceded by an attempt to reach agreement. Fourthly, the industrial action by an organisation of employees has to be duly authorised by the organisation's committee of management. Fifthly, the industrial action could not involve personal injury, wilful or reckless damage to property or the unlawful taking or use of property. Sixthly, if the Industrial Relations Commission sees the value in ordering a secret ballot of employees, such industrial action has to be approved by a majority in the coalition.
The coalition predicted that with the advent of legislation in 1993 there would be an outbreak of industrial disputation; there was not. In fact, from the period of the Fraser government when the yearly average was 590 days lost per 1,000 employees, industrial disputes steadily declined under the Labor government—so by January 1993 there were only 148 days lost per 1,000 employees and by January 1996, barely two years after the enterprise bargaining reforms, there were only 80 days lost per 1,000 employees. Indeed, that was during a period when the commission had a supervisory role through its ability to enforce good faith bargaining—a facilitative provision to try to achieve enterprise outcomes.
It follows from the 1980s and the 1990s when there was a genuine realisation by all concerned in industrial relations that if Australia was to prosper economically we had to focus on world's best practice management and productivity techniques, and a tremendous amount was done. I can say from first-hand experience that on a number of occasions I represented trade unions, primarily during that period before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. More times than I can count the commission sent the parties away—the employees and the employers—because the commission were not satisfied that the productivity improvements properly justified the wage increases. This philosophy went right through the eighties and the nineties, particularly in 1993 when enterprise bargaining was sanctioned by legislation. 
With the facilitative provisions of the commission we saw a continuation of productivity improvements ingrained with this philosophy and wage increases based on those improvements. Quite frankly, I think the government are doing an injustice if they do not acknowledge that the infrastructure that was created during that period has been a significant factor in Australia's current economic prosperity. But, be that as it may, the focus of both parties was on productivity outcomes—yes, growing the cake, not simply dividing the cake—but with the commission having a role as a facilitator.
The reality is that the coalition has been saying that what is needed in industrial relations is deregulation of the labour market, and in terms of deregulation I do not know where this bill fits in. If this bill is passed, it will add about 40 pages of very complex legislation to the Workplace Relations Act and will add an incredible degree of complexity. The bill will require, for instance, the following steps to be followed before an employee can take protected industrial action. Taking account of these procedures will be laborious and boring but, to understand the impracticality of them, it is necessary to set them out. 
Firstly, an employee or union must apply to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for an order that a secret ballot be held. If no union is present, the employee cannot even make an application, unless doing so has the support of a prescribed number of employees. If there are fewer than 80 relevant employees, the prescribed number is four. If there are between 80 and 5,000 employees, the prescribed number is five per cent. If there are more than 5,000 employees, the prescribed number is 250. The bill does not make clear what constitutes support for an application for a secret ballot. Is it moral support, some words of encouragement, a pat on the back or perhaps a secret ballot itself about whether or not an application should be made for a secret ballot? Not to worry—there is always litigation in the common law courts. My mates in the legal profession are doing very well out of this government's focus on common law—the pursuit of penalties and trying to resolve complexities—as a result of the strategies being pursued by the government, but it is not achieving productive outcomes. Instead of the focus being on improving productivity partnerships between employers and employees, the focus is on antagonism. 
Returning to the ongoing assessment of the procedures, the application must also set out the question or questions to be put to the relevant employees in the ballot including, quite specifically, the nature of the proposed industrial action, details of the types of employees who are to be balloted and any details required by the rules, which have not as yet been made—that is, the rules which will be made if this legislation is passed. The application must be accompanied by a copy of the notice initiating the bargaining period, the particulars accompanying that notice and a declaration that the proposed industrial action does not relate to an objectionable provision, as set out in section 170NBBB. If you can get all that paperwork in order, you might have a valid application for a secret ballot, but a flaw in any of these complicated procedures can result in a ballot being challenged.
The commission must give the parties the opportunity to make submissions about whether a ballot should be held. We are now up to section 170NBCB, and we have some more ground to cover until we get to the end of these provisions, where 170NBDE results, if its provisions are satisfied, in a ballot being held. But I will press on. The commission must then satisfy itself that the applicant for a ballot has genuinely tried and is genuinely trying to reach an agreement with the employer. It also must consider whether the proposed ballot is not inconsistent with the object of establishing a transparent process, which allows employees directly concerned to choose, by means of a fair and democratic secret ballot, whether to authorise industrial action. 
The commission must be satisfied that the applicant has not, at any time, contravened the secret ballot provisions of the act. If the commission is satisfied of all these things, it must frame an order for the ballot specifying the name of the applicant or agent, the types of employees who are to be balloted, the voting method, the timetable for the ballot, the name of the person authorised by the commission to conduct the ballot—and that is a significant issue in itself, as to whether that person will have the qualifications and skills necessarily to properly conduct a ballot—and the name of the person authorised by the commission to be the independent adviser for the ballot. These provisions, if they are passed, will create an industry—a very lucrative industry—in terms of independent advisers and those engaged by the respective parties challenging or defending these provisions.
I return again to the government's repeated assertions that it desires to remove the third party from the employment relationship. Yet, with this bill, the government proposes not only a third party in the form of the commission but also a fourth and fifth party in the form of the person conducting the ballot and the person who is the independent adviser for the ballot. As I have said, these provisions will create, if they are passed, an industry in itself. 
I return again to the actual order, because we have not yet reached the end of the matters which must be established before the application is dealt with—the commissioner cannot put his pen down yet. If the application is valid, the orders will set out, firstly, the questions to be put to the relevant employees in the ballot, including the nature of the proposed industrial action; secondly, the voting method, which must be a postal ballot, unless a more efficient and expeditious method can be found, so that presumption necessarily involves mail delay; thirdly, the quorum that must apply to the ballot, if it is to be lower than 40 per cent; and, fourthly, the period of notice required before industrial action can be taken, if it is to be longer than three days. 
We are now up to section 170NBCK, and this is where the fun really begins for the commission. The commission must now compile a roll of eligible voters—who is a current employee, who is casual, who has resigned and who is a new employee. The commission is given the power to require the employer and the union to provide a list of names and any other information it is reasonable to require to assist the completion of the roll. Again, employers will be really grateful for that additional burden! But what if that information provided to the commission is inaccurate? Will there be a challenge to the process? These are all complications that, no doubt, if the legislation were passed, would be tried in the courts. Things would get bogged down and we would not progress in dealing with the actual matters in dispute, which is where we say the focus of industrial relations should be.
Moving on to further complexities, an employee is an eligible voter only if they were employed on the day the ballot order was made—clearly that is a complexity in terms of determining the roll. If the applicant for the ballot is a union, then the employee must have been a member of that union on the day the ballot order was made. Do they need to have been a financial member or a part-paying member of the union? How do we determine these things? They are not an eligible voter if they were subject to an Australian workplace agreement on the day the ballot order was made. These are all tremendous administrative complexities that the parties will confront.
Once the roll has been drawn up, there is an opportunity for employees to apply to have their names either added to or removed from the roll. Clause 170NBDA of the bill heralds the arrival—not before time—of ballot day, when employees finally breathe the sweet air of this new democracy that the government has promised them. Exhausted after having spent many days compiling paperwork, appearing before the commission and finalising their rolls, their minds have long since turned from reaching an agreement with their employer. Their one goal is to cast their vote so that they can go on strike. This is where a paradox occurs, because going through all these complexities will actually lock the parties into a predetermined course of action despite the ongoing progress of negotiations, which tend to be fluid in these matters. Having gone through the effort and the expense, it is very unlikely they will depart from that. So, far from preventing industrial action occurring, it may well lock parties into taking the action.
The ballot paper must be prepared and copied, and it must be in the prescribed form. It must include the name of the applicant or their agent, the type of employee to be balloted, the name of the ballot agent authorised to conduct the ballot, the question or questions to be put to the employees, a statement that a voter's vote is secret and that the voter is free to choose whether or not to support the proposed industrial action—which makes sense—and instructions to the voter on how to complete the ballot paper. Once the ballot has been held, the votes counted and any disputes about irregularities put to rest, the ballot agent declares the result and informs the parties. While that paperwork is finalised, including the ballot agent's report and the publication of the ballot results by the Industrial Registrar, the employees turn their minds to clause 170NBDD to see if they can take industrial action.
One by one, they have to check off the requirements: firstly, that the action was the subject of a protected action; secondly, that the prescribed percentage of persons on the roll of voters for the ballot voted—that figure is 40 per cent by default—thirdly, that more than 50 per cent of the votes validly cast were votes approving the action; and, finally, that the action commences within 30 days of the declaration of the result of the ballot. This is, again, a paradox: you are actually compelled to take the action within that 30 days, even if the negotiations in the workplace are progressing in a constructive fashion. Then, of course, employees must satisfy the existing requirements of the act regarding notice provisions. They must prepare their notices, serve them on the employer and wait three days. Exhausted, frustrated and having thought through these procedures again, how inclined are they going to be to sit down and resolve the dispute as opposed to continuing with what has been a predetermined outcome, effectively, from the time these procedures were commenced? 
If we look at the time scale involved, we are going to lose at least one working day to prepare, file and serve the application and for the parties to prepare their submissions to the commission. We will be looking at at least two working days for the commission to determine the application—longer, of course, when the commission is busy and cannot list the matter. We will be looking at at least one working day for the commission, in consultation with the parties, to prepare the roll of voters—but I think a more realistic assessment is probably a week for that to occur in terms of crosschecking whether someone has resigned and so forth—and for the ballot papers to be drawn up, sent to the printers and returned from the printers. Again, I think a week realistically accounts for that period. We will be looking at at least six working days for the ballot to be held. In terms of the postal system, I think it would be three days out, three days in at the very least. We will be looking at at least one working day for the votes to be counted, a report prepared and the results published. We will be looking at at least three more working days being the required notice for the protected action. 
We are looking at at least 15 working days or three calendar weeks for industrial action for this procedure to be followed. It, as I have said, will probably be counterproductive. It is three weeks away from the ongoing process of negotiations and, indeed, it is quite inconsistent when you look at these strictures. They do not impose anything of a similar nature on employers before they conduct a lockout, for instance. There is no requirement for a vote of shareholders. These procedures cannot be justified. It is the policy of the ACTU and, indeed, the practice of trade unions, because of the significance of industrial action, to seek the opinion of their members through a ballot held at the workplace through a show of hands. These procedures add unnecessary complications and will not further the resolution of industrial disputes.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—I rise to talk on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002. This bill aims to protect jobs by ensuring democracy so that workers who will be most affected by going on strike will have an unfettered say about whether they want to do so. Let me take the House back in history to the early mid-1960s when I was a young married man, working as a slaughterman in an abattoir in Melbourne, whose wife had just given birth to a child. I can vividly recall over a three-year period being out on strike for 15 months. That is, five months in every year. Imagine how difficult that was for a young married man, coming from a low income working-class background, to survive and trying to support a child in an environment where the basic wage in the meat processing industry for a slaughterman in those days was in the vicinity of 23—about $46. To compound that issue, in those days workers compensation was not as generous as it is today. I frequently had serious injuries because of my ambidextrous method of slaughtering using either my left or right hand. I suffered a number of very serious cuts and was out of work for a number of months and my wage was reduced to eight guineas—about $17—per week. That was done in an environment where I was paying eight guineas per week for my rent alone and trying to support a wife and child. 
As a result of those strikes, abattoir closures became more and more frequent. There was a loss of jobs and export markets, and a reputation of unreliability in the supply of meat exports to overseas markets. The reason that I stand here tonight to talk on this particular bill is that the votes that occurred, which stimulated those strikes, were done by a show of hands. It was done in an environment where a number of union heavies used to stand around the room and look at the people who were voting. Needless to say, those people who wanted to work were intimidated into ensuring the status quo prevailed with a show of hands voting pattern. Because of that, in the time that I have been in parliament, I have been determined to be the ALP's nemesis. I am here as a working-class individual, as a former trade unionist, to constantly remind them of the union's actions in preventing a person like me exercising their right to work. The ALP puts unions before jobs of Australian workers. The ALP shuns democracy because unions tell it to. The ALP's own internal processes deny fair say to ALP members and give unfair say to unions, just as the absence of a secret ballot before strike action denies fair say to workers and gives unfair say to unions. The ALP will not fetter this unfair say, just as the Leader of the Opposition's mooted 50-50 rule will not do anything to fetter the unfair say that unions have in the affairs of the ALP.  
I listened very intently to the contribution by the member for Barton. He reminded me of an article attributed to him in the Sydney Morning Herald on 30 November last year. He said this when talking on `Secret ballots—a hostage to unions':
I made a lot of money appearing in trade union election inquiries. It's easy to challenge a ballot ... it would open up our industrial relations system to this sort of attack. It would neuter the ability of unions to engage in collective bargaining ... because the unions can no longer seek an arbitration of their claims.
I am not a lawyer; I am not a person who holds a tertiary degree, but I think I know—and have experienced—a lot more about the issue of hard knocks and trying to work and support a family than many of the trade union officials on the other side of the House. The one thing that I vividly recall is that when we were out on strike, because of the voting system within that particular union of the day, the trade union officials were earning their weekly executive wage and driving their vehicles without any care or concern for people like me struggling to make a living. 
Let us contrast the Australian Labor Party with the Leader of the Labour Party in the UK, because in Britain the Labour government has had the courage to implement secret ballots. Tony Blair had the courage to stand up to the unions, to introduce one vote one value within his party, and democratic principles in the workplace. As he told the trades union conference in 1997: 
Better to let a ballot decide the issue rather than an industrial dispute which is the present law. We are not going back to the days of industrial warfare, strikes within ballots, mass flying pickets and secondary action. You do not want it, and I will not let it happen. 
That was in a speech to the trades union conference on 9 September 1997. Let us compare Blair's courage in standing up to the unions, who previously controlled his party, to that of the current Leader of the Opposition. On 25 November last year, the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, confidently predicted that `the influence of trade unions necessarily has to wane.' That was a comment in the Australian Financial Review on 26 November 2001. Two days later he attended the closed door meeting at the ACTU headquarters after which he emerged to declare:
I'm not Tony Blair and I won't forget where I come from ... I'm not interested in the Third Way. 
That was a comment made at the ACTU headquarters on 1 December 2001. The Leader of the Opposition said that because influence in the Labor Party is bought and controlled by union money. Simon Crean should consider Tony Blair's advice:
Modernise your political structures as we have done in the Labour Party. The country actually knows that influence with this Government and with me is not determined by anything other than the persuasiveness of your argument. That is the right way and it is the truth. The old ways of the Labour Party were the resolutionists, the committee rooms, the fixing and the small groups trying to run the show. That has no future ...
That speech was to the TUC on 9 September 1997. What did the Leader of the Opposition come up with? He came up with a comment in a speech to the National Left Conference on 11 May this year. In part, he said:
... I believe we need to change from 60:40 to 50:50 because we have got to deal with the perception issue of that. 
But as Neville Wran said:
It doesn't give a tinker's curse, whether it's 60/40, 50/50, that's a symbolic thing.
Neville Wran said that to the New South Wales State Labor Conference at the Sydney Town Hall on 26 May 2002, as reported on the ABC that evening. The comments of the member for Werriwa are pertinent to this debate, and I think he is right. On Sunday Sunrise on 25 November 2001 he said:
... we have to face the reality that union coverage in the workforce has fallen to just 25%. But unions still have 60% of the delegates at our conferences, so it's pretty clear that 60 doesn't go into 25. 60 doesn't go into 25, and there will have to be some adjustment, so we'll be making those adjustments.
Let us ask some questions about the bill that need to be answered. First, why aren't the existing provisions that allow secret ballots sufficient? The answer is this: existing secret ballot provisions in the Workplace Relations Act give the commission discretion to order secret ballots. These provisions are rarely used. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations has been able to identify only seven secret ballots ordered under the existing Workplace Relations Act in the last eight years. Only some of these ballots related to taking industrial action. Generally, those that do relate to taking industrial action are held while the industrial action is ongoing and do not seek approval prior to the industrial action commencing. As only a handful of instances of industrial action have been preceded by independently ordered secret ballots, most decisions to take industrial action are unregulated. There is no guarantee that all workers are consulted about or genuinely support taking industrial action. The existing provisions have not provided enough protection to workers who feel pressured into taking industrial action. The proposed changes to the Workplace Relations Act will ensure that a decision to take industrial action is both democratic and genuine.
Secondly, will the bill impede employees taking industrial action? The bill proposes a streamlined process for holding a secret ballot, providing for prompt consideration of applications by the commission and allowing ballots to be completed quickly with minimal procedural impediments thus minimising disruption to employers and employees. Appeals to the courts against the validity of ballots will be limited so that the conduct of ballots and any industrial action authorised by ballots is not delayed by legal challenges. That is of some concern to opposition members who have come out of the legal profession. The bill will allow for attendance ballots to be conducted and it sets a target of 10 working days to complete such a ballot. Preindustrial action ballots are routine in the UK, Ireland and Germany. Industrial action has continued to occur in these countries.
Thirdly, is the ballot process provided for in the bill consistent with International Labour Organisation standards? In general, the International Labour Office considers that the prerequisites for rendering industrial action lawful should be reasonable and not place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to unions. The approach taken for this secret ballot bill has been developed following consultation with the International Labour Office with a view to ensuring that the underlying elements of the model for secret ballots meet Australia's international obligations. I commend the minister on ensuring that that process took place. The government believes that the proposed system of secret ballots is appropriate for Australian conditions and that it meets international standards.
Fourthly, why is there no ballot for returning to work or for the approval of a certified agreement? A secret ballot will not compel employees to take part in industrial action. Any employee will be free to choose not to participate or to stop participating in authorised action at any time. The industrial action can end without a ballot being conducted. I was never given that opportunity as a trade unionist. It is possible for the parties to reach agreement at any time in the course of the negotiations for an agreement. Agreement may be reached prior to any or all of the authorised industrial action occurring. In this case, the industrial action would cease without the need for any procedural steps. The government's focus in this bill is on the decision to commence industrial action. The decision to return to work or the decision to approve or not to approve a proposed agreement can be matters of disagreement between members or employees but they are not ones that the government considers as sensitive as a decision to commence industrial action. 
Fifthly, why is there no requirement for an employer to have a ballot before a lockout? While an employee may be a company made up of shareholders, the employer remains a single legal entity. It is a single entity that enters into the agreement. As such, it is not appropriate for there to be a legislative requirement for a ballot to be held to determine the view of shareholders on taking industrial action or any other matter relating to agreement making. Such a requirement would take decisions about agreement making away from the level of the workplace and out of the hands of the people who are directly responsible for agreement negotiation.
Sixthly, why are secret ballots necessary? Often when unions organise industrial action they fail to seek membership approval for the action, and I have experienced that. Even when union officials do seek the approval of members, they mostly use hands up votes during union meetings—the intimidatory approach. This type of process requires members to make a decision about taking industrial action in an environment where they may be subjected to considerable pressure. The introduction of preindustrial action secret ballots will ensure that employees, not union officials, make decisions about whether or not industrial action is taken. This places decision making power where it belongs: at the workplace level in the hands of the employees directly involved. The Workplace Relations Act provides protection from civil liability for industrial action taken in the pursuit of certified agreements. This is an important protection and should not be used frivolously. It should only be used in accordance with the wishes of the employees.
Finally, what is the international experience of prestrike ballots? Preindustrial action secret ballots are an accepted part of the workplace relations landscape in a number of comparable countries, including Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Germany. In most cases, the secret ballot requirement has been introduced through legislation, although interestingly in Germany unions have realised the benefits of democratic decision making processes even without such a legislative requirement and generally incorporate preindustrial action secret ballots as part of their organisational rules. In the UK, where secret ballots had been operating since 1987 and where they were retained by the Blair government, they have attracted support among trade union leaders. There is evidence to show that there has been a reduction in industrial disputation in the UK since the introduction of secret ballots.
However, the secret ballot arrangements proposed in the bill do not simply imitate those operating in Canada, Ireland or the United Kingdom. The government's arrangements must necessarily be uniquely developed to suit Australian conditions and institutions. Despite the differences, the bill reflects the shared recognition that a secret ballot is the best mechanism for ensuring democratic decision making in relation to industrial action.
It is because of those particular points that I have a great deal of pride in standing here supporting the minister's vision in introducing secret ballots for protected action through this Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002. I am quite sure that those thinking men and women out there in the trade union movement working for and on behalf of companies as trade union members will thank him for trying to introduce this bill, although I do not give it much show of getting through because of the restrictive way in which the Senate—the upper house of this parliament—operates. Having made those comments, bear in mind that the Democrats, who are supposed to be an independent group set up by a former Liberal to keep—I will not say the word—the so-and-sos honest, have abrogated their responsibility to the Australian community by becoming no more than an industrial wing of the Australian Labor Party. They ought to be ashamed of that. They ought to hang their heads in shame every time they go out into the street and face the good, honest working men and women of this great nation of ours. I support the bill. ",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—Tonight, in the form of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002, we are seeing another one of this government's infamous workplace relations packages of bills. We all know what they are: they are the bills that the government has in reserve for those occasions when it needs a filler to cover a gap in its legislative program or when it wants to create division in the Australian community. The previous speaker gave the game away. He knows and the government knows that these bills are unlikely to pass the Senate. The government has tried to get these bills through the Senate year in, year out.
The government has an unhealthy obsession with trade unions—and lately, I must say, with the internal workings of the Labor Party. What you find with the previous speaker is that he and the government say, `You should have secret ballots in union industrial action. You should have democracy there.' But he does not accept the democratic answer at the last elections in the Senate. He thinks it is terrible because you should have democracy on strike action but you cannot have democracy in the Senate where a majority of the senators will reject this legislation—as they have in the past.
It is also unfair for the previous speaker and those before him to compare the Australian industrial relations system to the British system. Some of the unions in the UK in the eighties and early nineties were out of control. They had no interest in their members' best interests and all they were interested in doing was exercising power on their own behalf. But one of the problems that the government in the UK had was it did not have a mechanism to resolve some of this. The interesting difference between the system in the UK and the system here in Australia is that for 100 years in Australia we have had a mechanism called the Industrial Relations Commission which has been the vehicle for resolving industrial disputes. The industrial culture in Australia is dramatically different from the industrial culture in Britain, particularly from the industrial culture as it was in Britain in the eighties and early nineties. But what you see again with the government's unhealthy obsession with the work of unions and of unionists is that the government also wants to destroy the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the Australian atmosphere.
In debate, the government is saying, `We want to have secret ballots in unions but we won't accept that the Senate, who are elected by a secret ballot, can reject this legislation.' They say they think what has happened in the UK is terrible. But here in Australia, where you have a mechanism—the Industrial Relations Commission—that has resolved many of the problems that the UK system could not resolve, they want to destroy that mechanism. What this government is really about is setting one Australian against another. There is nothing particularly urgent about this legislation. It is not urgent and it is not necessary but it is provocative and that is what the government wants. It has a lot to do with workers and unions and the government's ideological campaign against workers, and union members in particular.
Like the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002 that was recently debated in this chamber, this legislation uses what have come to be recognised as emotive terms: secret ballots, lockouts, industrial action. These words conjure up visions of enforced union membership, strikes, standover bullying tactics and all that so-called nasty blue-collar stuff which we have heard the previous speaker talk about that the government and the previous speaker would like the general public to focus on whenever the issue of workplace relations is raised—not to focus on the fact that Australia has fewer strikes than most other OECD countries or the fact that the union movement here in Australia invariably works more with government and employers to help create employment than to create the devilment that you had in some parts of the UK economy late in the last century.
This legislation is another attempt by the government to chip away at Australia's industrial relations traditions. It is not about making improvements; it is about making the system more complicated and less able to work. It is provocative, unduly complicated legislation. Rather than simplify and improve the current system, it will make it more cumbersome and bureaucratic. That suits the minister and it suits the government. They know the system at present is not broke, so they want to legislate changes that will make it broke. In fact, it is not difficult to imagine that employees could become so frustrated with the bureaucratic demands that this legislation would make that they would be pushed into taking illegal action in an attempt to move things along. The more cynical amongst us could be excused for thinking that that is probably what the government wants. It wants employees to be provoked into taking illegal industrial action so that the government can then take action against them. The government certainly does not want to help workers—or `employees', to use the government's preferred politically correct term when it comes to describing workers in legislation. 
The ACTU's submission to the Senate inquiry into the five separate workplace relations bills that we currently have before us in the parliament makes some interesting points about this particular bill, which are worth having on the record during this debate. They will help illustrate the general comments that I have just made. In its submission the ACTU said to the Senate committee:
The process for obtaining and implementing an order for a secret ballot set out in the Bill adds additional time-consuming complexity to the taking of protected industrial action, reflected in the approximately 35 pages which would be added to the Act if the Bill was to be passed.
And this is a government that talks about legislative simplicity! It wants to legislate to simplify the tax act but at the same time to complicate the industrial relations act. The submission continues:
The ACTU submits that the process would be of such complexity that it would nullify any practical right to take protected action.
The ACTU's submission also contained some interesting quotes from a letter sent from the ILO to the relevant government department about where the legislation might stand in relation to the ILO's principles and standards of freedom of association. One of the main concerns of the Freedom of Association Branch of the ILO was that the adoption of secret ballots as provided by this legislation should not make the exercise of the right to strike very difficult. To quote part of the correspondence:
... any legislation that is finally adopted on compulsory strike ballots will need to be considered in the context of the industrial relations legislation as a whole, in particular all the legislative requirements in order to call a lawful strike, to ensure that the cumulative effect of such legislation, by virtue of its complexity and extent, is not such as to make it very difficult from a practical point of view to declare a legal strike, or to declare a strike in a timely manner.
Of course, we know what the government really wants is to make it as difficult as possible.
In his second reading speech the minister stated:
The bill ... incorporates measures which ILO officials have indicated would be consistent with ILO standards.
That sounds like ILO endorsement, does it not? Well, I do not think so. I do not believe that the government has asked the ILO to look at the legislation in its full context as has been stated by the ILO. It has taken some ILO comments and concerns on board, but it has not been open with either the International Labour Organisation or the Australian people on this issue because it is not the government's intention or in the government's interests to be open. The government just wants to complicate the issue and that is what this package of workplace relations bills is all about: complicating the issue so that employees—workers—will suffer and any chance of a good system of industrial relations in Australia will be destroyed. That is all part of the government's ideological confrontational approach.
We only have to remember the Patrick dispute. Remember the preferred approach of the previous Minister for Industrial Relations? What a low point that was in the activities of government and some employers. The government then spent months and years running away from Peter Reith's arrangements with the Patrick dispute. It seems that the current minister wants to emulate the model established by Peter Reith when he was minister, except I think the current minister wants to make it a badge of honour to go even further. We are all aware of the past boxing prowess of the current minister, Mr Abbott, and his generally punchy nature. He seems to want to be even more hairy chested and punchy than Peter Reith. The minister might well remember that, in the end, Peter Reith punched himself right out of the ring. 
All this bill will do is strengthen the position of employers in industrial disputes. It will upset the level playing field. It will not help anyone who is a worker or an employee. It serves the needs of the privileged in society, the friends and supporters of the current government. It will make it more difficult for workers to take industrial action. Again, as we have seen in other workplace relations legislation, the description of the legislation and the words used in the legislation are misleading. Most people are happy to vote on industrial action. We have heard previous speakers outline the general approach that the union takes. Whether the ballot is secret or not is irrelevant. Sometimes there are secret ballots; sometimes there may be a show of hands. What is insidious about this legislation is that it is not really about secret ballots for protected action. It is yet another step in the government's agenda to make the whole issue of unions and strike taking an incredibly complicated process.
To go back to the ACTU submission to the Senate committee, the ACTU make a very valid point. They say:
The ACTU supports the right of union members to vote on whether or not to take industrial action, and believes such votes are generally taken. It should be noted that a number of unions routinely use—
note the word `routinely'—
secret ballots prior to taking industrial action. No evidence has been adduced showing that unionists are being forced or required to take industrial action against their will, or without their consent. The fact that in many disputes not all union members participate, is evidence of the lack of coercion, which would, in any event, be unlawful.
You could bet your life, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if unions were indulging in unlawful activity this minister would be the first person to try and strike them down. He would be the first person to have them in court. The fact that the minister has not managed to mount a prosecution for coercion for people being involved in protected action highlights the fact that this legislation is not necessary. There you have it. The big bogeyman image of unions, which the government would like people to think is exemplified by the ACTU, does not look quite so terrible at all, does it? In fact it is the government that looks more like the bogeyman here. It is the government that continually conjures up—with these emotional terms—the image of industrial turmoil and unreasonable strikes. We heard today at question time a barrage from the government about the recent action at BHP in Victoria. But what ended up happening there in the end? In the end, the unions and management resolved the dispute. In the end, you had the employers coming out and saying that the minister seemed to be playing this for his own political gain, not to help them or to help the employees. 
We have a government that has a very unhealthy obsession with trade unions in this country. We have a government that has a very unhealthy obsession with the internal workings of the Labor Party. We have a government that is willing to do anything to try and take the spotlight off its own failings and try and use all this emotive language to conjure up a problem that is not there.
There is no need for this legislation. There already exists provision for secret ballots to be held. It is an awful indictment of the government that it can cause resources to be devoted to unnecessary legislation such as this when there are so many other areas which need legislative change. The government wastes valuable, scarce legislative programming time on ideologically inspired legislation rather than face up to the real needs of Australians.
As I said earlier, the previous government speaker gave the game away. The government knows that this bill has little chance of passing the Senate. It has rolled up bills like this time and time again. They get defeated in the Senate time and time again. The government knows this bill will not get through. The reason it will not get through is not because of the intransigence of the Senate or, as the previous speaker said, the Democrats acting as the industrial arm of the Labor Party. First off, the government says it is unions who are the industrial arm of the Labor Party and we should have an obsession with them. Now the government thinks the Democrats are the industrial arm of the Labor Party, so it has an obsession with them. The reason this legislation will not pass is that it is bad legislation. For that reason, it should not pass this House and I hope it will not pass the Senate. ",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—It is my great pleasure this evening to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002. What we are talking about this evening is a bill that aims to protect jobs by ensuring democracy. One of the fundamental rights that a democracy like Australia has is that you can have secrecy in the way that you conduct your own affairs, your private business. I am going to take us back into a little bit of history, which might waken the nerves of some of those in the Labor Party. They talk about being the party for the worker. That is the biggest furphy doing the rounds of this country. The Labor Party is not for the worker; it is for the elites of the Labor Party and the trade union movement.
This evening, I want to establish the links between the Australian Labor Party and the unions of this country—to make it quite clear how these two are linked and why this bill is important not only to the unions but to the Australian Labor Party. We know in this place—we have been told ad infinitum—that the Labor Party has, as a party rule, 60 per cent union control in its preselections and in much of its state executives. As a result, the people it puts in here come from very colourful Labor Party and union backgrounds. We know that most of the people on the other side of this House come from union backgrounds. There is nothing wrong with that, but you just have to understand who owns them. They are not their own people; they are put here by the 60 per cent rule currently existing for preselection to this House.We know that most of the people sitting on the front bench over there—60 per cent of them—have a union pedigree, one way or another. What is more, we know it is a rule of the Australian Labor Party that every member of the Labor Party must belong to a union. If they are not a member of a union before they come into this House, they must choose a union to belong to before they continue.
So we establish the links to the fact that the members of the Australian Labor Party are controlled largely by the union movement, their masters. As a result, they are opposing this fundamental move towards democracy that allows people to have privacy in the way that they vote. Just imagine if you were at school and you were running a class and they have the election for prefects and some kid is leaning over the desk and saying, `Hey, you've got to vote for my mate'—leaning on you. This is what happens in the Australian work force at the moment. When they go to have ballots on the work sites, they are not secret ballots; these people are intimidated. Why do they want a show of hands? Because they want to know who did not vote their way. Why do they want to eyeball the people that are not voting their way? Because they want to intimidate them. We know they have these big thugs walking around workplaces eyeing off people who do not vote the way they want them to.
We know, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams—and you would know in your lumber trade—that in the Australian work force if you do not toe the line as far as the union is concerned you are dealt with. I was talking to a plumber today, and on sites if the blokes do not put up their hands and vote they are considered as having not voted for them. So what do they do? They take retribution. They fill up their pipes with concrete and so on. They stop jobs. They threaten their ability to get on site if they are contractors.
I really want to take this back to the links that the Labor Party should be supporting, and I want to talk about the movement of people called the Chartists, a British working-class movement for parliamentary reform named after the People's Charter, a bill drafted by London radical William Lovett in May 1838—164 years ago democracy came into the work force through the Chartists. This is something that the Labor Party might want to take on board as a result of the fact that they claim—as we know, quite falsely—to represent the working people in this country. If they want to take a leaf out of the book of the People's Charter, it contains six demands: votes for all men, equal electoral districts, the abolition of requirements that members of parliament be property owners, payment for MPs, annual general elections and secret ballots. They are the six points that the Chartists in 1838 brought before the working-class people of Britain. 
Chartism was the first movement both working class in character and national in its scope that grew out of the protests against social injustices out of the new industrial order of Britain—very noble, and something that you would think the Labor Party in this country would be taking on board, with one of the demands being secret ballots. The movement was born amid the economic depression of 1837-38, when high unemployment and the effects of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 were felt in all parts of Britain. Lovett's charter provided a program acceptable to heterogeneous working-class populations. The movement swelled to national importance under the vigorous leadership of an Irishman named Feargus Edward O'Connor, who stumped the nation in 1838 in support of these six points.
A Chartist convention met in London in February 1839 to prepare a petition to present to the parliament. `Ulterior measures' were threatened should parliament ignore their demands—in other words, they got a bit threatening—but the delegates differed in their degrees of militancy over what form the ulterior measures should take. In May the convention moved to Birmingham, where riots led to the arrest of their moderate leaders Lovett and John Collins. I am putting this all in context, because you would think that the Australian Labor Party would have something in common with what the working man all of those years ago wanted for their party, and that was those six points of democracy. We know which of those is largely not supported by the Labor Party. The only other one that did not succeed, as we know, is annual general elections—we do not have an election every year, thank goodness.
The rump of the convention returned to London and presented its petition in July. The parliament rejected it summarily. There followed in November an armed rising of the `physical force' Chartists at Newport, which was quickly suppressed. Its principal leaders were banished to Australia. How about this: the principal leaders of the Chartists movement, for all of their sins of trying to get democracy in the work force in Britain, were banished to Australia—they were transported. Some of the first convicts to this country were people trying to get democracy in the work force—the Chartists. Here we are, with a group of people—the old Labor Party, which had roots in the work force, not the elites of today—who you would think would identify with them. But, no, this current Labor Party, held prisoner of the union movement, will not do anything about it.
Just to extrapolate the Australian connection through transportation a little further, I want to connect with a book called The Chartists by Dorothy Thompson and actually put some names to these people that were transported to Australia and suffered the consequences of trying to get democratic reforms in the work force in Britain. These people were tailors, blacksmiths, silversmiths et cetera. One of the best known Chartist tailors was William Cuffay of London. He was in the movement from the beginning. His father had been a slave in the West Indies and his grandfather had been taken from native Africa. Cuffay himself was like many tailors: he was a bit physically deformed. `A good spirit in a little deformed case,' he was described as. He was known in his trade as an excellent working man, but he did become involved in radical politics. Cuffay was already 36 years old when he became a late convert to trade unionism—do you hear this?—in the old country 138 years ago. The strike of 1834 had made him a supporter of his society and also seen him lose his job. We have seen that recently in the car industry in this country.
Anyway, what we do know is that, as a result of this conspiracy, he was given 21 years transportation. After his transportation to Australia as a convict, and later as a ticket-of-leave man, he continued to be a respected, sober and industrious man and—guess what? In Australia he again took up radical politics. Here was a man who decided that he would do something for the working class in this country. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might be interested to hear that his wife joined him in Tasmania in 1853. So that is where the Chartists fled to: parts of Australia, getting away from the oppression of people who would not let them have secret ballots way back then. 
—I do not think there is any relationship, Parliamentary Secretary. Another gentleman, Booley, was a blacksmith and a bleeding radical who, to get away from it, emigrated to Australia; he was not transported. Here he helped found—the member for Melbourne might appreciate this—the Geelong People's Association to agitate for the six points of the People's Charter. Here are the people that probably helped with the genesis of the Australian Labor Party in this country, and yet one of the main provisions in their six points was secret ballots. Do you think the Australian Labor Party will get in and support that? No, they will not, because they are prisoners of the Australian union movement in this country and they are not allowed to—because the unions own them.
When Booley came to this country, he continued to press for parliamentary democracy and also for the legal eight-hour day—do you hear this?—things that the Labor Party have been on about. He was one of the many Chartist immigrants who helped set the tone of Australian democracy. You should be ashamed of yourself, members of the Labor Party in this chamber, because these people talked about freedoms, workplace reform and eight-hour days, and helped the union movement and Australian democracy, and you will not even support them by looking at secret ballots in this country. 
I will go to other Chartists, from the Lancashire cotton operations. Two of the most prominent were William Ashton and Frank Mirfield, who had been transported to Australia for their parts in the bitter strike of 1829. They returned to the town at the beginning of the Chartism movement. As the result of a petition, the townspeople raised enough to pay for their return from Australia. They had already been transported on other matters but they went back to support the Chartist movement, the people of their towns having paid for them to get back to Britain. Again, I will not take you through all of the history of that, but there is ample evidence that many people were transported to Australia as convicts because they had tried to support democratic reforms in the work force in Britain. The Australian Labor Party sits there smugly, just saying: `Look, that is good enough for those people all those years ago, but we are not the modern Labor Party. We are the party that wants to go back to the Dark Ages, that does not support the charter of rights, as the Chartists did, and provide the six points of reform.' If the Labor Party cannot see the connection between the people who were imprisoned, ill-treated and sent to this country and reform to the work force, they have sorely lost the plot.
I will move on a little further with the Chartist connection. Its principal leaders were transported to Australia, as I have said, and nearly every other Chartist leader was arrested and sentenced to a short prison term. The Chartists then started to emphasise efficient organisation and moderate tactics. Three years later, a second national petition was presented containing more than three million signatures. Way back then, 160-odd years ago, they could organise three million signatures for their reforms. But the parliament refused to consider it and the movement lost some of its mass support later in the 1840s when the economy revived. The movement to repeal the Corn Laws divided radical energies and several discouraged Chartist leaders turned to other projects.
The last great burst of Chartism occurred in 1848, a year of bad harvests at home and revolution on the continent. Another convention was summoned and another petition was prepared. Again, parliament did nothing. Thereafter Chartism lingered another decade in the provinces but its appeal as a national movement was slowly waning. With the onset of the relative prosperity of mid-Victorian Britain, working-class militancy did tend to lose its edge. Many Chartist leaders, however, schooled in the ideological debates of the 1840s, continued serving the working classes and the Chartist spirit outlasted the organisation. All of the six points, with the exception of annual parliaments, have since been secured. They fought for it, they got transported to Australia for it—the lucky things, as it turned out—and what was their reward? They got all but one of the provisions accepted. 
The secret ballot is very dear to Australia and is actually called the `Australian ballot'. It is the system of voting in which voters mark their choices in privacy on uniform ballots printed and distributed by government or designate their choices by some other secret means. Victoria and South Australia—the member for Melbourne might appreciate this, too—were the first states to introduce secrecy of the ballot in 1856. For that reason, the secret ballot is referred to as the `Australian ballot'. The system spread to Europe and America to meet the growing public and parliamentary demand for protection of voters. So we actually exported the secret ballot and led the world in this—but not the Australian Labor Party; they do not want the workers to have the same rights. 
The means for securing secrecy vary considerably. Voting by Australian ballot usually takes place in a prescribed manner; the voting boxes are required to be of a certain dimension and enclosed, the only aperture being a small slit at the top. How a secret ballot will be conducted is very well prescribed. These containers are examined before the poll begins and cannot be opened until after the voting has finished, when the counting then begins. The voter marks the ballot, often while standing in a special booth—and we are all very aware of this as we are very close to it. In Great Britain, the secret ballot was finally introduced for all parliamentary and municipal elections by the Ballot Act of 1872. In other words, 16 years after Australia enacted secret ballots in this country, Britain followed Australia into democracy. In the United States, the Australian ballot system was extensively adopted after the presidential election of 1884. So it took the Americans another 28 years to follow the Australian system of secret ballots.
It is good enough for the members of this House. When members of the Australian Labor Party want to vote on divisions in this House in regard to the Speaker and other issues in this House, they are happy to be involved in secret ballots. But they will not let the people in the work force, the Australian workers, have access to the same democracy, because they think they know best for them. We know what it is: they are afraid of losing control. The Australian Labor Party are, as we know, hooked hip and shoulder to the union movement. We know that, at the end of the day, on average only 19 per cent of Australian workers belong to a union, yet two-thirds of the other side of this parliament is represented by people with union backgrounds. 
We are asking the Australian parliament to pass this legislation so that workers are given the same right as their parliamentary colleagues in this country to have secret ballots and democracy in the workplace. Australians have improved on the democratic push by the great English reform movement of the Chartists, many of whom, as I said, ended up here as convicts. All totalitarian and authoritarian regimes hate secret ballots, because they want to control the masses. They do not want them to have democracy. What we are saying here is that the union movement of this country, supported by the Australian Labor Party, is like a totalitarian and authoritarian regime. They do not want democracy. They want to manipulate the vote. Just as the Australian Labor Party will not support reform in the electoral system, they do not want to support reform to the secret ballot provisions that operate on work sites in Australia. It is a shame. The Labor Party should be embarrassed that they are standing up against this bill because it is undemocratic.

"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 is based on a longstanding conservative fantasy, a fantasy that suggests that ordinary workers are mere robots—they have no brain, have no individual characteristics and are manipulated and ordered about by unions and by union officials. It is a longstanding view in conservative quarters that, when workers go on strike, the individual workers who collectively make up the group that has made the decision to go on strike do not really know what they are doing and do not have a genuine commitment to the action that is being taken but are being manipulated or deluded by nasty, evil trade unions. Built on this assumption is a longstanding commitment to impose a variety of kinds of secret ballot legislation upon the trade union movement in order to ensure that strikes that the conservatives believe would not have happened without a secret ballot do not occur. The premise upon which this legislation is built is fundamentally flawed: the assumption that workers have no independent choice, that they have no power to exercise that choice within their trade unions and that they are meekly and mildly led by the nose to take action which is against their interests. I have been a union official, as you have, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams.  
—And me!
—It is good to see that there are others here as well who can say the same. I can speak from my experience, and I am sure it is the same in your experience, Mr Deputy Speaker, that workers facing the prospect of going on strike do not treat that issue lightly. They certainly do not allow anybody to tell them what to do, instruct them to do something that goes against what they want to do and force them to take an action which is contrary to their interests.
The legislation before the parliament ignores the real dynamics of industrial relations. It ignores the realities of what drives workers and why disputes occur and why some workers in some circumstances go on strike. I have been involved in decisions by groups of workers to go on strike made by both show of hands and secret ballot. I and my union certainly had a very clear policy that, wherever there was the slightest hint that anybody who would be involved in that decision wanted a secret ballot, a secret ballot would be held as a matter of course, on the spot. It was sometimes, I will admit, in rather messy circumstances, but nonetheless a genuinely democratic secret ballot was held whenever anybody felt that that was appropriate. But that did not happen very often. In virtually all of the circumstances that I dealt with, workers were quite happy for a decision to be made by a show of hands, and in most of those circumstances there were people voting on either side of the proposition. Those who were voting against going on strike were quite happy for their view to be known and quite happy for the decision to be taken on a show of hands.
This bill is a slightly watered-down version of previous legislation that has been put forward by the Howard government, but it still imposes a ridiculously cumbersome and bureaucratic regime which is designed to hobble the capacity of unions and their members to take industrial action in pursuit of legitimate claims for better terms and conditions. The provisions of the bill require that any union or employees proposing to take industrial action have to apply to the Industrial Relations Commission for a secret ballot after a bargaining period has commenced. The application has to contain the questions to be put in the ballot, including the nature of the proposed action to be taken. The Industrial Relations Commission must, if practicable, determine the application within two working days, and the parties can make submissions to it about that. It must not allow the application unless it is satisfied that the applicant has been, and is, genuinely trying to reach agreement with the employer, and the Industrial Relations Commission has the discretion to refuse the ballot on certain other grounds.
In other words, the workers cannot even necessarily get to first base without satisfying the Industrial Relations Commission that there is even a legitimate possibility that they may be entitled to take industrial action and therefore have a secret ballot as to whether or not such action should be allowed to occur. For industrial action to be protected and to be legitimate under the act, 40 per cent of the eligible voters have to vote and a majority of the valid votes cast have to be in favour of the action. The action has to be taken within 30 days of the declaration of the ballot results. The applicants—the workers, the union—are liable to pay the cost of the ballot but, if they notify the Industrial Registrar of the cost, the registrar may determine that the cost was reasonably and genuinely incurred and the Commonwealth may, in all its generosity, pay up to 80 per cent of the cost. In other words, not only is a ballot being imposed upon the workers and a union where there may be no desire for it on the part of either; it is also going to be accompanied by, in some cases, very significant cost. 
This legislation is really about radically altering the bargaining position between workers and the unions on one side and employers on the other. It is all about strengthening the bargaining position of employers. It is all about further neutering the power of industrial action as a last resort to be used by workers and their unions as a legitimate bargaining tool to achieve better wages and conditions. No alternatives are proposed for employers. No employers are to be required to hold ballots of their shareholders before a lockout or before they decide to sue their own workers, as occurred very recently in the dispute in Victoria. There is no countervailing obligation on the part of those employers to ballot their rank and file, their shareholders, but an obligation is being imposed on workers that they have to have a formal secret ballot to make a decision.
We may well ask why it is necessary for such legislation to be brought to the parliament at a time when, as the government often points out, industrial disputes in this country are at record low levels. The answer is pretty straightforward: this is an ideological attempt to further weaken the bargaining power of workers and trade unions and to further strengthen the dominance of employers in the workplace so that the ability of unions and workers to make use of industrial action as a legitimate bargaining weapon is further counteracted.
We have occasional high profile disputes. We have had some recently in the car industry and with BHP, and they of course reflect an industrial relations system that this government put in place. They reflect decentralised bargaining. They reflect a wage fixing system that is all about workplace or shopfloor bargaining. The pattern of establishing this system was laid by the former Labor government, but it has been very substantially furthered by the current government. The government does not want to face up to the logical consequence of this decentralised system, which is that there will be industrial disputes in particular companies that flow from having workplace based decision making—and that is precisely what has been occurring in the car industry in recent times.
Employers make the decision to pursue just-in-time approaches to manufacturing for entirely legitimate economic reasons but in doing so take upon themselves certain risks—in particular, risks that the supply chain will in some way be disrupted by a variety of possible factors, one of which is industrial action. Employers cannot have it both ways; the Howard government cannot have it both ways. If the government want a market driven system—if they want a system in which the individual parties determine outcomes and the government stay out, which is the rhetoric that we hear from the minister, the Prime Minister and the former minister, Mr Reith—then they have to live with the outcomes of that system. They cannot have it both ways.
This bill and the others that are associated with it are all about the government trying to cripple the strength of unions and trying to undermine the power of union members and workers to bargain on an equal level with their employers. No matter what rhetoric we get hit with about union bosses and holding Australia to ransom and bullies and all of the posturing bluster we get from the minister for workplace relations, it is very simple in reality: this legislation is an attempt to tilt the scales in favour of employers even further and more to the disadvantage of ordinary workers.
The sort of stuff that came from the member for Canning about the Chartists I find quite risible. As somebody who studied the Chartist movement for some time in the past when I was a student, I find it highly amusing that somebody of his political ilk would be citing them as some sort of base for his position. His political forebears opposed the Chartist movement and they outlawed the trade movement in Britain. They sent the Tolpuddle Martyrs to Australia as well as many Chartists. The member for Canning now seeks to capture their legacy in some sort of entirely dubious attempt to give credibility to his position. Of course, what he fails to point out is that the Chartists were agitating for the secret ballot to elect parliamentarians in ordinary elections that occur from time to time on a predictable basis, not when there are 15 of them or 20 of them or 30 of them caught in a situation, potentially at short notice, where they feel the need to take industrial action—for example, because of a health and safety threat that has emerged where they feel the employer is not dealing adequately with the threat. The notion that you should idly sit by and accept an ongoing risk to your own health and safety while the Australian Electoral Commission or the Australian Industrial Relations Commission conducts a formal postal ballot is simply ludicrous. 
This is all about bargaining power. Unions exist in our society to correct the severe imbalance in bargaining power between workers and employers and to ensure that workers, particularly those who have lower skills and less bargaining power in a pure open market, can collectively bargain to achieve a reasonable standard of living and a reasonable return for their efforts from the production process.
The Liberal philosophy is based on that of John Stuart Mill; in fact some of the more progressive ones belong to an outfit called the John Stuart Mill Society. That philosophy is essentially that all individuals are entitled to contract for employment as individuals and to enter into contracts with employers on that basis, and that any intervention in that is unjustified. They see the employment contract as essentially the same as all other contracts—it is no different from a contract to buy a bag of jellybeans or to buy a theatre ticket or whatever—whereas the Labor Party see the employment relationship as fundamental to our society and quite different from all other contracts. Our philosophy derives from R.H. Tawney, another great philosopher from the past—or historian in this case of our British tradition—who very pertinently pointed out in that great one-liner: freedom for the pike is death for the minnow. That is ultimately what trade unionism is about, and that is ultimately what labour market regulation is about. There is an inherent imbalance of power in most employment circumstances. There is an inherent imbalance in bargaining capacity, and that is what having a regulatory system and having trade unions is all about: to correct that imbalance to ensure that people do not get exploited and that they get a reasonable return for their labour in spite of the fact that in an open market, if they did not starve, they would live in destitution.
The labour input into the production process is not just that. The human input into the production process is also the means by which the rewards of the production process are distributed through the wages system. So as well as being the primary input into production, it is also the means by which the output—the benefit—is delivered. Finally, and in some respects most importantly, it is the means by which the vast majority of people get their identity, their sense of value and their sense of contribution to society.
From a Liberal perspective, the human input into the production process—the employment contract—is one-dimensional. It is an input into production, like a machine or a piece of land, and that is it. The Liberals do not acknowledge the broader social dimension that is involved in the phenomenon of labour, nor do they acknowledge the need to have special regulation in this relationship to ensure that there is fairness and equity so that people are able to have a reasonable standard of living.
The great irony of this bill is that it comes from a government that preaches deregulation in industrial relations. Yet what we have is a highly prescriptive, highly interventionist approach being imposed upon essentially unwilling people. What we have is the government micromanaging the relationship between trade unions and their members and intervening very prescriptively to say that, if there is a decision to be made with respect to prospective industrial action, that decision has to be made in a highly bureaucratic, highly time consuming and, in some cases, highly expensive way—you are not allowed to make that decision in your own way by a decision at the workplace at a meeting, which historically has been the primary way that such decisions have been made. 
Not only does the government say, through its legislation, `You are only allowed to take industrial action at certain times'; it also says, `We, the government, are going to prescribe how you can make that decision and we are going to impose an incredibly cumbersome and bureaucratic process of decision making upon you just to make it as hard as possible for you to come up with that kind of decision.' In other words, from the government and from employers we have the free market when it suits them. When it suits their interests they are all in favour of the free market, but when the free market could lead to a bit of disruption or to unions and workers actually taking industrial action or exerting some sort of power in the overall negotiating position, then they are in favour of regulation—highly prescriptive, highly interventionist, highly cumbersome regulation at that.
They are not that far away from the position that prevailed shortly before the period that the member for Canning was talking about—namely, the Combination Acts in Britain from 1799 to 1824, which effectively outlawed trade unionism and made collective bargaining in Britain effectively illegal. That is where this government is heading. Bit by bit it is seeking to prevent workers from bargaining collectively through unions and pursuing their interests as workers to achieve better outcomes and better wages and conditions. That is ultimately where they are heading.
It is ironic that the broader context in which this approach is pursued has been about more jobs. We have heard for some years that deregulated labour markets deliver better employment outcomes. For quite some time the United States was cited as the perfect example of this and the European Union was the contrast. Australia was seen as an excessively regulated labour market and the United States was held up essentially as the model for how we should regulate industrial relations. Now that the United States is experiencing unemployment figures above five per cent and as those figures continue to increase, getting to a point where they will not be a great deal below Australia—and they are in fact significantly higher than a number of European Union countries—some of the propagandists who put this point of view have gone decidedly quiet in recent times.
They have managed to ignore the fact that something in the vicinity of one per cent of the American work force is in jail; therefore, there is an artificial reduction in what would otherwise be an augmentation of the unemployment figures. They ignore the impact of currency valuations and, particularly in the case of Europe, of overvalued currencies, which tend to create higher unemployment. They ignore the fact that overregulated product markets in Europe have also tended to exacerbate unemployment by restricting work opportunities and by diverting investment into unproductive and ultimately job-destroying kinds of activities, particularly through vehicles such as the common agricultural policy.
Jobs are created by demand. Employers employ people because they have work for them to do which they cannot have done by their existing work force. Supply issues are relevant. Questions of costs of employment and circumstances of employment are relevant to the employment relationship and to the creation of jobs, but the fundamental driver of employment in this country and in others with a market-driven society is demand. That is why large companies are downsizing. That is why big companies—even those companies doing very well, like the banks—are reducing the number of workers they have. Why? Because they can get by without them.
When the Commonwealth Bank makes a record profit it does not immediately go out and say, `Beauty, we can now employ a whole lot more workers.' It is quite the reverse, because its employment decisions are based on the work it needs to do in order to deliver its services to its customers, not on the fact that it has enough money to employ a given number of people. Always, ultimately, the employment decisions in this country will be based primarily on demand—on the work needing to be done on the employer's product being purchased by consumers. Cost and supply factors are relevant to that but the dominant consideration will always be demand factors. 
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 is part of a broader intellectual theory that the government adheres to, which is based on the notion that deregulated labour markets are free, fair and deliver best outcomes. In truth, they are none of those things because they deliver unfair outcomes that suit a minority of workers who do very well, as well as employers and the better off. They damage the interests of a very large number of workers, particularly the lower paid and people who have less bargaining power. They do not produce better employment outcomes.
This legislation is highly interventionist and prescriptive, contrary to the deregulatory rhetoric that broadly enshrouds the government's typical position on industrial relations. Its propaganda about employment outcomes is now disintegrating because of changes in the United States. We are left with its simple agenda of bullying and of mendacity in all its ugliness and starkness. As Peter Reith said when he was the minister, `Never forget that we are on the side of private capital. Never forget that we are against workers and that we are on the side of employers.' That is the real agenda of this government and that is what you are seeing in this legislation. It is not designed to produce greater democracy or freedom; it is there to make life harder for workers and harder for unions.

"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002. I want to start immediately with the philosophical arguments raised by the member for Melbourne. The member for Melbourne painted this as in some way an assault on the basic freedoms of workers, as a capitalist plot, yet it is about three fundamental principles. Firstly, it is about higher productivity, which has occurred over the last six years; secondly, it is about higher employment, again which has occurred under these changes over the last six years; and, thirdly—and this seems to be an idea which has eluded the member for Melbourne—it is about greater democracy, both in the workplace and more broadly within society in general. That is why in the United Kingdom—that great, heavy, capitalist society that he champions so strongly—they have secret ballots.
There are four principles which this bill introduces that I would like to address initially. First, it brings a fundamental principle of democracy to trade union activity. It is the notion that every worker, when deciding whether to withhold his or her labour, has the right to do so in secret, to do so free of coercion and to do so free of the oppression of those around them. The second principle is that this bill protects jobs by ensuring democracy, and it does so because on every occasion that there is industrial action—as we have seen in this very last week with the BHP plant at Westernport in my own seat of Flinders—it risks the long-term future of jobs for the majority. The heads of the car industry in Australia have raised the fact that they might no longer source component parts from within Australia as a result of this industrial action. Yet I know, from the families in the area and from the discussions that I have had, that there was a real concern amongst the workers in Westernport as to whether or not they would have the freedom to choose, because the families knew that the actions which were occurring were being done in public and without any choice but to vote in the full glare and amongst the full pressure of the union leadership.
The third principle that the bill provides for is industrial action under worker approval, including the idea that worker approval includes all affected employees, not just the union members who are affected. That is a critical distinction: people have a right to participate in the union but they also have a right not to participate in the union. That is one of the fundamental principles of freedom that we have. This bill strengthens and enshrines that right to opt in and, more importantly, to opt out, because it means that workers can participate in any decision to withhold labour rather than having to rely on a union of which they are not part and over which they have no control. Fourthly, the key principle is that the bill helps to make unions accountable to workers and subject to the workers' wishes without placing a premium on the decisions of the leadership from the top down, so it institutes a genuine democratisation to the processes within the workplace. Why would anybody be afraid of that? What is there to be afraid of in a process which dictates democracy in the workplace within a collective agreement? 
I want in particular to look briefly at the dispute which has just occurred at the BHP Westernport plant in Hastings on the Mornington Peninsula in the electorate of Flinders. It is accepted in law and within this bill that any individual has the right to control his or her own labour. That is not in dispute but it is subject to two critical precepts. The first is that, in doing so, nobody has the right to compel or to prevent anyone else from working in their own right if they so choose. You simply cannot prevent others from working. Making your own decisions is a matter for you, but it is not a right to prevent others from making the choice for themselves. The second precept is that it has to be a genuinely free choice. In all other aspects of our society, we accept the notion that we have the freedom to choose, free from the glare of publicity and peer pressure, whenever there is a democratic right to be exercised. In particular, I note that when you look at like-minded countries—the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Germany, Ireland—all have strong secret ballot provisions, yet this approach, this philosophy, is being opposed by the Labor Party, the opposition, in this very debate. Those two principles qualify the basic right to choose to give or to withhold labour, and that is that you cannot prevent others from doing so and you must be free to make your own choice without oppression and without coercion.
In looking at this bill, I want to examine it in three steps. The first is to look at the current situation; the second is to examine the operation of the bill; and the third is to put it in context—to examine the importance of this bill. What is the current situation? The current situation is that we have a context of unnecessary strikes which can be undemocratically approved. A union leadership can decide what is best for a worker without genuine consultation or reference to that worker. Yes, there is a set of existing secret ballot provisions in the Workplace Relations Act which give the Industrial Relations Commission discretion to order secret ballots, but the means of achieving this are so public and so onerous that these provisions are rarely used. It is interesting that the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations has been able to identify only seven secret ballots ordered under the existing Workplace Relations Act provisions in the last eight years. Only some of these ballots relate to the act of taking industrial action, of withdrawing labour, which means `one out, all out'. Generally, those that do relate to taking industrial action are held while the industrial action is ongoing and do not seek approval prior to the industrial action commencing.
The fact is that the vast majority of decisions to take industrial action are unregulated. There is no guarantee that all workers are consulted or that they genuinely support taking the industrial action. It is a fact of human nature that in a heavy, oppressive environment individuals will find it difficult. Whether they do or whether they do not, we have an obligation to ensure that they have the right to make that choice free from the threat, the possibility or even the spectre of oppression. What we have seen is that the existing provisions have not provided sufficient protection to workers who feel pressured into taking industrial action. In that situation, the proposed changes to the Workplace Relations Act will ensure that a decision to take industrial action is both democratic and genuine. The use of `hands up' voting places unfair peer pressure on members to approve an action.
How does this bill operate? What will it actually do to redress the current situation? The government's focus in this bill is on the point of the decision to commence industrial action. That is the key moment. The bill aims to protect jobs by ensuring, enshrining and strengthening democracy at the key moment of control over one's own labour so that workers who will be most affected by going on strike will have an unfettered say about whether or not they want to do so. When will it apply? Applications for a secret ballot can be made to the Industrial Relations Commission. The application for a ballot can be made only when a bargaining period is in place and not more than 30 days before the last occurring nominal expiry date of any relevant certified agreements. Who can apply for a ballot? If an organisation of employees initiated the bargaining period, then the organisation can apply or an employee or employees can also apply. Very importantly, the bill provides that, if an employee wishes to remain anonymous, they can appoint an agent to initiate the bargaining period, represent them during the application for a ballot and provide notice of the industrial action to the employer. There is protection for a worker seeking to be covered by this legislation. 
Indeed, the bill goes on to make it an offence for a person to disclose information that will identify any other person as someone who has appointed an agent for the purposes of seeking a ballot. That is a critical protection. What it means is that action cannot be forced. Industrial action can disrupt not just the group of employees involved. As we saw in BHP Westernport, a small number of employees held over 1,000 other employees in that institution to ransom and, more than that, they held thousands of employees in the automotive industry throughout Australia to ransom. As a consequence, the long-term future—not even the short-term future but the long-term future—of that industry has been placed in jeopardy. That is why the leaders of that industry have expressly stated that they seek to look elsewhere to provide alternative sources of supply for key components—and all because a small number of employees took an action which affected a great number of employees. It was one small group who jeopardised the position of thousands of employees.
By making a secret ballot a compulsory precondition for industrial action, three things happen. First, you get a true picture of the worker support. Second, you add democratic legitimacy to that action. Third, you place power where it belongs—at the workplace level, in the hands of the employees directly involved—because, if the leadership does accurately represent their views, then they have nothing to fear from a secret ballot. If, however, they do not accurately represent the views of the rank and file, then a secret ballot will expose the true position. That is all that this legislation seeks to achieve, and that is all that anyone can ask.
That is the way the bill operates. Why, then, is the bill so important? At a philosophical level, we believe in a freedom to organise. We accept the notion in law that there is a freedom to give or to withhold one's own labour, but neither of these can fully work without the freedom to choose and without the individual's capacity to make the choice that `I will give my labour' or `I will withhold it' without the oppression of an organised environment which militates against it—and that was the word which came back in Hastings from the families of both those who were on strike and those who were affected by the strike. The second thing is that it protects jobs by ensuring democracy, and the third thing is that it overcomes an existing lacuna in the legislation. The fact that there have been just over a handful of secret ballots ordered in the last half a dozen years shows that the fear of going public in asking for a secret ballot is a significant inhibitor in itself.
These are the key points I wish to make. Ultimately, I believe that the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 enshrines in law a fundamental principle of democracy. It enshrines in the workplace the choice of each individual over whether to give or to withhold their own employment. Significantly, it adopts a principle that exists in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Germany and Ireland. And for anyone who opposes that, surely the question must be: what are you afraid of? If it is operating successfully in those countries and if the Blair government's Employment Relations Act 1999 retained the secrecy provision, what are we trying to achieve here? Very simply, this bill enshrines the right for individuals to decide their own future in the workplace. I commend the bill to the House.

"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—I rise to make a contribution on this very important bill,  the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 which, as our shadow minister has indicated, the Labor Party and the members on this side of the chamber will be opposing. As I understand it, this is the third legislative attempt by the government to mandate secret ballots as a prerequisite for gaining authorisation from the commission to take subsequent protected action during negotiations for an enterprise agreement. One of the issues that has not been clarified in the course of the debate on this bill is the point that there is already a highly regulated system in operation before industrial action can be granted the status of protected action, free from the possibilities of civil action being taken against the unions and workers. So there already exists in this country a high degree of regulation for action to be protected.
Why is this bill before the House? Is it really there to redress matters of concern to the Australian community? Are there shortcomings in the way the system operates? Is there a principle that operates internationally that we do not have in this country that we should pick up? Or is it really just another attack on the rights of organised labour? I want to try to establish that this bill is before the chamber not for any pragmatic considerations, but as part of an ongoing agenda by the minister to continue to try and tilt the industrial relations system even more consciously in favour of employers at the expense of working people, and, in this piece of legislation, to actually try and erode the fundamental principle that all democracies uphold, namely the right of workers to withdraw their labour—although, as a former union official, I have always taken the view that industrial action should always be action as a last resort. I think most sensible minded people in the union movement would believe that to be the case.
I have just listened very intently to the member for Flinders as he traversed other international examples. What he forgot to mention is that the principle of a right of access to secret ballots already exists in this country and, I think, has existed historically way back to the 1920s. So it is of little value for the minister and other members of the government to try and position people on this side of the chamber—and former union officials such as myself—as being somehow on the side of those who want to deny ordinary working people the right to make decisions about whether or not they engage in industrial action.
I support the right of all union members to vote on whether or not to take action. I think that is a fundamental right. It is a right that is expressed in many and various ways, including, in some unions, by secret ballots. But in my judgment, what we are seeing on the part of this minister is an attempt to say that the right can only have one form of legitimacy and that is by way of a secret ballot. That is a highly prescriptive and interventionist approach that the minister is trying to force onto the industrial parties who have shown over many decades that they are not particularly interested in using that right, even when the right exists, but rather in resolving matters in a sensible way at the workplace or industry level.
But just to make it very clear, in every union that I am aware of—and I think I understand the operations of most—it would be a very reckless and foolish union official who did not take into account the views of the work force when determining certain forms of industrial action. Furthermore, like politicians, union officials are accountable to their electorate. I know from my own experience that union officials who get too far ahead or too far behind the prevailing views of the people they are elected to represent do not last very long. However, it is quite offensive for the minister to be suggesting that, somehow, workers are captured by leaders, that they do not think through the implications of proposed action and that they do not have a means to express whether or not they support industrial action. 
As I say, I have been around long enough to see every form of democracy in operation in unions before industrial action is taken. In many unions, it is by a show of hands—the same kind of system that operates in caucus meetings of major political parties. I am sure the minister is not suggesting that true democracy can only pertain in the caucus room of the Liberal Party by a secret ballot. I am sure that it happens there as it happens in our caucus: discussion occurs and often votes are taken by a show of hands, but that does not in any way undermine the democratic principle once that decision is determined. In other unions they have major mass meetings. As I have indicated, though, there are some unions, including some teacher unions, that historically have had provisions written into their rules for secret ballots of the whole membership before action is taken. 
A variety of forms of democracy exists. I find it rather surprising that the minister preaches the virtues of a deregulated labour market—something that we on this side of the House do not support—and goes around pontificating about the virtues of deregulation yet at the same time wants to introduce a highly regulated and prescribed system of mandated secret ballots prior to the taking of protected industrial action. It is somewhat inconsistent. For those who still want to perpetuate the myth that there is a lack of democracy within the union movement or that people have something to hide, let me make it clear that, beyond the union and the workplace, that very august body the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has the power today to order secret ballots. As I have indicated, that is not new in Australia; secret ballot provisions have existed in different legislative forms since the late 1920s, so perhaps Australia led the world in the introduction of the provision that enables secret ballots to be put in place.
Under section 135, of its own volition the commission can order a secret ballot and, under section 136, employees can request that the commission put in place the process of secret balloting. So the provisions are there and they are open to be used. In fact quite recently I read that one of our unions—the Rail, Tram and Bus Union—sought a ballot of employees of Great Southern Railways over their choice of being forced to continue with AWAs—that is, the individual contracts—or having a collective agreement. It comes as no surprise that their democratically expressed preference was for a collective agreement. I raise that example only to show that such provisions exist and they can be accessed, although they are not accessed very often. The member for Flinders was right to draw our attention to the fact that, although they are written into law, those provisions are not used very often. But he did not go on to say why that is the case. The case for the infrequent use of secret ballot provisions arises because industrial partners often believe that a secret ballot can polarise the positions of parties and remove the flexibilities that are necessary for the resolution of industrial disputes. In other words, you take a secret ballot; the workers express an opinion; that opinion, let us say, is carried overwhelmingly; you sit around and try to negotiate an outcome to the dispute; and you find that the mandated secret ballot often makes the resolution of industrial disputes far more difficult.
To those who want to argue that this bill provides an extension of democracy in the industrial relations system I pose this question: if the matter is all about democracy, why does this bill not require a secret ballot to call off industrial action? The bill proposes these forms of ballot before industrial action can be taken but there is no suggestion that a secret ballot should be held to call off industrial action. Nor is there an onus on companies for a form of democratic decision by shareholders before, under the law, a company can lock out its employees as part of their industrial strategy in enterprise bargaining negotiations. This bill, like many others that have been and will come before this chamber, is very one-sided. It does not deal with any gross omissions in the current system of industrial relations. It really is the extension of the pursuit of a very political and ideological agenda by the current minister and his predecessors. I contend that it is not about democracy; it is about restricting the right to take industrial action. Interestingly enough, the present minister learned a lot from the former minister for industrial relations, Minister Reith, but he does not talk about the fact that back in 1998 the former minister commissioned a discussion paper on this very issue. The discussion paper commented on the secret ballot provisions and said: 
The Commission seems to be using ballots strategically to progress dispute resolution, particularly where the parties have reached a standoff in negotiations.
But that discussion paper, which was commissioned by the minister, indicates quite clearly that there was no evidence of the commission ever refusing applications by employers or anybody else for ballots in relation to the question of taking industrial action. The provision exists but the minister will not recognise that it is rarely used because the industrial partners believe that it is not an efficient way of resolving industrial disputation. The minister has not made out a case for the changes he proposes, nor has he made out a case to show that the existing arrangements are inadequate. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission currently has the discretion and in my judgment that is where it should remain. The bill is a reflection of the minister's misguided belief that on many occasions industrial stoppages do not have the support of rank and file workers. The words in his own second reading speech indicate his obsession. He said of the bill:
It will ensure that the right to protected industrial action is not abused by union officials pushing agendas unrelated to the workers at the workplace concerned.
That is a very one-eyed, very dogmatic, very unrepresentative and very distant view of how union officials operate in practice.
We need look no further than Western Australia to see what farce emerges when a highly regulated system of mandated secret ballots is forced on unwilling partners. As we know, the Liberal government in Western Australia made much about their industrial relations agenda—in fact a more extreme agenda in many respects than this current government's agenda. There was a lot of fanfare about legislating for compulsory secret prestrike ballots. What has been the outcome? Applications were made possible by employers, employer organisations, unions and union members. Here we had a highly regulated system open to all to have compulsory prestrike ballots. I will tell you what the result was: not one application was made from the time that the Liberal government in Western Australia legislated for the introduction of these compulsory secret prestrike ballots. Again, it was a highly ideologically driven agenda that had no relationship to practicalities, nor to the wishes of those involved in resolving industrial disputes.
In fact, the reverse can be true. Instead of the motivation being, as we are led to believe, the extension of democracy, let me tell you what an eminent labour lawyer, Professor Ronald McCallum, has said about the Western Australian situation and the details of this bill. In commenting on this bill in the previous Senate inquiry, Professor McCallum said this:
... I suspect, from my long experience in labour law, that such a bureaucratic system will drop industrial action down from union executives and union secretaries to wildcat action. I think we will see an increase in short-term wildcat action, and there will be a series of legal decisions seeking to assert that wildcat action on the shop floor can be sheeted home to trade union officials. Similar case law occurred in England in the late 1960s and early 1970s, to little effect.
In other words, the eminent labour lawyer Professor Ronald McCallum was arguing that moves to introduce secret ballots would result in employees ignoring regulated processes for protected action that currently exist in the act. They would simply end up taking wildcat industrial action—possibly against the advice of their unions—which could well end up in endless litigation, as case law in other countries has shown.
In conclusion, I want to argue that the provisions in this bill are not necessary. They are impractical and based on the Western Australian experience. They are ideologically driven and bear little relationship to what it is that the industrial partners want as an efficient way of resolving industrial disputation. I would also argue that the bill should be rejected because the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, a very eminent body, has the authority to call secret ballots and that the discretion that rests with the commission should remain there. I would argue that there is already a highly regulated system in operation for the taking of what we call protected industrial action. 
In short, the bill really adds little to the notion of industrial democracy, being as one-sided as it is. As I pointed out, there are no secret ballots to call off industrial action and no secret ballots for employers before they are able to lock out workers. The bill effectively creates further impediments to unions being able to undertake legitimate industrial action and to withdraw labour as a last resort. As Professor McCallum so rightly points out, such forms of highly regulated interventionist approaches often lead to the prospect of longer disputation and needless and endless litigation. It is for those reasons, among others, that I contend that this bill should be rejected.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—Tonight we have before us the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Genuine Bargaining) Bill 2002 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Termination) Bill 2002 all brought together for debate. In an attempt to make a balanced contribution this evening I thought it might be worthwhile trying to come to grips with what industrial relations is meant to be about, or what I understand industrial relations is meant to be about, within the Western democracies and specifically within Australia. To my mind, it is about the willing relationship between an employer and an employee. It is about the creation of employment and the maintenance of employment. It is about working in a workplace that is safe and fair. And is about people being able to make reasonable progress—that is, the business and the individual employee—to the benefit of the total community and to the nation.
There is no doubt in my mind that in 100 years of Australia's history we have seen very significant progress. The bitterness of previous times is not as severe today. It gets a little bit rough, as we saw in the BHP dispute last week where the automotive industry was on its knees and the steel industry was at its wits end to know how to maintain an efficient industry and maintain their supply to their customers. In all of this there is inevitably from time to time the two sides. There is an adversarial system and generally speaking sometimes it ends up in strike action. But most of the time it ends up in resolution.
To be specific, the bills address compulsory union fees. I must confess I was not aware of what that actually meant until I saw it in front of me here tonight. For the purposes of the House and any community member that may be listening, those who are non-union employees, as the description is, are expected to pay a service fee for union participation in agreement negotiations in the workplace. The demand is typically made without the consent or solicitation of the relevant employee. In most cases the fee is set at about $500 per year—wait for it!— above the annual due. Apparently it is accepted practice. The information before me even goes on to suggest that the ACTU formally supports unions pursuing this compulsory fee in collective agreements in an attempt to give these demands a legal aura. So the concept of freedom of association and freedom to join a union is but a nonsense. The previous speaker for the government talked very much about democracy and secret ballots. I thought that he put it in a most eloquent and forthright manner when he said that the importance of human rights and the importance of the principle that a secret ballot allows to be tested is vital and central to our democracy.
With regard to what genuine bargaining is, let me go back in history a little bit. We see quite remarkable differences within unions. The MUA is noted for some of its methodologies in achieving its ends. It seemed to be a very successfully union in its outcomes. But the people in my electorate say it is all very well for the MUA to demand those sorts of outcomes, but what about the forklift driver who brings the product to the wharf? He works equally as hard, if not harder, and he is on about half the wage of the MUA employees. It is very obvious to any casual observer of the Australian industrial scene that might is able to achieve much more than others can achieve in those sorts of circumstances. What is genuine bargaining—that elusive capturing of something which is the balance of commonsense and the need to have a job and the need to keep the company or the business going? There is no doubt that there is a very large imbalance in power between some of the unions and the way they go about it. 
In terms of some of the tactics in recent years, I am sure we conduct our industrial relations in a much more moderate atmosphere that than the way we used to do it 50, 70 and 80 years ago. Nevertheless, it is still an essence as important as it has ever been, even in a time when we have very significant support and welfare payments and a whole lot of sophisticated government mechanisms which give significant support to people who would have been much more vulnerable in earlier times. I think it is very important to respect the human rights of individuals who want that basic freedom, that basic right, to work. So I have to come out in support of the legislation, acknowledging the progress of the Australian system based on respect for human beings and their right to work, their right to have their say, their right to withdraw their labour. But let it be done without coercion, without threats and without the need, as I have seen in previous disputes, for heavy security for ministers of the Crown.
This bill offers us that opportunity to allow individuals at the workplace to have their say. I guess if I was an employee of 50 years ago, I would have appreciated many of the hard-won gains of those unions. But I believe in this current environment—and we see it in the recruitment by the unions themselves; we now have less than a quarter of our work force unionised—we have massive change occurring in the workplace. I believe that both sides need to acknowledge that—and I even hesitate to use the word `sides' because at the end of the day we have a common cause, a common purpose. We have the creation of employment, the creation of wealth and the creation of export income, but we all have a common purpose in getting it right.
So it is with significant pride that I support these bills. I think it is the third time around, in various forms, that this legislation has been presented to the House and it is very important that we recognise the enormous change that is occurring in the workplace. It is extremely important that we respect the fact that individuals are much more aware of their rights, much better educated and much more aware that coercion of any kind, from the boss or from the union movement, is unacceptable. In that climate, we need to have some of these mechanisms that are here tonight in this legislation. With that contribution, I wish the bills a speedy passage through this House and through the Senate.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 has nothing to do with good policy and everything to do with partisan politics. The legislation is before the chamber for the same reason that other industrial relations bills are being brought to the House of Representatives, and that is to seek to divide this country, to divide workers from employers, to create hostility in the workplace—because that is the government's agenda. It is important to understand that the history of the Liberal Party in Australia has been one of dividing Australia, of setting Australians against Australians. We can go back to the Fraser years. The verdict was finally delivered on the Fraser government, with the election of the Hawke government, that enough was enough—that the pitting of Australians against Australians through industrial relations laws was getting the country nowhere, that strike action was rampant and that the base political purposes of the Liberal Party then, as now, were doing nothing to advance harmony in the workplace or, indeed, changes in work practices and in workplaces themselves.
This legislation is brought forward ostensibly on the grounds that it will reduce the level of industrial disputation. But, if I can refer to the Fraser years, under the Fraser government, a yearly average of 590 days were lost to industrial disputes per 1,000 employees. That is a divided nation. By January 1996, there had been 13 years of Labor government, and throughout that period the coalition said that everything Labor was doing would lead to greater industrial disputation. In fact it led to a reduction in industrial disputation to 80 days per 1,000 employees. I think it is also a fact that the level of industrial disputation overall has continued to fall under the coalition, and yet it says that the reason it is bringing this legislation into the parliament is to deal with high levels of industrial disputation. It is a complete furphy, and the true motivation in bringing this legislation into the parliament—just as the motivation has been in bringing in the Orwellian-titled `fair dismissals' legislation for small business—is to achieve some basic partisan political purpose, not any genuine reforms in the industrial relations system, and certainly not with a view to creating harmony in the workplace. 
We now have a Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations who is, through his own job application, prepared to sacrifice any prospect of industrial harmony in this country by declaring to the H.R. Nicholls Society that he is very disappointed with employers and employer groups because they have not gone to war against working families in this country. He wants them to go to war—for no purpose other than to promote his own agenda and lift his own profile in the Australian community. He is not genuinely interested in a harmonious relationship between workers and employers. His comments in relation to the recent difficulties in the car components industry have been inflammatory. He has wanted BHP to proceed with prosecutions and, when BHP said they were not going to do that, he expressed grave disappointment.
We need to understand, in this current environment, that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is using the fact that there is a Productivity Commission review of the automotive industry to hold over the heads of the component manufacturers and the car manufacturers in this country the spectre of withdrawing funding under the ACIS arrangements—which provide import credit relief to those industries to the value of $2 billion—if they do not do his bidding in the declaration of industrial war that he has made.
It is a completely irresponsible attitude on the part of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, whose sole objective is to raise his profile as a prime-ministerial candidate. He is prepared to set Australians against Australians. He is prepared to provoke industrial disharmony in the very important car industry in this country and in the components industry. He is prepared to jeopardise Australian exports of automobiles and of components—a rapidly growing industry and one of which we all should be proud. Instead of looking for solutions to ongoing difficulties or possible difficulties in that industry, instead of bringing the parties together in some sort of roundtable, or encouraging them to come together in a roundtable to work out their approach to the enterprise bargaining that will be coming on in large numbers in the next 12 months, he is only interested in creating further strife. You would think that the minister would have an interest in settling the industrial relations system down. It is quite the opposite. His interest is in provoking a very poisonous relationship in that industry between employees and employers.
This legislation is poor policy. It is designed purely for base political purposes. It will not result in a reduction in industrial disputation, because, if a strike were called as a result of a secret ballot, a strike would have to be called off as a result of a secret ballot. That means more industrial disputation when it occurs, more protracted industrial disputation. The automotive industry in particular cannot afford the prospect of protracted industrial disputation, because of the just-in-time inventory systems the car manufacturers have in place, where they do not keep large stocks of components. That is for good, efficient productive reasons, but it would make them more vulnerable to protracted industrial disputation by requiring secret ballots to call and call off strikes. All that means is longer industrial disputation and greater difficulty for this industry.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—Tonight I wish to bring to the notice of the House the issue of the outstanding redundancy packages yet to be paid to approximately 540 former employees of the now insolvent Internova Travel Pty Ltd trading as Traveland. Some of these former employees live in my electorate of Lowe. I note that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Tony Abbott, finally tabled an answer to my question on notice No. 54, which was printed in Hansard on 14 May 2002. In my question I asked the minister, inter alia:
Has his attention been drawn to (a) the insolvency of Traveland Pty Limited on 26 November 2001 and now under administration, (b) the subsequent termination of 550 employees of Traveland on 4 December 2001 and (c) the fact that those 550 former employees had worked the whole of November 2001 without being paid their monthly wages and (d) the fact that, since 4 December 2001, those 550 former employees have received no further payments.
The minister replied, inter alia:
The administrator for Internova Travel has advised my Department that some employees have unpaid wages, however, the extent is unconfirmed.
I ask the minister tonight to confirm what steps, if any, he is taking to determine the extent of these unpaid wages and what administrative action he or his department is taking to ensure the proper settlement payments that are, in justice, owed to them. I further quote from my question on notice No. 54 to the minister:
Were the 550 former Traveland employees excluded from the Special Employee Entitlements Scheme for Ansett Group Employees as a result of Traveland's primary assets, including its employee contracts, being sold by the Administrator of the Ansett Group, which included Traveland Pty Limited, on 23 September 2001 to Internova Travel Pty Limited, notwithstanding widespread speculation at the time that Internova Travel did not have sufficient capital to operate a national travel agency network.
The minister's reply notes:
The former employees of Traveland were made redundant as a result of the insolvency of Internova Travel Pty Ltd. Internova Travel Pty Ltd is not an Ansett group company and consequently the former employees are not eligible for assistance under the Special Employee Entitlements Scheme for Ansett group employees ...
I urge the minister to ensure that entitlements to the former Internova employees will be equivalent to those industrial entitlements that these employees were subject to under the provisions of the SEESA agreement. In hindsight, the handover from Ansett to Internova was an irresponsible commercial transaction in that it was reasonably foreseeable that Internova was not competent to manage a national travel agency the size of Ansett's ongoing business operations. Further, whilst the parties to that commercial transaction may be responsible for this irresponsible act, the reality is of ongoing financial hardship for those former employees of Internova, including constituents who live in my electorate of Lowe.
The situation has created great financial hardship and creates a political obligation on the Howard government to act with justice and to support those former Internova employees. I urge the minister to ensure that as a matter of urgency he investigates the full extent of the financial harm caused by this irresponsible commercial transaction. Moreover, I urge the minister to answer as soon as possible my follow-up question No. 472, which I placed on the Notice Paper on 4 June 2002. That question asks:
... what steps, if any, is he taking to determine the extent of the unpaid wages ... What administrative action is he or his Department taking to ensure that proper settlement payments are made to the former employees of Internova ... in light of the fact that Internova is not a former Ansett group company and therefore was never subject to the provisions of the Special Employee Entitlements Scheme (SEES) for Ansett Group Employees, are steps being taken to ensure that those estimated 540—
or 550—
former Internova employees are given industrial entitlements similar to those of former Ansett employees equivalent to the SEES provisions ...
With each day that elapses, the harm continues for the former employees of Internova and the financial burdens become worse. Therefore, this matter needs to be dealt with by the minister with the utmost urgency.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Traveland: Workers' Entitlements</title>,Adjournment,12,1,speech
"Jackson, Sharryn, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—In rising today to speak to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 and in support of the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I would like to consider a particular concept that both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer refer to on a frequent basis, and that is good government. In numerous press releases and interviews over the past six years, we have seen this phrase bandied about by government ministers, expressing that in their opinion they are delivering good government to the Australian people. Just what is good government? Since the budget was handed down, many constituents in my electorate of Hasluck have been wondering the same thing. My electorate office has been inundated with people deeply concerned about the impact of this budget on their already difficult circumstances, and they want to know why they have been targeted. Is that what good governments do? Is it good government to hit those in the community who are the most disadvantaged while at the same time giving tax breaks to those who are better off? I think not. According to the Prime Minister in a speech he made at a Liberal Party function in 1999: 
... the quality of good government is always to know what to reform, what to discard and what to preserve and what to refurbish.
I would like to consider this year's federal budget in light of those criteria. Let us look at what to reform. The measures that this government calls reform in the budget start with ordinary families and health care. Remember that this government has already presided over a five per cent reduction in the number of GPs who bulk-bill, not to mention an average $12 increase in the cost of visiting a GP. Families have also seen a $150 average increase in the cost of their private health insurance cover. But to compound this problem even further, this government has decided that it is going to reform—and I use the word advisedly—the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and increase the cost of essential medication for many vulnerable Australians. It is interesting that the government has decided to bring in changes by imposing harsher measures on those at the bottom of the food chain, the patients or constituents, simply shifting the cost from government to patients. At the same time it is doing very little to reform the cost of pharmaceuticals at the top end through targeting the pharmaceutical companies, the terms of the subsidies paid under the PBS and the pharmacists themselves. Indeed, the budget proposes that pharmaceutical companies get funding assistance to market their product more effectively.
The additional cost of $1 per script may not seem a significant amount to the Prime Minister or to the Treasurer, but to people who are already struggling under the pressure of increased costs it is extremely significant. I want to place on record the situation for one couple from my electorate. Ken and Merle Longbottom of Gosnells wrote to me within days of the budget announcement. Mr Longbottom has suffered from severe heart attacks since 1985 and as such now has to endure taking six tablets a day, one of which is Ramipril, which attracts the $4 surcharge. Mrs Longbottom is also forced to take up to six tablets a day, as she is suffering from a severe gastric condition. The cost of the PBS budget measures in real terms for this couple in Gosnells will be an additional $6 a fortnight, a very significant amount for two people struggling on a pension. This comes on top of the recent 32 per cent increase in the cost of their private medical cover, which both have struggled to maintain, as they did not wish to be a burden on society. If I can use the words in their letter, Mr and Mrs Longbottom say:
We ... feel the added cost to prescriptions may not seem much, but as everything else goes up as well [this is] the straw that's about to break the camel's back.
The Longbottoms are just two of the many people who have contacted my office on this issue. The government has underestimated the strength of feeling in our community about the PBS changes and the desire of ordinary folk to protect the sick and the disadvantaged. Australians want a fair go and will not stand by and see people kicked when they are already down. I am confident that the majority of my constituents are opposed to these PBS changes and support Labor's stand on this issue. Clearly, the government's so-called reform of the PBS by targeting those most ill equipped to absorb the increase is not an act of good government.
What else has this government sought to reform in the name of good government? There is the disability services pension. Perhaps the real test as to the legitimacy of this budget measure was the fact that, within days of its release, we saw the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Prime Minister backtracking on some of its core details, due to the public outrage at such an ill-conceived policy. We are all aware that the minister was forced to admit that approximately 13,000 disability pensioners currently receiving the benefit and working a few hours a week would be adversely affected by the new measures. I have been told by disability pensioners in my electorate who are currently able to work a few hours a week that they are terrified at the prospect of either having to work a full week or losing their disability pension. They are clearly in no physical condition to cope with either scenario. But what of the other 187,000 pensioners that have been left to deal with the prospect of a $52.80 cut in their base benefit when they are pushed onto Newstart—not to mention the loss of other vital concessions such as the $5.80 pharmaceutical allowance, the $68 pension education supplement, the pensioner concession card and the telephone allowance? 
Again, as one example of the many, I want to place on record the situation of one of my constituents who lives in a caravan park in Caversham and who wrote to me asking me to oppose the federal government's change to the disability support pension. He has a permanent disability and lives each day with acute pain. He is obliged to take daily the maximum dose of pain-killers to enable him to function. He has had part-time employment for over 10 years, working 24 hours per week, and is well respected by his employer and his peers. It is painful for him to work, but he forces himself to do so for his own self-esteem, as a form of physiotherapy and to reduce the so-called burden on the welfare system. He receives very little pension but relies heavily on the medical and other benefits that the disability support pension entitles him to. He will not be able to reduce his working hours to 15. If the federal government changes are made law, he will have the rug pulled out from under his feet. He stands to lose his park home and will not be able to afford the medication that he requires to continue to work and function on a daily basis.
Whilst disability pensioners and disability services stay in the firing line of this government's attempt to justify its so-called welfare reform process, the Labor Party will do all it can to protect these people by opposing these unfair measures in the Senate. The Minister for Family and Community Services's crude response to this was to threaten to withhold the funding from the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. You only have to speak to the many individuals, families and community support groups in my electorate who have to deal with the frustration and suffering resulting from insufficient disability funding and support to realise what an effect such a course of action by the minister would have.
I have previously spoken in this place about two of my constituents, Carol and Norm Franklin of Huntingdale, and their adult disabled son, Stephen. In that context, I spoke about their inability to access funding for accommodation support for him. I had the opportunity to be in contact with Carol following the announcement of the federal budget. I left messages for her, and she emailed me back. I asked her if I could read some of her emails into the Hansard, as her son, Stephen, has recently been diagnosed with lymphoma—a form of cancer. She wrote:
Life is hectic. Stephen was diagnosed with a lymphoma, and I seem to spend most of my life at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital.
Another family that also lives in Huntingdale have a 19 year old son with Angelman's Syndrome. This family are one of the families in critical need, Rick only sleeps for 2-3hrs a night, they lock him in his bedroom, so they can try to get some sleep. Rick now bangs constantly on his door for the rest of the night. So sleep for that family is rare, the other two children in the family are falling behind with school work because they are so tired. 
Did you read about Peggy Pratt a mother who had cancer and her dying wish was to see her son (31) be accommodated before she died, but she never had her wish.
If Amanda Vanstone goes through with her threats the crises will only get worse, families will break down and a tragedy will happen. Someone will take their Child's life as that is the only way that they can secure their future. Families are just surviving and being put in the middle while governments play their control game, only will lead to a Tragedy.
The Disability Pension in the Budget doesn't really affect our Kids because none of them would be able to work 15hrs at award wages, but in saying that they will never get a job, because they would never be productive. The prescription will be another added burden to families, most of our kids are on multiple medications, and the rest of the family would have to pay the extra because they don't have a pension card.
Regards Carol
That is just how one family is feeling in light of the threats by the minister to cut the funding under the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement.
It led me to ask: why is it that the government are so insistent on targeting the disabled and the vulnerable in our society through shifting the cost burden of the federal budget onto them? Does this perhaps have something to do with another of the indicators that the Prime Minister used to measure good government—by what they discard or, should I say, by who they discard? In addition to discarding the concerns of those people, what else have they discarded in the preparation of this federal budget?
The first thing I think that you could identify is responsible spending. The one thing the government decided to discard—more particularly in the lead-up to the federal election—was the whole concept of responsible spending. A multimillion dollar advertising spree before the last election, the HIH royal commission, the family tax benefit debt waiver and the `Pacific solution', not to mention the Treasurer's money market gambling problem, were clear demonstrations of this government's lack of vision. This federal budget reflects their decision to make Australians pay for their continued mistakes. With the recent announcement of an additional ¼ per cent increase in interest rates the squeeze on already struggling families has continued. Disregarding responsible spending measures has produced a $1.2 billion deficit which the Australian people now have to pick up the tab for.
But that is not the only thing that the government has sought to discard. Let us take the environment. Over the last three years, $484 million that had been pledged to help the environment has simply not been spent. That means that the funds the Treasurer claimed were needed for green issues were simply never delivered. World Environment Day was a stark reminder to catchment groups, such as the Canning Catchment Group and the Blackadder Catchment Group in my electorate, that the Commonwealth government has let them down. Their projects have been driven by grassroots community organisations which have invested a huge amount of their own time and resources in trying to save Perth's rivers and the surrounding environment. The fact that the Commonwealth government's second stage of the promised Natural Heritage Trust funding is still up in the air is putting at risk the good work of these catchment groups.
I want to look at another group of people affected by the budget, and that is women, generally, in the community. There is an old proverb that states: `Women hold up half the sky'. This proverb originated in China in recognition of the global contribution of women, a point that seems to have been discarded by the government in this budget. When commenting on the outcomes for women in the budget, Eva Cox of the Women's Electoral Lobby, stated: 
When the government starts its women's budget statement by announcing women's suffrage a century ago, it is obvious that our present concerns are not high on their agenda.
It appears that this government has no comprehension about the challenges that face women in our society today, many of whom are struggling to juggle the financial need to work as well as trying to raise a family. The juggling act is a very real issue for women in Hasluck, most of whom can literally not afford to take five years out of the work force, due to the growing financial pressures that record household debt and rising interest rates are placing on their families.
The only new real measure for women in the budget, the much touted baby bonus, actually provides nothing for women who must return to work after their first child is born or indeed for women having their second child. To add insult to injury, the government has again ensured that it will be looking after the better off in society by ensuring that only families with incomes over $50,000 will receive the maximum benefits for stay-at-home mothers. For those women who do return to work, the level of assistance provided for child care remains a patchwork that especially does not meet the needs of mothers working irregular hours or shiftwork.
What else has it discarded? As the implementation of the baby bonus scheme demonstrates, along with the government's constant attacks on the sick and disabled, this is a government that is happy to discard the concepts of equity and fairness in Australian society. Nowhere is this more clearly demonstrated than if we look at what the government has sought to preserve in the federal budget. One thing it has preserved, it seems to me, is the coalition parties' ethos of looking after the better off in this society at the expense of the average Australian. You have to look no further than the proposal to give the richest three per cent of the population a tax break by giving them a 30 per cent reduction in the superannuation surcharge rate whilst at the same time giving no such reduction to low-income and middle-income earners. During the last parliamentary sitting, Labor's proposal for a fairer system which would see all Australians receiving a cut in their superannuation surcharge rate was deemed financially sound by the Liberal Party's superannuation expert Senator John Watson. One wonders: will the government now move to grant this tax reduction to all Australians and not just the rich? The answer is no.
Also, why has the government decided to make it easier for employers to get away with not paying superannuation contributions to casual employees? By extending the minimum income level calculations from a monthly basis to a three-monthly basis, it will now be much easier for employers to manipulate the hours of casual workers so that they do not reach the minimum pay level required for a superannuation contribution to be made. It is just another way that it has opened the door to exploit those who are in the most vulnerable positions in our community.
Again much touted in the budget was how the government was going to address the pay parity issue for registered nurses in the aged care industry. As we all know, nationally the wage gap between aged care nurses and their public sector counterparts is at least $84.48 per week. The additional $51.2 million in the 2002-03 budget translates into less than an extra dollar per resident per day, a one per cent increase. For an average 48-bed nursing home or hostel, this means an extra $48 per day to increase wages across all shifts. You do not need to be Einstein to know that this additional funding will not be enough to address the wage disparities and stem the flow of experienced nurses out of the aged care industry. 
I now move to the fourth criterion of the Prime Minister's policy of reform, discard, preserve and refurbish. What have they chosen to refurbish? Nothing at all. They have touted their Intergenerational Report as the blueprint for our future. Their flawed report concludes that we must cut expenditure now to pay for a future ageing population. One wonders where members of the government have been if they were not aware of this increasing problem of an ageing community. You have to examine the report itself and look at some of the ridiculous assumptions that underpin it—the accuracy of fiscal projections made 40 years in advance and the assumption that health issues for 70-year-olds in 2002 are going to be the same health issues for 70-year-olds in 2042. You only have to look back over the last 40 years to see the changes that have occurred. There is little, if any, clear detail about the effectiveness of cost-cutting now in areas such as health and education and training in reducing expenditure in the long term.
I also want to talk about the lack of refurbishment in my own electorate. There will be no refurbishment on the number of GPs who bulk-bill in the Hasluck electorate, no initiatives to better combine federal and state health funding more efficiently, no funding for tertiary places for potential students in Perth's outer eastern suburbs and no funding for the Midland historic railway workshop precinct. Given the Prime Minister's own criteria for judging good government, what has this budget delivered? It will reform the PBS and disability support at the expense of the most vulnerable in our community, discard those who are sick and disadvantaged, preserve the standing of the well-off at the cost of the average Australian, and refurbish absolutely nothing. On their own criteria this has been a miserable failure for good government and certainly for the electors of Hasluck.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—At the outset I want to make it clear that I am speaking on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03. Although this is a cognate debate, as I introduced the other two bills on behalf of the government it would not be appropriate for me to speak on those bills and I certainly intend to desist from that. Having said that, there is a very wide-ranging debate permitted on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03, and I am pleased to have the opportunity of making a contribution.
I cannot help mentioning the remarks made by the honourable member for Hasluck. The only failure with respect to the electorate of Hasluck is the honourable member herself. It is certainly inappropriate for her to suggest that the bills currently before the chamber have in some way failed the people of her electorate.
The government is particularly proud of its budget which continues the sound and strong economic management of the government since it was first elected to office in 1996. It was re-elected in 1998 and the election in November last year saw the Howard government returned for a third term with an increased majority. During the last election campaign, seeking from the electorate of Fisher my return to this parliament, I announced the Fisher 10-point plan: a number of key priorities which I have committed myself to work for during this term of government to ensure even better outcomes for people of the Sunshine Coast and, in particular, people of the electorate of Fisher, which comprises the central and Sunshine coast regions. 
It is important when we are elected to represent local communities that we seek to cooperate with those people elected at all levels of government. I enjoy a very fruitful relationship with the members for Maroochydore and Caloundra but, regrettably, the state member for Kawana seems all too often intent on playing politics, even when the result means our mutual constituents are substantially disadvantaged. I also enjoy a very sound working relationship with the councillors of both the Caloundra City Council and the Shire of Maroochy.
The 10-point plan that I mentioned prior to the poll has a number of elements, some of which are matters of federal responsibility and others are matters of local and state responsibility. I am not going to apologise for the fact that I was prepared to stand up before the electorate of Fisher and say that I was prepared to fight for improved outcomes even if some of these matters were not, under our Constitution, matters of federal political responsibility.
One of the complaints I regularly get in my electorate office is from ordinary, decent people resident in communities from Maroochydore south to Caloundra and west to Montville who are concerned about the state ALP government's serial inability to deal with the ongoing problem of car hoons.
—I am pleased to see the member for Reid in the chamber. The New South Wales Labor government has a policy which has seen car hoons have their vehicles confiscated in certain circumstances. The Queensland state government is looking at introducing some new laws which may prove useful, but the police service would have a much greater opportunity to clamp down on car hoons if the Sunshine Coast received its adequate quota of police service members right through our rapidly growing area. Regrettably, because of the ineffectiveness of the state Labor members in the area, the Premier of Queensland seems reluctant to give us police numbers which we desperately need if we are to ensure that the safety and security of coast residents is maintained and safeguarded.
I get lots of complaints from residents who have their peaceful enjoyment of life interrupted by car hoons who have no respect for the civil rights of others. I hear about motor vehicles tearing up lawns and people being unable to sleep. I have called on the state government to bring in very strong legislation to deprive car hoons of their motor vehicles as the price of these people being uncivic-minded. In July, I am calling a public meeting for residents of the electorate of Fisher who want to express their concerns and share their experiences about the ongoing problems caused by car hoons. 
This is probably the No. 1 issue of people ringing my electorate office. They are concerned over the failure of the state government to act decisively in the way that Premier Carr has in New South Wales in relation to this ongoing endemic problem of car hoons. I am not going to apologise for standing up today in the federal parliament to highlight the plight of ordinary, decent residents of the Sunshine Coast who are having their lifestyle destroyed by car hoons, who are simply thugs. They are people who break the law and they should have the full force of the law thrown at them. The price of that force of the law ought to be that, when a car hoon commits such an offence, the vehicle is subject to confiscation. It is simply not adequate for the state government to attack this problem with a wet lettuce; it is important that the state government listens to the community. I am calling on Premier Beattie, the state Labor government and state members to listen to the results of the community meeting which will be convened to talk about, and demand action from the state government in relation to, the problem of car hoons. 
Another issue which has concerned me is the fact that sewage is pumped into the ocean by coast based councils. The Howard government is the greenest government in Australia's history—it has set up the Natural Heritage Trust and it is the first government which has been prepared to address the impact of 200 years of European settlement in Australia—yet we find that local councils are still pumping sewage into the ocean. I am particularly keen to work with the councils to ensure that this no longer happens. It is unacceptable that people who travel right around the country to enjoy our wonderful Sunshine Coast beaches should have to share the waters off the Sunshine Coast with sewage pumped into the ocean by councils on the Sunshine Coast. There has been some activity by councils with respect to this matter but, as we have now entered the 21st century, it is simply not adequate for this to continue.
Another issue I highlighted, as I have done over the years, is the problem of unexploded ordnance, particularly in the Kawana Waters-Currimundi area, and I was fortunate to be able to attract the outgoing Minister for Defence, Peter Reith, to the Sunshine Coast prior to the election over this. It is a tragedy that unexploded ordnance, ordnance that has been around for the last 50 years since the Second World War, is regularly found, often by children. The state government has permitted the land to be cut up for residential development, Caloundra City Council has permitted subdivision to occur and the developer has made substantial profits from the sale of the blocks but we do have unexploded ordnance still present. It would be a tragedy if a child had to lose their life or a limb before this endemic problem was attended to.
I am particularly keen to work with Caloundra City Council, the state government and the developer to make sure that this problem, which has been around for half a century, is resolved once and for all. It is not primarily a federal problem but we do have a circumstance where our community's children are endangered by the fact that unexploded ordnance could be lurking in bushland or on beaches. We have had very large numbers of near escapes where young people have discovered these things, and then, of course, the ordnance has had to be removed or exploded. This morning I was very pleased to talk to the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, about this matter.
One of the difficulties we have as a fast-growing area is that our infrastructure never seems to catch up with the growth in our population. People are moving from what I like to refer to as the rust belt areas of southern Australia to the sun belt, and it is important that the state government continues to pump additional funds into providing much needed infrastructure on the Sunshine Coast. The city of Caloundra is a rapidly growing area and regrettably the road from the highway is simply two lanes in places. I am calling on the state Labor government to improve access to the city of Caloundra from the Bruce Highway and to widen Caloundra Road to four lanes. I have had discussions with my state colleague Mrs Joan Sheldon, the member for Caloundra, and Caloundra City Council concerning this matter, and we are all determined to push the state government into this much needed action.
It is tragic when a state government plays politics. What happened was that the state government—the Beattie government—were elected and immediately upon election to office they dropped down the list of priorities the upgrading of Caloundra Road to four lanes. So in effect they said to the people of Caloundra, `Look, we're going to penalise you because you had the temerity to return Mrs Joan Sheldon as the state member for Caloundra.' Joan is an excellent member, and I just think it is appalling that Premier Beattie and the state Labor government show this level of vindictiveness in that they are prepared to penalise people because they have exercised their democratic right to choose to return a Liberal representative. 
The federal government has made funds available to upgrade the access road to the Sunshine Coast from Brisbane, and I am certainly working to seek additional Commonwealth and state government funds to widen the Bruce Highway to six lanes along its entire length from Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast. A very large proportion of tourists visiting what is undoubtedly the premier tourist destination in Australia travel to the Sunshine Coast by road. If you look at how clogged the roads are, you will see that those circumstances could well be a disincentive to people travelling to the Sunshine Coast. If people are not able to gain access to the Sunshine Coast easily, that, of course, has a negative impact on our local economy. I am lobbying the Deputy Prime Minister and the state government to start work on this very necessary continued expansion of the Bruce Highway, to build on the outstanding contribution that the government has already made to date. In Maroochydore, which is a growth centre, I am pushing for financial assistance to construct the southern access link road, and I want to support the efforts by the Shire of Maroochy to make this a reality and to improve traffic flow into the central business district of Maroochydore.
On the Sunshine Coast there is particularly strong support for the proposal to build a Sunshine Coast arts and exhibition centre. The Sunshine Coast is, as I mentioned earlier, one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. We have a large retired population, a large population of young families and a very interested and active arts community. It is important that the Sunshine Coast receives such a centre, which will enable a very large number of shows, conferences and conventions to travel to the Sunshine Coast and take place in our local community, boosting the economy and consequently increasing jobs. I am working with the Maroochy Shire Council and the local community to do what can be done to bring this wonderful dream of a Sunshine Coast arts and exhibition centre to reality.
Another matter we are looking at very strongly is a feasibility study into the development of a multimodal transport and communications corridor on the Sunshine Coast. As we continue to grow rapidly, it really is important that we have better methods of access to the Sunshine Coast, including rail. It is something which the entire community needs and it is something which we are working for. It is a particularly important element in the growth of the Sunshine Coast and the infrastructure and facilities needed to support our rapidly growing population.
The present government is the greenest government in Australia's history, and I want to support very strongly more Work for the Dole projects, more Green Corps projects and more Jobs Pathway programs allocated to the electorate of Fisher to help young people into work and to benefit our local environment. We have done pretty well in preceding years, but we have to build on that success and make sure that we get more Work for the Dole and Green Corps projects and more Jobs Pathway programs.
The wonderful thing about these programs is that we have projects of enduring environmental and general benefit to the Sunshine Coast community. Just for a moment I will refer to Green Corps projects: the young people who participate in Green Corps learn something about the environment, become work ready and also know that they have the satisfaction of repairing the impact of a couple of hundred years of European settlement in Australia. I am pleased that we have delivered Work for the Dole, Green Corps and Jobs Pathway, but more still needs to be done. 
As a rapidly growing area, the Sunshine Coast central business district town of Maroochydore deserves a Medicare office, and I am lobbying the federal government for a Medicare office in Maroochydore. We have offices at the moment at Caloundra and Kawana Waters, and I fought very hard to make sure that those offices remained. I am pleased that we have been able to deliver to the people of Kawana Waters and Caloundra the continued services of those local Medicare offices. But it is also appropriate that Maroochydore, in the central part of the Sunshine Coast, also receives a Medicare office.
The HMAS Brisbane has to be sunk, and the federal government has allocated the ship to the Sunshine Coast on the basis that it be sunk off Kawana-Mooloolaba. The federal government has also allocated up to $3 million both for the preparation of the ship for sinking and for its actual sinking; but, regrettably, at the present time we are being met with a total lack of cooperation from the state Labor government, and the Premier of Queensland has refused to sign the deed of gift to accept this ship, which will cost the state government very little.
The local community will be placing very great pressure on the Premier of Queensland, and I would like to call on the state member for Kawana, Mr Cummins, to show that he is not as ineffective as everyone believes he is. He ought to get in there and back this very important job creation project, which will provide growth not only for our tourist industry in general and the accommodation industry in particular but also for other, additional jobs, which I think is a very important aim.
I have been disgusted by the way that Mr Cummins has to date shown a complete lack of interest in this very important project. Premier Beattie will look very silly if the federal government moves the ship to another location off the Australian coast and if he, as a result, loses this moneymaking venture to another state or to overseas. I am calling on the Premier to look at the needs of the Sunshine Coast and to support the very important stand taken by the federal government, which says that the HMAS Brisbane should be sunk off the Sunshine Coast as a dive wreck.
The budget currently before the chamber aims to keep Australia safe, our borders secure and our economy strong. The budget has been well accepted by people of the Sunshine Coast who value the fundamental objectives of sound economic management. The government will contribute $1.2 million over four years to a productive ageing centre to be established at the University of the Sunshine Coast. This was proposed by the government during the last election campaign and fulfils yet another government commitment to the Sunshine Coast and older Australians. The centre will provide services to the seniors community, and it will operate as a corporate entity in its own right and have a formal and financial relationship with the National Seniors Association. This is an outstanding budget, and I am proud to support it.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—During hearings before a committee on 3 June, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Allan Hawke, put another hole in the government's defence of its budget that it was based essentially on the needs of national security. He indicated that before the election, despite government claims, his department told this government that there was no way that costs could be held with regard to these areas, despite the funding of its election promises at a later stage. 
Quite clearly, this budget deficit has very little to do with defence requirements. It has far more to do with the $5 billion that the country has lost in currency swaps. It is far more relevant to note that $1 billion has been devoted by this government to advertising and consultancies. It is far more relevant to look at the outsourcing of banking from the Reserve Bank of Australia by various government departments, which also lost millions. A larger part of this budget problem is to do with the government's total failure with regard to IT outsourcing. The taxpayer is up for a huge cost because of the incompetence of the previous, now retired, minister. It has a lot more to do with the home loan scheme, which saw 220 people buying homes worth $1 million receive assistance. They are the reasons why this budget is in deficit. It has very little to do with defence.
I noted today in question time the desperate attempts by the Prime Minister to sound important with regard to his visit to the United States. Trying to make his visit relevant, every person that said hello to him in the corridor and every person that he met in the street was quoted. Despite how obsequious he is and despite his attempt to race with Guam, Puerto Rico or wherever to be the most obsequious, obedient supporter of the United States, the reality is, as a colleague pointed out to me, that he did not rate too highly in last week's Washington Post. He was competing against sex scandals in the US Catholic Church, the burial of a Vietnam veteran, Karzai's vote in Afghanistan, EPA plans with regard to coal burning, whether a few Democrats were using their association with Bush for re-election and a Chinese seizure of one asylum seeker. The competition was not really that outstanding, but he still did not merit a mention. Quite frankly, it really starts to show a few people where Australia does stand with regard to US perceptions.
I am reminded of his performance at the time of September 11. There he was on national television, on the spot, seeming to be important. Then one of the three national broadcasters of US television said, `We are now going to take you to the only world leader in the United States at the moment.' They certainly did not turn to John Howard; they turned to the President of Lithuania, which has a population of 3.6 million. That is the kind of payback that he has received, and it has been the same thing in regard to trade policy.
Quite frankly, the attempt by this government to say that people have to suffer with regard to the disability pension and that they have to cop increases in pharmaceutical costs because of defence, terrorism, security et cetera is extremely shallow. Many of the reported defence expenditures that the government tries to use as a facade for these antisocial changes are actually to be met through funding changes in the portfolio and subsequent savings.
I want to say that in my electorate, in contrast to that of the previous speaker, the government's budget has not been warmly received. I did promise to read the words of one constituent into the record. The constituent says:
I would like to let you know how the proposed budget measures will affect me! Please; Sir! pass this on to Mr Costello!!!!!
I work as a security guard, &, earn just under $30,000 a year ... This is in addition to periodical, medication price increases!!! 
I work hard, &, long hours, I don't ask for “FREE” medications!
I pay my taxes, &, understand we all must contribute to the running of this beautiful country.
I am not a “bludger”, I have a mortgage!
But; I have to say! These proposals are very much UNAUSTRALIAN, and, NOT a FAIR-GO!!!!!!!!!!
That typifies the reaction in my electorate.
The budget has not been warmly greeted by people in the field of disability as the government seeks to deprive people of their current entitlement to the disability pension. ACROD, a group interested in this field, has asked me:
... to ensure that disability employment organisations in your constituency are able to continue to provide services for people with disability.
The Down Syndrome Association of New South Wales says:
... the proposal to move people with disabilities, including those with intellectual disabilities, currently receiving DSP, who are assessed as able to work more than 15 hours a week at award wages, to the Newstart Allowance—
is an attack that is to be resisted. It goes on to say:
People with Down syndrome need and require support in all aspects of their lives. Today, people with Down syndrome are developing their independence. An important component of which is seeking employment opportunities.
Similarly, there were statements by the Physical Disability Council of New South Wales asking me:
... to do everything in your power to oppose and stop the Government's proposed reduction in eligibility for Disability Support Pension.
So we have the main players in this field—the people representing people who find it very difficult to articulate their thoughts, people who are suppressed, people who have disabilities—saying that the government's changes are totally wrong.
No less a person than Kerryn Phelps of the AMA commented that the government's medication changes `will hit the sickest and the poorest—people with chronic illness will be particularly affected, as will people with young children who are often at the doctor's'. This of course comes at the same time as the government's broad threat to basically get rid of Medicare in this country. It wants to take us down the road of the US system where, unless you are in the most desperate, dire circumstances—in the bottom 10 per cent of the economy—you will have to pay for it. If we are to have that system, the vast majority of people who feel some identity with the Medicare system in this country will no longer feel an identity because they will not have self-interest. Essentially, the government is trying to bring in a system in this country which plays to private corporate interests. This is the same government which now says that we should be alarmed at the cost of pharmaceuticals in this country; that we have to increase prices because they are getting too expensive. This is the same government which last year for the first time tried to appoint representatives of the pharmaceutical industry to the bodies that basically decide which—and for what price—pharmaceuticals will come into play in our system. Last year the government was trying to give the corporations more power in the system. Obviously the only interest the pharmaceuticals would have is to get more bucks in return for their research. But the government is now saying we should be worried about the cost. This is a significant attempt by this government, now that it is in power, to increase these costs. This is not the first time: it is just a continuation of what it has been doing over the years. 
With regard to the disability pension, the government is saying that all new applicants and those being reviewed after 1 July 2003 will be subject to this change. The reality is that for once this government has not been totally doctrinally driven; it has looked at a few realities in the workplace. These days, people over 40 offering themselves to employers are basically regarded as pests. Half the time they are not going to get jobs. Perhaps some people went onto the disability pension because of this reality. Quite frankly, a policy which is designed to deprive them of $52 a fortnight, to force them to tramp around to employers who are not really interested in them, really makes you doubt the practical outcome of it all. Up to 200,000 people receiving disability support pensions will be forced onto Newstart if the government proposals are implemented. This will mean very real suffering for very real Australians.
Quite frankly, I am unimpressed with the retinue of government speakers who have come into the House and into the Main Committee saying that the government have made the hard decisions. They are not making the hard decisions for themselves, for federal members of parliament; they are making hard decisions for people in our electorates. They are making hard decisions for people for whom $52 a fortnight is big dollars. They are making hard decisions because of their own mismanagement in a variety of portfolios that have virtually nothing to do with defence requirements. 
In one of the portfolios that I have been interested in, we have seen $1 million provided for Australian citizenship campaigns. These were undertaken to regain some momentum after last year's promotional campaign which was conducted for only a few months and which has foundered. The government have also guaranteed in this budget that the Living in Harmony initiative will continue for a further three years. There has been no increase in funding and I note that more than half the allocation for this aspect of multiculturalism goes to departmental overheads rather than to grants to the community organisations that are really doing something practical out in the electorate. A variety of interest groups have approached me with their criticisms of the government's accent in this policy area: that the government's only concern is to slap themselves on the back and say how great the country is, that we are multicultural and have very few problems. 
I know the new Northern Territory government, amongst others, has said that we should show a bit of interest in the problems we still face. That government reflects a broad number of people in Australia who say that on the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination we still have racial vilification, racial discrimination et cetera in this country. We should not spend this money on allowing the minister of the day to run around the place getting a few television shots and assuring everyone that everything is well. That is not to say that there are not a significant number of groups funded by this money who do good work.
The government has reached a stage where there has been an initial evaluation of the first stage of the Living in Harmony initiative but still today the outcomes of that have not been publicly released. The full evaluation of that program has not been given to the public and perhaps having that out in the marketplace for discussion is overdue. The budget also announced that from July 2003 there will be funding for the AMEP, the migrant English Special Preparatory Program and the Home Tutor Scheme Enhancement Program. Once again it is a continuation of current funding levels. There are no initiatives, no changes and no improvements.  
The future delivery of migrant English services remains rather uncertain due to the fact that the tender process has not been completed and could be another six to 12 months away. I noted, in discussing this issue with various groups around Australia, concern that we have situations—in Perth, for instance—where husbands and wives are doing courses at two different colleges across town. Obviously the management of that in the family situation is not easy. In some of these tenders there has to be a search to see how, in delivering these services, we can help people with their real family problems.
There is no ongoing increase in funding under the two main settlement programs: the migrant resource centres and the Community Settlement Services Scheme. That is despite the fact that there have been increased award costs for the staff after 10 years, there are problems in securing adequate premises for these organisations and there are arising in this country new communities which have needs. With regard to the award rise, the New South Wales government—these wages are, in a sense, proportionately funded by state and federal governments—has come to the party to make sure that when people get the increase, after 10 years without an increase, they do not have to work extra hours and reduce services: that the increase is funded. The response of the ministers in this government has been, `Go and do harder work or make sure your services are reduced so that we don't have to pay any more money.' 
There is a one-off increase of $1 million from savings elsewhere which, for some unknown reason, is devoted to rural and regional areas. One of the lamentable realities in this country is the continued concentration of new arrivals in Sydney and Melbourne. We know those figures. We know the trend is worsening. We know that not only is there a continued movement of new arrivals to Sydney but they are specifically going to a smaller and smaller part of Sydney. When this government does find some money through savings for some pork-barrelling exercise to help some National Party or Liberal Party rural member, it proposes that these resources go into an unspecified, undescribed rural or regional area. The real need in Sydney, where people are unemployed because they lack English and where the numbers are increasing all the time, is being ignored.
When asked last week in Senate estimates, the department said that the minister had not yet decided how the funding was to be allocated. He has decided to do a bit of pork-barrelling, but he has not decided yet to find an excuse or a facade to defend the prospect. There is no shift by DIMIA on the issue of services for temporary protection visa holders, but it is worth noting that the Minister for Education, Science and Training, in a slight distinction of policy in the government, announced extra funding to the states for intensive language tuition for the school-age children of TPV families.
The final area of expenditure in multicultural and citizenship affairs by the department is $3.7 million over three years to former child migrants from the UK and Malta. That is to help them travel overseas to be reunited with their natural families. Whilst the opposition welcomes those measures, they are essentially a response to a Senate committee of inquiry chaired by Senator Crowley. The coalition response to that was that there was no need for that inquiry. The coalition was somewhat uninterested in the process. Now that that inquiry has come down and shown the level of suffering, despite the fact that the government refuses to apologise for its failure to properly exercise its clear duty of care to these children, it is providing some dollars. The details of the travel fund have not yet been determined. It is about time that these guidelines are looked at to ensure that people can travel and can have an overdue reunion with their families. 
The expenditure in this area of multiculturalism and citizenship pales into insignificance when we see the heavy expenditure devoted to the so-called `Pacific solution', which we have been told in the past few days is no longer a solution. The nightmare the electorate faced late last year was going to be rectified by excising a few islands, but that is no longer a solution. We have to go further. The amount of money the government is devoting to settling people, helping them gain employment and helping them live in this country, work for it and assist it is nothing like the $430 million over four years for offshore processing in Nauru. The other amount of $455 million is for the Christmas and Cocos islands. There is $195 million for construction costs and associated roadworks. We all know that these so-called solutions, paying off the Nauruan regime, letting people have their health care et cetera, are going to do nothing to solve the fundamental problem of the large number of rejectees that the government is now faced with having to detain, in all probability for a number of years, and the cost to the Australian taxpayer. We were told back then that these people were never going to step on Australian shores, but you can bet your bottom dollar that they will. They will have to be detained for a number of years because we do not have diplomatic relations with Iraq. Syria and Iran now refuse to take back failed applicants. The overall solution is no longer good enough. The government now wants to basically excise other parts of Australia.
In conclusion, this government has made a lamentable attempt to justify a tax on people's disability entitlements and in areas such as pharmaceuticals, which will make it very difficult for people who live in electorates like those in Western Sydney, on the basis that the government is beefing up defence and is in the forefront of the fight against international terrorism. The real cost is from the government's bungling with regard to transactions on the exchanges and making commitments at the last election that it knew it did not have the funding for. It was told by Defence that there would be some requirements with regard to increased defence expenditure. At the time, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister said that it was all covered and that there were no problems. That has been refuted by the Secretary to the Department of Defence. It is not good enough to expect that the opposition and the minor parties should support these changes, which are going to hurt the people in our electorates, from a government which is a very minor player internationally, despite the pretensions of the Prime Minister in question time. It is taken for granted because he is such an obsequious supporter; whether it is on climate change, trade policy or defence, he is always reliable. Quite frankly, when you are fully taken for granted, you do not get much say.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,2002-06-17,"—It is always interesting to follow the member for Reid. I followed him through the door in 1984 into the state parliament. It is also interesting to see the metamorphosis from his ebullient support of the Wran-Ferguson government to his present negative state. Obviously, the opposition are squirming over this budget. It has been a magnificent performance by the Treasurer, the member for Higgins, and there is no doubt in my mind that historians will treat him kindly because of what he has done for Australia. I am very proud to stand here and support this budget. There is no doubt that Australia is in a very strong financial position, not because this government is sitting back and letting things happen but because it is making some very hard decisions to ensure that the country has a long-term economic base. This budget, like previous budgets, addresses those particular problems. 
There is no doubt that there were problems associated with September 11, and that those problems associated with that event shocked the world. I was stunned. I could not believe that anything like that could happen. We are now dealing with a different situation—the world will never be the same—where we are all suspicious. We do not quite know what is likely to happen. We are cautious about different groups in our community, which is very sad. But the fact is that we have to put extra precautions in place to make sure that our free society cannot be attacked. That of course means quite a lot of expenditure. There is no doubt that money is expended in this budget, as it was before this budget was brought down, that the government—and, I dare say, Australia—would have preferred not to expend. Nevertheless, if we are to protect the rights of the citizens of this country, we cannot run away from our responsibilities. We have to spend that money to ensure that this country remains a free country and that the citizens of this country are protected.
The money that is expended on Defence is, I believe, expended wisely. I do not apologise for the fact that we have been, and are, strong friends of America. My father and uncles were very proud to fight with the Americans in the Pacific war. Only for the Americans, this country would have been conquered in the Second World War. It was undoubtedly the Americans who saved this country—not that I would blindly support everything they do. I think the Prime Minister has made that very clear. But, on the other hand, if we believe that we need strong friends, then we could have no stronger friends than the Americans at the present time. I am sure that that was highlighted again when the Prime Minister was in America last week. 
Let it be said that I know the Prime Minister put very plainly to them what Australia thinks about trade. I have no illusions about what the Americans think. The fact is that, unless we keep putting forward those views, we will not be heard. We have to continue talking, not just to the President but also to congressional leaders, and putting the view very strongly about where we stand. I believe that, if we do that, we will get that message through to the Americans. They have told our leaders when they have been in America that they appreciate the support of Australia in the fight that they have at the present time. I am sure that eventually—I do not believe it will be in the short term—we will get some recognition for that.
I note that the Labor Party have given up. Today in question time there was almost glee on the other side when trade was even mentioned. They have given up: they are not prepared to go over there and put a strong voice forward; they are prepared to just roll over and accept the fact that America might agree to some of the trade provisions that we think are very important. I have listened quite closely to some of the speeches of members opposite. I have had the opportunity, sitting in the chair, to do that quite often. I dare say that it is the problem of all oppositions that there is very short memory about some of the issues that were of importance just a few years ago, that have now changed.
I was an agricultural leader in Australia when penalty interest rates to farmers hit 23 per cent. That hurt enormously. Now, when there is a quarter of a per cent increase, people get delighted. They say, `The government has failed. Interest rates have gone up from 5¾ per cent to maybe six per cent.' All of a sudden, the government has failed! We still have the lowest interest rates in 30 years. It is not a fluke. The reason we have the current interest rates is that our economy has been managed in such a way that they have been kept down. I have been amazed in the last few years that Australia was not affected by the Asian downturn and then the problems in America, which obviously went though a recession. That is the first time in my memory that we have not been affected by those types of global downturns, particularly in America. There was a common saying when I was younger: if America has a cold, we have pneumonia. This time it did not happen, and it was quite remarkable. I was rather stunned that it did not happen and that the Australian economy continued to grow. 
I will not claim all the credit for this government, because I think some of the decisions were taken by previous governments. We are now managing our economy in such a way that it is able to withstand outside forces. Our economy is quite small—I do not run away from that fact—compared to those of other large countries of the world. We as Australians should be proud of the fact that this country has managed to withstand these outside influences and has continued to grow.
I note that as usual the opposition are trying to zero in on some areas of the budget that they think might be detrimental to the community and on fertile areas in which they might be able to get some support. If you look at the provisions in the budget, as usual we do not get the full story. I listened to the member for Hasluck earlier, as well as a number of other opposition members, speak about the PBS. There seems to be a total lack of understanding that this scheme is growing at an exponential rate. You just have to look at the Intergenerational Report which the Treasurer has put in this budget, which people are trying to pooh-pooh. We must look ahead. We all talk about the impending baby boom, the bulge. I am part of that or the start of it. There will be a huge problem for this country if we do not address some of these issues. Fewer and fewer people will be paying more and more to support the elderly in this community who are living longer and longer.
I saw figures the other day which showed that the average male in Australia now lives 76 years and the average female lives 82 years. That forecast is much higher now than it was when I was a young person. In those days, I think males lived to about 65 and women a bit over 70. We are living longer and longer. We are now consuming medicine a lot more in our older years than we did in the past, so there is a real challenge as to how to manage and fund it. The PBS is a marvellous scheme. There are very few countries in the world—in fact, I do not think there is another country in the world—with a scheme as good as this. We are very lucky that we can afford it, but we cannot allow it to run out of control.
The speakers opposite zero in on the fact that there has been a dollar increase in prescriptions. But there is still a ceiling there. The opposition speakers seem to be saying it is the chronically ill who are going to be affected by this. That is not true. Maybe those who do not use the pharmaceutical system as much, who do not get to the ceiling, will be the ones who will pay. The ceiling is still there for those who are chronically ill and they will be protected by that. There has to be some sort of protection in the system. In the budget we say that doctors should be more aware of what they are prescribing. We talk about pharmaceutical companies as well. I think there is quite a lot to answer for there. We talk about trying to address some of these issues. We must look at this on the broader scale.
I have not heard from the opposition in this debate what they would do. How would they contain the PBS? Obviously containing the PBS is going to be a challenge for all governments in the future. We have to do some thinking. We cannot just sit back and be critical. It is about time we sat down and did some thinking. I do not say that all knowledge exists on the government side—I do not accept that at all—but I do think we have to be positive about this and not just run off and say to people, `It's terrible. The government has put up our prescriptions by a dollar.' How do we address this problem? That is a challenge that the opposition has not addressed at this time. 
The disability pension is another issue that has been zeroed in on. If you look at how this pension has grown over the last few years, you have to ask: why has this pension grown at such a rate? Maybe it is doubtful whether some of the people who are on this pension should be on the pension. I won't name names but I am sure you could look at a number of people in my electorate and say to yourself, `I don't know quite why these people are on the disability pension.' It is not about the people who are totally disabled or people who are desperately disabled. However, I have to say that when this furore about the disability pension erupted in the media one of the most disabled persons in my electorate, a young fellow who had a bad accident in the surf similar to one in the claims we heard of recently in Sydney—he just dived into the surf and finished up a paraplegic—came out and said, `I don't want to work 15 hours a week. I don't want to work 30 hours a week. I want to work full time.' And he does. He is a very good contributor to the work force.
Instead of being negative about this, we should be looking at these people because most of them want to work. Most of them want to have a skill. Most of them can be trained. In the budget there are 73,000 new training and work opportunities for disabled people. The government is saying it is not just a matter of looking at the disability pension; it is a matter of getting people into some training. We need to look positively at that.
If you look closely at the budget papers, the Commonwealth is contributing $2.7 billion to a new Commonwealth and state disability agreement, $743 million more than in the previous agreement. This is an agreement with the state governments that helps disabled people. We look at areas where we can try to help some of these people. If you start projecting into the future and think about what we said earlier about the baby boomers coming through the population, you will see that we need these people as employees in the future because the unemployment rate is already coming down. In my electorate it is already down to 9.6 per cent, which is three per cent above the average. Do you know what it used to be? It used to be 16 per cent. It is down to 9.6 per cent.
These people may be disabled, but there is no good reason why they cannot get a good job and good training. We will be needing these people. It is not a matter of kicking them off a pension; it is a matter of training them and getting them some skills so that they can work in the community, and there is no doubt that they can do that these days. With the technology that we have today, there is no good reason why a lot of people cannot work. I keep thinking about that scientist.
—Steve Hawking.
—Yes, just have a look at him. He cannot speak. I think he has motor neurone disease. He is disabled but is the greatest brain in the world. He is a professor at Oxford. I am saying that that is what we should be looking at. We should be a little more positive about this. This is not about saying: `This terrible government.' This is about asking: `How do we help these people? How do we get them trained? How do we get them into the work force?' 
Similarly, one should look at the traineeships and the apprenticeships that this government has introduced. I find the Jobs Pathway Program is working extremely well. Some of these problems go back a long way. They go back to the days when we brought in Austudy and where students, instead of going to a college and getting training, stayed back at school. There were problems with Austudy. For example, there were students there who did not want to learn and they caused problems for the ones who did want to learn. The Jobs Pathway Program is a great program. It gives students in the later stages of their education an opportunity to glimpse what a certain job might be like, and then, if it does not suit them, it is not too late for them to change paths and do something else. Often people make up their minds and say, `I want to be a neurosurgeon,' or something like that, and when they get there they say, `I really didn't want to do this.' Maybe that is an extreme example. But the fact is that, with the Jobs Pathway Program, people can get a glimpse of what the job is likely to be, and then they can say, `Yes, I am interested in that,' or, `No, I'm not interested in that.' But we have gone a step further by saying that those employers who are prepared to take on an apprentice or a trainee will get a payment of $750 and, in fact, if they continue on and employ that person they will get another $750. So there is an incentive for employers to try to do something for these people and to give them a chance to get employment.
I will now turn to the veterans area. I think governments of all persuasions in Australia have always been very generous to veterans. In fact, there are very few countries in the world that look after their veterans like we do. It probably goes back to the fact that we have a pretty sad war history. I think the member for Herbert may have mentioned this in debate in the lower house. When you look back to the First World War in particular, you see that we lost 80,000 men. To put that in perspective you have to remember that Australia had four million people in those days, so that was a huge number of people for us to lose. Governments have always been focused on the needs of veterans, and I think this particular budget supports that. It gives extra benefits to veterans so that they can live with security in their old age.
Another area that I am very keen about is the area of health care. I will not go into the total funding of health care, because that could probably take up a full debate. I see as very important the fact that we have offered to provide six radiation oncology services across Australia. I am putting up my hand for one of those, and I am sure a lot of other members will be putting up their hands for them. On the North Coast of New South Wales in Lismore, which is the centre of that coastal strip from Port Macquarie through to the Gold Coast, there are two major hospitals—the base hospital and St Vincents—which probably have some of the best specialists available, particularly in those regional areas. That is an area where I believe that an oncology unit would be very helpful. We missed out in the last round of MRI allocations.
—It went to Dandenong.
—You will not get the next one, because we have our hands up.
—Townsville has two.
—Oh, my gosh—that is a marginal seat, is it! We desperately need that MRI facility. St Vincent's Hospital in Lismore has an MRI; it is just that it has to get accreditation under Medicare, and there is no doubt in my mind we will get that. 
As I said to start with, I am excited about this budget. Obviously, there are special circumstances surrounding its formulation, and it addresses those particular challenges immediately in front of us. This budget keeps Australia on a very sound financial basis: it will ensure that our interest rates remain low compared to historical levels; it will ensure that inflation is kept under control; it will ensure that our small businesses and our farmers are not ripped off by having to pay high interest rates as they were in the years under the previous Labor government; and it will ensure that young people, in particular, paying off mortgages, will be able to own their own homes because of the low interest rates. I believe that Peter Costello will go down in history as one of the best treasurers in the history of Australia.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—Today in question time the House welcomed Xanana Gusmao and Jose Ramos Horta as President and Foreign Minister of the newly independent nation of East Timor. They were received with great warmth by all members, and it was a moment of genuine joy on the floor of the House. All of us who have observed what has happened in East Timor over several years would not wish to dwell upon what should or should not have happened, what may or may not have happened, but would wish to rejoice that now the East Timorese have become, through self-determination, an independent nation. We should now dwell on the way in which Australia can continue to be a very friendly neighbour. That is the positive outcome that is most important to remember on a day like today, because those two gentlemen, along with a number of their colleagues, struggled for a long time to get to this point.
It is also a time to reflect upon Australia's capacity to operate within the region with our new neighbours—an area where, as a larger nation, we should be able to play a very big role—and to reflect that, perhaps, in the past, we have not played a very big role. Perhaps in the past we have not concentrated and focused on the issues of our new neighbours and the region. Some of those nations of the region confront some very grave problems. Australia should be turning again to look at the region and to decide on the ways in which we can help solve the region's problems, such as the ongoing problem of Bougainville and the way which PNG has developed since its independence so many years ago now. We can reflect upon the ways in which we can be a better neighbour: we can look at the current happenings in the Solomon Islands and in Vanuatu. When we think of a neighbour like Nauru, we remember the headlines like `Illegals in bogus passport racket' from last year—negative connotations of the way in which Nauru is allowing itself to be used by global organised crime. Perhaps we can think about how we can help those countries in our region.
This leads to one of the environmental problems that will well and truly impact on island nations—if we believe the theorists—which, of course, is the greenhouse effect. The global community is trying to come to grips with the way in which it can come together to address this. At the moment we have the discussions about what Australia is actually going to do in the context of the Kyoto protocol.
We have a vast difference developing between two international camps. On the one hand we have the US, especially since the election of George W. Bush as President, moving away from the Kyoto protocol and putting in place its own version. What we see developing now in the Australian context is perhaps a line of thought that places us in that camp rather than in the wider international camp. We really should look at what is happening with Kyoto to see how distinct this difference is and how we are putting ourselves on one side if we go down the United States track. All 15 European Union countries have signed the Kyoto protocol. They were followed earlier this month by Japan. Russia and New Zealand are to sign by the end of the year. That would leave the US and Australia to act. A total of 71 countries have now agreed to ratify the Kyoto protocol. 
Along the way Australia has been able to get a fairly good deal from the processes that arose out of the protocol. Having gained those concessions makes the government's position even more bewildering and puzzling. I admit that at the time those concessions were gained I was not totally satisfied. But the point is that in the present debate this government has to acknowledge it gained those concessions. It is now, it would appear, intending to move away from the whole process. The process is important; the protocol will put in place three economic instruments that would be open to countries that have ratified and are moving towards meeting their emission reduction targets. Those economic instruments are: (1) international emissions trading—the exchange of credits between industrialised countries to meet emission targets; (2) joint implementation—the creation of credits from projects in industrialised countries; and (3) the so-called clean development mechanism—the creation of credits from projects in developing countries to meet the industrialised countries' targets.
There has been great discussion about these instruments. First of all one has to go through a learning curve to get one's head around the notion of using economic instruments for environmental gains. But that is where we are situated in the early years of the 21st century; there is a developing awareness of the potential for such instruments. But if Australia places itself outside a mechanism that would allow it to participate in that system, we would be well and truly out of step. We would find it very difficult, once being shunned by the international community, to meet the targets that are set under the protocol and, more importantly, to take an active role in what is an international effort.
At the moment we have state governments acting on reducing carbon emissions—they are showing leadership when at present that leadership is lacking at the federal level. There are specific initiatives. For example, the Victorian government has set a target to reduce Victoria's greenhouse gas emissions by more than five per cent within a decade. Some of those targets are set within the context of many competing parties saying that those targets are not achievable and the interests of those parties are not being looked after.
A number of regions of Australia have a great dependence upon the coal industry, and there are a number of jobs in that industry. Slowly but surely the debate is turning around the feelings of those regions, as they understand that the new technologies that would lead to the clean use of coal have great employment potential as well. These are important developments. This is an ongoing debate; it is not as if everybody understands the phenomenon and the mechanisms that are required to address it. It is my concern that, if the government continues on the course of action it has put in place—as it appears it will; on the basis that yet again it is something we want to be shoulder to shoulder on with the United States of America——we will be outside what is happening internationally.
The real point—and this is important—is that it is yet another example of where the environmental outcome that we are trying to achieve marries with potential economic benefits and outcomes. In this case, it is significant that business opportunities are created by the Kyoto protocol and that we would lose that opportunity if we failed to ratify. Companies are thinking about whether they would be better placed to go offshore to countries that are inside rather than outside the Kyoto tent. There are many examples in Australia of companies that are developing alternative energy technologies and, if we continue to move away from the protocol, the further development of those potential technologies might be placed in jeopardy. 
On another subject, at present there is a debate going on about the regulations that were put in place on the Friday before last, excising 3,000 islands in the northern waters above Australia from the migration zone. In the debate about this, the Labor Party's position, which would see us opposing that excision, is being portrayed as being in some way soft or weak on border control—I think `weak' was the word used today in question time. I am saddened that that is the way our position is being portrayed, because such a portrayal really reflects what the gesture of the Friday before last—of a further excision of more islands from Australia's migration zone—is really about.
Is the debate really about the appropriate and proper processing of people that are making their way to Australian shores with the intention of seeking asylum? If that is what the debate is about, then the types of proposals that are being put forward are well and truly at the margins. It is a nonsense to use them as a wedge between political forces within Australia. In fact, as has been put forward in the debate on behalf of the opposition, if people are headed for these islands and the islands are in some way put outside the migration zone, it would not require great imagination to see that shifting the goalposts would simply mean that people would make the additional journey to the mainland. And then what happens when any potential boats land on the mainland? Do we see excision of areas on the mainland? I think that people would understand that that is a logical progression from the thinking that is in place in this policy area.
But if we are going to talk about border control and weakness or softness we ought to look at the whole picture. Why is it that the government uses people who, in their desperation, would come here by a method which is outside the preferred legal regime, in order to talk about border control and put fear into the minds of Australians that this is about border control full stop? It is not. If we were fair dinkum, we would be talking about the 60,000 people—based on the department's own figures, at least 60,000—that come here illegally by other methods. These are the people who either have legitimate visas and overstay or rort the system to get a visa to get here with the intention of staying permanently. If we want to put fear into people's minds, let us start talking about those people. But it is not convenient when, of those 60,000 people, 12,000 are from the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Please, let us get fair dinkum. 
I, for one, am not in any way dissuaded because a high percentage of those processed off the Tampa by the UN have had their claims dismissed. That means that the procedure for looking at claims is appropriate. That is all it tells me. It tells me that people have legitimate rights when they take the actions that they have taken—being on a leaky vessel, the leaky vessel sinks under whatever circumstances and a courageous captain of a Norwegian merchant vessel rescues them. Then everything goes completely askew because we have a government that wants to project and change the way in which it is perceived as acting on `border control'. So we have, conveniently, a large vessel within camera shot of Christmas Island so that we can have our SAS troops go aboard the vessel in the full glare of the media. Is it just so that we can have the slogan `Who is the most hairy-chested? Who is the harshest or the strongest on border control? We are.' 
—Where is the debate about source countries? If the honourable member for Dunkley wants to interject about the closest port, let us go to the detail about that and ask why the vessel did not go to the closest port, because this is the crux of the matter. We have the source countries and we have the countries that are in the pipeline. Can the honourable member for Dunkley tell me what Minister Ruddock and Minister Downer, to prove that they are hard on border control, are doing about that? The member for Dunkley cannot tell me because he will not get up and ask the question that will get a ministerial statement that is different.
—You have misled the voters, haven't you? 
—I did not mislead the voters. If the honourable member for Dunkley again wants to get into this debate that it is about which party is the strongest—
—There is only a cigarette paper's width—
—and not about which party is actually looking at the policy, progressing the policy, he might want to note that it is not about the minister being in the House on the Wednesday and saying that the great success of the present policy is that no boats are on their way, while on the Friday using the excuse that a boat is on the way to increase the excision of the migration zone. Now the boat has disappeared—I do not know whether it is the Bermuda Triangle, but it has disappeared. But that is not the point: boat or no boat, there should be a proper discussion of policy. And on the cigarette paper's width, the Labor Party 18 months before this was talking about the treatment of people in the detention centres and had called for an inquiry, and that inquiry would have gone forward. That was lost in the artificial way that this was created as an issue. 
—That was misleading the voters.
—That was always there. It is not about misleading the voters. Were the voters told that the migration zone will be excised and excised? Were they? No, they were not. They were not told that it would be cut away and cut away. There has been no answer to the question about how far this measure goes. We can ask those that have got the good voice now: what are we going to do with those who have been denied, whose claims have been dismissed, and how are we going to deal with their return? 
Was that discussed in the days and weeks up to the election? The people that were there at the time of the election remain; the same people are still there. Isn't it simply that we should discuss this to see the way in which these people should be properly processed now that their claims have been denied? That is in fact the crux of the matter. No matter what we as legislators believe, the individuals that are involved, except for a few that are perhaps out-and-out parts of some criminal element, are driven to these types of measures, and the outcome must be based on the way that the international community deals with these things. 
The present government can get excited about the way in which Australia is deciding these matters and people can say that the result of the election decides it for evermore, but that is a nonsense. This is a piece of public policy that is a work in progress. The problem has not gone away simply by the measures that were put in place three days after the government announced that it was going to build more detention centres—policy on the run. The point is that I am quite happy for the Labor Party to be in a position where it is developing its policy on this matter. It has gone out to the public and said that that debate is continuing.

"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—I am a bit puzzled. When we first announced excluding certain territories from Australia's migration zone, that was supported by all sides of the parliament, as I understand it. It was public policy. It went to the last election and in the legislation was provision for regulation so that at a time in the future we would excise further territory if that were seen to be useful. That was very public: that was on the public record. The government is, for very prudent reasons, moving to excise islands above latitude 12 degrees south and the Labor Party are now doing a complete backflip and saying they are not going to support it, but I do not know the downside of excising further islands. I have not heard that argument: I have not heard anybody tell me why they should not be.
—What if Magnetic Island were excised?
—It would not make a damn piece of difference, because all Australians can move freely and openly in any of those territories, as they do now. It does not make one iota of difference to anybody except those people who want to come here unauthorised: they are the only people it affects. The Labor Party are saying, `Well, we're going to signal that we want to go soft on border control.' That is what they want to do. Until I hear a logical reason coming from the Labor Party as to why we should not excise I will remain puzzled. I did not get up here to speak about that.
—You were provoked.
—I was provoked. I thank the member for Dunkley. I move widely in Australia, as most of us do in discharging our responsibilities as members of parliament, and for more than a third of the year, as all of us are, I am out of my electorate in other parts of Australia, principally in Canberra but with committee duties you do move around the country. Then, as always happens—it happens to you and it happens to me—people ask, `Where are you from?' I say, `Australia's largest tropical city,' and they ask, `Where's that?' That is a very interesting response. What do I then get? The first thing that a person will say is: `You're from Cairns.' `Well, no, actually; it is not Australia's largest tropical city.' `Well, then you must be from Darwin.' `No, that's even smaller.' Then on comes the bright light: `It's Brisbane.' `Well, Brisbane is not even in the tropics.' If they are really, really pushed they can name Rockhampton and then Mackay. But do you know what: they cannot name Townsville, Australia's largest tropical city.
That worries me. Townsville is a very important and significant city in this country. We have in Townsville Australia's largest defence base. Virtually all of Australia's overseas operations in the last 10 years have been launched from Townsville. In Townsville we have the Australian Institute of Marine Science, which leads the world in marine science. We have the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which controls one of the wonders of the world and manages it. Yet no-one can name Townsville. If you say to the television stations, `Why don't you have Townsville on the weather map? It's Australia's largest tropical city,' do you know what their answer is? `It's easier to put Cairns on because it's a shorter name and it fits on the weather map.' What an excuse! I do not understand that. We are a tropical city that has, straight out its back door, the reef, the rainforest and the outback, but nobody knows Townsville. 
Townsville is the undiscovered gem of Northern Australia. We in Townsville think that North Queensland is the best place in Australia—blue skies, golden sands, deep green rainforest, fascinating outback, charming cities and islands for indulgence. We have it all. It is the ultimate tropical lifestyle. Those of us in Townsville know that the lifestyle is as good as you would get anywhere in the country. We love our life in the tropics and we invite those of you listening to this debate to share a slice with us. Come for a weekend of excitement or relaxation. Come on a package tour. Fly in and rent a car or drive the Bruce or Flinders highway and enjoy life with us.
Townsville has a progressive and innovative community that enjoys its restaurants, nightlife, casino, museums and galleries. We love our water sports, golf, fishing, abseiling, whitewater rafting and bushwalking. We know of pristine beaches, rainforest habitat and outback oases that will all astound. I say to the member for Franklin, `Forget the crowds, the stress, the pressure and the tourist traps; relax with a drink in hand, gazing out to the islands in the Coral Sea.' We enjoy our life in the tropics and our enthusiasm is contagious. Once you experience it all, you will love the feeling of euphoria and you will be determined to return again.
But what happens? People think of Cairns. People think of the Whitsundays. People do not think of Townsville. And what is the reason for that? It is hard to change people's perceptions of Townsville if they visited the city years ago. People know it as an industrial port—dry, dusty, not a lot to do. We had the problem of losing our international air carriers at the international airport; they have come and gone. It is very hard for us to compete with the hot spots and gateways in Queensland that already have well-established product in international markets and that tend to get the support from the various tourism promotion bodies as being the hot spots in Queensland.
What do our potential customers miss out on? They miss out on what Townsville is today—a dynamic, progressive city with a new tourism product and major developments and infrastructure. The redevelopment of the Strand, for example, has been branded as one of the best beachfront promenades in Australia. I do not think there is any doubt about that. Domestic airfares are now more affordable with the introduction of Virgin Blue, which chose Townsville as their first Queensland regional destination, for very good reasons. That has brought prices down. But I just lament that we do not yet have enough airline capacity into Townsville.
Only last week, when I had to return to Townsville, I could not get a seat on a plane from Brisbane to Townsville. I had to fly to Cairns to get home. I had to fly to Cairns, get in a car and drive 400 kilometres to get back that day.
—I observe to the member for Dunkley that, if I drove 400 kilometres in his state, I would be out of the state, but we Queenslanders have a much more significant area to look after. I know that last Saturday one of the Qantas flights out of Townsville was 15 seats overbooked. They could not fit 15 people on the aircraft. I think that is a clear case where schedulers at Qantas really need to take note and, by increasing the capacity available in and out of Townsville, look after the market that is most clearly there. 
I firmly believe that Townsville Enterprises is working very hard on trying to get the name recognition up. I was very pleased to be able to give Townsville Enterprises $25,000 last week as a matching contribution to cash contributions from their members to develop a definitive publication on the attractions available in the north for visiting cruise ships and, particularly, visiting warships, so that we can market the city in a very meaningful and positive way and talk up all of the really great facilities and attractions that are available. I think it behoves everybody in Townsville to play their part to increase the awareness of the attractions that we have in our city.
In the time available to me I would like to move on to another couple of matters in relation to the north. I would particularly like to talk about the proposed ocean terminal. Every time a warship comes into Townsville—and, incidentally, the US Navy rate Townsville as the best port to visit in Australia, which is a pretty good feather in our city's cap—it stays three days or so and it leaves behind $3 million to $5 million in the city. We as a community need to concentrate on—I believe this is probably the next major project that we should all be working on—the gateway project; namely, an ocean terminal development of the potential of the Western Breakwater in Townsville and the area in front of Jupiters casino. I think that it should happen as a partnership between private enterprise and government. While the state government has a lead role in this, the federal government should also be involved, because this has the potential to give our city and our region a major boost by capturing a segment of the tourism market which we are not currently adequately capturing.
Recently, in Townsville, the state government announced a new gas-fired power station—base load power station—for the city. This was a very important announcement because it signalled the arrival of gas into Townsville. That power station will become a reality as part of an upgrade of an existing peak load power station at the Queensland nickel site at Yabulu. This is very important in relation to Yabulu because it will turn into a cogeneration scheme. I note that we have the chairman of the environment and heritage committee with us today, and he will be very pleased to know that this cogeneration scheme will see gas, which is a clean fuel, generating electricity. It will also see the waste heat being used to generate steam, which will be fed into the nickel plant. So it will reduce everybody's costs and give the benefits of gas.
It will also further enhance the likelihood that we will be able to get the Yabulu extension project up, which is a $300 million development in hand with the Ravensthorpe project in Western Australia, where nickel will be mined, part processed and then shipped to Townsville for final processing at Yabulu. I am very pleased to see state development in Townsville working to look at all of the value added industries that can be tacked onto the three mineral processing plants in Townsville and Thuringowa—something that would be a marvellous addition to our city.
Fundamentally, in the long term we need to think long and hard about true base load power. True base load power actually means delivering power to industry at a world competitive price. I am told that it is not possible to do that with gas. I am told that the only way you can get a world competitive unit price of electricity delivered to your doorstep is to use a coal fired power station. That has some downsides, and there are some concerns. With Australia determined to meet its responsibilities in relation to the Kyoto protocol, whether we ratify it or not, we need to think about how we might balance any additional emissions that would come from such a power station with ways of ameliorating the problem of the additional CO2 in the earth's atmosphere. 
One way or another, we have to be world competitive. Providing world competitive power on Townsville's doorstep with a power station on the Bowen Basin coalfields is certainly a way of making Townsville another Gladstone. It can bring enormous opportunities in relation to the industrial lands adjacent to the Sun Metals zinc refinery, and it can bring very significant developments associated with the Queensland nickel plant at Yabulu. I ask the community and the decision makers, particularly the state government, to think long and hard about that. I know that the Premier will have some difficulties with that concept, but I think there is a solution somewhere. It is important for our region's progress with jobs and for the economic wellbeing of our city to see true base load power being developed.
In the time left to me, I might spend a moment on higher education, particularly James Cook University. The member for Riverina may disagree, but I think next to the sandstone universities James Cook University comes right up there. The government has to recognise that the costs of running a regional university, particularly James Cook University, are certainly higher than those of running a sandstone university. There needs to be a will within the government to recognise that there are extra costs and to fund universities in the regions accordingly.
There is no doubt that a university like James Cook is very much at the centre of our community. It is not like the metropolitan universities. You find that there are much greater demands on regional universities in relation to the services that they provide to their local communities. There is a community expectation that we all do work as a team and that universities should contribute. You do not see that as much in the larger metropolitan cities. You also find that the regional universities do not have access to the benevolent funds that the larger universities have access to, and that holds their development back. When they have very strong, important, innovative ideas and they are determined to do something that is absolutely new in the country, they do not always have the resources to do it.
I think it is time that the government looked at the way universities manage themselves, at the way university councils sometimes try to usurp the role of management of universities and at the way that university councils, for political reasons perhaps, try to get in there and tell vice-chancellors around the country how they should operate. Equally, I think it is time that universities looked at allowing managers—meaning vice-chancellors—the opportunity to manage down into the faculties should they need to. At the moment there are some very out-of-date management structures which should be looked at. Universities need to operate in the real world in the way private business operates, and currently I believe that that is not the case.
I come back to where I started: the fact that people cannot name Townsville as Australia's largest tropical city. I invite anyone listening to or reading this speech to give Townsville a go. You will not be disappointed. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a fabulous place—an undiscovered gem.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—I will begin my comments on the budget tonight in a perhaps slightly unusual way. I want to take the opportunity to pay tribute to Ruth Cracknell. In many ways Ruth represented the best that Australia has to offer. Given that I am responsible in opposition for the status of women, the arts and Indigenous affairs, she was indeed a fine representative of all of those areas. I would like to take this opportunity as a member of the House of Representatives to acknowledge her passing. The Senate has in fact moved a motion of appreciation. I simply say that Ruth was a much loved and superbly talented actor with a deep commitment to social justice, Indigenous affairs and women's issues. She should be held up as a fine example of someone who used her status for a good purpose: to better the lives of others.  
The death of Ruth Cracknell is a great loss to Australia's cultural life. Her stage and screen career, spanning almost 60 years, made her one of Australia's most respected, best-known and honoured actors. In her 57-year career she acted in a wide range of classical and modern plays and Australian film and television. She raised three children and won Sammy, Penguin and Logie awards, to name but a few. Ruth Cracknell, of course, was a member of the Order of Australia and was named one of Australia's living national treasures, as indeed she was. She was generous in her support for many young actors and others in the arts community and she was a tireless campaigner to improve the status of women. Ruth Cracknell was also a committed advocate of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, joining forces with many others to form Women for Wik during the native title amendment debate in 1997 in an attempt to influence public opinion. Ruth Cracknell's passing is a great loss not only for her family and friends but also for the nation. I would like once again to convey my sincere condolences to her family and friends.
Before going any further, I particularly want to talk about Indigenous affairs, which I know were dear to Ruth's heart—and dear to mine, too—and I am very sad to say that the current budget does very little to assist Indigenous people in this country to improve their lot in life. I wish I did not have to say that. I do not say it as a political statement. Frankly, just look at the record. 
The minister announced when he released the federal budget that spending on Indigenous specific programs and services will increase to a record level of $2.5 billion in 2002-03, up from $2.5 billion the previous year. That sounds like good news on the face of it, and news that I would have been happy to welcome. But I think it is important that we look at that definition of `Indigenous specific' and pull it apart a little because it is absurdly broad. It actually relates to funds that in any way might be seen to be spent on Indigenous people, or on the areas in which they live. To give you an example, that statement includes $2.2 million going to Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for pest and disease monitoring in Northern Queensland. That benefits everybody; it is not Indigenous specific. Also, it covers the $7 million that the Australian Bureau of Statistics requires to collect statistics on Indigenous people. Again that is not done separately; it is done for all Australians.
These are worthy programs, but they are not Indigenous specific and they should not be lumped in with spending of that kind if we are to actually look at the government's performance here. The government is still including a lot of these areas in the total expenditure allocated to overcoming Indigenous disadvantage, and it is time we actually had a much clearer book. Many of these programs are provided to all Australians. I am not just talking about those extreme cases of quarantine and statistics collection but about the things we take for granted: clean water supply, access to reliable electricity at a reasonable price, and education and schooling. They are not Indigenous specific; they are the rights of citizens. In my view they should not be included as separate unless they have special elements, additional funds or new programs designed to address the disadvantage we know Indigenous people face. In fact, many of those are just basic citizen services which require funding. 
Given that the programs are listed for this purpose and the government describes them as Indigenous specific, it is reasonable to ask the minister, particularly as he puts them under the heading of `practical reconciliation', exactly what is going on in those areas of education, employment, health and so on that are available to other citizens. What effect are these programs having on Indigenous people? Are they improving their circumstances?
We put a number of questions in the Senate estimates to the department asking about a lot of these programs that are listed as Indigenous specific and as part of so-called practical reconciliation. The sad fact is that the department were unable to answer most of the questions; they simply had no idea, although they were happy to claim them as part of a program to support Indigenous people. We think they should be keeping a close eye on these programs if they are going to claim them as being of benefit and put them under a `practical reconciliation' heading. In response to how they monitor these broader programs—and I mention employment, education and health; they are critical areas—the secretary of the department said:
... I am not able—and frankly I do not think I should be able—to say that the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is monitoring expenditure of that sort down to that level. That is clearly a program matter administered by another portfolio.
You cannot have that. The minister has to know. The precise reason for having a separate minister for Indigenous affairs is that we recognise that there are special needs and special difficulties associated with many Indigenous communities in Australia. It is not good enough to say, `Someone else is looking after that,' if at the same time you are claiming it as part of a major program. In other words, they are not linked as part of a program; they are just what happens to be available to Aboriginal people, as they are to other citizens in our country.
When I asked the minister a question last week about what was happening to Aboriginal medical services, he said, `That is not my responsibility; I am not the minister for health.' No, he is the minister for Aboriginal affairs and reconciliation, and he should know. In estimates, evidence emerged that the federal government continues to underspend—and that worries me a lot—on areas that really are designed specifically to reduce disadvantage and to improve the life circumstances of Indigenous people. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, for instance, told a Senate estimates committee that in 1999-2000 the government had not been able to spend $20 million of funding allocated for Indigenous employment. What group in the community has the highest level of unemployment? Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. How can you possibly underspend in an area where there is so much unmet need? That was about 35 per cent of their total budget. They were very pleased with themselves this year when they said that they had only underspent it by 13 per cent of the budget, some $6 million to $7 million. It is not something to celebrate, I would have to say.
Further figures from this year's budget show that the government has not been able to spend an allocated $4.3 million on domestic violence. What have we been hearing about Indigenous communities? That they want to work together with the government to stamp out domestic family violence, alcohol abuse and substance abuse. This is an area where there is great need, and everyone recognises it. The government underspent $4.3 million under the status of women program. They said they could not find suitable program managers to spend this domestic violence money. This money was generic, but the need is greatest in Indigenous communities and could have been directed to those communities. 
It is another example of the government's apathy, in this case both toward women and Indigenous communities, for a problem that has, frankly, become a national disgrace. Everyone recognises that it needs urgent attention. It has been stated as a high priority for government. Indeed, they say that family violence is a particularly urgent issue for Indigenous women, who comprise 46 per cent of people who require hospitalisation from intentional injuries, and for Indigenous people, who die from interpersonal violence at 10.8 times the rate of non-Indigenous Australians.
Only a day later ATSIC told Senate estimates that they had been advocating constantly for increased effort in this area. There is $4.3 million sitting there unspent and ATSIC are saying, `We're in dire need of these funds.' Although they had already spent $4.9 million annually on programs related to family violence, they said the demand was much greater than that. When the question was put, they said that they could easily have spent that extra $4.3 million to improve community safety and the safety, particularly, of women and children in Indigenous communities.
Funding for the minister's office and the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is also included in the Indigenous-specific funding. This is for the benefit of Aboriginal people but it includes $4.3 million for fighting Aboriginal people in the courts—litigation such as the Cubillo-Gunner stolen generations case. This is not spending which helps Indigenous people yet it is listed there as if it were for their benefit. Indeed at one stage that litigation funding made up 47 per cent of the department's budget. Half of the spending was going on court cases that were clearly against the interests of Indigenous people generally and several Indigenous people in particular.
The interesting thing about this budget is that it actually contained no new funding initiatives in these Indigenous-specific areas. Most of those funds are administered by ATSIC and there has been no new funding for ATSIC. The chairman of ATSIC said that there were no new funding initiatives this year despite the ever increasing demand. He described the extra funding last year as a down payment on funds that never seem to come. The $470 million that was taken out of ATSIC has not been filled and the government apparently has no intention of doing anything about it. 
There were a couple of announcements of new expenditure. The government announced a new budget measure of enhanced training of Indigenous directors but there was no new money. There were new programs that ATSIC had to find funding for but no additional funding. Better training in governance is critical to Indigenous communities and ATSIC in particular is working hard to develop new programs, as is Reconciliation Australia. But it is pretty hard to do it with no money. 
Another `new' measure was $8.3 million announced for meeting the telecommunication needs of remote Indigenous communities—again, worthy. But the funds were taken from a different Indigenous-specific bucket of money from previous years which had not been spent. What does it deliver to these communities? It provides exactly the same service that every other Australian should be able to expect. When questioned in the Senate estimates committee, the government was forced to acknowledge that remote Indigenous communities had very poor levels of service generally. I have listened to members in this place complain about poor telecommunication services in places like North Queensland, outback New South Wales and outback Western Australia. I understand that and I am sympathetic to it, but if you think they have a problem you should look at the Indigenous communities. Whereas 97 per cent of Australians are connected to fixed telephone services under the USO, the best estimates that we can get—from the government itself—for Indigenous communities are that five to 10 per cent of remote Indigenous people are connected. That is a huge gap in service provision. And the government provided no new money; it just moved a little bit around to give some people slightly better access to telecommunication services.  
We have also indicated that we are keen to support the ATSIC review that has been mooted. We were less enthusiastic about hiring former ministers Wooldridge and Reith to do the job; we did not think they would be particularly independent. But part of the problem with this review is that it will have to be paid for out of existing ATSIC funds, which were cut by $470 million. ATSIC do not even know at this stage what the review will involve—what its terms of reference will be, who will be involved, who will be consulted and how long it will take—and of course they do not know how much it will cost. 
They had $470 million taken out of their budget, there was no new expenditure on the part of the government for ATSIC and no genuine new expenditure on Indigenous affairs. And that is in the context of the government requiring ATSIC to quarantine big portions of its expenditure. Approximately 80 per cent is quarantined—the CDEP and the community housing program. So they have very little left to do some of these other things that are sorely needed, including tackling substance abuse and other issues which the government claims to care about and which are vitally important for the health of these communities.
Finally, in the area of Indigenous affairs, I want to refer briefly to the problem with Aboriginal medical services. The government have been warned several times that several of the medical services, which are vital to the health needs of Indigenous communities, are in real trouble as a result of the public indemnity insurance problems that we have heard so much publicity about recently. Many services—particularly in remote areas such as Bourke and Walgett, and including Redfern, in inner city Sydney, and Western Sydney—are under threat of closure. They cannot get their doctors suitable insurance. They are directly the responsibility of the federal government—no-one else is responsible for these services—and when I asked the minister a question he did not know the first thing about it. It is not just the doctors who cannot get indemnity coverage but also dentists, midwives and others who are providing services in these communities. We still have not had an answer from the government on this. As far as we know, they are just going to let the due dates roll along and these people will have to find very substantial additional funds from within quite tight budgets or they will lose their doctors. I think there is no doubt about that.
If I have time, I want to turn briefly to two other areas: the arts and the status of women, for which I am responsible. The notable thing about the government's approach in the budget to the arts is that there is no approach. You never hear ministers in this government talk about Australia's artistic and cultural life. You can beg and plead for something—anything; a sign of life—but you will not find it. It is really very worrying. The more I talk to people in this area, the more it is clear to me that the government is prepared to let the cultural life of this nation hang—not die exactly, because there is enough funding just to keep people hanging on the edge. Take, for instance, the small to medium sized performing arts sector. Many theatres in Australia are dark. If you go around the cities you will find this. In my own home town of Perth, there are theatres that are dark. Ten years ago that was not true; you would very rarely find a theatre company that did not have a full program for the year. Now you find that they do it project by project.  
The government has just put out a little report on the small to medium sized performing arts company—and the government offered no hope. Indeed, as one of the commentators put it: `It's like going to the doctor asking for treatment for lung cancer and being given treatment for bad breath.' That is how much attention they got from the government. That is a pretty damning indictment. The person who said it said it amusingly, obviously, but they are really concerned about the status of those particular organisations. We have seen very little attention given to any of the art forms. We are told that the Myer review into the visual arts sector is going to come out soon. The minister has it but does not expect to release it until the middle of July. But he has made it clear to everybody in the arts community, `Don't expect any money to come with this. We are basically going to tell you to do better with the resources you have got.' 
Anyone who spends any time in the arts community will tell you that the Nugent review, which did some excellent work for the major organisations, has been a very useful contribution and additional funds were provided—overdue but welcomed. But even that is causing problems, as the life of those funds is winding down. Then we get below that to the innovative side of Australian arts. I am not saying that Australian opera and the major performing theatres are not innovative, but a lot of the really original work comes from the smaller end of the market and they are really struggling to survive. The government seems to have no concern with that at all.
When you look at some of the areas of the budget where the government did provide additional funding last time—$37.2 million additional funding for the museum—you see that it was not additional funding for the arts, because the government had actually taken it out of another area; in particular, the National Archives. So the government was giving with one hand as it was taking with another. When the museum director was asked what the extra funding was needed for she said that it was due to unforeseen circumstances. That suggests to me that there is some fairly untoward planning going on—visitor numbers were not as good as expected, special exhibitions had not done as well as expected and they had not been able to get sponsorship. I can understand that with a new organisation, and I am not being critical of the museum's director. These are propositions that the government should take on and fund appropriately. But instead what does the government do? It takes it out of the archives. The government is effectively asking the National Archives to absorb the hit because of its failure to plan properly for the new museum. At risk at the National Archives is a vital part of Australia's records and objects. So we have, in a sense, a misunderstanding of the nature of those two organisations.
I could say a lot more about the arts—and I will at another time—but the real disappointment is that there is no focus, there is no energy, there is no commitment. As far as the government is concerned the arts is a dead area; it is one of those `special interest' areas; it is an area where you can poke at people and say, `These are all pinko lefties; you do not take them seriously.' But their vital creative input into the nation's life is not to be underestimated.
I want to speak about the status of women very briefly—not because it is unimportant to me but rather because I will have other opportunities to do so. One of the things that really continues to disturb me is the fact that the government has paid so little attention to the financial needs of women. For instance, in this budget and in legislation coming out of it, we are told that women who are sole parents will now enter the mutual obligation system and will be breached if they fail to meet certain conditions the government sets down. 
This will be my last point: the women most likely to be breached are precisely the ones who need the support and assistance of government. If you fail to turn up for an appointment or you fail to meet certain commitments to the government, what sort of person are you likely to be? You are likely to be under a great deal of pressure, probably not particularly well-educated and frightened of administrations. In my time in parliament I have found that the people who throw their letters in the bin are typically those people who have a psychiatric illness or an inability to deal with bureaucracies. They are people, in other words, who have a great deal of difficulty in managing from day to day.
And what are we saying to these people? We are saying, `We're going to take the money from you.' The penalty level is really hefty; it is more than you get for a serious breach of the law. We will be putting women who are already in poverty and under stress into an impossible position. We will be saying to them, `Either you do what we require, and you know that you have to do it,'—it is the latter that worries me more—`or you go and find yourself a partner.' There is some very recent evidence to show that that kind of continual repartnering is very damaging indeed. It is not something that government policy should be seen to be encouraging, inadvertently or otherwise, but that is one of the possible consequences of this legislation.
In superannuation too, a brief look at the government's proposals here shows that they do nothing for women, the ones with least coverage in superannuation. There is a bit of splitting at the top end, which is very beneficial for those whose spouses have incomes over $100,000 but is of no benefit at all for women—many of whom have had interrupted working lives—who will end up at the end of their working lives with very little in the way of superannuation coverage. They are just a couple of issues I want to signal. I am particularly concerned about the government's proposals to do with single parents and I intend to say a lot more about it, because it is a destructive, careless, thoughtless and child unfriendly policy, and the government deserves to be hit around the head very hard.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—I rise to speak with great pleasure in support of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 in its original form. In particular, I wish to focus on the micro-economic elements of the proposal, knowing that the macro-economic elements have been covered in great detail elsewhere. I want to focus on the fact that this is a budget which sets out the conditions for growth, lower unemployment, sustained low interest rates and a general economic climate which will encourage the creation of jobs. I want to look at the budget on two levels. Firstly, I will look at the level of the impact of the budget on the people of Flinders. Secondly, I will address the impact of the benefits contained within the budget on three particular constituencies across Australia: families, rural communities and the aged and elderly community.
Firstly, I will address the impact and highlights of the budget for the people of Flinders, within my own electorate. The first and most important benefit contained within the budget is, I believe, the initiative to establish an extra $80 million over four years for doctors for outer metropolitan areas. This will be supplemented by a further $73 million which will be spent over four years in establishing up to six new radiation oncology units in regional Australia. 
In looking at the question of doctors for outer metropolitan areas I note that already, in the period since the budget, we have been able to secure not only the approval for but an actual doctor for the town of Koo Wee Rup. This is a town which is going ahead but has had difficulty attracting medical staff; it already has an existing, first-class doctor, but he finds himself overwhelmed by the work. So this is a real, practical and tangible benefit which flows from the budget for the people within the area of Koo Wee Rup. It also has an impact on those within Lang Lang, Clyde, Devon Meadows and Five Ways, all of which are benefiting already.
The second local issue which I would like to raise is that of the baby bonus, which is available to parents of a child born on or after 1 July 2001. Mothers who are no longer working can receive up to a maximum of $2,500 each year until the child turns five. This is a tangible benefit to people within the towns of Somerville, Baxter and San Remo—growing communities with young families, working families, who need this support if they are to be able to maintain the balance of family life whilst at the same time maintaining the balance of their incomes. It is a critical initiative about which I have already received many inquiries. 
The third local issue that I want to raise is that of aged care. Through this budget, the coalition is establishing an additional half a billion dollars to be spent on older Australians. That includes $311 million for aged care homes, $47½ million for nurses and personal care workers and an additional $80 million for carers. On the Mornington Peninsula, in Cranbourne and on Phillip Island, all of which are areas that have significant numbers of elderly people, that means that their needs and the resources that they require are being met. In particular, I am delighted that on Friday only a week ago the Minister for Ageing, Kevin Andrews, visited the Mornington Peninsula and was able to announce that the Mornington Peninsula and Cranbourne are areas of priority for aged care. This follows from the fact that very recently, at the last aged care assessment round, specific places were made available on Phillip Island: 40 additional beds on an ongoing funding basis in perpetuity were made available for Warley Hospital, Phillip Island. That has a profound effect on all the areas of need within our area.
On the question of superannuation, from 1 July 2002 qualifying low income earners who make personal superannuation contributions and have annual incomes under $32,500 will benefit from the government's co-contribution of up to $1,000 each year. In Rosebud and Rye, working families that are working to save for their long-term future are being not only encouraged but also supported to do so.
In looking at those issues, I want to turn from Flinders to the broader national picture. As I said, I want to address three particular issues in the time remaining to me. The first is the question of what the budget means more broadly for families. I have already outlined the benefits attached to the baby bonus. In addition, in an area which is often neglected, men's health, there is over $5 million in funding for establishing national focus groups on the problems of men in rural and remote areas—the problems of suicide and depression, things which are not frequently acknowledged in a public sense. 
Furthermore, at the family level, over $6½ billion has been allocated in the budget for Australian schools for the coming financial year. Government schools are going to receive $2.4 billion. Since 1995-96, Commonwealth funding for schools has grown by over 80 per cent. That has a very important impact on families. Similarly, in disability support services, new places will be provided for rehabilitation, training, education and employment.  
I would now like to look at rural and regional benefits and what the budget means for these communities. On the communications front, within Flinders we have an important issue relating to telecommunications black spots. An original program of $35 million to fix over 250 black spots has already been completed, but this budget allocates an additional $13.3 million over three years to find alternative technical solutions in a further 34 black spots. In Mount Martha, Safety Beach, Dromana and Rosebud we have benefits.
Finally, I want to address the issue of aged care and the elderly generally. There is over $100 million for rural aged care homes to upgrade their facilities. This has a long-term impact on the quality of life for people within Flinders—for the elderly, the veterans, the more than 20,000 people in my electorate who come from that population over the age of 70.
In conclusion, this budget sets down the long-term prescription for economic health—jobs and economic growth. But it also takes care of the conditions for the young, the families and the elderly within the electorate of Flinders.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 and to make some comments on what I view as a very woeful budget handed down by the Treasurer a while ago. In doing so, I will make clear my opposition to this budget in broad terms—that is, with respect to the consequences for the country—but I will also touch on those constituents of the Burke electorate that have been harshly hit by this cruel and unfair budget.
The first thing to remind people of is that this budget will put upward pressure on interest rates and increase costs for Australian families. This budget must be placed in the proper context. Three years ago the Treasury forecast that the surplus for this financial year would amount to $14.6 billion. The latest estimate for the same year is a surplus of only $0.5 billion. Any economic observer would conclude that this means pressure on interest rates. It may well be argued that this is a result of the vagaries of the market and of external factors, but the government must take responsibility for this problem because more than 80 per cent of the loss of the estimated surplus is a direct result of some deliberate decisions it has made—decisions that in my view were made not in the national interest but to save the government's hide prior to the election last year. What plan does the Treasurer have to make the books look like they balance? He is talking again about selling the rest of Telstra, and the government is now hinting that there may be a sale of Medibank Private.
But how does one explain the state of Commonwealth finances, given the strength of the economy? I am afraid that much of this problem arises from the government's recent reckless, selfish and irresponsible financial behaviour. We see this failed budget as a result of currency losses. The Treasurer has presided over a $5 billion loss over the past four years by gambling on foreign currency markets. He rolled the dice and they came up snake eyes. Despite numerous warnings from his own department, the Treasurer failed until September last year to do anything to address this matter. He just kept rolling the dice instead of leaving the table. It should also be remembered that the Howard government has misused an incredible $1 billion over the past five years on advertising and consultancies. In my view, this was a veiled resource to buy votes. In fact, it was hardly veiled—it was clear to people before the election and certainly after the election that this was a government willing to spend taxpayers' money to basically look after its own interests before the interests of the Australian public. 
Of course, then there was the Pacific solution, the Clayton solution, the solution you have when you do not have a solution. It costs twice as much to process asylum seekers on Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands as on the mainland and more again in countries such as Papua New Guinea and Nauru. We are still looking to fathom the extent of the wasteful spending, which by no means could honestly be termed a solution. Another failure of the budget was to properly look after the majority of Australians with respect to superannuation.
We all know that the Treasurer's rationale for a budget deficit was always going to include the excuse that it was a war budget, a khaki budget—you could almost smell the gunpowder. Indeed, it is true to say that there are matters of national importance which the government must attend to in the national interest. It is now very apparent that if it were not for the Treasurer's wasteful and mismanaged ways the budget would now be in surplus. Even if no new funding requirements for defence and border protection had been required, the 2001-02 budget would still have been in deficit by more than half a billion dollars.
The government cannot escape the horrible consequences of this budget for those least able to afford it. The budget will increase the cost of essential medicines for more than one million pensioners, and cardholders will be $52 a year worse off. This budget will also ensure that 300,000 Australians who are in families will pay an extra $190 a year for essential medicines. The budget, if successfully passed, will mean families will now have to fork out $28.60 for each prescription, up by more than $6 per script. There are many more millions of Australians who will pay 30 per cent more for essential medicines every time they go to the chemist. 
This budget will cut the pensions of 200,000 disability support pensioners by $52 per fortnight, and it does not ensure any guaranteed training or rehabilitation for these pensioners. This is a disgrace, even for this government. The sickest and poorest of Australians are being asked to carry the overwhelming burden. Even I was able to accept the contention that cuts may need to be made or tax increases imposed, but why on earth would a decent and caring government slug those least able to afford it? A decent and caring government would do no such thing. It seems as if this government could not care less for the less fortunate in this society.
We have had the Howard-Costello gamble on the foreign exchange market amounting to a whopping $4.5 billion, the hundreds of millions of dollars wasted on the so-called Pacific solution and the buying of helicopters that are museum pieces. It is a wonder the government would consider devoting any further money at all to be expended by the Minister for Defence after that decision. On top of these gambling debts and financial failings we see little effort to assist the elderly, the infirm and the sick. Despite this government's rhetoric and its hollow assurances before the election to fix the aged care problem, only $72 million was left to address the growing pressures on nursing homes and community organisations that provide support and succour to the infirm and the frail.
—In my electorate of Burke many thousands of people are concerned about their future and that of their parents and other elderly relatives. It does not take a genius to know that there is a growing crisis, notwithstanding the remarks made by the member opposite. There is no doubt that she is aware, as all members would know, that there is a growing crisis in aged care. If they wanted to be honest with themselves, they would acknowledge that fact. Not only are there insufficient funds devoted to residential care and to home and community care programs for those in care, but the shortfall impact upon the growing disparity of income between aged care nurses and their public sector counterparts is now, on a national basis, over $80 million and climbing. Not only is this disparity inequitable; it increases the difficulty for nursing home operators to attract and retain quality staff. These problems are just a few of the concerns ordinary Australians are expecting their government to address. 
In my electorate constituents want to see something done to assist them in their everyday lives. They would not have expected to see such a cruel and unfair budget handed down by this coalition government, especially in light of undertakings given by the Prime Minister prior to last year's election that no disability pensioner would be worse off. That is why Labor will oppose changes in the budget that hurt the poor, the sick and the elderly. I am sure like all members and senators across Australia, I have received much correspondence since the budget with respect to those matters that are affecting ordinary Australians. I would like, if I could, to refer to a number of those. Mr Phill McQuade wrote to me on 21 May this year in relation to matters of concern to him. He said:
Dear Mr O'Connor
I am writing to you to let you know of my disgust at the planned budget changes to prescription costs and the changes to Disability Support Pension.
My name is Phill McQuade. I'm a 40 year old married father of 3 children aged 7, 5, and the third baby who is 2 days  old. I'm currently on the Disability Support Pension. I'm no dole bludger. I've worked for the last 20 years. This includes 4 years in Australian Army transport corps. Four years ago I was diagnosed with Congenital Tarsal Coalition, which in English means I was born with bones in my feet joined together that should have separated. It didn't show up till 1998 when in a lot of pain my doctor sent me for a CT scan. My ankles and feet are worn out with arthritis. I've had 3 operations and had my ankles fused with bolts. I've been through 4 years of hell. I was working previously as a storeman driver for 5 years but I had to leave fulltime work in 1998. My WorkCover claim was knocked back because I was born with this condition. I'm in constant pain 24 hours a day and on a lot of medication. My medical certificate says I can work 16 hours a week. I miss out on the pension by 1 hour. 
The problem is I'm a truck driver with a B double licence, but my medication makes me drowsy. To work 2 days I have to stop taking my medication. If I lose this pensioner concession card we are totally stuffed. We will lose our own house we currently live from week to week. My wife works 2 days a week as a kindergarten teacher but is taking 12 months unpaid leave for our new baby. If we are without the concession card and have to pay $28 for a script we couldn't afford all the medication we need. My son has asthma, he's 7. My 5 year old daughter has a condition called Renal Reflux. And my wife has Marfan Syndrome. I have been doing some work doing casual driving for a labour hire company but it's not regular. I can't believe they want to raise money by hitting the people who can least afford it. This is the lowest act I've ever heard of. It seems politicians don't know what it's like to struggle for money each week and care nothing for people who do. They'll pay come next election with their jobs.
This is signed by Phill McQuade, and he is one of many constituents who have written to my office outlining the harsh effects of many parts of the budget handed down by the Treasurer. It would be a good thing if the Treasurer and other senior members of the government were to meet people like Mr McQuade or indeed read the letters that have, no doubt, been sent to their own offices to know what effects these budgetary decisions will have on people like Mr McQuade and his family. I will refer to one other. It is from Bet and Jack Luke, who reside in Gisborne. They have indicated: 
Dear Mr O'Connor,
In regard to the changes to the Disability Pension in the new Budget.
We wish to complain of the unfairness of lumping all disabilities together.
We agree that there are people who use the system, but we feel very concerned about those with mental disabilities who work 30 hrs weekly in a Sheltered Workshop, with no ability to work in any other employment.
These people who perhaps can't read or write need some respect in the community.
We have been involved with a particular workshop, and know that some people have been there for 25 yrs and would be lost without the continuity and companionship of “their job”.
They do very repetitious work which you or I would never tolerate.
Some weeks if there is a shortage of work, they are unable to be employed, and so they rely more heavily on the pension.
We feel it is very unfair for these people to be getting a reduction of their pension.
It is those letters that bring home in the most human sense the tragic consequences of some of the budgetary decisions made by this government. In Burke there are almost 4,000 people on a disability pension, and they are relieved to know that the Labor Party will vote against the changes proposed by the government. Families in Burke are pleased that the Labor Party is standing up for them by voting to prevent the regressive changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. These changes will hurt people who can least afford it.
Another area of concern has been the failure of this government to provide necessary upgrades to the important transport road links in my electorate. An election promise to improve the Calder has been reneged upon—or, at the very least, deferred—and no commitments have been undertaken to address the critical problems of the Western Highway. The communities in Deer Park and the new estates of Burnside and Caroline Springs are sick to death of the ever-growing congestion that is developing along the highway. The residents of Rockbank, ably represented by their spokesperson Ian Cowie, have for years lamented the dangers associated with the patch of the highway adjacent to their community. The incidence of death and serious injury cannot be tolerated any longer. The residents of Melton and Bacchus Marsh, which is also connected to the Western Highway, share these concerns and have brought the dangers of the area—notably, Anthony's Cutting—to the government's attention, but without relief. As I have said on other occasions, this highway is a premier link between Melbourne and Adelaide and must be given greater priority.
As for the changes proposed to the superannuation surcharge, in many ways this decision sums up the unabashed elitism of this government. Let us remember that, before Labor extended superannuation to the vast majority of Australians, only the well-off enjoyed the luxury of a guaranteed, comfortable retirement. The coalition have either opposed broadening the superannuation net or have been dragged kicking and screaming into supporting changes which benefit those who now receive compulsory superannuation. It is laughable for any member opposite to boast that this budget assists and helps those people's superannuation benefits. 
Contrary to the rhetoric of the Treasurer's Intergenerational Report, this government shows scant regard for the bulk of the nation. If this is the Treasurer's CV for the position of Prime Minister, then he failed the job interview. No wonder the minister for workplace relations is puffing his chest even more than normal! The budget contained what the Treasurer boasted was a plan to boost incentives to investments in superannuation. In truth, it is a plan to benefit the well-off, ignoring the concerns of middle- and low-income earners in Australia. The budget proposal involves giving a tax cut to only the top three per cent of working Australians. Instead, Labor proposes a fairer alternative. We would consider cutting the superannuation tax for all Australians from 15 per cent to 13 per cent or we would consider cutting the tax to 11.5 per cent for people aged 40 and over. It is important to note that the packages proposed by Labor are, responsibly, revenue neutral. 
In my first speech to parliament this year I said, `Australians are seeking political leaders who will look after the interests of the many rather than the few.' I believe this is still the case, but the budget does nothing to assist them in this pursuit. Instead, the budget highlights the disregard and contempt this government has shown for people who it should be doing its utmost to assist and protect. It is a shameful budget and it provides the electorate with an insight into what the next leader of the Liberal Party really thinks about the aged, those in need of essential medicines and those with disabilities most in need of care.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—Speaking in the Main Committee on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 gives me the opportunity to go through some of the successes of the Howard government. If you had asked me back in 1996, when the government came to office, whether the success which has been achieved was possible, I would not have agreed at all that it was possible to achieve what has been achieved. This is another chapter in the proper management of Australia. You can talk about border control and the war against terrorism but, while those extraordinary international events are occurring, there is still an economy to be managed and a country to be run. The sure hands of this government and its executive are something that the Australian people have come to respect.
Some of the comments from our political opponents are always predictable; naturally enough, they have to find something to probe us on, and that is the way it should be. I will run through a few of the general points in the budget—some significant, some quite large and some quite modest, but they are just finetuning the overall macro-effect which has been so effective in making this country currently probably the most successful economy in the world.
The National Food Industry Strategy is important to the regional sector and to the value adding sector of the economy, and significant resources have been placed there to give it a greater emphasis and to point up our trade opportunities. Some of the incentives provided to individuals in terms of the rural environment are also important. Greater incentives have been created to address a problem that is emerging about the availability of rural vets, and that move is very welcome. A small measure, but one which is particularly important to my electorate, is to do with scientific research in cooperation with a number of other countries into the southern bluefin tuna. That research measure will be much appreciated. In Northern Australia we have the Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy, and the foot-and-mouth scare through Europe, the UK, Northern Ireland and small parts of the Republic of Ireland has made us more aware than ever that it is very important to stay ever alert with regard to this issue.
One measure that I particularly welcome in my part of the world is with regard to the Commonwealth legal services. We have a great lack of general legal advice in regional areas, particularly in the area that I come from, and the service that has been offered, particularly over the past couple of years, has been very much appreciated. The focus in the budget on illicit drugs is also important and, in answer to a question in the House a fortnight or so ago, the Prime Minister gave considerable hope as to the sort of success that is possible when you give support to the states—although I worry sometimes about whether the states do enough and whether they wait too long for the Commonwealth to become involved. Nevertheless, with the sort of the support the Commonwealth has been given—and I give credit to those states who have endeavoured to get on top of the issue of substance abuse, particularly illegal drugs—the statistics that are coming forward are quite encouraging. 
Crime Stoppers is a small program but, nevertheless, it is important and very successful. The citizenship program will receive greater support. At a time when international events are perhaps making us respect our citizenship and the quality of life that we enjoy in Australia, it is highly appropriate that we remind ourselves and the population in general that it is important to Australia to be citizens of this country, especially as much of that privilege is taken for granted by so many.
In the regional sector we have a great little program called the Television Black Spots Program. For most Australians it would seem almost incongruous and most unlikely that people would not enjoy three or four television channels. But, believe it or not, some communities have only one channel. With great respect to the ABC, it is nice to have a little bit of diversity aside from that one source of television and to have Imparja and SBS. The Television Black Spots Program is a great program for small communities. As I say, most Australians would not even credit that you might have only one channel—and, of course, some do not have any television at all. That program is greatly appreciated by a significant minority of our population.
There is $14.3 billion for defence in this budget—a significant contribution from taxpayers to a pretty important part of our national infrastructure. There is a similar amount of money for education—around $14 billion, I believe. The sorts of percentage increases that the Commonwealth has been putting into this area, which is now combined in the new portfolio with science, are very significant and important. The Job Network receives some modification, some changes and some improvements, and I very much welcome that. The Job Network initiative is a world leader. Whilst everybody would agree that finetuning will always give some improvement, the principle, the structure and the comparison with the previous system show us that Australia can be well proud of the effects and results of the Job Network. Apprenticeships, once again, receive generous support. It is important that we remember that, in 1996 and prior to that, our apprenticeship and traineeship systems had dropped away. It is very welcome to see the sorts of numbers of trainees and apprentices that are coming through our nation. Of course, this is the foundation of so much of the skill base for future industry.
For the Natural Heritage Trust there is $1 billion-plus in this budget. It is an important program—unprecedented in Australia's history in terms of the support given particularly, but not exclusively, to regional environmental projects, on which it is important to work with the states. The National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, combined with the Natural Heritage Trust, is seeing unprecedented work going into our natural environment.
It is very important that support continue in the family area. With the very significant focus on women's issues over the last decade or so, I have been particularly pleased to see some focus on men. I think a very significant case can be made for the support of men in some of the issues that they face, particularly after such a significant focus on women's issues over the years—important as those issues are. 
I will just touch on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the respect that I have gained for that department. We had some pretty significant issues in front of us with the US farm bill and the ever-present European Community with its subsidisation of agriculture. Right across the world we have a very excellent resource in our diplomats and our trade people. From my limited knowledge, I will talk about the people who are recruited. For example, in a place like France, they are people who understand the local situation; quite often they are nationals of the country, and there are even some Australian people who have perhaps undergone their secondary education in Paris or somewhere else in that land. I think the way these people blend into and understand those countries and represent Australia is nothing short of astounding.
To conclude, it is another very good budget, building on, as I said right at the beginning, what is getting to be a long period of successful economic outcomes and reminding us all that we have one of the most successful economies in the world. Not to put too fine a point on it, there is no doubt in my mind that the government's focus on interest rates, debt and government expenditure, its bringing down a balanced budget and its focus on the real skills of this country are things that the executive and the parliament can well be proud of.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—Federal budgets always attract a great deal of attention and, in doing so, they usually attract a great range of labels. I think the worst label that you could give to a budget would be to say that it is an opportunity lost or that it is a budget that offers not terribly much at all. Basically, that is how I see this current budget. There are a number of victims of this budget. Families will certainly be paying the price. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister spent enormous levels of money in the lead-up to last year's election, and they should be blaming no-one but themselves for the current state of the books. We are seeing the evidence of pressure on interest rates already, with the government also wanting to charge higher costs for pharmaceuticals and wanting to attack those on disability pensions in the cloak of welfare reform. Families will be paying enormously high levels for pharmaceuticals—something that we on this side are not at all impressed with, even though we do agree with some of the administrative changes that are proposed in the PBS.
I have mentioned already that some sectors of the community look to a forthcoming budget with dread. I think that is a fair thing to say on behalf of many sectors of our community. The community of the ACT, the people in my electorate, have had cause over recent years—since 1996—to dread this government's budgets. We in this town still remember very clearly what happened to us in 1996 and 1997 in particular. The attitude to this community was one of slashing Public Service numbers. In fact, I remember that terrible term `cut them off at the knees'—I think that was the phrase being used by a minister at the time.
This community is recovering from that period in spite of those attitudes. The private sector and the businesspeople in Canberra who have invested their money, their families and their future in this town and its economy have hung on, determined to see that faith paid back in profit in every sense in the long run. I have to commend them on that. While this year's budget, thankfully, did not threaten kneecapping, it offered little in the grand scheme of things. I do, however, want to acknowledge that the funding for the upgrading of the Australian Institute of Sport is very welcome. That funding helps to lessen the fears held by some as to the long-term future of the AIS in Canberra, and I am pleased to see that decision has been made. I note, however, that the overwhelming amount of that money will not be seen until 2005-06, and so the announcement in this budget is really a prediction of spending in future years rather than some very large project that is about to occur. 
We see the same sort of situation surrounding the construction of the new Defence headquarters, which was announced prior to the last election. Two to three days before the election the then defence minister announced that the government planned to construct the Defence Headquarters Australian Theatre at a site outside Queanbeyan. The budget papers are extremely disappointing, in reality, and people cannot not be blamed for thinking that the government are still not sure what will be built or where it will be built.
Something that is not, but should have been, in the budget is the government's decision to announce the sale of very large tracts of land in the ACT, with no consultation with the ACT government on economic or planning grounds. The ACT government has responsibility for administering an orderly program of land release and use, and has gone to a great deal of trouble in doing so, with a great deal of work being put into that area of its policy. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, just decides that it has very large blocks of land that it does not believe it needs any more, plops them onto the market and then is a little surprised when the local authorities say that this is not quite how planning ought to occur. That is perhaps something that should have been announced in the budget in a fairer and more open way.
The other two areas that I want to very briefly touch on here tonight, given the limited time I have, surround education and ageing. I am again disappointed to see the lack of good, strong investment in our future, through investment in education, particularly in the higher levels of education and in public education. I understand that there is only about $12 million for new measures for the entire science, education and training portfolios, which is about 0.1 per cent of the total education and training budget of $12 billion. It is pretty disappointing. When the government also says that we could `expect a fall in estimated demand for residential aged care services', that is so unbelievable as to be laughable. It raises the question of where the government has been and where the minister or his advisers have been, if that is how they see the aged care sector. I think the front page of the Adelaide paper today had an article with the terrible prediction of possible closures of aged care services there, owing to lack of resources—or some such story. With the government going to remove subsidies by something like $152 million this year and a further $174 million in the next year in the aged care area, if it is going to have that sort of attitude towards aged care now, that raises the question of why we would go down the avenue of an Intergenerational Report which tells us that we have to worry about a growth in aged care needs in the future.
I believe that the government's program of welfare reform is one of the most contentious parts of this whole budget. There are serious concerns about the minister's plans for people receiving disability support pensions and for those in our communities who require that type of support now and into the future. While much noise is being made about the growing numbers of people receiving DSP, it is a fact that those numbers have been trending down in recent times; but we need to look very carefully at what the government is actually planning here. Firstly, the third Commonwealth-state-territory disability agreement, which is a five-year agreement, is currently under negotiation and due by the end of June. However, I noticed in recent days that the Prime Minister and Minister Vanstone have announced a four-month extension to that current agreement. I would like to come back to that a little later. Within these negotiations is the debate surrounding the money needed for unmet needs, as demonstrated during the current five-year arrangement. An additional $100 million per year was agreed to and announced by then Minister Anthony back in July 2000 and was already factored in and, in many cases, already spent by the states and the territories in their program deliveries. The government is attempting to falsely claim this as new money or as some generous windfall. Clearly, it is not. I despair at the lack of growth funds in reality in the budget arrangement for that agreement. 
Secondly, proposed changes to the administration and eligibility for the DSP were announced in the budget. Currently, a person needs to demonstrate that they are unable to work a minimum of 30 hours a week at award wages to receive DSP. In the future that work test will be reduced to 15 hours a week at award wages—in other words, a tightening up of that work test rule. It is not going to affect people who are within five years of retirement age. It is going to affect existing recipients and new recipients from July of next year. There are also other changes which, unfortunately, I do not have the time to attend to here but which have been talked about in great detail in the other chamber. In the recent Senate estimates hearings, we learned that people currently working in business services, which were previously referred to as sheltered workshops, may also be facing the possibility of this new work test.
Thirdly, there are serious problems emerging, with the government refusing to accept its responsibilities for increases to salaries for those working in the community sector in New South Wales. The Social and Community Services Award, or SACS Award, was passed last November. This meant that people working in the community sector, and in this case the disability sector in particular, would receive a very justified wage increase. These people were among the state's lowest paid non-government community workers. On 26 April the New South Wales Premier, along with seven prominent community leaders, wrote to the Prime Minister, pointing out that the New South Wales government had fulfilled its responsibility to meet its share of the SACS Award increases, at a cost of $116 million over three years. In that letter it was estimated that the Commonwealth's share was $68.8 million, or approximately 37 per cent, of the total funding required. Still the Commonwealth is refusing to face up to this responsibility. While the government remains intransigent, the services involved are paying wages to their employees and are very quickly running out of money. The services include residential disability services, day programs, respite services, youth refuge and hostels, amongst many others.
If the time permitted I could quote scores of representations that I and other colleagues have received from this sector, from families and from organisations facing closure of the programs—all because we cannot see this government saying that it will pay its share of the costs. It is fair to say that Minister Vanstone uses a lot language and a lot of words to deny these claims but, in reality, I cannot find any way of justifying the Commonwealth's actions. In actual fact, a serious crisis is looming. The government is holding the sector to ransom. The minister says that, if this parliament does not pass her changes to the DSP, funding for the disability sector through the CSTDA will be withheld. This is cold-hearted blackmail. In the words of the MS Society of Victoria, `This is Senator Vanstone's own human shield strategy.' People with disabilities, their families, their carers and the organisations providing services are not pawns on some game board. They are not to be used as scoring points, and they are not to be seen as people refusing to do their bit to contribute when and where they can. They are able to do those things knowing that they have the DSP to support them and to catch them if needed. Compulsorily remove that support and force them into competition in the open labour market, and you risk their chances of succeeding. 
I want to very briefly refer to a couple of cases where people have contacted me and given me examples of how these changes will affect them. Danielle is a 45-year-old woman who works 37 hours a week in a business service in New South Wales. She requires support to perform her duties. Open employment is not an option for Danielle, because of her support needs as a result of her intellectual, neurological and physical disabilities. Young Stephen is a 32-year-old who works 36.7 hours per week in the same business service. I had the pleasure of meeting this young man when I visited there two or three months ago. He requires assistance to perform tasks. He is legally blind and he has an intellectual disability. He receives DSP. He lives at home with his parents, and he relies on that DSP to supplement his wages. Stephen is also working one day per month at the University of New South Wales in the mail room to gain experience. He earns a full wage for this work and he pays tax. He is gaining valuable skills in this work and now uses those skills at the business service in question. But he is not able to earn full award wages on a full-time basis, because of his work capacity.
The government has to understand that business services and other similar areas actually offer for these people an employment base that is different from the open labour market. Those business services can actually alter their day requirements when necessary. I know of a young woman here in Canberra who works a 35-hour week, but that may take a different configuration each week, depending upon her wellness and her ability. An open labour market would very likely not be able to do that for people like those I am referring to. There is another stunning article that I recommend that everybody read if they have not. It was in the Melbourne Herald Sun on 27 May. It was written by a young man called Lachlan McLeod, who is a journalism studies graduate and is disabled and confined to a wheelchair. It is a very good article. Towards the end of it he says:
To most able-bodied people, going out and doing everyday things may not seem like an achievement.
But to a disabled person, I can assure them that it is indeed an accomplishment to be like everybody else.
Then I suppose at the end of the day, losing $53 isn't as insulting as the Government assuming that the disability pension is a waste of money.
These are real people. I am not making any of this up. I know that Minister Vanstone has made noises about rethinking certain bits of this, but I personally think that she has to rethink almost the whole lot.
The Eastern Regions Mental Health Association in Melbourne sent me a very detailed letter of its views about these changes. The president said towards the end of the letter:
I see the changes proposed by the Treasurer as not only short-sighted but potentially damaging to the mental health of many Australians disabled by mental illness.
We have to imagine what it is like to have a mental illness and to try to adapt to the new requirements, which will be stringent and harsh, given that what the government has said has not been refuted. The Melbourne City Mission had this to say: 
The framework for the report—
that is, the Intergenerational Report—
accepts that it is desirable for Australia to aim to maintain its position as a `lower taxing and spending country'. This is clearly a point that can be contested. While fiscal sustainability and accountability are necessary, consideration of current and future citizens extends beyond their role and expectations as taxpayers. Questions of common good, community cohesion and individual well being must also be considered.
They had a lot more to say, but time does not allow me to go into those details. All I can say is that we have people working in the business services area who are facing massive change through the quality assurance bill, which we supported but about which we have some concerns, given the current budget situation. We have people on DSP with chronic illness or disability who need a seamless, smooth transition from support to work as they are well and able to carry out their duties. The government is totally wrong in believing that the only way it will achieve renewed policy in the disability area is by coercion. It needs to think carefully about the gains already being made by the massive number of people on DSP with no coercion. If we could increase the support and financial resources for those people and the employers employing them, I believe we would reach stages that we could be proud of as a community with no need for coercion or compulsion at all.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Jull, David, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—It is not my intention to delay this chamber for long tonight, but I would like to make some comments on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03. In many respects, this is a most remarkable document. It is a remarkable document inasmuch as it has managed to provide some good, sound economic guidance for Australia at a time of very great concern; concern at our security and concern at the state of our defence forces. The government has made a commitment to ensure that they are brought up to date, that they are properly funded and that Australia can play a role not only in international affairs but in ensuring the security of the people at home.
If you look back over the last five or six years, the story of our defence forces is a remarkable one indeed. I think it is good that we pay tribute to the tremendous work that has been done in places like East Timor. When the newly appointed President of East Timor arrived at question time today, the emotion in the reception he got in the House was obvious. There was a realisation by all the members in the House, as there is in the community at large, that Australia did play a most constructive and leading role as part of the UN forces that brought some peace and security and ultimately democracy to that troubled island. There is no doubt that in providing that particular support in East Timor our defence services were indeed stretched, as our equipment was stretched. The load on those forces in recent years has been considerable indeed. It has not only been East Timor. If you look at what Australia has achieved in a number of peacekeeping forces around the world—if you look at the tremendous job that is being done and what is being achieved on the troubled island of Bougainville—I think you can see the standard of the service that we provide. We really need to congratulate and support all our forces, not only as a token of thanks but as a means of making sure that Australia does play its role in the international community.
Bougainville is not quite there yet, but it is indeed heading towards a situation where at last—after 12 or 13 years—that troubled island may have the prospect of some peace. Mr Deputy Speaker Price, as you and I both know, what has been achieved by the Australian forces in Bougainville is really incredible. It was an invaluable experience to visit that place, to see the state that it was in just two or three years ago and to realise that a form of peace had been kept and that the peace process was working through with the support of the Australian defence forces. The thing that came back to me time and time again after that visit was the fact that the ADF people on the ground carried no arms whatsoever. It was part of the arrangements that there were not to be arms used in that particular process. Our people were indeed brave, and the people of Bougainville paid tribute to the attitude of the Australian forces in the work that they undertook. The one thing that should be pointed out in terms of the Bougainville effort is the fact that the women who were members of the Australian defence forces played an enormous role. Once again, in public meetings with the personnel of Bougainville, it was pointed out to us that it was really appreciated that the women were there, and the relationships that they built up with the local communities were such that they were regarded as being trustworthy and as having a real contribution to make. 
So I was delighted to learn that this commitment was made to re-equipping our defence forces, to providing that extra support and indeed to building on their numbers. Virtually daily in the papers now we read of their efforts in the war on terrorism and the role, in particular, that they are playing in Afghanistan. That in itself is going to be a major commitment for not only this particular budget but also a great number of budgets to come.
The other point I would like to allude to very briefly is the increase in allocation to our own security services. One of the things that has tended to be forgotten in recent months is that we are still very much on alert for any terrorist activity that might happen not only within this country but also in our region. I am afraid I have no time for some commentators. It would seem particularly prevalent on radio for commentators to say that there is no threat to Australia. I do not think anybody in authority in Australia, whether from the security agencies, the government or indeed the parliament itself, has ever said that there is no threat to Australia. It has been said that there has been a low threat, but never that there has been no threat. The government has recognised that our first obligation is obviously for the security of the country. Consequently, the commitment has been made for extra equipment, extra funding and, I understand, for some extra personnel.
In many respects Australia has been very lucky, and we have been lucky because of the quality of our services. But I think one of the things that probably assisted us more than anything was the three years or so in the lead-up to the Olympic Games, when a massive security operation and security check were undertaken not only in terms of what may be happening in the country but also in terms of assessing people who would be visiting. The fact that the Olympic Games went by without a hitch and without an emergency spoke volumes for the standard of the work that was done by our security services in conjunction with overseas bureaus. The reality is that Australia has a very real role to play in providing that security for our region and indeed as part of the worldwide effort to stop terrorism. The quality of our work is acknowledged overseas, and I think that the work that has been done within Australia has been acknowledged not only by the public at large but also by a number of the ethnic communities scattered around Australia who have been working in conjunction with our security services. So, in that respect, it was a major commitment of the government to undertake to look after the defence forces and our security services. Despite that, we still had the opportunity to provide some good support for community organisations and for our education system. 
There are a couple of areas that do not normally seem to come to light in these general debates on the appropriation bills. Australia's record on the trade front in recent years really has been quite outstanding. We know that many of our trade figures in recent quarters have been in the black. While obviously the level of the Australian dollar has contributed to our success in going into overseas markets, I believe that the government should be congratulated on the real efforts that they have made in trade promotion. I was pleased to see that the export market development grants have once again been a focus of this budget and are to be extended. I do not think that people fully realise just what effect that can have. Maybe it is not a big deal in terms of our larger companies, but in our small and medium enterprises the fact that that assistance is there often makes the difference between having a go at exports and just leaving them alone and concentrating on a domestic market.
In my electorate in Queensland the vast majority of businesses are small and medium enterprises. I was going through a list of export market development grants that have been paid in the last 12 months within that electorate, and there are some amazing stories. There is the story of a swimming pool lining manufacturer who now produces his entire output for export to Germany. He makes liners for swimming pools. There is an optical company that makes contact lenses that have been quite revolutionary. They are the only one of their type in the world. They are now exporting worldwide. Jewellery manufacturers export from Sanctuary Cove to places like Hawaii—it seems almost incongruous, but they are there.
One of the classics came through just last week with some funding from the Minister for Trade. This was in the area of soft serve ice-creams. A company that was part of one of the major Australian groups decided that they would off-load their soft serve ice-cream division. Two young gentlemen took this over and decided that they could make a go of it. I tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, next time you are in Dubai or Beijing and you have a Dairy Queen ice-cream of the soft serve variety, it came from my electorate. That company is exporting to more than 20 countries around the world selling soft serve ice-cream. The list goes on and on.
The manufacture of portable buildings is another area. A company that was involved, I understand, with the making of the sails for Expo have now got to a situation where they are exporting worldwide. They built the sails and the covers for the Commonwealth Games complex in Kuala Lumpur. Now they are building collapsible and portable silos for wheat, which they are exporting to the United States. They are making portable libraries for sale in France, car parks and major entertainment centres which can be erected in a matter of hours. This was a process which was developed in Queensland and exported to the world. Now the company are manufacturing in such diverse places as India and South Africa. I understand they will soon be going into the United States.
The other area that is a concern in my electorate—and it is one with which I have been associated for many years—is tourism. I would like to congratulate the government on the initiatives that they have undertaken in recent years in making sure not only that Australia is promoted properly but indeed that major studies have been undertaken to make sure that we maximise the benefits of tourism. I do not know how many times I have stood up in this place and talked about the flow-on effect of tourism on employment. Every time we have an increase of something like 25,000 international visitors, there are another 1,200 jobs up for grabs. The success story of Australia over the last 15 or 20 years in the tourism industry has been quite remarkable. 
It is true—and we had to do it—that we looked towards volume, and we prided ourselves when we first reached the million tourists a year mark. We made great noises about the fact that during the year of the Olympics we had more than three million visitors. Now we are looking at the quality end of the industry—not to ignore the others but to ensure that those tourists who come to Australia are of a type that spend more than most and have the opportunity of providing yield for our tourist operators and for our accommodation houses. It has been true that in past years we have been through a huge construction phase, particularly in hotels. Nobody has made any money out of them. Now is the time to settle down and consolidate and to make sure we do have that capacity to bring some yield in and to provide some real returns for the investment that has been made in that industry.
There is a maturity in the tourism product but, more importantly, there is a maturity in the nature of the people who work in that industry; and I think we should pay tribute to the work that is being done by TAFE and specialist colleges around Australia in producing young people who manage, run and operate various tourist facilities. I suppose my first interest in tourism arose 25 or so years ago. The thing that really used to annoy me was that the few hotels in Australia all seemed to be managed by somebody called Fritz or Helmut. If you go overseas now, more often than not you will find Australians working in or managing hotels. A number them are working in Asia, but the reality is that a number of them are now working throughout Europe in some of the great hotels of the world.
When I was recently in London I was quite delighted when a young lady came up to me at the hotel in which I was staying to tell me that she was from my electorate and that she had graduated only recently from a course at one of the Queensland institutions and immediately got a managerial job in that particular hotel in London. A lot of effort, money and concentration has been put into the training of our young people. That money and that purpose is still there, and now of course the hospitality and tourist industries can provide our young people not only with satisfying jobs but with lucrative jobs as well. We are not just providing housemaids; we are providing the real brainpower and effort found behind the tourist industry and we are exporting that to the world.
The other issue that I would like to raise very briefly concerns one particular aspect of some of the controversy that is going on at the moment over pharmaceutical benefits. There have been increases in the rates to be paid, by both ordinary Australians and, indeed, those in receipt of pensions, for drugs under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I think there has generally been an acceptance that this had to happen, much as some people may not like it. The reality is that science is making tremendous progress in the development of medicine, but that progress is often expensive: new drugs are hitting the market all the time and some of them are very expensive indeed.
In fact, lists of the real prices of some of those drugs that are available have circulated around this place, and I do not think a lot of people realise the cost that is involved. One of the things that the government should be congratulated on is the decision to make sure that the real price of the drugs actually appears on the label of a prescription when it comes out of the chemist shop. Not one but two of my local chemists who agree with this particular move have raised another issue that is of concern to them. Admittedly, it would appear from what they tell me that quite often the elderly are the offenders. Apparently a number of service clubs quite often have drives for drugs that are out of date and they ask people to take those drugs back into chemist shops where they are collected and checked. If they are still all right, they can be sent overseas to some needy countries. 
The situation that they point out is that there would seem to be almost a tendency by some sections of our community to hoard their prescription drugs, and that in actual fact quite often mountains of drugs come into chemist shops for distribution overseas after their official expiry date. As one of my pharmacists said the other day, it would be an interesting exercise for the government to sit down sometime and try to estimate the cost of this hoarding of drugs. Maybe that exercise could be looked at. I thought it was an interesting aspect of this whole debate on the PBS. I certainly know people in my community who do have a tendency to hoard drugs, and obviously that is also putting some pressure on our system. Mr Deputy Speaker, I said I would not delay the House too long and my time is just about up. I would just say once again a special word of congratulation to the government for a budget that I think has achieved a great deal in very difficult times.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03. I do so not to congratulate the government but to condemn them for the very harsh attitude they have taken to some of the most vulnerable in our community—those with disabilities who are caught up in a very mean and tricky move by this government to change their disability support pension. I have had many calls, as I suspect have most members of parliament, not only from people with disabilities but from employers of people with disabilities. 
Any prospective employer who is looking for an employee would be well served to look at employing someone with a disability. People with disabilities generally make far better employees. The facts show not only that they take less time off due to sickness and other matters but that they appreciate being given the opportunity of employment and will generally work much harder than their able-bodied counterparts. You can understand why people with disabilities feel that they have had a real kick in the guts from the government when they heard the news about their pension in the budget.
In the time that I have available tonight, I want to refer to the case of a young girl aged 29. Her disability was as a result of suffering from a serious stroke at the age of 22. The ongoing effects of the stroke are, firstly, reduced mobility and capacity in the right arm and leg; secondly, a speech disability; and, thirdly, anti-phosphate syndrome: a blood disorder, which requires regular medication, monitoring and analysis.
Her employment position prior to 14 May was this: she is a client of BizLink, a disability employment organisation which operates in the northern suburbs of Perth and does a tremendous job. This young lady was employed by RIC Publications Pty Ltd, an educational publisher, as a production assistant. She has worked there for the past three years for 25 hours per week, a time that has been altered regularly to allow her the opportunity to comfortably manage her disability while at the same time develop an ongoing career. The employer in this circumstance is to be congratulated for the opportunity afforded this young woman.
As to her financial position prior to this government's budget, she received the disability support allowance of $112.20 per week and had a salary of $305.75 per week, giving her a total income of some $417.95 per week. Her position post this budget of 14 May is that she is currently very uncertain of her future and is exploring the following options: first, she is looking at full-time employment, which will have negative effects on her health and wellbeing and will result in the loss of eligibility for health care cards which are essential to her; second, she is looking at reducing her working hours to 15 hours per week, which will see her financially disadvantaged and intellectually unchallenged, will increase her pension and increase the burden on government—an increase in the government's contribution from $112 to $162 per week; lastly, she is looking at not working at all and receiving a full-time pension. 
Her financial position post 14 May is this. Her disability support allowance could be replaced by Newstart allowance. This would represent a potential reduction of some $52 per fortnight. She could cop a reduction in salary if hours worked are reduced. Then again, there could be a loss of job. The reporting regime required by the Newstart program would create a level of physical and emotional distress that would be detrimental to this young lady's health if employment were terminated for any reason.
This employer tells me that the current level of uncertainty is placing a significant level of emotional stress not only on this employee but also on a couple of other people that he employs. It has had some effect on this young lady's work with this particular firm, but, combined with the support provided by BizLink, they have created an environment where this young lady can manage her disability well, at the same time developing her skills and making a considerable contribution to her employer and to her community.
The experience of this young lady over the years since the stroke has shown that increased stress levels place health and wellbeing at some risk. What young people in this circumstance need, particularly young women, is not the sort of initiative that this government has written into the most recent budget. What young people like this need is support in the workplace. They need programs to help them maintain themselves at work. And people without employment need programs and support in areas that will help them find that employment.
I really appreciate the job that BizLink does. It is not in my electorate, but it does service a fair area of the northern suburbs. Its staff are very committed and it does a tremendous job. It is one of those organisations which in the last three budgets has had to accept about a six per cent cut, called an efficiency dividend. On top of that, it has had to absorb the GST. That has meant that it has had to take one person away from the support position that it has had in the field and has had to put more administrative time into managing its budget, which is much tighter, and dealing with the GST. Here is an organisation that has done a tremendous job and that has not been helped in the last three budgets. It now finds that it has a much more difficult client workload to contend with simply because of the uncertainty and the concern that has resulted from this budget—concern not just to employers but to employees.
Another point that needs to be made is this, and I hope the government will consider it. People with disabilities, depending upon what the particular disability is, can have really good days and really good weeks. They might go for months being fit, healthy and well, and then they can have a run of outs. They can have bad days. They can have days when the disability just gets on top of them and when they find it very difficult to cope. It is very difficult when you are faced with an assessment at a time when you might be feeling pretty good or at a time when you are feeling very bad. 
I think the government has made a real blue here. It has made a blue in picking on some of the most vulnerable people in our community. I am very pleased indeed that we on this side of the parliament have indicated that we will oppose this legislation in the upper house. A number of people from the ranks of government have indicated to me that they hope that the opposition parties in the Senate will knock this off. They are not comfortable with it, they are not happy with it, they feel embarrassed by it and they feel that these moves in the budget do not reflect some of the good things that they believe the Liberal Party stands for. I think it will be a relief to many people in government to have this piece of legislation knocked off in the Senate.
I want to say this to those government members who see there being some sort of a safety net in the Senate and who know that ALP members of the Senate will not let unfair measures like this through: if those government members are really dinkum about being concerned about the unfairness of these initiatives in the recent budget, they will do what people in the Liberal Party have done previously—that is, they will have the courage to stand up in their party room and say to the Treasurer that these sorts of moves are simply not acceptable and that he should go away and find other ways of raising the funds that he claims he needs.
There are a number of issues that I would have liked to have had the time to raise tonight, but I understand that there is an agreement to cut things short so that everyone gets the opportunity to have a say. I am very pleased to be able to join with other members from this side in giving voice to our opposition to these moves on the disability support pension and in saying to the government that it is not an appropriate way to raise money and that, if they want revenue that badly, instead of picking on some of the most vulnerable, most deserving and most needy people in our community, they should look elsewhere. There are plenty of places that they can look, and they should.
The issue that I will conclude on is that this whole budget has been sold to the community as a khaki budget—a budget which brings in increased funds because of our need to deal with the terrorist situation, because of our need to fight the war on terror, because of our need to better protect our borders and because of our need for greater security. The truth is that, when you look closely at this budget, you see that it is all camouflage; it is trickery. It is the old mean and tricky bit which this government is well known for and well identified by its own hierarchy. This is not a budget which brings in a lot more money to Defence, because much of what is being spent on defence is being achieved through cost cutting and through the delaying of longer term capital acquisition programs. The government has sought to simply con the people of Australia by talking up a khaki budget at the same time that it is hitting some of the most vulnerable people in our community. I am very pleased that the ALP is taking stock of those measures and will knock them off in the Senate, which is what it ought to do.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—I am delighted to support the budget tonight because the residents of my electorate, the federal seat of Wentworth, have benefited for seven years from low interest rates, low unemployment and economic growth as a direct result of the budgetary policies of the coalition government. The coalition's seventh budget—and, if I may say so, my first as a member of this august parliament—continues the government's excellent record of management of our economy, which has seen Australia perform better than most other developed economies. In 2001, it is perhaps worth noting, our growth was higher than that of each of the world's largest seven economies and was twice as fast as the OECD average. 
Following the budget speech, I thought that I would do a little survey of my own in my electorate to determine what the feel on the streets was about this budget. I did some doorknocking in Randwick, in the southern part of my electorate, and in Paddington, in the eastern part of my electorate. Those are somewhat diverse communities, and I thought I would get a reasonable response in relation to the budget. I found to my interest that, in general terms, people were supportive of the direction of the budget. There were concerns in one or two places that changes to the disability support pension might impact not so much upon them personally but upon their acquaintances, but when I further examined the persons involved they said that overall they were pleased with the direction of the budget.
Interestingly enough, in relation to issues of economic significance and financial implications, the greatest concern to the people of my electorate in the middle of May when I made these casual inquiries—if I can put it that way—was regarding the direction of insurance and the problems faced by the broader community, especially not-for-profit organisations, concerning premiums for public liability insurance. I wish to say something about that possibly later in this speech, although it probably deserves a separate address.
I want to point out several features of the budget which, I believe, are very important. They include some general economic features, some sector by sector features, some of which have been dealt with in detail by my distinguished colleague the member for Fadden, and also some local initiatives in my seat of Wentworth which have been very welcomed by the people of that part of Australia. Let me deal firstly with some general features of the budget. The Treasurer concluded his remarks on 14 May by saying:
This is a Budget to keep Australia safe, to keep our borders secure, and to keep our economy strong.
I am sure that I was not the only one in the chamber that night who felt a tremendous sense of relief that these objectives had been made the priorities for the coming budget. I believe that, if we do get the support of the parliament—and I urge the Senate to reflect very carefully upon any opposition to any measure in this budget—our country will continue to enjoy those economic benefits that it has enjoyed over the last three terms of the Howard-Anderson government.
The budget surplus, which is provided for, is $2.1 billion in 2002-03, with every cent being used to pay back Labor's debt. Labor's debt by mid-2003 will have reduced substantially from the $61 billion that it is at present. The debt interest repayments are really quite significant. The interest bill today is $4.75 billion per year less than it was under Labor. That is a very significant saving. It means that those moneys can now be put into other things such as health and education. Australian home buyers are now paying $350 less per month for a $100,000 home mortgage than they were paying when the opposition was last in office. These are not insignificant benefits of good economic management. More importantly, the coalition has created more than 980,000 new jobs since 1996 and unemployment is expected to fall to six per cent by mid-2003. It is expected that over one million jobs will have been created by Christmas this year. What a wonderful occasion it will be when somewhere around this country some lucky person becomes the one-millionth beneficiary of the economic policies of this government—that might be an interesting photo opportunity. 
Let me turn to some of the sector by sector features that I mentioned earlier. The first is strengthening Australia's defence. In my electorate I have three defence facilities: one Navy and two Army. They are very significant defence facilities. The war against terrorism, which is currently being continued by our government in coalition with 35 other countries around the world, will cost an extra half a billion dollars, but I warmly commend the government for that effort. We must do all we can to ensure that innocent people, not just in our country but in all other countries around the world, can enjoy their peace and not be terrorised by people who have no regard for their rights. Therefore, the increase in defence spending of $1.3 billion in 2002-03, bringing the total defence spending to $14.1 billion, is welcome. The establishment of a permanent incident response regiment with capacity to respond to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive incidents is an important step.
Major projects, too, have not been neglected. The government will continue funding for major projects such as acquiring armed reconnaissance helicopters and upgrading weapons on the Anzac frigates. I have had the pleasure as an officer in the Defence Reserves of actually being deployed on one of those frigates. I warmly commend those measures in the budget. The establishment of a permanent special forces tactical assault group on Australia's east coast to support the existing one on the west coast is highly commendable. As earlier speakers have said today, the government's commitment to strengthening Australia's defence forces and fighting in the war against terrorism, including bringing important legislation before this parliament, must be given the support not just of the Australian people but of every responsible member of this parliament.
Protecting Australia's borders is another aspect of the budget which I wish to briefly mention. Over the next five years, $1.3 billion will be spent to improve aviation security, to assist in identifying possible security threats and to increase Australia's capacity to respond to security incidents. The offshore processing of illegal arrivals is an important measure in that regard, and it is obviously working. Border protection is also significant, and the Coastwatch patrolling activities of our northern borders must continue to be addressed. All of these are in the provision for protecting Australia's borders. Over the next four years, $75 million will be spent for a regional cooperation agreement to fight people-smuggling and unauthorised migration in transit countries. It was pleasing to hear today that the leadership of East Timor is committed to supporting our government in this program. A strong border protection policy, maintaining the integrity of our immigration programs, is in the interests of the Australian people as a whole, of the region and of responsible migration policies around the world.
Health is another sector which is of real significance. Fighting drug abuse is of particular interest and concern in my electorate. In an area bordering Kings Cross, residents often experience problems associated with the drug trade. I am therefore pleased that the budget is funding a program for the introduction of retractable needle and syringe technology in Australia and that overall $65 million will be spent on fighting drug abuse. In the area of arthritis, which is important for a number of people in my area, $11.5 million over four years to improve diagnosis, treatment and care will be appropriated. In the area of palliative care, $55 million over four years to target education and training for GPs, more efficient backup and coordination between service providers, support for family and friends and increased awareness for the wider community is another important health provision which I would seek to emphasise. 
In the area of aged care and veterans, there is a tremendous interest in my electorate in the provisions in the budget. The $654 million over four years to provide quality care for older Australians is an important measure. In particular, I would mention the 6,000 community aged care packages that will assist older Australians to continue living in their own homes. This is a measure which is proving most popular. As for aged care nurses, our aged care homes will receive increased subsidies to help them attract and retain more nurses, and facilities will be upgraded in some small aged care homes. These measures in the area of aged care are of particular importance. As the Treasurer pointed out in the Intergenerational Report, we have to ensure that we responsibly address the challenges we face into the future in dealing with an ageing population. Today 2.4 million Australians are over 65; in 20 years time, it is estimated that there will be 4.2 million. We cannot ignore those demographic changes.
Another area which I would seek to address is the area of job seekers and training. In July 2003, the government will renew contracts for the most effective providers and put others out to tender. An important measure which resonates in my electorate is the announcement of 8,500 additional places each year to give job seekers greater opportunities to participate in the Work for the Dole program. For mature age workers, 11,500 places for computer skills training at a cost of $23 million over four years is a highly commendable measure. We ought not to consider that, simply because someone has reached the age of 55—or even younger these days—they are no longer able to adapt, no longer able to be trained and no longer able to be of significance in the work force. I take the opposite view; I take the view that, with measures such as these, we can exploit the tremendous experience and greater skills of our older people.
In the area of education, I am particularly proud of the measures in relation to numeracy and literacy. An increase of $35.7 million over three years for programs in our schools has been announced. Just the other day it was my pleasure to attend Bronte Public School with the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, for the launch of that national program. It was an exciting day. The kids at that school and the teachers—who have not always found reason to agree with every aspect of federal policy—were very excited about the direction of the education program. Expenditure of $82.4 million over three years to expand quality teacher programs has also been announced. A massive 52 per cent increase in general funding for government schools since 1996 is part of the package. Finally, in the education area, let me mention $60 million for research into the critical new economy areas of information technology and biotechnology.
Finally in the sector-by-sector analysis of measures which are of relevance to my electorate, can I mention the environment. Increased environmental funding of over $1.8 billion will be spent to protect Australia's environment—$198 million more than in 2001-02. Another $100.7 million will be allocated to tackle salinity and improve water quality measures as part of the national plan. In addition, $103.57 million will be allocated to improve the condition of Australia's coasts and waterways.
Let me now turn to some of the measures that directly affect my electorate. I was particularly pleased that the government has, through the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, allocated more than $10 million to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. As the former chair of the Australian Heritage Commission, I played a role in the establishment of that trust, which will establish lands for the permanent and public benefit of the people of Sydney and Australia. The trust has a vital role in managing Commonwealth-owned heritage assets around our harbour, including two in my seat: the Macquarie light station and the former marine biological research station at Watsons Bay. Funding will assist the trust to maintain these properties and continue to develop a management plan for the sites. 
I am also pleased that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has confirmed that the coalition's election commitment to provide capital assistance to the Sydney Jewish Museum will be honoured during the coming financial year: $250,000 will be provided to help upgrade access to the museum for people with disabilities. This will be a major boost to its fundraising drive to complete what are vital works for an institution which is, in many respects, the heart of Sydney's Jewish community. The museum's educational programs, particularly those associated with the Holocaust, rely on the wonderful support of the magnificent Holocaust survivors who every day toil in that museum to ensure that their story is so poignantly told. As the years go by, the absence of lifts and ramps in the museum is having a serious impact on their ability to get about the museum. This project will particularly help those volunteers, but also ensure that the museum is more accessible for members of the general public. I am proud to support this budget. I am pleased to have the opportunity to support it and, along with my colleagues tonight, I commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03, I want to concentrate on a couple of broad areas, the first being the budget and its implications on government direction and the other being where the government is heading in terms of its own policy direction and the relationship it has to the budget.
If there is one clear thing that we can all gather from the budget, it is that it was a complete failure. The Costello-Howard budget—proclaimed by the Treasurer himself in his own handouts and materials to be the sixth consecutive budget surplus—was actually a deficit. The Treasurer got it wrong right from the start. He sneakily tried to correct this on his own web site when the fact became common knowledge, but he was caught out.
This budget is about taking from the poor and giving to the rich. That sounds like a cliche except that this time the rich are actually the government. This budget is about cutting spending to those least able to afford it. It is about cutting spending to people on disability support pensions and about cutting spending in pharmaceutical benefits. At the end of the day, this budget is about paying for the war on terror—paying for defence—by taking money away from those in the community that are least able to afford it. These cuts are targeted at the most vulnerable in our community, and these are the people whom the government should be looking after, rather than cutting back on what they get in the budget and giving it to another area.
One area which I have just mentioned that did get a significant budget increase is defence. Everybody on the Labor side supports the idea that we should have extra spending on defence, but when you have extra spending in a particular area, it needs to be balanced in terms of where you get that money from. There is no objection to spending extra money on defence, but it should not be taken from people on pensions, low incomes or disability support pensions. Do not take it from those who can least afford to pay for the increases.
On the one hand it is good to see the government provide extra spending for defence and to promote what I would call `the government's war on terrorism'. That is what the government is trying to do: promote its own private war on terrorism, rather than bringing all the people together with it. What we know and see in the community is that people are not ignorant or stupid. They understand what is going on. 
I heard one of the government members saying that he did a bit of a straw poll in his electorate and spoke to his constituents. I think we all did something similar. I went out and asked people what their concerns were about the budget. A fairly resounding response came back in my electorate that they were concerned about budget cuts. They were concerned about what would happen with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, they were concerned about people on pensions and low incomes and they were concerned about people on disability pensions that would have their funding cut. Of course, those on disability pensions that are receiving cuts are sometimes the most in need, particularly people with intellectual disabilities. They are now out in the cold, left to fend for themselves. It is the old catchcry, the `catch and kill your own' approach from government.
The government has wavered a bit. It got a bit shaky in the knees. It suddenly realised this might be a really bad idea and that it had not quite anticipated that the community would see what it was trying to do. There was a bit of outrage and a bit of feigned indignation from the minister, who thought the government might need to get a different approach on this and started looking at ways to make it less harsh. That is what it is: harsh. Less harsh is what the government thought it might make it. The changes the government may put forward are insignificant. They are not going to make any difference to those that need to have some positive outcomes from the budget.
This is where the good news stops, believe it or not, and where the bad news really begins. Labor has said that in the Senate we will steadfastly oppose changes to DSP. We will get support from the minor parties to do this. So what does the government do? What is the government's response to a democratically elected Senate that in the end has the majority over the government if it chooses to exercise it? The government blackmails the Senate. Call it budget blackmail or whatever you like; at the end of the day that is what it is. The government has made it clear that, if we do not pass the harsh measures and the cutting back of disability support pensions to those most in need, the government will start defunding disability to the tune of $100 million per annum. That is the choice we get. That is the alternative. It is a case of `damned if you do and damned if you don't'. But there is one thing for sure: this government will take away from those least able to afford it. It will attack the weak and it will give to the wealthy and the rich—in this case, the government. It just gives it back to itself so it can pass it on to other areas.
Before I talk about a range of other measures in the budget, I want to remind people of the link between the way the government operates—the way it treats people in the budget, the way it is treating disabilities and the way it deals with the business of government—and the way it ran the last election campaign. The last election campaign, without any doubt, was a single issue campaign. It was about war, terrorism, border control, border protection—wrap it up any way you like; that is what it was about. We all genuinely have some fears about some things that might take place, but when a government deliberately exploits the fears in the community—the deepest, lowest common denominator—this is when it has lost its way. The government set out in the last election to deal with one issue only—to scare a whole country into concentrating on the one issue of border protection. 
The media had its own hand in this; the media did play a huge role. After the election it was said that something like 80 per cent of front pages during the whole 33 days of the election campaign were in relation to September 11, boats, boat people or something of that nature. There was very little to do with the election campaign. This highlights the length the government will go to win an election. You might think that everything is fair in love, war and elections, and in a sense it is. But the government has taken that election win, transposed it to the budget and said, `This gives us carte blanche, open slather, in terms of big spending in certain areas.'
There is some need, but let us get the need in perspective and let us get the need from the right areas. Let us not take money from people with disabilities. Why attack that group? Why attack people on disability support pensions? Why change the work test? Why attack those in the community least able to afford it? Why make it harder for people who need access to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and make them pay the extra dollar? Why make families pay that extra bit of money? It is quite simple: this government simply does not care. The easiest people to hit are often the people with the least ability to lobby, the people with the least ability to come back to the government. This government thinks it has got away with it.
The government have taken some unbelievable opportunism at the time of September 11 and transposed it not only to their campaign but now into what they do in government and what they do in the budget. It is all just flowing through. If you look really closely, there is evidence everywhere you look, every day. I turn my mind quickly to a couple of weeks ago when Minister Brendan `Chopper Read' Nelson was so caught up in trying to embarrass the Queensland state Labor government that he did not realise how much promotion, how much free media, he was giving to the very subject that he was denouncing. Smart move by Minister Brendan `Chopper Read' Nelson! He was waving photocopies—
 (Mr Barresi)—Order! I ask you to refer to the minister by his correct title.
—Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker. He was waving for everybody to see, in front of the media cameras, the front cover of the book he was denouncing. So upset was he about the impact this would have on our young kids that he was prepared to flaunt it around in front of all the media cameras, he was prepared to put it on his web site and he was prepared to keep promoting that book with that offensive front cover! At the end of the day, I think he actually likes it. It is as simple as that. What else could it be? We have a pretty smart minister! In fact, he was a little embarrassed, because he got up there attacking the Queensland state Labor government about some sort of approval of this for high schools, and he forgot that it was the federal government and federal funds that actually paid for the movie Chopper to be put together in the first place. It was funded by the federal government. How embarrassing it was to see the minister squirm all red-faced, with the front of the book cover in his hand. What a genius! He just kept coming back for more, because that is the genius he is! He is a great genius and we should all applaud him for his efforts!
Then you have your fully true, tried and tested one, the `Big A', one of my favourites: Minister Abbott. He is like a robot with a short circuit. He is unable to feel; he cannot see; he cannot integrate with the human race. This is a man on a mission. His mission, if he accepts it, is to destroy the union movement, kill off the Labor Party and in his spare time convince every employer that what they really want, more than anything else, is more unfair dismissal laws. Forget about making money! What business really wants is more unfair dismissal laws! If the minister just keeps telling them that, perhaps one day some of them will actually be convinced. As I said, his mission, if he accepts it, is to completely destroy the union movement, kill off the Labor Party and in his spare time convince employers that they do not really want to make money. This is how the minister comes into the House every day. 
People refer to him as the attack dog. He is like an attack dog. It is a bit like those banned breeds across Australia—those dangerous breeds. He is one that needs to be muzzled. Through careful breeding over many generations, the minister's brain—through that generational thing—was completely shrunk down to the size of a pea so that all he needs to do is control his breathing and his attack functions in the House.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I do believe the member is slighting the minister in tones that should not be allowed for parliamentary colleagues.
—I ask you to get back to the debate.
—As I said, it is just like dangerous breeds—I do think there is a great comparison to be made here. It is an analogy, a way of projecting. You have got to place yourself in this and think of the best way you could describe the minister. You could have a look at dangerous breeds, and this guy is just like one of those dangerous breeds. He should be kept away from all decent pet owners. Those people are decent people and they would not have a bar of it. We have the only minister, I would say, in history—apart, probably, from Minister Reith when he was a minister—that works very hard day in, day out to prolong industrial disputes. He actually attempts to convince employers and workers that they should not negotiate, that they should not resolve their disputes, that they should continue to be in dispute because that would be good—for whom, I am not sure, but probably for the minister, no-one else. 
So even after the dispute is resolved, as we saw today in question time, what does the minister do? He still tries to create a dispute out of one that has been resolved. This is a minister that has lost his mind. How can you bring up in the parliament today an issue that has been resolved? The workers are happy; BHP is happy; everyone has gone back to work. They have resolved their own issues through negotiation, and that is what it is about. But, no, the minister is not happy. The minister insists on continuing to try to cause disputation, because that is what the minister wants to do. It is all about the politics; it has nothing to do with the end result. It is all to do with the way this government behaves. Luckily for the majority of workers and for the majority of decent employers out there, they know there is a better way to get on with business. They actually want to get on with business to make money. 
But today I have to hand the prize to Minister Downer, today's living proof that old habits die hard. I am sure a lot of us remember those famous words he uttered when he said `the things that batter' in relation to domestic violence. Today he did it again. I might bring up a question that was raised by the shadow minister for foreign affairs when he asked the minister a very simple question about where he stood on something. His answer, of course, was the famous John Moore defence—that is, `Everybody knows very well what my view on that is, which is not much at all.'
This budget and this government—and the last election—are about not helping people, not coming to the assistance of people, not trying to give people a decent go so that they can provide for themselves better. They are really just about one thing: the government winning an election and having a budget that provides a smokescreen for the next election, because the next election is already being played out now. It is all about border protection—and we already know where it is at. Let us fight those issues. Let us get them on the table and let us be fair dinkum about the next election. ",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—The Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 before this chamber presents the parliament with a unique opportunity to safeguard the future of this country and our society by preserving our prosperity and our freedoms into the future. Edmund Burke observed over two centuries ago in the classic critique of the French Revolution that society is a partnership not only between those who are living but also between those who are living, those who are dead and those who are yet to be born. So we have an obligation to craft our economic and governmental arrangements today with an eye to tomorrow and the memory of yesterday. These bills and this budget do just that.
The budget brought before this parliament by the Treasurer is a sturdy fiscal platform for Australia's future development. By commissioning the Intergenerational Report, the government has set in train reforms that will safeguard our nation's future. One of the keys to those reforms is Australia's superannuation system, and I will give credit where credit is due: there is no doubt that it is to the credit of the Australian Labor Party that it did seek to make self-provision through superannuation a part of Australian life. This has helped to insulate Australia from the future calamities that face nationalised pension systems in Western Europe, for example, and to turn around the wishful idea that taxation is a form of savings. Nonetheless, it is also true that Labor could never shake the union monkey from its back: it could not see superannuation except from the perspective of increased union power, influence and financial clout, and our nation's retirement income strategy is the poorer for that failing.
By contrast this government, through this budget, recognises that superannuation offers the best way for Australians to secure both their own personal retirement income and the financial health of the nation. This budget will ensure that from 1 July 2002 the rebate for personal contributions will be replaced by a co-contribution. The government will contribute up to $1,000 a year towards the superannuation savings of eligible low income earners where they make personal undeducted contributions to those savings. Contributions can continue to be made by working people aged between 70 and 75. The superannuation guarantee contributions will be fairer for small business employers. The tax rate on excessive eligible termination payments will be reduced. The fully deductible amount for superannuation contributions by the self-employed will be increased from $3,000 to $5,000 from 1 July next year. Members of accumulation funds will be able to split future contributions with their spouse. Families will be allowed to make superannuation contributions on behalf of a child, and the superannuation surcharge rate has been reduced. The budget also reaffirms the government's commitment to choice and portability in superannuation, and it makes provision for an education campaign in that regard by the Australian Taxation Office.
I think the introduction of the children's superannuation accounts is of particular interest, given the importance of fostering a lifetime savings culture in our society. This particular measure was a very popular election commitment on the part of the coalition and will ensure that from 1 July family members, including parents and grandparents and other relations, and friends can make contributions on behalf of a child. Not only will that child be better able to achieve financial self-reliance in the future; they will, from the very outset, be encouraged to make their own contributions once they enter the work force. There will be a contribution limit of $3,000 per child per three-year period, and this limit is flexible enough to accommodate the needs of a contributing family without compromising the integrity of the measure. 
Of equal importance is the reduction in the rate of the superannuation surcharge. It is no secret that many Liberal members of parliament have had reservations about the surcharge. On a personal level, I entered this parliament some years after the surcharge's introduction and was not a fan of it either inside or outside this place. But like many others, I recognise the valid intentions of the surcharge in addressing some tax and budget issues. Nevertheless, I welcome wholeheartedly this particular budget initiative not simply because it is an effective tax cut, an initiative that ought to be welcomed by all members of this chamber, but because it addresses the concerns of many of my constituents about this particular surcharge. Over the past 3½ years I have had numerous representations from professionals, the self-employed and many others calling for the amelioration of the effects of the surcharge, so those Australians are most pleased that from 1 July this year the surcharge rate will be reduced by one-tenth and that similar reductions will be made over the following two income years. As such, the maximum surcharge rate will be 13.5 per cent in 2002-03, 12 per cent in 2003-04 and 10.5 per cent in 2004-05 and succeeding years. The total tax relief generated by these reductions will be $50 million in 2003-04, $120 million in 2004-05 and $200 million in 2005-06. So, combined with other budgetary initiatives, this reduction in the surcharge will encourage savings and self-provision in retirement to the benefit of Australian taxpayers and the ultimate benefit of Australia as a whole. The federal government has also made it clear that it will review the surcharge arrangements after three years so as to ascertain whether any further changes will be required. Given the evidence available to date and the present circumstances of our economy, I would urge the Commonwealth to utilise that future opportunity to abolish the surcharge in its entirety.
Retirement incomes policy, including superannuation, pension reform and fiscal policy more generally, is of particular interest to the people in my electorate of Curtin. The western suburbs of Perth are home to more older people than anywhere else in the state of Western Australia. In fact, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics census figures show that over 18,000 residents of Curtin—that is, about 15 per cent of the total population—are aged over 65, making my electorate one of the oldest in terms of the proportion of people aged over 65 years in Australia. Incidentally, in my electorate over one in four people are aged 55 or older. That is around 25 per cent. Not surprisingly, the findings of the Intergenerational Report released with the budget papers have been of particular interest in Curtin.
That report has found that, without a change in policy direction, the social and demographic forces shaping our nation will be likely to produce a structural deficit of around five per cent of GDP within 40 years, equivalent in today's prices to about $87 billion annually. Australia's population will age such that the number of people aged over 65 years will double and the number aged over 85 will quadruple. Almost 25 per cent of all Australians will be 65 or older in the year 2042. It will accelerate government spending on health services and aged care. By 2042, 15c in every single dollar earned in Australia could be spent on welfare and health—an additional $90 billion annual burden on taxpayers. It will also increase the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to Australia fivefold and double aged care costs. 
The report is by no means a tale of doom and gloom. The report does find that Australia is very well placed to take care of its retired citizens by virtue of our means tested age pension system and our maturing superannuation system. While 6.3 million more Australians will be of age pension age in the year 2042, spending on age pensions is likely to grow much more slowly here than in other developed societies. Further, the report's findings take the form of challenges not problems. Armed with this comprehensive analysis, we have the opportunity to re-fashion the future. We have the opportunity to take the steps in 2002 that will bear fruit in 2042 or before—steps like the reform of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the disability support pension. For example, taxpayer support of the disability support pension has increased dramatically in recent years and is likely to increase in the future. Twenty years ago, only 229,000 Australians received a disability benefit. Today more than 624,000 receive the disability support pension. In the last 12 years, the number of recipients has doubled. Today over one in nine Australians aged between 50 and 64 is, according to our welfare system, disabled. By taking measured and reasonable steps to address these issues today, we are safeguarding the benefits to Australians of the disability support pension system and other entitlements such as the PBS. Were such entitlement systems to collapse under the weight of their extraordinary costs, either in 40 years time or before, the ultimate losers would be those who rely on those systems. Those who would threaten such necessary reforms today will most certainly be called to account in the future.
The Intergenerational Report also affords us as parliamentarians the opportunity to discuss the social and demographic forces acting upon our national future. An issue often spoken about by Peter McDonald of the ANU is the fertility rate for Australian women. The decline in the number of children being born in Australia is very real, and the rate will drop to less than 1.6 births per woman. Other important social phenomena include the increasing casualisation of employment—a shift driven by the needs of employees first and foremost—and the growing instance of people under the age of 55 living without a partner. Further, young adults are staying at home longer. Amongst the 20-somethings, the proportion is over 30 per cent. Likewise, a lone parent now heads over 15 per cent of those households with young children. This government will continue to develop public policy to meet these changing social needs precisely because it is a Liberal government, and liberalism has served, does serve and will continue to serve the needs of people rather than ideology. Liberalism is about the sovereignty of the individual person, not about class or race. It is about making every man and woman the pilot of their own lives. It is for that reason that I would counsel parliamentarians to do more to reduce the burden of taxation on Australian families, businesses and employees. This government has made great strides in lessening that burden. It would have done even more had the opposition allowed for the implementation of the complete economic program endorsed by the Australian people at the 1998 federal election. But there is always more to do.
Our economic future is bright, unemployment is low and we continue to lead the way in growth globally. To safeguard the extraordinary development and success of the past six years, we should turn once again to the engine of income tax reduction, particularly to the reduction in the top marginal tax rate. We can be pleased that our nation faces a lower tax burden than the OECD average: about 30 per cent compared to 37 per cent of GDP. In Western Europe, it is almost 50 per cent. But our regional partners face even lower levels of taxation, averaging around 25 per cent of GDP, and that is where our competition lies. The increasing incongruity of the top marginal tax rate on income will drive away our nation's best and brightest achievers. Labour may not be yet as mobile as capital but, in a globalised marketplace, it is increasingly picky. 
Before I embark on one of my pet topics—further tax reform—we should do a growth accounting exercise to consider the sources of growth over the next 40 years. The sources of growth will be productivity and labour force growth, which can mean population growth, the labour force participation rate, the unemployment rate and hours worked. All of these will be affected by our level of taxation. But, before we focus on this, we also need to appreciate that future economic growth rates can be improved not only by making our tax rates more competitive but by curbing spending, particularly spending on what is being termed as `middle class welfare'. While the key to good growth performance is lower tax rates or a much flatter tax scale, we must also be conscious of increasing government expenditure, particularly on health and medical care for those who can otherwise afford it. The price of growth enhancing tax cuts will be curbing government spending. We should re-examine our public expenditures in the light of the Intergenerational Report and hopefully will find our way clear to continue to ease the burden of taxation that falls upon those who generate the income that supports those expenditures.

"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2002-06-17,"—What a wonderful idyllic world it is—the view from Peppermint Grove!
—I don't live in Peppermint Grove.
—I mean Peppermint Grove in the sort of Alice in Wonderland view of those on the other side. Today, statistics from the latest Australian census were revealed to all and sundry, and we saw the warts and all figures of Australian society. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 gives us an opportunity to wax lyrical about where we stand and to give our views on what is happening to our country and what is happening in our electorates. Most people have given a view on society. I am about to have my 61st birthday. My eldest daughter is 25 and my youngest is 23. They are both currently in Prague. The eldest works in London and the other, when not on holidays, works at Target in Melbourne to pay for her Dip. Ed. at Melbourne Uni. Today's census, as I said, highlighted the warts and all figures of Australian society. We heard about the median age of Australians, the percentage in each age group, the average weekly earnings, the states which had the greatest increases in population and the birthrates. Someone mentioned to me over the phone tonight that there are 30,000 fewer Tasmanians than in the last census. There are a whole lot of things in this census that we can compare with similar things in the last census. We can compare things in my childhood with things in my children's childhood.
In these speeches on the budget measures we keep hearing phrases about security, threats to Australia, what is happening overseas, the Intergenerational Report, retirement income policy, superannuation surcharges and what sort of Australia we are going to have in 30, 40 or 50 years time. Tonight, in the moments that are left to me I would like to give a thumbnail sketch of my electorate. My electorate is basically the same as those of most people, although what the previous speaker says is happening in her electorate bears no relationship to what is happening in any other part of Australia that I know of.
I have an electorate that is made up of three regions: huge tracts of broadacre public housing, middle-class Australia, and rural and remote regional parts of Tasmania. Each of those has specific needs. In the census statistics that are out there for everybody to see today, each of those regions can compare and contrast what they have and have not got, see where the deficiencies and needs are and see where resources need to be placed. When we come to these appropriation bills, it is incumbent upon all of us to have a realistic look at what this budget means for each and every one of us. I am a hopeless budgeter—always have been. I have always spent more than I have earned. I have been lucky enough in my few years on this earth to realise that life presents you with a hell of a lot of opportunities and, if you do not grab them with both hands and hang on to them as tightly as you can, you are never going to get another chance to enjoy what is coming along. 
But a lot of Australians are not in the situation where they can grab these opportunities. Constantly in my electorate office I come across families that are really doing it hard. If you listen to some people in this place, you hear about how wonderful Australia is—a booming economy, wanting for nothing, with average weekly earnings of $X, with things being great. I can tell you that there are lots and lots of families in my electorate that are doing it really tough. You see them on Friday night at the supermarkets just before closing time carefully going through their budgetary strategies to see which bits of the chicken packages, which bits of the roast and which bits of bread are going to be marked down. In this day and age I find it hard to believe that in our Australian society we have families doing it so hard.
As I said, my electorate is probably no different from most electorates, apart from some in Sydney or Melbourne where there is money aplenty and you do not really worry about where it is coming from. When you are framing a budget, you need to be mindful of the good times and the bad, and of Australian society in general. Access to excellence in education, medical services, aged care facilities, adequate housing options, relevant child-care facilities, crisis accommodation for families really doing it tough, assistance for veterans and war widows—all these things are in the budget. When you look at the numbers and you listen to ministers espousing the virtues of their departmental strategies, you would think that everything is fine, but once you scratch the surface it is not.
You hear of the First Home Owners Scheme, the $7,000. There are young families in my electorate who love this First Home Owners Scheme. This was their one opportunity to grab a house. They went along to the bank and said, `Yes, we've got the $7,000; we have managed to scrimp and save a few thousand dollars to pay the various bills that you need to pay, for the stamp duty and for the lawyers to do all the bits and pieces.' Then they find that they cannot really buy the $60,000 house in the broadacre public housing areas that are now being sold by the housing department: they need a 10 per cent deposit because the mortgage insurers will not accept five per cent. If you go up the road to the town of Brighton, where the houses cost $120,000, you need only a five per cent deposit, so why not double your debt? People say, `We can get you into the house.' Things should be different. You should be able to buy the house that you can afford to repay, rather than doubling your debt and putting yourself under further strain. One of the statistics today is the increase in the divorce rate, and I am firmly convinced that the stress of money is one of the key contributors to the rise of the divorce rate since I was a child.
We hear lots in this place, as I said, about security threats to Australia. We hear of the wonderful role of the Americans. I have quite a few American cousins. My late Aunt May was an American war bride. My brother married an Irish-American girl from the east coast, and they have four American-Australian kids. I take the mickey out of them and tease them dreadfully about how the Yanks were not in the First World War until it was all over, how it was two years into the Second World War before they came and how they were hopeless in Vietnam. It really worries me that we are focusing on this supposed threat. We put our hand over our heart and, unfortunately, follow George W., and it really worries me. I grew up in the 1940s and early 1950s. As a child I remember being propagandised with stuff that was trotted out every Saturday afternoon in the movie theatres. 
As some speakers have said in this place, I think we need to focus on the basics. Our communities are not communities. We all have our security doors. We do not know who our neighbours are. We tend to be isolated and fragmented. Yet, when it comes to an outside threat, we are all together, all on side and all supportive. I would like to think that we can become reflective and introverted in the nicest sense, back into the communities that I remember as a child. People say that they are probably the dreams of a baby boomer, but in fact I was born before the baby boomers. Governments do have a responsibility. We as legislators have a responsibility. It is an awesome responsibility. It is incumbent upon us, as people have said in this place, to share the responsibility rather than to nitpick, blame each other and say, for example, `Back when interest rates were X-plus ...' I well remember, when I was putting an addition on my house, how hard it was.
Let us stop blaming and start creating. Let us start supporting our communities, supporting the families that shop on Friday nights because that is the only way they can survive, supporting the families that are making their first commitment to a home, supporting kids when they are underachieving at school, supporting sole parent families and supporting widows who are left in large houses, with large front and back yards, who are not coping and who do not want to go into nursing homes. Let us think creatively. We do have that capacity, but we—the Commonwealth government, state governments and local governments—need to work together. I support lots of the measures in this budget. I do not want nitpick and particularise, but we need to really have a vision. I have a vision for my children. I hope that when I leave this place I can spend the next 25 years contributing to that vision. I know my children do. I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—It gives me great pleasure to rise this evening in the Main Committee to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 and to outline the significant benefits that flow as a result of this government's strong fiscal policy and strong management of the economy. This budget is another in the long line of Howard government budgets that have focused on getting the fundamentals right. It is a budget that is built upon the platform of keeping our economy strong, our borders secure and our nation safe. It is a budget that, thanks to the Howard government, has seen Australia continue to move forward, safe from the economic turmoil that has been experienced around the world. This budget, Peter Costello and the Howard government's seventh budget, is one that will ensure Australia weathers the economic storm. As a result of this government getting the economic fundamentals right, we have succeeded in ensuring the Australian people have not suffered the turmoil that arose as a result of the Asian economic downturn. Australia has also withstood the storm resulting from the attacks on the mainland of the United States on September 11 last year. The Howard government is committed to ensuring the fundamentals are right, and it has done this by repaying approximately $62 billion of the Labor Party's $90 billion black hole. 
Previous opposition speakers have made comment that we need to be mindful of the good times and the bad. This is a budget that does exactly that: it is not a budget built on short-term economic sunshine, nor is it a budget that offers a knee-jerk reaction to short-term economic decline; it is a budget that is in Australia's best interests in the long term and it is a budget that, as I have said, has seen Australia weather economic turmoil throughout the world.
This week's Economist magazine noted as part of its economic and financial indicators table that `Australia's GDP rose by 4.2 per cent in the year to the first quarter, by far the biggest increase of any country in our table'. We have seen Australia surge forward with economic growth of 4.2 per cent. Let us compare and contrast that growth with that of other developed countries around the world. Opposition members like to compare Australia with Third World and developing nations, but I will compare apples with apples—I will compare us to those other developed countries around the world. Canada has had economic growth of 2.1 per cent; France, 0.3 per cent; Japan, minus 1.9 per cent; Switzerland, 0.2 per cent; the United States—the economic powerhouse of the world—has had economic growth of only 1.5 per cent; and the entire European area has had economic growth over the past year of only 0.1 per cent. We see that Australia is surging ahead. We are surging ahead because this budget, like all previous Howard government budgets, is solidly built on a platform of getting the economic fundamentals right. It is not a budget that seeks to take advantage of political opportunism. It is not a budget that seeks to ensure that we creep our way back into office by only looking after certain sectoral interests; it is a budget for all Australians. It is a budget, as I said, that keeps our economy strong, our borders safe and our nation secure.
When you look forward, however, you also see that Australia does not suddenly fall away. This budget will, according to the Economist magazine, continue to hold Australia in very good stead. The Economist poll predict four per cent growth for Australia in 2002. Again, let us compare that with other developed countries: Canada, only 2.9 per cent growth; France, 1.4 per cent growth; Germany, 0.9 per cent growth; Italy, 1.3 per cent; Japan, still languishing at minus 0.8 per cent; and the United States, 2.9 per cent. The same applies in the following year in the Economist forecast for 2003, where Australia is again ranked No. 1 at 3.9 per cent growth. It is very safe for the Australian people to place their faith in the Howard government. We have delivered time and time again, and this budget has once again scored a goal.
One of the key government initiatives that was handed down under this budget was the additional $194 million for the war against terrorism. I find it interesting that opposition members refer to a `supposed threat'. The member for Franklin, who spoke immediately prior to me, mentioned a so-called supposed threat, about how he had been `propagandised' throughout the sixties. He spoke of how the United States appeared, in his words, `to be an abject failure when it came to previous wartime experience'. I am intrigued by this notion of a `supposed threat'. Apparently it is only a `supposed threat' that terrorists would seek to murder nearly 50,000 people in the World Trade Centre. They were only successful in murdering 3,000. I find it incredible that it is only a `supposed threat' when now on almost a weekly basis we see attempts by terrorist groups throughout the world—for example, an attempt to place a shoe bomb on board a flight from Europe to the United States. These `supposed threats' seem to me to be anything but `supposed'. They seem to me to be very real threats and threats that go to the very heart of democracy and what it means to live in a free country. If we relent, if we move away from maintaining the defence that we have against these people who would seek to make us live in fear, who would seek to make us question the very lives and freedoms that we have, then we most certainly have lost. I am very proud to be part of a government that is playing its role in protecting the democratic ideals that Australia has embodied for over a century. 
In addition to the $194 million for the war against terrorism, the Howard government has also provided $1.3 billion to upgrade domestic security over the next five years. This has involved additional spending in terms of aviation security. We have seen the introduction of the air marshal system at a cost of $40.2 million for the financial year 2002-03, rising to $169 million over the next five years. The air marshal program is a very tangible way in which the Australian government is helping Australians to feel safe when they take to the skies. It is also helping the Australian tourism industry to weather the terrorism storm—and I will speak on this further. With regard to domestic security, we also have provided additional funding of $110.9 million for the financial year 2002-03 to assist agencies such as ASIO, the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority to access additional investigative technology—the kind of technology that will ensure we have success, as we have had in the past, in defeating those who would seek to threaten our democratic way of life.
We also have, as a result of an additional $113.7 million of funding, an increased response capacity. This will directly assist Health and Ageing to build and develop a stockpile of biological weapons vaccines and antidotes. It will also mean that we have an incident response regiment and a second counter-terrorism tactical assault group. Again, these are very tangible measures that the Howard government is taking to ensure the Australian people feel safe and secure in our way of life and know that our country will not fall victim—or will certainly have an extremely low chance of falling victim—to the kinds of base terrorist attacks that we have seen in other countries. I can honestly say from my discussions with constituents and from my own perspective, I would never want Australia to become a country that lives in fear like countries such as Israel, the United Kingdom and now the United States. Many Australians would like to believe this will never happen in this country. But it can. The way for us to prevent these attacks is to be vigilant.
This budget also provides funding of $1.6 billion for border security. As a result of this funding, we will succeed in maintaining Australia's borders. This budget provides an increase of $22.3 million for coastal surveillance. It also provides for the construction of a $21 million facility on Christmas Island to ensure that those who would seek to queue-jump, those who would seek to undermine the very equitable nature of our refugee program, will not succeed. These direct measures will ensure the Australian people can continue to offer all people around the world safety and harbour on an ongoing basis in an equitable way. We will not allow those who seek to bypass the integrity of our system to go through other countries such as Indonesia and then jump on board a boat and come to Australia.
I will turn now to some very direct ways this budget will benefit the people of the Gold Coast and in the electorate of Moncrieff. This budget goes to the core of assisting a region like the Gold Coast, principally through increased spending being provided to the tourism industry. It is fair to say the Howard government and the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, the Hon. Joe Hockey, are providing a direct impetus for the tourism industry and safeguarding the future of the industry in trying times. Tourism benefits to a significant extent as a result of some $50 million additional spending. Key initiatives such as $24 million of additional funding for the Australian Tourist Commission, an additional $8 million for the See Australia program and an additional $8 million for the regional tourism program are of direct benefit. 
Fundamentally, however, tourism benefits because Australia will once again be regarded as a safe destination. One of the key results of the attacks on the mainland United States was a loss of confidence among tourists. The Australian tourism industry, an industry that accounts for some 30 per cent of my local economy on the Gold Coast, suffered as a result of this downturn in the willingness of people to travel abroad. Now, because we have secured our country and secured our borders, people feel safe travelling to the Gold Coast. And safety is one of the principal drivers of a healthy and vibrant tourism industry.
In addition to assisting the tourism industry, the Howard government's budget extended the PELS to Bond University students. Bond University, Australia's most successful private university, is based on the Gold Coast. Those opposite—not all those opposite, but certainly some—are opposed to the very notion of private tertiary funding. Little wonder, then, that Bond University would never stand a chance of succeeding as a private tertiary education model if those opposite were in government. In contrast, this government has looked after and directly assisted institutions such as Bond University through the extension of the PELS to postgraduate students.
Likewise, additional funding has been provided for the Gold Coast film industry and for the film industry broadly. The Gold Coast film industry is a fledgling industry that really benefits as a result of this government's film industry package. Although not announced as part of this budget, it is one of several measures the Howard government introduced. Since its introduction, the Gold Coast has attracted big budget feature productions. The direct benefit of these movies is a significant increase in employment for those who work directly on the film set and indirectly in areas such as special effects production and post production.
In the time remaining, I urge all members to consider the benefits of this budget. I would also make some brief comments on those opposition members who seek to reject this government's initiatives in the Senate. I cannot help but think that the opposition to changes to eligibility for the disability support pension and the increase in the copayment under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme reek of political opportunism. It is absurd that those opposite say this government is being mean and tricky because we seek to decrease the number of hours for those on disability support pensions from 30 hours to 15 hours. How can the opposition rationally argue that 30 hours is the acceptable level to set the threshold? At present if you are capable of working 31 hours, that is bad luck. If you are capable of working 29 hours, good on you, you are eligible for the disability support pension. We have now lowered the threshold to 15 hours, and all of a sudden the arbitrariness of the threshold does not mean anything anymore. The opposition attempts to portray this government as being mean and tricky. I urge support for this budget.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2002-06-17," asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 13 February 2002:
(1)	Has his attention been drawn to a presentation by the Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA), Professor David Flint, launching the ABA research report Sources of News and Current Affairs, 3 May 2001 and titled “How news is made in Australia” in which Prof Flint called for the relaxation of Australia's cross media ownership laws.
(2)	Has his attention also been drawn to Prof Flint's conclusion that the greatest influence on the media is not the media owners but the journalists, themselves, who are the most influential factor in the making of news; if so, does he concur with this view.
(3)	Do Australia's cross media ownership laws need to be changed along the lines Prof Flint has suggested; if so, why.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Media: Cross-media Ownership Rules</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,16,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2002-06-17,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1)	and (2) I understand Professor Flint indicated that he was providing a personal viewpoint and was not speaking in his capacity as Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Authority.
(3)	On 21 March 2002, the government introduced the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002. The Bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the Act) to empower the Australian Broadcasting Authority to grant `exemption certificates' to applicants seeking to acquire media organisations that would otherwise represent a breach of the cross-media rules.
Exemptions will be subject to applicants meeting requirements to maintain separate editorial decision-making responsibilities. Regional broadcasters subject to an exemption certificate will be required to meet prescribed minimum levels of locally relevant news and information services, or maintain existing levels where those are higher.
The Bill repeals the media-specific foreign ownership provisions in the Act which apply to both free-to-air and pay television. The government has also committed to discontinuing newspaper specific foreign ownership limits within its foreign investment policy.
