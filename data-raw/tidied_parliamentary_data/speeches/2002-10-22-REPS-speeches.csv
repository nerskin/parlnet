"Howard, John, MP",LP,2002-10-22,"—Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.
—The Prime Minister may proceed.
—At the beginning of question time, the member for Cowan asked me a question about travel arrangements for relatives of apparently deceased Australians coming to the memorial service on Thursday. I have been informed that before question time—indeed, as early as last Friday—approaches were made by my department to the airlines to establish whether there would be any difficulties regarding ticket availability and also cost. They were informed that there would be none. All carriers were contacted. As a result of the question raised by the member, my department is again contacting the carriers to see if there is a difficulty. Could I ask the honourable gentleman, if he is aware of specific cases, to let my office know and we will see what we can do about it. My information is that as early as last Friday contact was made with the airlines in anticipation that there might be a difficulty, and we were told, on the basis of that inquiry, that there would be none.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Memorial Service: Victims of Terrorist Attacks in Indonesia</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1
"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2002-10-22,"—I am very pleased to open the debate on this matter of public importance on the valuable contribution that Australia's 2.3 million carers make to the community by looking after those with a disability, mental illness or chronic condition, or those who are frail and aged. Caring for people with disabilities and the sick and the frail is one of the most essential tasks undertaken by millions of Australian every day. The `unsung hero' tag might be clichéd in most circumstances, but when it comes to carers that tag is absolutely justified. This week is national Carers Week, and it gives us a particularly good opportunity to give some well-deserved recognition to carers, who devote so much of their time and energy to family members and to friends.
There are more than 2.3 million carers in Australia. In fact, there could be many more than 2.3 million, given that many carers remain hidden from view. This is particularly the case with young carers. It is astonishing to learn that 17 per cent of carers in Australia are under the age of 26—that is 380,000 young Australians whose freedom and opportunities in life are curtailed by the larger responsibility of caring for a parent or another family member. We also need to keep in mind people who are carers who do not actually see themselves as carers; in many cases their role does not register in the community's mind.
Carers make an extraordinary contribution. They save governments around $16 billion each year. Compare that with the $80 million in new funding over four years that the Howard government announced in this year's budget and you will understand what a good deal the government is actually getting. But the work performed by carers cannot be valued in monetary terms alone. The army of carers across Australia allows people to remain in their own communities, often within their own homes, despite their frailty or their high care needs or the circumstances of the family unit. Carers deserve a huge vote of thanks, but Labor wants to use this week to remind all Australians and the government in particular that thanking carers is not enough.
Carers need access to a range of reliable, high-quality support services for themselves and for the person in their care. Unfortunately, the situation for carers I believe has only worsened during the six years of the current government. If we look at the situation of people with disabilities, there is no doubt about the scale of the problem. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare released a report recently on unmet demand for disability services. The report found that, in 2001, 12,500 people with disabilities could not get accommodation or respite services; community access services were running short by 8,200 places; and 5,400 people with disabilities could not get any support to find a job.
Once you understand the scale of the problem, it is impossible not to be shocked by the Howard government's performance in current negotiations on the new Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement. The CSTDA is a vitally important agreement. It will have a critical impact on people with disabilities and their families and carers. That is why so many carers and supporters of people with disabilities are mobilising to tell the Howard government why they are so concerned about their performance in this area. 
We received a letter only a few weeks ago from the Unmet Needs Campaign Committee, which represents a number of very well respected, dedicated organisations, including Carers Australia, the Autism Council of Australia, the National Council on Intellectual Disability, the Australian Cerebral Palsy Association, the Disability Council of Queensland and many other Queensland based organisations. The people running the Unmet Needs Campaign put things into their proper perspective. They have examined current Commonwealth, state and territory spending on disability services and they say this:
What is clear from these statistics is that the States are bearing the majority of the costs for the CSTDA. Whether this is right, fair or reasonable is a matter for Governments to sort out. However, it is clear that more needs to be done and the onus would seem to be on the Commonwealth to lift its funding contribution.
The Unmet Needs Campaign also points out that:
... in the lead up to the new CSTDA, there appears to be no specific commitment from the Commonwealth to even discuss, let alone fund, unmet demand—despite the latest research from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.
What that report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows is that, in order to address the backlog of unmet need for disability services, governments in Australia need to spend more than $400 million per annum. The CEO of ACROD, Dr Ken Baker, actually puts the figure close to $500 million per annum. So the message to the Howard government from the carers and from people with disabilities and their families and supporters is really quite simple: keep the politics out of it and make a commitment to decent funding levels for disability services in cooperation with the states and territories—because, for as long as unmet need remains at its current staggering level, the family and friends of people with disabilities will have to step into the breach. Caring for someone with high-level needs should be a matter of choice and in fact not the only option.
The whole point of the CSTDA process, which Labor actually established back in the early nineties, is for the Commonwealth, state and territory governments to leave politics at the door, to sit down to negotiate in good faith and to produce a funding outcome which meets the needs of people with disabilities. I find it interesting and I in fact commend the Prime Minister for the comment he made just a few moments ago in question time when he said that people are fed up with federal, state and territory governments slagging off at each other, arguing over money and blame. Maybe he should talk to his own ministers about that as well.
Just in case anyone in this chamber needs reminding, I will emphasise that the services funded by the CSTDA are not a privilege, and the people pushing for a good outcome are not making ambit claims. They simply need help to keep up with the rest of us. If we do not provide those services, then we leave these people behind. Unfortunately, the Minister for Family and Community Services has been going to extraordinary lengths to whip up conflict with the states and territories and to deflect attention from the Howard government's own responsibilities. The minister made her intentions clear when she announced earlier this year that, unless Labor supported her cuts to the disability support pension in the current parliament, she would withhold the Commonwealth's money from the new national disability agreement.
I am pleased to say that that tactic failed, because we will not respond to that sort of threat. But having failed in her attempt to hold the Labor Party to ransom, the minister has now turned her attention to the state and territory governments. The minister has now spent several months making vitriolic attacks on those states and territories. She has continually refused to negotiate with her state and territory colleagues unless they provide signed letters from their premiers and chief ministers containing a detailed breakdown of their spending plans for the next five years. I do not know what you think, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I do not call that negotiation. It is a stunt by the minister, and a very disappointing one at that, particularly when you consider that the Commonwealth's offer on the table and about which the minister boasts is a measly $125 million over five years, with $15 million alone being available in that first year. So the $1.2 billion funding announcement by the state and territory governments last Friday really does place the onus squarely on the minister to return to the negotiating table and finalise the new disability agreement before the deadline of 31 October. Leadership from the Commonwealth in genuine cooperation with the states and territories is essential to delivering good outcomes to people with disabilities. 
Unfortunately, the situation is no better for older Australians. They might have a less abrasive minister, but they still have to deal with the Howard government. This is a government which has produced a shortage of 12,321 nursing home beds. Many of those beds could be used for respite care to give carers a break and to provide more options for older people. Instead it is the carers who have to pick up that slack. The government's so-called reforms of the aged care sector in 1997 have made life horribly difficult for nursing homes and have drawn funds away from the construction of badly needed new beds. Nursing homes are also employing registered nurses just to fill in paperwork, such is the tangle of red tape in the sector. At the last count, the Minister for Ageing was overseeing six separate reviews of the Howard government's aged care reforms—six reviews only five years after the reforms were unveiled. I wonder whether those reviews will also fully disclose the extent of the damage inflicted by the Howard government on the aged care sector.
Professional aged care in the home is another key issue. This requires adequate resources from government and high quality services. If people really are to remain in their own homes for good or until well into old age, then we need to get that system right. For the vast majority of Australians, the quality of care is a fundamental issue. Quality of care, access and cost determine whether people will entrust their ageing relatives to the care of others or choose to take on that role themselves. But they must have a genuine choice.
What is the government doing in national Carers Week to turn around the situation of carers? At least one of its Centrelink offices—in Tasmania, I believe—is giving a free massage voucher to the carers of frail aged people. I for one am not going to knock that. It is said that, with gifts, it is often the thought that counts. But, in this case, not much thought is really evident at all. Governments have a huge impact on the lives of their citizens, especially those citizens who need extra help with day-to-day living, whether they be old, frail or living with disability or chronic illness. Mr Howard and his colleagues will continue to fail Australia's carers and their loved ones for as long as they fail to address the issues that we raise here today.
I would say, in concluding, that I know all members of this House on all sides will want to pay tribute to Australia's carers and, in my case and that of my colleagues', to assure them that they are held in very high esteem; we will keep working to make life easier for them and for the people in their care, whenever and however we can. It is a pleasure to speak to this MPI on the occasion of national Carers Week. I would like to think that, when we do so again next year, the plight of carers in this country will have improved dramatically.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health: Carers </title>,Matters of Public Importance,10,1
"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2002-10-22,"—I join with the shadow minister for ageing and seniors, the member for Canberra, in expressing our support for carers in this country. I do so particularly as this week is not only Carers Week but also a week of such tragic events in Bali and in the associated light of which I believe the contributions of carers, family and friends, and others more generally, have been seen—indeed, a heroic light. This is a time at which we must try to offer comfort, care and hope to the bereaved friends, lovers and relatives of those who were killed in that tragedy. In different ways, different individuals, in different communities across our country, will end up as carers of the Bali terrorist attack survivors. In my opinion, these unfolding stories of continual care will be as poignant as the stories of people assisting the survivors at enormous risk to themselves, because they are stories of dedication, companionship and commitment.
As indicated by the previous speaker, there are some 2.3 million people involved in the informal care of children, adults and older persons with disability and with chronic and terminal conditions in this country. It is estimated that some 19 per cent of these people, almost half a million, of all carers are primary carers. They are the ones who provide the most informal assistance with personal activities to people needing help because of disability, chronic illness or ageing and, therefore, caring plays a major part in their lives. Some 70 per cent of primary carers are female, and almost 80 per cent of primary carers care for someone living in the same household. Indeed, primary carers provide care mostly for a partner, in about 43 per cent of cases; for a child in about 25 per cent of cases; and for a parent in about 21 per cent of cases.
I had the opportunity last evening to meet with a number of carers here in the ACT at a special function at Government House to recognise and support carers. In recogising and supporting carers, there are two or three things which I believe are important. One is to recognise and affirm them in what they are doing. As many people said to me last night when I was moving amongst them—and I have heard this remark on other occasions— people are not necessarily looking for further assistance, although there are cases where that is obviously required; but often people who are voluntarily caring for their loved ones would like, I suppose as we would all like in relation to such efforts, to be recognised, affirmed and encouraged in what they do.
Last week at the annual conference of the Incontinence Foundation of Australia, the Carer of the Year award was announced and presented to Belinda Mayne. Mrs Mayne cares for her husband, Ross, with the assistance of her young daughter, India, who incidentally is also a member of the Young Carers Association. This is just one of the many cases where people are making enormous efforts on behalf of family members. Ross, in his early sixties, suffers from Alzheimer's disease, having been diagnosed some six years ago, and requires full body care. To listen to Belinda Mayne, after she was presented with this award, talk about the great rewards she felt from the opportunity of being able to care for her husband in these circumstances was, indeed, quite moving. She said words to the effect that every day she gets something from Ross, for whom she cares in these circumstances. This is just one example, as we all know, of thousands, indeed hundreds of thousands, of Australians doing something similar.
I recall my own parents-in-law who, until he died at almost 50, cared for their disabled son at home almost right throughout their lives. I think people in these circumstances are indeed doing something heroic. The roles of such people involve managing medications, therapies and medical emergencies, and providing supervision and emotional support. Caring, in these circumstances, provides considerable satisfaction to people and it also strengthens relationships. However we know that carers also can often feel exhausted, isolated and burdened by their responsibilities.
That brings us to the second thing which carers desire—and, in a sense, we all owe them—in addition to recognition, encouragement and affirmation, and that is support which is appropriate for their needs when they require it. In that regard, there is a whole range of programs which the government has in operation to provide this additional support for carers. Primarily there are direct payments that are made to carers—the carer payment and the carer allowance. There are approximately 67,000 carers currently receiving the carer payment and approximately 270,000 carers currently receiving the carer allowance. Both of these payments—the carer payment and the carer allowance—have increased in value by about 40 per cent since June 2000.
In addition to these direct payments, the Commonwealth government also provides a range of other services to support carers. These provide information to carers about community services, respite, counselling and possible financial entitlements. In addition to that, funding is provided to the states through the Commonwealth, state and territory disability agreement. There has been an allocation by the minister responsible, Senator Vanstone, of $4.8 billion for the third agreement, to run from 2002 until 2007. Of this, $2.8 billion will go to the states and territories to assist them with their responsibilities. This includes an additional $125 million over five years to address unmet need.
The figures quoted about disability assistance by the honourable member for Canberra are a reflection, in one regard, on the states themselves. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found in its report that there was a shortfall by the states and the territories with about 12,500 people needing accommodation and respite services. This points out quite clearly, in relation to these services which the states and territories have not funded, the concern that there should be better accountability and transparency of the state and territory administration of this program. This is something that Senator Vanstone has been calling for and continues to call for in relation to the current negotiations under this matter.
In addition to that additional unmet needs funding, through my own portfolio in the 2002-03 aged care innovative pool there will be some 550 additional flexible care places made available for innovative care approaches. One of the criteria for the innovative pool places this year is in relation to disabilities and aged people with disabilities. To care for people in this situation, I announced just last week that there would be a further $3.6 million funding boost for respite services, particularly for respite services in rural and remote areas of Australia under the National Respite for Carers Program and we are calling for new applications. I remind members of the House that this additional funding is available under that program for services in their own electorate, particularly those members from rural and remote areas.
In this year's budget, there was also an additional $80 million over four years provided to carers, and this comes in three major packages. The first is $20 million in additional support for carers of people with dementia, including further assistance with the cost of residential respite and expansion of the coverage of the psychogeriatric care units to provide full national coverage in this regard. The second is $30 million to provide support for ageing carers of people with disabilities, including a pilot program to establish and train a network of specialist volunteer carers, additional assistance with respite care and targeted financial assistance for costs incurred by carers in their carer role. And the third is another $30 million to provide more support for all carers, including the expansion of respite services, provision of emotional and psychological support across the caring experience and provision for assistance with carer costs.
These budget measures build on an already substantial record and on growing levels of help for carers from this government. For example, the Commonwealth funding for the National Respite for Carers Program has more than quadrupled since its commencement in 1996-97. It has risen from $19 million to an estimated $88 million in this current financial year. This program provides: a national network of more than 90 Commonwealth carer respite centre outlets to help carers find the respite care they need; brokerage funds for Commonwealth carer respite centres to purchase short-term and emergency respite for carers where mainstream respite services are unable to help; a Commonwealth carer resource centre in each state and territory to provide carers with information, advice and other support; over 400 specialist respite services to assist carers, including over 100 services which target carers of people with dementia; and three projects that focus on helping carers of people with dementia.
In addition, the Commonwealth government funds a range of programs which either wholly or partly also help carers. These include about one million days of residential respite care in Commonwealth subsidised age care homes worth about $78 million a year with about 45,000 respite admissions annually and the Home and Community Care package, which provides for a wide range of community services to help the frail aged, people with disabilities and their carers. In fact, this is the most popular and the most used of all aged care programs that the Commonwealth funds, in this case funds cooperatively with the states. I am informed that on any one working day there are approximately 320,000 people in receipt of Home and Community Care services, such as Meals on Wheels and modification of housing to enable people to move about more appropriately than they would have otherwise been able to. And, over the course of the year, somewhere in the order of 390,000 Australians are in receipt of Home and Community Care funding. So this is a substantial contribution to those people who are caring for others and in some cases people who are living alone and caring for themselves.
There is additional support, particularly through Aged Care, for dementia, and there are increases in other programs as well. There has also been an increase in terms of the aged care assessment teams, with approximately 180,000 assessments each year, allowing progressively more people to gain the support services they need to remain in their own homes. In the 2001 aged care approvals round, there were 1,700 community aged care packages. These packages do something very important. Most people wish to stay in their own homes as long as they possibly can and, where that is appropriate, the government seeks to support that aspiration of those people. The Community Aged Care Package and the Home and Community Care program are both programs which help people to stay in their own homes. Indeed, since we came to government there has been a substantial increase in the number of community aged care packages. There are now over 26,000 of these community aged care packages delivering services to people in their own homes. In this year's budget, there is additional funding earmarked to create over the next four years another 6,000 of these places. Since the coalition government came to office in 1996, over 49,000 aged care places have been released to meet the care needs of older Australians. There are now over 170,000 operational aged care places throughout Australia. This is against a background, when we came to government, of there being a 10,000 shortfall in aged care places; a shortfall which we inherited from the previous Labor government. In May this year, I released 8,231 new aged care places to be distributed across Australia to meet the needs of older Australians, and we are on track to meet our objective of 200,000 aged care places across Australia by 2006.
All in all, this is a significant contribution by the Commonwealth to the work of carers. We acknowledge, however, that carers undertake a major task and that without carers many people would not have the quality and standard of life which they enjoy. It is incumbent upon government at all levels— whether Commonwealth, state or local government—to support people in these ways. I hope what I have outlined to the House this afternoon is an indication of the way in which the Commonwealth has sought to work in partnership with organisations within the community, with agencies and with individuals carers themselves to add to the wellbeing and the welfare of these people.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health: Carers </title>,Matters of Public Importance,10,1
"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2002-10-22,"—I am very happy to be given this opportunity to speak to this matter of public importance. National Carers Week is a time when we honour, recognise and celebrate the overwhelming care and devotion that 2.3 million Australians give to their loved ones who may be disabled, mentally ill, chronically infirm or frail and aged. It is an important sign that our community as a whole not only values their gift of service but also recognises that they are extraordinary people who make enormous personal sacrifices in caring for dependent loved ones and should be treated with admiration and respect. These are, as the member for Canberra said, our unsung heroes. Every community is blessed with their care, including my own community of Calwell where we have a staggering number of people—8,379—on disability support pension, including a great number of elderly people who are living at home in the care of their families.
Carers are the ones who, in addition to conducting the business of their own lives, must also tend to the needs of those who become dependent on them. A typical day in the life of a carer will involve great physical and emotional strain, their tasks often made more difficult because being a carer means around the clock duty of care. As a result, they are often forced to leave their employment in order to concentrate on the needs of a loved one. This results in inadequate earnings, so they are also the ones most likely to be socially and financially disadvantaged. In fact, 33,000 carers report that they have given up work, 61,700 report reduced income and 100,000 report difficulty meeting living expenses. They are also the ones who pick up the pieces that, more often than not, government service deliverers fail to address. Australian carers are doing it tough, but I am also inspired by their dedication and by their great sense of hope in the face of constant adversity. We are all inspired by their courage and even their sense of humour. We are inspired by their great sense of loyalty and devotion and are reminded that these are the qualities that best illustrate our humanity at work. These are the qualities that form the backbone of our community and that probably have been responsible for the coining of the phrase so often quoted:
The sign of a civilised society is the manner in which it cares for its weakest and most vulnerable.
It is these qualities of care and courage that have been displayed by countless Australians this week as many take on the role of carers, in some form or another, of the victims of Bali, and it is these qualities that we have come to collectively celebrate—coincidentally, also this week—as we mark National Carers Week.
By acknowledging the valuable work that carers provide we give them a sense of personal worth, because we all need to be praised. Praising their efforts gives people much needed courage to carry on. Many times I have heard people say, `I can't go on. Some days I think I'm just not going to make it through the day.' Often after they have uttered these feelings—which are perfectly normal, by the way—they are overcome by guilt, and say, `But I won't abandon them into the care of someone else. I owe them that.' They also say things like, `They are my child'—or parent or spouse or sibling—`I have a responsibility to them.' In fact, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to a very dear friend of mine Pam Christoforidis, whose husband, Con, suffered a major stroke some years ago. This vibrant, active man I had known for so long was reduced to a pale imitation of his former self. Unable to recognise people and unable to move his arms or to speak, his prospects for survival were bleak, but Pam was determined that he would not only live but also walk and speak again.
Pam is a fighter. When doctors advised her very strongly that she should put Con into a nursing home, her first reaction was to refuse. This was her husband; he was her responsibility and she was going to look after him. Eventually she agreed, and only because she was convinced by the very practical argument that she did not have the appropriate equipment at home that Con would require to aid his recovery. Even so, Pam had her own idea of what it means to send your loved one into the care of a nursing home: you move in with them. Naturally, this is not an administratively correct thing to do, but Pam did it. She convinced everyone that she was integral to Con's recovery. For 10 months, Pam slept on a mattress on the floor beside Con. She was there when he woke up; she was there when he went to sleep. She cared for him every minute of the day, and eventually he did regain some movement and some speech and was able to go home.
Perhaps as a justification for her determination, she said to me, `He is a good man. He has been a good provider for our family and I will not let him down.' Sadly, Con passed away a few months ago; but his family did care for him, and he knew that, right till the very end. These incidents form the basis of the daily angst experienced by carers across the country and also describe their daily routines. By celebrating Carers Week we are telling all these wonderful people: `It is okay, you're doing a great job. If there's anything we can do to help then we are there for you.'
I imagine that there are a lot of things that governments can do to help carers and to make their lives more comfortable. We do provide assistance, but there is always more that we can do. I would like to take this opportunity to also remind the parliament that we have not adequately discharged our obligation to Australia's 2.3 million carers and we should be mindful of that when we are setting policy agendas and prioritising budgets.
I would also like to pay tribute to an organisation I have known for over a decade, known as AGAPI. `Agapi' is the Greek word for love and, as you can see, it is appropriately named. It was formed by a small group of Greek-speaking parents from the northern suburbs of Melbourne who have children with various mental and physical disabilities. They wanted to provide some respite for their families. They felt that there was a serious shortage of respite services available to meet their needs and demands, particularly in the area of ethno-specific services. Today AGAPI is a successful organisation that provides much-welcomed support and respite for Greek-speaking families across Melbourne. Their hard work, their endless fundraising and their dogged persistence in lobbying for their cause—and that included lobbying me in my capacity as a local government councillor at the time and as a political staffer with connections to state and federal governments and agencies—deserve mention and commendation in this parliament.
I want to pay tribute to my constituent and dynamo extraordinaire Mrs Betty Moore, also a full-time carer and activist. For many years she has been on the management committee of Brite Industries, a supported employment provider in my electorate of Calwell. Many carers end up becoming activists as they see a need to fight for their rights and needs. This adds more burdens to their already overburdened life, but they feel an obligation to advocate on behalf of those who are not able to speak for themselves. And what a good thing that is, otherwise how else would we all be kept on the ball and in touch? Betty burst into my office one day and asked me if I realised just how much money she and other carers were saving governments. Their caring meant that less had to be spent on the cost of full-time nursing in aged care facilities and hospitals.
Betty has many ideas about how we can make her life, and the lives of other carers, much easier. She is concerned about the burden of red tape, especially where Centrelink is concerned. She tells me that the payments she and others get are so small that often it is not worth the embarrassment and guilt you might feel asking for these payments in the first place. I understand that many carers become stressed because the constant reviewing of their circumstances to ensure and prove that the person they are caring for is still in need can be an undignified experience. There are many other complaints, but I am sure that we are all more than happy to hear from wonderful people like Betty Moore. I would like to say to Betty: go get them Betty, even if it means giving me and others a hard time in the process.
I would like to take this opportunity to not only celebrate Carers Week but also contemplate how best we can take their concerns on board and make changes and adjustments to give them the respect and support they deserve. Let us not praise them on the one hand but make life difficult for them on the other.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health: Carers </title>,Matters of Public Importance,10,1
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2002-10-22,"—From the outset, I congratulate the member for Calwell for her motion, for her genuine contribution to the recognition of carers and for the gentle reminders she provided as to how all governments can act to make the lives of carers much more dignified. I am also disappointed that the member for Canberra has used the recognition of Carers Week to distort the facts and offer political rhetoric here on such an important occasion. Yes, all carers do deserve gold: they deserve a gold purse; they deserve a gold medal. There would not be enough gold in Australia to compensate our carers. Just imagine what a world we would be living in if we did not have the tireless work of carers, who dedicate so much of their time to loving and caring for a family member or friend.
Caring also has many rewards, like the many milestones in a loved one's life: the first step, the first word or the first movement of a child with cerebral palsy; or a loved one's breakthrough in the battle against cancer. However, a carer's life is also fraught with difficulty. Carers are not just parents; they can be a brother, a sister, a daughter, a grandchild. They are young people who are committed to caring for their mother, brother, sister or father. What wonderful young people they are. They are indeed an asset to our communities. In Australia there are around 388,800 young people under 26 years of age who are carers. Of those young carers, 188,000 are under 18 years of age. Furthermore, 18,800 young people are primary carers, providing the main source of unpaid, informal support for the person whom they support.
Young carers rarely have a choice about fulfilling their role. They often provide care because they are the only ones available. They are most likely to be providing care to their mothers and they are often in a sole parent household. Young carers often spend most of their time thinking about the person they support or undertaking caring tasks. This can involve providing emotional support, assisting with mobility, administering medications, cooking and housework. Often they assist with more intimate tasks such as bathing and dressing, which can be inappropriate in the relationship because of the age of the children.
Young carers' health is at risk from stress, limited sleep and the multiple physical and emotional demands on them. Many young carers report constant feelings of sadness, guilt, anger, fear and worry, and at times that contributes to impaired psycho-social development. Our young carers do not have any spare time. They cannot go to the park and play. They cannot meet their friends after school at the local milk bar. They cannot have outings of an evening. They cannot go to the local dance. They cannot go to sporting events or attend cultural, recreation or leisure activities.
They are likely to have few friends that they can lean on, and they often feel isolated and lonely because theirs is the task of caring. Young carers frequently miss school, and they tend to leave school early without worrying about qualifying to go on to any tertiary education, simply because of their motivation to care. Distracted by worry and duties, young carers often skip homework and they underachieve at school through no fault of their own. Career choices are often put on hold, and it is difficult to obtain and keep employment when the constant concern is for their loved one at home. The choices and opportunities are limited for our young carers, and they are often unable to leave home, gain employment, get financial independence or have intimate relationships in the future.
Currently, our younger carers receive little recognition. They receive little understanding or support from any sector of the community—obviously because there is not a great awareness of our young people's plight in the caring role. There are few programs or services targeting their needs, and they face many barriers to accessing existing services. Above all, our young carers deserve an opportunity to reach their potential through full economic and social participation with peers and in the wider community. 
Each carer's situation is quite unique. Some carers need to assist with the tasks of daily living and spend their days feeding, bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring and doing a whole host of important things to make life of the best quality possible for the person they love. They are there to provide emotional support day in and day out, night in and night out. They are the most vulnerable people in our communities. They at times can be the most isolated people in our communities. They are the carers, but who cares for the carers? That is the task that all communities need to recognise and understand. 
A carer's life may begin not only with the birth of a child with a disability or with a stroke; it can happen suddenly as a result of a motor vehicle accident. Many of our carers have in their families someone with acquired brain injury syndrome. It can be the result of an accident, developing over a number of years; in other areas, it is from a condition such as Alzheimer's or dementia that progresses through life. 
After the recent events in Bali, we see that many families are now facing the prospect of caring for an injured loved one from the Bali bombing blast. Many children aged in their 20s and 30s—I call them children because, as a mother, they are always your children— have suffered serious injuries and have a long, long road to recovery. On top of the 2.3 million carers, these families will be additional carers who will support and love their children and provide the care, the concern, the compassion and the humanity required in order to deliver them back to health if they possibly can. Their brothers, their sisters, their parents, their families and their loved ones will all feel the strain as these young people recover from their injuries.
The valuable contribution that carers make is so appreciated. It is recognised by all Australians, but perhaps not to the extent that it should be. I think that there are many things that all areas of government can do to provide our carers with more support. Typically, because many of our carers are chronically tired, they desperately need just one night of unbroken sleep, a day off or an extended period with no caring responsibilities so that they can refresh, get a life for themselves and regain a sense of wellbeing. 
As I have indicated before, caring can be such a rewarding and fulfilling experience. It can provide opportunities for personal growth and it can provide opportunities for the development of new skills, but it also provides frustration and distress and it severely impacts on a carer's life and on their family relationships. Having watched my mother care for my father in his years with cancer and now having my mother in the same position of having cancer herself, I can see that Carers Week brings to light the fact there are many people who need to be rewarded and congratulated. 
If I could have a wish it would be that everybody would understand, that everybody would provide assistance, that everybody would offer a helping hand. We are Australians; we offer helping hands. We have just seen that happen in Bali. We do offer services to our government and to our community and, if we could provide one thing, it would be quality of life for all Australians and for all carers of all Australian people. I appreciate the opportunity to pay homage and tribute and to give great recognition to all of those carers in Australia, known or unknown, who provide such wonderful service, such love, such devotion and such protection.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2002-10-22,"—Early last century in The Life of Reason, `Reason in commonsense', philosopher George Santayana noted:
Fanaticism consists of redoubling your efforts when you've lost sight of your aim.
I quote that because I have a difference of emphasis from many of my colleagues on this side with regard to this particular piece of legislation, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. They see it simply as a matter of the government having a trigger for electoral purposes. In contrast, I would put forward that there is a fair degree of fanaticism driving the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations long after the reasons for the legislation have been shown to be rather implausible. The minister seeks essentially to deny people in the small business sector in this country any right to re-engagement or any sense of fair play with regard to their employment situation. We hear implausible promises that, if we allow employers to sack people more easily, all of a sudden throughout the country they are going to hear bells and hire 53,000 people—a figure without any statistical evidence. Nothing has been put forward with regard to how that figure was derived and it is extremely dubious.
The sector in which the government seek to deny people any rights is a sector where union concentration is extremely small. These cases are not normally waged by unions because there is very little union membership in this sector. The government are attempting to undertake this role at a time when they themselves cite low levels of industrial action in this country. They deny totally the possibility of negotiating with the opposition with regard to alternatives whereby we can enhance procedures, reduce costs, diminish legalisms and find ways to do something concrete about those cases where employees do wage legal cases to intimidate the employer into paying money, settling the matter or perhaps not terminating their employment when it should be terminated. There is no attempt by the government to put up alternatives or to discuss options. This is very doctrinally and ideologically driven— this or nothing else; there should be no rights for employees, no rights for workers.
This government has very little credibility with regard to industrial relations in general. Sydney radio commentator Alan Jones, as recently as 25 September, noted:
There has been a fairly major exercise in union bashing going on for some months, calling itself a Royal Commission.
Alan Jones, a noted friend and associate of the Prime Minister, was talking about the royal commission that this government and this minister are waging in this country at the moment. This government, which comes to us and says, `We are about protecting people's rights' et cetera, is waging a royal commission—and paying a person $660,000 a year to chair it—which is totally denying the proliferation of safety issues in this country; where 97 per cent of the hearing periods have been for anti-union statements; and where there have been 633 employer witnesses and a mere 36 on behalf of unions and workers. That royal commission, instigated for political purposes—like this legislation—by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, seeks to deny the reality in the building industry and gives no time to and has no interest in the very real safety issues that should be the preoccupation of it. In 2001 we saw 45 deaths in the building industry, and it is estimated that, in 1998-99, injuries in the building industry cost the Australian economy $109 million.
Here today for the seventh or eighth time—some have said seven times and some have said eight; I have lost count—the government have come into this place with this piece of legislation which has been rejected in the Senate, which has been found to be of no real purpose and which is essentially driven to destroy employees' rights, when very real issues do confront workers and the Australian economy. As I say, it is a royal commission which is wasting taxpayers' money—millions upon millions of dollars squandered by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in an attempt to undermine, deregister and get rid of the CFMEU. Equally, here today we are wasting our time with this legislation. 
This is the same government which is allowing the conditions of Australian workers, whether or not they are in unions, to be undermined totally by the way in which it is allowing easy access to this economy by visiting workers—457 visas have become run-of-the-mill these days, and even the government has occasionally expressed some doubts. We have a situation in Blacktown in Western Sydney where a person was working for less than $1 an hour, with no superannuation and no workers compensation, doing frescos et cetera in the Serbian Orthodox Church there. Similarly, in an Indian temple in the south of Sydney or north of Wollongong—whichever way you want to put it— people were locked up and not allowed out of their workplace for months on end under these same visas. They are the kinds of industrial conditions that this government is trying to precipitate in this country.
Today, once again, the government are bringing in legislation which says, `If you're sacked you have no right to have a day in court. You have no right to any appeal on those matters if you are in a company with fewer than 20 employees.' The government's credibility is so meagre, given their broader agenda. They are allowing the proliferation of visitor visas for two and four years for jobs that can be done by Australian workers; they are encouraging the situation where people are undermining Australian conditions and are prepared to work for nothing; and, at the same time, they have a royal commission which is wasting the Australian taxpayers' money for no real purpose.
As I said earlier, I cannot have any great confidence in the assurances of the minister that this job creation nirvana is really going to occur. To illustrate the situation of people who would suffer because of this legislation, the ABS shows that the average person in Australia, upon termination, is out of work for 22 weeks. Similarly, with regard to those over 45 years of age, I understand that the current average is 96 weeks out of employment. It is a very serious matter when someone is terminated from employment. They are not going to get a job next week in the company down the road. If they are over 40, as I say, they are out for years. This government would say that, despite that disruption to people's lives—the fact that people are thrown on the scrap heap for often questionable reasons and trifling irrelevancies or they are terminated because there are other people out there to do the job—they should be given no other options, no protection whatsoever, nor the option to try to get their job back. There were other figures in the last week or so about the way in which people in the Australian work force are giving up on the possibility of re-employment when they are terminated.
I would like to talk about why people are terminated and what can happen. I want to cite a recent case which admittedly involved Telstra, not a small employer, but which is a comparative situation of people being terminated. The CEPU worked on behalf of one of my constituents, David Portelli, who was terminated on 13 May 2001. Now, a year or so later, his termination has been thrown out by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in a unanimous 3-nil decision. What happened was that the employers, it would seem to me, attempted a set-up by leaving in the car park a mobile phone in an obvious state of disrepair. In later evidence it was indicated by management that for three months they knew this mobile was in the possession of the employee. They knew for three months that he had it. When it came to his attention that it was not lost, discarded or owned by who knows who, he returned it to management the next day. This person had worked for Telstra for 11 years, not 11 days. He had been the subject of commendations and praise. There was no financial gain to him whatsoever with regard to the repair of this mobile phone. The commission in the first instance—and later the full bench of the Industrial Relations Commission—found that the employee had given a plausible account of events. In a similar instance, with the same Telstra management and in exactly the same circumstances, Telstra had said that the matter warranted no more than a warning; but because this person was the union delegate and had been involved in struggling against AWAs, in his case it was found to be a `capital offence' and he was terminated. So, on the one hand, a warning was good enough for one person and, on the other hand, a person was terminated, despite 11 years of employment. The commission questioned whether there had been procedural fairness. The people in Telstra who assisted with police investigations on the supposed theft also carried out the internal investigation. When the person involved was brought before management in January 2001, they decided that it was not serious enough at that stage to warrant his suspension and yet, a few months later, they decided that it required termination. These are very real examples of what can happen on the other side of the industrial fence.
The assumption all the time is that employees warrant dismissal. The assumption is that the workers are always out to undermine the employers' industry—that they are always out to thieve money or to be slack on the job. This was clearly the case when the Australian Industrial Relations Commission had to decide last year in the case of my constituent, who, as I say, was out of work for a year and had to spend all that time in the legal system to get his job back. That is how difficult it is for employees. This government would try to make it impossible for people to get even that far. That person was fortunate that the CEPU and, more particularly, the mayor of one of my municipalities, Councillor Malcolm Tulloch, were able to fight the matter for a year. But this government has no interest in the fact that that person was without wages for a year, that his family life was disrupted and that there were difficulties with his wife because of those circumstances. The government has no interest in the circumstances of the average person. It is driven by the very doctrinal approach of trying to deny people any rights whatsoever.
The government is coming forward with a piece of legislation which went down the gurgler on a number of occasions because of opposition not just from the Labor Party but also from the Greens, the Democrats and the minor parties. People see it for what it is: no real solution for when there are, on some occasions, concrete problems. The government should be finding ways of getting a piece of legislation which the parties can agree upon as a commonsense, intelligent approach to what is, on some occasions, a problem. There is no attempt to do anything about trying to get a sensible alternative to the current practices. There is no attempt to look at the situation of small business and the fact that there exists, on occasion, a disincentive to employment et cetera. All there is is a grandiose statement that 53,000 jobs will be created from who knows where, on the promise of the minister opposite, because he simply wants to drive this home as an indication of support for employers' interests.
In conclusion, the matter has been raised here on a number of occasions. There is no real sense to the piece. It will not get through the parliament on yet another occasion. It is going to postpone once again the possibility of any intelligent, concrete alternative to the problem where it does exist. It is a piece of legislation which, if it were to ever be successful, would say to the average person in this country—in an economy that is characterised by severe casualisation, longer working hours and insecurity for those in employment—that people would have no rights whatsoever if they were unfortunate enough to work in an enterprise which had 16 rather than 21 employees. I again urge the House and the Senate to reject this legislation.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2002-10-22,"—I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. I believe very strongly in workable unfair dismissal laws. I believe they are a part of the responsibility agenda for our society. They ensure that employers meet their proper responsibilities in the workplace. I believe passionately in the importance of social and economic responsibility. We live in troubled times. We live in a society where its cohesion, its connectedness, is not as strong as it used to be. Indeed, we live in conditions where the Australian economy is experiencing record rates of GDP but Australian society is experiencing record rates of trouble—record rates of youth suicide, family breakdown, and community and social decline. If you ask the average Australian what they want most out of life, they will say, `Stronger connections with other people.' They will talk about the importance of social relationships. They will not necessarily put economic issues and economic policy at the top of their priorities. In that environment, it is important for government to demand responsibility from all parts of our society: to demand that we look after each other, and that we have regard for notions of common decency, regard for providing a helping hand for those in need and regard for trying to help those who have made a mistake and seeing if they can correct that mistake next time. We need a society and government policy that demand responsibility from all: responsibility from the rich, responsibility from the poor and responsibility from all those in between.
The unfortunate thing about this legislation is that the Howard government has a very lopsided definition of responsibility. This is a government that wants people on the dole to work for their entitlements. This is a government that wants to extend mutual obligation to other welfare recipients. This is a government that very much wants to apply the responsibility agenda to disadvantaged citizens. In its own right, I have no objection to mutual responsibility for those in difficult circumstances. People do need to make a personal effort in tandem with government support to end the poverty cycle. More importantly, I want to see government policies that apply responsibility across the board— not just to the poor and disadvantaged but to the top end of town; not just to big business but to all businesses.
I believe passionately that all employers in this country have a responsibility to their employees: a responsibility to counsel, to assist, to correct mistakes, to give warnings and to do as much as they can to produce a harmonious and productive workplace. This is a government with a lopsided definition of responsibility. They seem to have no problem with the sins of corporate crooks like Malcolm Turnbull. He has been rewarded with the position of treasurer of the federal Liberal Party. The problems that he has caused in corporate Australia are of no concern to the government, yet they want to apply responsibility to those who are disadvantaged and to those who are trying to break free of the poverty cycle.
I look at this question of unfair dismissal very much as an employer, and I believe that all members of parliament can relate to this. We have an entitlement to three employees in our electorate offices. In my experience, I have always thought that, if staff have difficulties or if their work performance is not up to scratch, they deserve warnings, they deserve counselling and they deserve a helping hand to try to improve their performance. I believe it is wrong—I believe it is indecent—to just sack people on the spot and to have a rule of one mistake and they are gone. What sort of barbaric society have we become when people are not excused for one error? This government, and now this minister, wants to give employers the power to sack on the spot and to basically say that, for one mistake—and it could be, `I don't like the way you look,' or, `I don't like what you are doing'—you can be sacked without any recourse to the law and without any process of appeal, that you can be dismissed without any legal rights whatsoever. I believe that is plain wrong and plain indecent.
This is not good legislation. This is legislation that simply reflects the minister's own personal prejudice against the trade union movement. It is not law that would build a more cohesive and productive society. It is not law that would improve economic performance in this country. In fact, it would produce a dog-eat-dog—a very savage—environment in the Australian workplace. The minister has a problem in that his own personal prejudice against the unions is driving bad legislation such as this. Why does the minister, the member for Warringah, hate the trade union movement? It relates to his interest in his father figure, Bob Santamaria, and the fact that Santamaria tried to take over the union movement in this country and failed. Basically, from a DLP perspective, what they cannot control they will try to destroy. It is the minister trying to make up for the failings of his father figure, Santamaria, in trying to destroy the Australian trade union movement. 
We all know his obsession with the father-son relationship. He has mentioned it in this House 242 times since 1998. He has a bad obsession with the father-son relationship. Now, with his father figure, Santamaria, he is trying to make up for those failings in the 1950s and 1960s. Santamaria did these things in the name of Catholicism, and the minister is well known for boasting about the Catholicisation of the Liberal Party. But the truth is that he is not always in tune with the teachings of his own church. It reflects the minister's hypocrisy. He is what we call a `cafeteria Catholic'; he wants to pick and choose the bits of his religion that he accepts and that are in tune with his political interests. On some issues, most notably stem cell research, he sounds like he swallowed the catechism. But it turns out there were some pages of the catechism that he spat back out, like the page that says:
Remuneration for work should ... (take) into account ... the common good. Agreement between the parties is not sufficient to justify morally the amount to be received in wages.
The teachings of the Catholic Church, the social justice approach of that church, clearly state that there should be agreement in the workplace, that there should be harmony and that we should try to create the moral good between people. There should not be a dog-eat-dog environment where someone can be sacked for one mistake, where someone can be sacked on the spot and where someone can lose their livelihood—their capacity to feed and house their children—because of the minister's determination to push through the abolition of unfair dismissal laws. The minister's support for individual contracts and the abolition of unfair dismissal laws makes him a heretic in the Catholic Church. He is not in tune with their most decent teachings. He is not in tune with the social justice aspects of the catechism. I think this is a great shame indeed. It is also a shame that the minister continues to take out his personal frustrations on the Australian trade union movement. But he is not the only minister to do this. Earlier this year we had the ridiculous notion from the member for North Sydney, the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, that it was important for the parliament to pass these laws to help the 700,000 home based small businesses. That was what the minister said. He said he thought these unfair dismissal laws should be abolished because that would assist Australia's 700,000 home based small businesses.
It is a well-known fact that 80 per cent of home based businesses employ their own family as staff. So the minister for small business is saying that he wants these laws abolished to make it easier for people to sack their own family. What an absurd notion. Eighty per cent of Australia's 700,000 home based small businesses employ their family—very often they employ their children— as staff members. The silly minister for small business thinks that we need these laws abolished so that small business employers can sack their own kids. He has been taking lessons for the member for Warringah, and it is a shameful thing. We do not need laws in this country to make it easier for people to sack their own family. We do not need laws to make it easier for people to sack their own children who are employed in home based small businesses. We need laws that preserve decency and legal and human rights in the workplace. We do not need these barbaric laws that allow people to just sack their own kids from their own business. It is an absurd notion and it should be dismissed as such.
I think it is important to look at the reasons why the government could possibly want to pass these laws. How can you understand it? I think you need a psychologist to try to work out where the government are coming from. They want people to sack their own children in home based businesses, they want to throw out the notion of a decent society and they want a dog-eat-dog industrial environment. You do need a psychologist to work these things out. It is no wonder the member for Warringah wrote in the Bulletin magazine on 18 August 1987:
Dr Iverson had asked me to see a psychologist to clarify whether the priesthood was what I really wanted. The psychologist reported that without the warmth and trust of real intimacy I would find life in the celibate priesthood too frustrating and lacking in peace. Lack of sensual intimacy is something that priests have always had to handle. In my case, this has become a heavy burden. 
I will bet it had become heavy burden. Why does he lack sensual intimacy for the trade union movement? Why does he lack a sense of warmth and real intimacy for Australian trade unionists? Australian trade unions are Australia's largest community based organisation, and we hear from the member for Warringah and other government members that they support community. Why then would you knock the nation's largest community based organisation, which has two million members? If you support community, if you support social capital and if you support a more cohesive society, why would you knock and ridicule Australia's trade union movement—the largest community based group in this nation? The member for Warringah really does need to reconsider his priorities.
I note in another of his articles, this time in the Australian newspaper on 13 June 1984, he wrote as follows: 
As time went by it seemed to me the real issues were not so much political but spiritual. The important arena was not parliament, the economy or the strategic balance but the human heart. The great qualities were not ambition, ability or eloquence but love.
That is what he had to say in 1984. Where has his love for the union movement gone in the subsequent 18 years? This was a minister who was saying that the important issue was not political but spiritual; the important arena was not parliament, the economy or the strategic balance but the human heart—the brave heart. He could have been taking lessons from the Minister for Education, Science and Training. It is the brave heart that matters; it is not great ambitions, ability or eloquence but love. The politics of love was the basis of his approach to issues in 1984 and, sadly, it has disappeared. The only love now is the tough love that he advocates for welfare recipients. He needs to rekindle and rediscover his love for community based organisations, particularly the trade union movement. The minister went on to say in that article in the Australian newspaper:
It's been said that I have a martyr complex, that I like to rush off and engage in heroic struggles for lost causes. I hope that's not true.
Minister, when it comes to this legislation, we hope it is true. We desperately hope this is one of your lost causes—to once more be defeated in the Senate. It is bad legislation. It should be rejected by the parliament, and I urge the minister to rediscover the politics of love. I urge the minister to rediscover the sensual intimacy that he longed for in the priesthood and to show a kinder heart. Take a lesson from the minister for education and show a brave heart—a kind, human heart for Australia's largest community based organisation. Don't foster a dog-eat-dog environment in Australian workplaces where people can just sack other human beings at will. Don't foster such barbarism in Australia's workplaces. Foster the things that you advocated when you contemplated your move into Australian politics. 
I also urge the minister to consider the importance of the union movement for cultural reasons. For those of us who love this country, one of the institutions we truly treasure is Australian mateship. The truth is that Australian unions are the heart and soul of the institution of mateship. To attack the union movement, to try to destroy it, as the minister attempts, is to attack Australian mateship and to attack one of the great institutions of our nation. I am inspired by a reading of Australian history, in particular Russell Ward's book The Australian Legend. On page 198 he writes about the development of the union movement in the 1890s in this country, saying:
The phenomenally rapid growth of the union probably sprang more from the bushmen's already existing ethos than from the organising genius and missionary zeal of prominent leaders. Once the idea of trade union combination was put before them, it seemed to most bushmen merely a natural extension of the non-political, but cherished and familiar, sentiments associated with the concept of mateship.
Ward goes on to quote William Guthrie Spence, as follows:
Unionism came to the Australian bushman as a religion. It came bringing salvation from years of tyranny. It had in it that feeling of mateship which he understood already, and which always characterised the action of one `white man' to another. Unionism extended the idea, so a man's character was gauged by whether he stood true to Union rules or `scabbed' it on his fellows. The man who never went back on the Union is honoured to-day as no other is honoured or respected. The man who fell once may be forgiven, but is not fully trusted. The lowest term of reproach is to call a man a `scab'. ... At many a country ball the girls have refused to dance with them, the barmaids have refused them a drink, and the waitresses a meal.
Such is the lot of the scab. Minister, unfortunately you will not have many country girls dancing with you and you will not have many barmaids serving you a drink because, in terms of what you are trying to do to Australian unionism and mateship, you too are a scab. You deserve that ultimate reproach for what you are trying to do to the trade union movement.
 (Hon. L.R.S. Price)—Order! Honourable Member for Werriwa, it would be helpful to the chair if you withdrew that remark.
—I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I pointed out, the government is vulnerable on the issue of social responsibility, because in truth it has a lopsided view of our obligations as citizens. It applies them only to the poor and powerless. The Liberals have exempted the corporate sector from the demands of social responsibility, and so too it is with this legislation. The minister is trying to exempt the corporate sector from any responsibility it might take in the workplace. 
We all know, as employers ourselves, that we make the choice as to who comes to work for us. You make a judgment; you make a choice. People apply for a job, you interview them, you assess their credentials and you make a judgment as to the best person suited to the position. We know that as members of parliament, with our staff entitlement of three in our electorate offices. Surely people should take responsibility for the judgment they have made; they cannot just wipe it and say, `Last week I made a mistake, or last month I made a mistake, and I bear no responsibility for that error of judgment.' The corporate sector must take its proper social and economic responsibility. If people have made a mistake, they should have the decency to counsel, to warn, to assist staff and to improve their performance in the future.
The minister has one rule for disadvantaged Australians and a different rule for corporate Australia. He said in July that we should excuse the behaviour of bad bosses because they are no worse than bad husbands or bad fathers. This, unfortunately, is typical of his view of society. He has spent a lifetime preaching responsibility to the poor but never practising it. In a perceptive cartoon in the Australian newspaper, Bill Leak summarised the minister's mantra as follows:
A bad boss is like a bad husband or a bad father: he should be able to walk away any time he likes.
The truth is you should not be able to walk away from your proper responsibilities. Unfortunately, the minister has spent too much time walking away from his responsibilities in every sense. I would say this is not the Australian way. It is not the Australian way to slag the underdog and prop up the tall poppies. It is not the Australian way to create a dog-eat-dog environment in the workplace. We should have greater cohesion and greater trust and confidence as citizens, and that should be extended to the industrial relations environment.
It is sad that there is a double standard. The previous speaker, the member for Reid, was talking about the minister's double standard, where he is trying to use a very expensive royal commission into the building industry to destroy trade unionism. It is turning out to be something of a damp squib. He has all these worries about corruption in the building industry but he seems to have no problem with corruption in the legal industry, particularly when it involves his Warringah campaign manager, Ian Harley MacDonald. The minister is a regular visitor to the Kirkconnell Prison in western New South Wales, where MacDonald, shamefully, is serving 5½ years for embezzling $7 million from his legal practice—basically, embezzling money from little old ladies in the electorate of Warringah. The bad priest, it seems, is quite fond of bad bosses and bad lawyers.
Labor have no time for any of them. We have no time for this legislation. We believe that, if government is to demand responsibility from the weak, the same demand must also apply to the powerful. Unlike the Liberals, we do not believe in means testing mutual obligation. Rich people, poor people and everyone in between have a basic responsibility to assist each other and to put something back into the community. There is one saving grace here, because the minister is in the chamber and he is listening to my speech with good intent—
—Grace.
—and good grace, unlike the occasion in the last session of parliament when I attempted to make a five-minute speech on industrial relations and was gagged off at half past one in the morning when the parliament had many more hours to sit. It was as if he was trying to dodge me. The minister did not want to hear my five-minute contribution, even though the parliament had many hours to sit.
I have been worried about the minister. I have taken an interest in him, and we have had some dialogue and political debate. I understood he was the hard man of the Liberal Party but, unfortunately, in recent times I rather fear he has been trying to dodge me, because he says to the newspapers so often, `I have no comment to make on the member for Werriwa's remarks.' It is like the mad monk becoming the Trappist monk. He seems to have lost his voice; he has become Howard's coward. We worry about his credentials when it comes to standing up for himself, putting his point of view across and living up to his reputation as the tough guy on the other side. It makes me think of the news that when he won that boxing blue at Oxford his opponent went on to be Director of the Royal Ballet in London. Maybe Doug Cameron was joking about that, but we understand that, in fact, it is quite true. He has become a bit of a marshmallow. We knew him as the mad monk but, in recent times, he has become the Trappist monk. We oppose this legislation, and I very much look forward to what response the minister might make in reply.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2002-10-22,"—We have just witnessed a remarkable speech to close the ALP's contributions to this debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. I do not propose to dignify too much of it with a response. Nevertheless, I think it is important to say at the outset that what we have seen over the past few weeks in this parliament is that on both sides of this chamber there is much that we agree on. We agree on the war against terrorism. We agree that Australians should stand together in the face of natural disasters such as fire and drought. It has been one of the encouraging things in this parliament and, I am sure, to people who listen to this parliament to see that, notwithstanding all the issues on which we disagree, on some of the big fundamental questions there is much on which we do agree.
Nevertheless, the different degree of emphasis which the respective parties place on trade unions and their place in our system certainly is an enduring point of disagreement. This particular bill is one of those issues where our different emphases do come sharply into play. This government is unashamedly and unambiguously in favour of small business, whereas, when it comes to the crunch, members opposite usually find themselves falling into line with the dictates of big unions. I know that many members opposite have done their best to try to reduce the formal hold the trade unions have over the ALP but, for better or for worse, they were not able to go nearly as far as many of them would have liked. I think this continued attachment—for all sorts of reasons: some understandable; some, in their own way, noble—that members opposite have to the union movement, its mystique, its ethos and its values, has tended to come out in the course of this debate.
But this government has faith in the Australian people. We have faith in the Australian worker; we have faith in the Australian employer. They are not perfect: they will not, from time to time, avoid mistakes; they will not, from time to time, avoid treating each other in ways that are less than perfect. But, by and large, this government believes that the Australian worker and the Australian boss can be trusted to organise their own relationships with each other. Sometimes it will not work out, but that is life. Certainly this government believes that freedom is more important than excessive regulation that can swamp and overwhelm the initiative and the good sense of the ordinary Australian.
We believe that the unfair dismissal laws, insofar as they apply to small business, are a classic case of a cure that is worse than the disease. The last thing that this government would want to see, should this bill be passed into law in both houses of parliament, is people being harshly or unconscionably dismissed. But, quite frankly, there are very few instances of that in modern Australia, where we have, generally speaking, humane and intelligent employers and highly intelligent and independent minded workers. The problem with the law as it stands is that one or two difficult cases have been allowed to create a regulatory structure that stands in the way of the creation of tens of thousands of new jobs.
This government has no intention of taking the unfair dismissal regime off larger businesses—although there are certainly some further improvements that we would like to make to the way unfair dismissal works generally—but we do believe that small business is different. Small business is more like a family than an institution. Small businesses, generally speaking, do not have the complex structures in place to carry out the kinds of formal requirements that the unfair dismissal regime has generally imposed upon them. That is why small business deserves an exemption. This idea of exempting small business is not particularly new or unusual. There is a long history in our system of treating small business differently in important respects from larger businesses. To give just one example, the Industrial Relations Commission typically permits a different redundancy regime to that of larger business to apply to small business because the Industrial Relations Commission, in its wisdom and in its understanding of the way our system works, appreciates that small business is different from big business.
What we are really on about here is not the desire to oppress anyone—far from it. What we are on about is trying to enable the businesses of this country, the economy of this country, to create the maximum possible number of jobs for people to enjoy. At the end of the day, that is the important thing to have: a job—not a right of sorts to go into a commission and argue a case under which you might get a few hundred or a few thousand dollars and, if you are particularly lucky, reinstatement. It is far better to give people a much wider range of jobs and opportunities so that they can make the most of their situation; so that they can pick themselves up off the ground of disappointment and go on to make the most of their lives.
The basic principle that members opposite are refusing to concede is that if you cannot afford to let someone go you cannot afford to take people on. This is what small business knows in the marrow of its bones; this is what many members opposite understand but are not allowed to say because of the policy position forced upon them by the union bosses. I do not want to go through member after member opposite and put words in their mouths, but certainly there is the classic statement by the member for Hunter, when he was the shadow minister for small business—and I see he has entered the chamber again, with what I am sure is a cheery smile on his face because isn't it good to have your words listened to, understood and appreciated! As the member for Hunter said on that celebrated occasion: `My wife is in small business and she knows just how much easier it would be to employ people if she was not faced with the burden of these laws.'
—That story is getting better and better! Could you table it?
—Like all good stories, it is savoured, appreciated and improved over time.
—Like a good Hunter red!
—Members opposite have, from time to time, tried to oppose the government's position by telling us that this or that survey shows that only five per cent of small business think that they would take more people on if these laws were changed.
—It is less than that, actually; it is less than one per cent.
—Even if it were one per cent, that is some 10,000 or 15,000 small businesses. That is 10,000 or 15,000 new jobs that this economy would have if these laws were changed. Members opposite frequently stand up and say that there are many other things that are of greater concern to small business—I would not disagree. There are lots of issues that are of concern to small business and there are lots of issues that, if they were treated differently, would help small business. I am sure that a general lowering of tax would help small business, but I should point out that this government has lowered taxes, particularly business taxes. I am sure that lower interest rates would help small business to create jobs, but I should point out that this government has lowered interest rates very significantly and substantially over the last six years. So, sure, there are lots of things apart from this bill that would help small business, but the fact is that this is the matter before the parliament and this is a matter that this parliament can address simply by the vote before us today and the vote in the Senate in a few weeks time. So I would ask those members opposite who do take small business seriously and who would like to see the employment opportunities available to ordinary Australians increased to think again about this bill.
I listened with interest, as I always do, to the contribution of the shadow minister, the member for Barton. It was thoughtful, intelligent and well argued. As I have said before, he is a good lawyer and, like all good lawyers, he does his best with the brief he has. I do not think it is a good brief; I think he is a barrister with a dodgy brief. I wish he could change his instructing solicitors, but unfortunately the union bosses are still there and they are still handing out the documents for the barrister to refer to.
If you look at the shadow minister's speech, it was basically in two parts. Firstly, there was a concession that there were problems with the unfair dismissal laws that would be addressed, he said, by amendments. Secondly, there was the veiled threat that if small business were exempt from the unfair dismissal laws they would be faced with something worse—the unfair termination laws. I am sure that there are all sorts of issues with the unfair termination laws, but the unfair dismissal law is the issue before the parliament and the fear of something worse should not stop us from doing something good now. It should not stop us from providing a definite if not necessarily all-encompassing improvement that would help bring about the things we all say we believe in.
This has become one of those bits of watershed legislation. It has become something of a political icon. This government has now proposed, in one or other house of this parliament, to improve the unfair dismissal laws 21 times, and we have been opposed by the ALP 21 times. I accept that the shadow minister does have some amendments. I accept that some of those amendments do make some sense. I am prepared to entertain those amendments in a different context—but not here. This is an important part of this government's mandate. We went to the electorate in 1996, in 1998 and again in 2001 saying that we wanted to improve the unfair dismissal laws, we wanted to take unfair dismissal off the back of small business and we wanted to keep faith with small business. It is very important that we do not let small business down. I have to say that this bill does demonstrate the fundamental differences between the parties: the fundamental support that we have for small business and the fundamental instinct that members opposite have for big business; and the fundamental support that we have for the idea of freedom and the fundamental instinct that members opposite have for regulation because you cannot trust people to do the right thing in nearly every circumstance. I commend this bill to the House.
Question put:
That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr McClelland's amendment) stand part of the question.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2002-10-22,"—This afternoon we are dealing with the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2002 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2002. These cognate bills introduce the co-contributions scheme and reduce the surcharge on high-income earners. Labor support the co-contributions measure, with certain amendments, but do not support the measure to reduce the surcharge tax for only four per cent of working Australians. We consider the current co-contribution to be a pale imitation of the much more extensive co-contribution arrangements proposed by the ALP government in the May 1995 Saving for our future statement.
Those 1995 proposals included that the government match contributions of up to three per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings, about $1,342 per annum in current levels, which did not phase out until the member achieved a wage of twice average weekly ordinary time earnings, or $89,492 per annum currently. The current Treasurer committed an incoming coalition government to implementing the 1995 ALP co-contribution proposals. The coalition government subsequently reneged on that promise and implemented instead a savings rebate, which in turn was quickly abolished.
This was a very important measure proposed by the previous Labor government. It was designed to get superannuation contributions up to a level which would ensure that people had a decent standard of living in their retirement. When it was put into the budget in 1995, it was to take effect from 1998-99 and, in that year, it was to cost the taxpayer $1,080 million. That was contained in the budget papers. When the current Treasurer decided to abolish it—in contravention of his election promise—he recorded in the document `Budget measures 1997-98', which was circulated with his budget in 1997, the following financial implications of removing it. It was going to have a cost in 1997-98 of $1 million, make savings of $1,079 million in 1998-99, save $2,414 million in 1999-2000 and save $3,980 million in 2000-01. 
We are now a couple of years on from that, and one could expect that the savings produced by that measure would probably be around $5 billion a year. We had a Treasurer who decided that he needed to make some public savings, and he decided to do it very much at the expense of private savings and very much at the expense of the future retirement incomes of a great many working Australians. I think it was one of the most pernicious savings options that the Treasurer took. 
In the previous year he had made some quite substantial savings which in the third out year were worth about $7 billion. In the subsequent budget he was very keen to hold the line, but it seems that the only way he actually held his savings line in that year was to abolish this co-contributions scheme. It is a matter of great regret to me and I think it is one of the most dreadful things that Peter Costello has done to Australians who were saving for their retirement. It is absolutely scandalous. He then proceeded to declare victory over the budget black hole that he had postulated. Having declared victory over it, he has gone on something of a spending rampage ever since.
Of course, 1998 was an election year so he had to spend several billion dollars that year. Normally, treasurers who are sensible about these things take stock after they have got through an election and perhaps make some savings; but not this Treasurer. No, he went right on spending in 1999 and he went right on spending in 2000. The spending in 2001 was absolutely unbelievable; there were tens of billions of dollars spent to try to buy another election. He promised then that we were going to be in surplus after the 2001 election but, as we have found out, we are in fact in deficit by $1.3 billion in cash terms and in deficit by about $3.7 billion on an accrual basis.
After 11 years of almost continuous economic growth, the Treasurer is running up deficits. He has spent every dollar he has ever saved. He has spent all of the proceeds of fiscal drag. He has spent basically everything that he can lay his hands on.
—The cupboard is bare.
—The cupboard is somewhat bare, as the member for Lowe has pointed out, and we are now dealing with a measure which is supposedly designed to give some low-income earners a co-contribution for superannuation. But it is a co-contribution that is of absolutely minuscule proportions: we are talking about a couple of hundred million dollars here. The measure that he took away some years ago was worth $4 billion then, in the last out year, and would be worth considerably more than that now.
The co-contribution is an excuse for the surcharge cut. It is one of the most highly inequitable measures that have been brought in by this government. It only fully affects those on surcharge incomes of around $100,000 in 2002-03—a group that represents approximately four per cent of the working population. We need to remember that the surcharge is the Liberal government's very own tax which they introduced in 1996. They broke their promise, coming into the 1996 election, not to introduce new taxes. Mr Howard made a promise on behalf of his party on 1 February 1996 when he said:
We are not going to increase existing taxes and we're not going to introduce new ones.
—They lied!
—That was a pretty clear promise—a lie, as the member for Lowe says— which they broke just six months later by announcing a new tax on superannuation. That is something else that makes this a very significant bill. At the time, the government justified the surcharge as an equity measure. Peter Costello stated in his budget speech on 20 August 1996:
The measures I am announcing tonight are designed to make superannuation fairer.
A major deficiency of the current system is that tax benefits for superannuation are overwhelmingly biased in favour of high income earners. 
How right he was! He continued:
For a person on the top tax rate, superannuation is a 33 percentage point tax concession while a person earning $20 000 receives a 5 percentage point tax concession. High income earners can take added advantage through salary sacrifice arrangements that are not available to lower income earners.
The Government is remedying this situation.
...					...				...
For high income earners the superannuation contributions will still be highly concessional but are more in line with concessions to middle and low income earners.
It was an equity measure then, and reducing it is an inequity measure now.
There was another important feature of Mr Costello's justification for this measure in his comments on 27 August 1996. He said:
... the point I'd like to make is that on Budget night the first Treasurer in history—me—stood up and put a surcharge in respect to high income earners and applied it to himself and every other politician, you know, we're the good guys in relation to this.
Where did he say this? He said this on the Midday Show, when he was dancing the macarena. He will be dancing the macarena now because he has reduced the surcharge. The iniquitous thing is that the reduction is going to provide a significant benefit for people on relatively high incomes by Australian community standards—not just treasurers. It is going to provide a benefit to all people in our profession as politicians. I think most people in the community would agree that that is fairly iniquitous.
One of the biggest problems with the way this government tried to hide the fact that the surcharge was a tax was that it made it extremely difficult for superannuation funds to implement. In terms of administrative costs, the surcharge was unacceptably expensive. In its first year of operation, some superannuation funds incurred as much as 30 per cent of the revenue paid as associated administrative overhead. I do not imagine that that has gone on forever, but it was an extremely administratively expensive tax to implement. If it had been done in perhaps a more straightforward way, that problem could have been reduced for the superannuation funds and, therefore, ultimately for their beneficiaries. To that must also be added some of the collection costs incurred by the ATO and some, though much less, employer costs.
The administrative burden of the surcharge means that all fund members meet increased costs regardless of their incomes. One way or another, the associated monitoring, collection and compliance costs must be met and are likely to reduce the overall accumulations of all fund members, not just those on whose behalf the surcharge is levied. Reducing the rate of the surcharge does absolutely nothing to redress the situation. If anything, a 10 per cent reduction in the surcharge rate each year for each individual surchargeable member turns up the heat on the average administrative costs.
Labor's plan to cut the contributions tax is the best way to deliver higher retirement incomes to millions of working Australians. Labor have proposed two fairer options and urges the government to redirect the Treasurer's superannuation tax cut away from the few and to all the superannuation fund members who pay the contributions tax—which is, of course, all of them. Peter Costello believes it is impossible to cut the contributions tax burden. He said in a radio interview on 22 October 2001:
It's pretty complicated. The taxing of contributions on the way in started back in the mid eighties ... and I think now that it's started that's going to always be with us ... So it's still better to put money into superannuation, than to take it as income. But that system having commenced 15 years ago would be incredibly complicated to unravel now.
I think it would be considerably less complicated to unravel it now than to unravel the superannuation surcharge, which the Treasurer seems to believe desperately that he needs to unravel because it applies to high-income earners, whereas the contributions tax applies to all earners. We do not agree; we know that cutting the contributions tax can be done with a minimum of fuss, as confirmed by the many industry representatives we have spoken to over the last few months. Indeed, they would be very enthusiastic about cutting the contributions tax.
We now have an opportunity to implement a fairer proposal which will improve the budget and boost retirement savings, but this chance will be lost if the government gets its way with these unfair changes. Labor's alternative propositions are: option 1, cut the superannuation contributions tax for all Australians who pay it from the present 15 per cent to 13 per cent; or, option 2, cut the tax to 11.5 per cent for people aged 40 and over. These are the people who are coming up to retirement who have had less time in the work force, in many cases, making superannuation contributions and who would probably benefit enormously by having their contributions tax reduced for up to the last 25 years of their working lives and would then be able to accumulate a larger nest egg for their retirement.
I will give a few examples of how people will be benefited by Labor's measures. The first is Matthew, who is 20, and earns $40,000 a year over his career. He gets an extra $7,128 in a retirement nest egg under option 1 and $4,748 under option 2. Matthew would receive nothing under the Liberal government's proposal to reduce the surcharge. Another example, for someone already well into their working life, is Heather, who is 40 and earns $60,000 a year over the rest of her career. She gets an extra $4,069 under option 1 and $7,122 under option 2. Heather would receive nothing under the proposal to reduce the surcharge. These examples are in present value, so they reflect the value in today's terms. The benefits would be substantially more in the dollars of the future. 
These outcomes provide a powerful incentive for Australians to invest in their own future, helping us to cope with our future needs. The Labor package for a fairer superannuation system is revenue neutral. This is achieved by opposing the reduction in the superannuation surcharge and the proposal to allow the splitting of superannuation contributions, which effectively doubles the 2002-03 reasonable benefit limits of $1,124,384 for pensions or $562,195 for lump sums, which we expect to see in another superannuation bill in the spring sittings.
The government's response to the ALP's plan was almost immediate. They did not like it because it meant they had to start arguing that a tax cut to the select few was better than a tax cut to millions of working Australians. So they chose a different route; they went with what they thought would be much easier: they said that Labor got the figures wrong. During the estimates process, Treasury officials admitted they had made mistake after mistake in that 17 May costing, yet they still refuse to hand over the revised costings they gave the Treasurer when they realised just how wrong they had it. 
Even now, five months later, the government will not allow Treasury to publicly correct the record and release the figures which would prove our plan is affordable. Since we exposed the Treasury costings for the fraud they were, the government have fallen pretty much silent. They do not seem interested in debating the measure anymore, and we all know why: it is pretty hard to enter into an argument about how it is better to cut taxes to the top four per cent of taxpayers than to cut them for millions of working Australians. 
Unfortunately, it appears that the Democrats will argue the surcharge tax cut for them. After a spectacular backflip in September, the Australian Democrats are set to deliver the rich a massive tax windfall while leaving millions of Australians with nothing. The deal offered by Senator Cherry on the government's superannuation package will still see a cut to the super surcharge tax that applies only to those on more than $90,500 per year. While a smaller cut to the surcharge in return for a more generous voluntary co-contribution is an improvement on the government's package, it remains grossly unfair compared to Labor's alternative: a cut in the contributions tax to benefit all super fund members who pay it.
Under the Democrat proposal the affluent are all guaranteed a tax cut. Those earning $46,000 or less will receive a contribution from government only if they voluntarily make additional contributions to superannuation. Treasury estimates indicate that only 75,000 Australians will receive the full co-contribution, even under the Democrats' new proposal. This is out of the more than five million working Australians who should be eligible but simply do not have the money left over after servicing their mortgages, feeding their families and paying the bills. It is an absolutely typical measure by this government. It promises something to a group of people on relatively low incomes and, when the people on low incomes read the fine print, they find that they are not eligible or, in this case, not financially able to take advantage of what the government is purporting to offer them.
The only justification Senator Cherry could offer for cutting the surcharge is that it is an administrative nightmare. Everyone knows that. Cutting the tax rate does not solve that problem; in fact, it makes it worse in average administrative terms. Democrat senators have previously staunchly opposed this tax cut for the rich, including on 27 June 2002, when they supported a Labor motion calling on the government to withdraw the measure. I expect the Democrats to keep their commitment, but doubtless they will not.
The inquiry of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation into these bills heard many submissions that raised concerns in relation to the effectiveness and equity of the proposed co-contribution scheme, as well as in relation to access to the co-contribution by particular groups of persons and the administrative costs of the proposals. The Labor Party is concerned about submissions to the committee that the proposed co-contribution arrangements leave considerable scope for abuse, in that comparatively well-off people will be making contributions in respect of family members in part-time employment. The ability of single or sole breadwinners in the salary target range to afford to make contributions to superannuation in order to qualify for the matching co-contribution is untested and, as attested to before the committee, unlikely for most in that range. The number of people estimated to receive the full $1,000 is only 75,000, according to evidence provided by ASFA. This is from a total pool of 4.4 million people with incomes of less than $32,500, according to ATO evidence.
Another important consideration is the government's announcement on 20 June that they intended to remove the surcharge reduction amendments from the superannuation bills they had before the Senate at the time and shift them to the bills we are considering today. Senator Coonan stated that change was due to the government's desire to highlight the fact that the government's superannuation initiatives were designed as a balanced set of measures. That is, it was a blatant political stunt which was aimed at trying to justify their unfair tax cut to the well-off by pretending the measure was linked to co-contributions. This is a complete furphy. If the government were serious about helping those most in need of assistance in accumulating a retirement nest egg, they would have placed the co-contributions measures in separate bills.
Against that background, the Labor Party will move an amendment to the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill to include in the legislation a provision that would require the government to closely monitor the operation of the co-contribution arrangements. The purpose is to ensure that only those who are genuinely in need receive the co-contribution and to establish the proportion of the target group who are accessing the co-contribution. I have to say, based on the government's previous performance of not releasing Treasury's revised costings of our measures, I think it is very unlikely that we will get satisfaction from the government on this amendment. In relation to the surcharge, I will move the amendment, circulated in my name, to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 requesting that the government withdraw these bills from the House, remove the unfair proposals and replace them with the ALP's fairer superannuation plan. If the government will not do this, I intend to move further amendments to the bills which will specifically oppose the reduction in the surcharge. I urge the members of this House to support my amendments.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2002-10-22,"—I rise to speak on the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2002 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2002. Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, I know you cannot comment on the remarks made previously by one of our colleagues, but I am sure that there would be no way a person of your status and standing could possibly agree with those remarks. The industry and commentators in all areas have remarked on the commonsense of the government in moving to assist in two important areas that are affected by superannuation, these being the overtaxing and the overcommitment of people. The government is moving on a commitment it made over 12 months ago to assist people at both ends of the spectrum as far superannuation is concerned.
The Australian Labor Party want to pick bits out of the legislation and to add bits. If it is so bad, let it go through and let the government wear the criticism. The Labor Party should do that. The Labor Party have painted a picture of how unfair this process is. They are going to fiddle with it, negotiate with the Democrats, as they have indicated, and try to effect change to it. They seem to be saying that it is grossly unfair and that it very much favours the wealthy. They are not quite the words that the Labor Party used, but that appears to be what they think. They want to increase the advantage for the lower end and completely readjust the government's program, despite what commentators right across the board have said. There is an almost unanimous point of view as to the fairness of what the government is proposing, but the Labor Party think that it is grossly unfair. My comment is that if it is grossly unfair, the community will see that and the Labor Party will have a wonderful platform to run to the election with. They will be able to make great play in an election campaign of how unfair these proposals are. The Labor Party should not play with amendments; they should just let this process carry on and then they will be able to say to the Australian community, `We told you this was bad. It has turned out to be bad and you should not, as a community, support the government.'
The package that we are dealing with today is part of A Better Superannuation System, which was announced on 5 November 2001. The government contribution is expected to increase the numbers of low-income earners making personal superannuation contributions. The government contribution will replace the existing taxation rebate for personal superannuation contributions made by low-income earners. The co-contribution will be more generous than the rebate it is replacing. The maximum co-contribution of $1,000 compares with the maximum rebate of $100. That is a very substantial increase. The government co-contribution will match personal superannuation contributions made on or after 1 July 2002 by eligible people with incomes of less than $32,500. That is what this legislation is about. That will mean that the maximum contribution of $1,000 will be payable to those with an income of $20,000 or less. The maximum contribution will reduce by 8c for each $1 of income over $20,000, with a sliding scale of contribution finally vanishing at $32,500. A minimum co-contribution of $20 will also apply, as long as the person is below the income threshold and has made some personal superannuation contributions during the year.
This is a marvellous program of support that links in with a package of superannuation reform that the government has been undertaking. Why is this necessary? The Treasurer released the Intergenerational Report at the time of the last budget. That report tells us that the proportion of the population that is ageing is expected to increase and that the proportion of the budget spent on the age pension will increase from the current 2.9 per cent of GDP to 4.6 per cent of GDP by the year 2042. That imposes a huge policy challenge which, it appears, the Australian Labor Party are unwilling to tackle. I have read Senator Sherry's proposals. The proposals being put forward by the Labor Party in no way tackle the long-term problems of superannuation investment in Australia; they seem to fiddle with government policy. The Labor Party hope to attract votes through the changes that Senator Sherry wants to make. One of the biggest criticisms that can be made of the current opposition by the community—and the way the opposition are figuring in public support indicates this—is that they have not done the hard yards as far as policy development is concerned. The community is not attracted to policies that fiddle with the current government's policies. The Labor Party think that they are going to score with the proposals put forward by Senator Sherry, but that will not happen.
The OECD economic survey on Australia, released in August last year, found that:
Australia's age pension and superannuation systems combine to provide Australians, especially low income earners, with replacement rates above frequently-used benchmarks.
It reported that:
Replacement income rates are expected to rise over time as the superannuation element matures.
That is a good report, and that is good news. It indicates that we have a world-class superannuation system and retirement package. But the government feels—and rightly so— that more should be done. Most Australians feel there is more to be done. The package presented by the government prior to the last election was designed to encourage an attitude in Australians of saving and preparing for the future, because of the demographic changes so well identified by the Intergenerational Report. Unless we do that and start to make a move soon, the impost on future generations of Australians of sudden changes will be most severe. It seems to be the purpose of the Australian Labor Party to delay those changes by obstruction, which is forcing the government into more and more difficult budgetary decisions instead of allowing it to plan and prepare for the future in a rational and sensible way. The government is spending $28.7 million over four years to undertake an education campaign to ensure that employees, employers, and superannuation funds and their members understand these changes. I think the government must do that. Australians need to understand that change is inevitable and that it is better to prepare for it in an orderly and measured way than to have it foisted on them suddenly.
Changes not dealt with in this legislation but part of the total package include choice and portability of funds. Senator Sherry makes some remarks about that in the Labor Party's policy, in particular about disclosure, about choice requiring portability and about the safety and preservation of superannuation funds. He says that the forward agenda for superannuation needs to be given serious attention. In a recent submission to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, the Department of the Treasury concluded:
The SG in combination with the Age Pension can produce replacement rates in excess of 60 per cent for—
Australians on median earnings—
of 25, 30 and 40 years ...
That was a significant contribution, as was legislation passed already in this House to change the upper age rate at which people may work and continue to make personal contributions to superannuation from 70 to 75 years. Broadly, that is the package the government has prepared.
The measures currently before the House have been noted by the Investment and Financial Services Association Chief Executive Officer, Richard Gilbert, who said:
Passing this bill could relieve burdens on two heavily taxed groups at opposite ends of the income scale.
This was one of the organisations I was referring to when I said that the industry is enthusiastic about the goals that these changes will achieve. The government has already agreed to changes to the minimum wage eligibility for superannuation entitlements—that it be no longer $450 a month but $1,350 a quarter—despite some claims that there would be increased administrative costs. The CEO of the Investment and Financial Services Association says:
It is a sensible result and it ensures savings are both widened and deepened.
That is just one of the many comments made about the decision to give people on low incomes the opportunity to enter superannuation schemes. The legislation also removes the disincentive for those at the upper end of the income scale. The superannuation surcharge—which was part of a government strategy in desperate times to cover a terrible budgetary inheritance from the Australian Labor Party—was put in place to recover the budget, which it did successfully. Now is the time to relieve of the penalty the people whom we want to encourage to invest in the institutions which put so much back into Australia—the superannuation funds.
The Australian Labor Party would rather people at the upper end of the income scale invested in things other than superannuation, but they have got it wrong. We need to encourage people at all income levels to invest in superannuation because the return, measured over a period of years, is much more satisfactory for the future economic development of Australia than investment in real estate. If the Australian Labor Party were to bring about the changes they are talking about, they would discourage those at the upper end of the income range from investing in superannuation. That is wrong. They have not devised a process which is logical, which hangs together and which would allow all income groups to invest fairly and properly in superannuation.
Over a period of time, the government have changed the superannuation guarantee from eight to nine per cent, increased the age limit for personal undeducted contributions from 70 to 75 years of age and permitted contributions of up to $3,000 in a three-year period per child under 18 years. These are enlightened processes which will encourage people into the superannuation system. We have increased the deductions for super contributions for self-employed people and, from next July, employer contributions will switch from annual to quarterly contributions. 
The Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill has been on hold. It should have been passed back in July, but it has been delayed because of the games being played in the committees of the Senate and because of problems with the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party seem to blame the Australian Democrats for everything, but the fact is that the Labor Party are the initiators of resistance. They are the initiators of the wish to obstruct. Without the Australian Labor Party, the Democrats could do very little in the Senate. The co-contribution for low-income earners will see the government match the $1,000 deposits of those earning less than $20,000, while the contribution will be reduced to nil for those earning $32,500. The surcharge will be reduced for upper income earners from 15 to 11.5 per cent over three years. 
It defies logic that the Australian Labor Party are going to move an in principle amendment saying that this proposal is wrong but that they are then going to move detailed amendments. It is obvious that this proposal is going to strike trouble again in the committees of the Senate, and I think that that is an inappropriate and improper way of dealing with something as important as retirement benefits. It is wrong that a total package, part of which has passed the parliament, should be held up for the sake of the perverse attitudes of a few senators. We need to have a comprehensive approach to saving. It seems that the Australian Labor Party are encouraging the government to deal with low-income earners—and we should. I think it is a great proposal, but we need to keep high-income earners within the scope of superannuation as well. We should not be encouraging them to look for other packages and other investments. There is no compulsion for higher income people to have superannuation. The surcharge is a limitation on them, and I believe that if they were relieved of that surcharge over a period of time people would reinvest in superannuation. That would be beneficial to the funds, to future investment and to the advancement of Australia, as well as to the individuals and their families. The nation will benefit from the process. I recommend the legislation. I reject the arguments that I have heard today from the Australian Labor Party. They are not cohesive. They are mishmash; they are fiddling at the margin. They are not a comprehensive approach to superannuation and they should be rejected. ",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2002-10-22,"—In the words of my inimitable predecessor, that speech was enough to make a cat laugh. When we come to the question of planning a future for Australia, as we do in the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2002 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2002, the Liberal Party are the second lot out of the blocks. Superannuation in Australia, in its modern form, was put together by the former Treasurer of the Commonwealth and former member for Blaxland Paul Keating. He was the one who put together a process whereby we now have nine per cent of people covered under the superannuation guarantee. If it were not for the government and one of their first acts, that nine per cent would have been 12 per cent. That is where we were heading in terms of what we thought was a reasonable place to finish— except for another three per cent on top. The final goal under the former Labor government was not just three per cent, six per cent or nine per cent—the current government were compelled to take it from eight to nine per cent; they could not get out of that—but from nine to 12 per cent and then from 12 to 15 per cent. 
It is enough to make a cat laugh to think that this government are actually talking about a coherent set of policies with regard to super. Coherent, rational, sensible and well thought out? I would not put any of those adjectives anywhere near what the government have done with regard to super. Through all of the years that the coalition government were in opposition, one by one their members condemned Labor's approach to super. They condemned the super guarantee charge and they complained that it was taking too long to get a majority of the work force involved in super. When we put the super guarantee into place, we tried to do it on a totally voluntary basis. I can remember the implementation extremely well. 
It took an enormous amount of time to try to convince ordinary working people that it was to their benefit to be participants in the super guarantee. In the end, we had to legislate for their benefit. If we had not done it, participation would not be three per cent, six per cent or—as it is now—nine per cent. And, if we do not get back into government, it will not get to 12 or 15 per cent. Proper planning and a proper regime that will adequately take care of the superannuation needs of the Australian work force will not come from what this government now have in place. It is entirely laughable for the member for Mitchell to argue, as he did at the end of his speech, just before he got to the fact that there was a bit in it for low-income earners, that if these changes are made over the next three years—the changes that the government are proposing are a bit of a slide down from a 15 per cent surcharge: 1½ per cent a year in 2002-03, another 1½ per cent the next year and another 1½ per cent the year after that—maybe people on higher incomes might start putting their money back into super. It was the current Treasurer's dopey idea in the first place to whack on the superannuation surcharge. The 15 per cent that he imposed on those who were at the highest level meant that a vast majority of those people walked out of super altogether. 
The government achieved their aim in terms of putting up what they thought was a terrific thing because of the criticism they had had. It thought it was a terrific thing to say, `Look at us: aren't we different? Aren't we substantially hairy-chested because we are going to knock the people at the top, we are going to put this surcharge on, and won't they cop it in the neck?' When they did, they made their choices very apparent—they walked from the super system. To argue, as the member for Mitchell did, that if you knock it back from 15 per cent to 10 per cent they might come charging back and start investing in super rather than in other areas, you would have to be a bit soft in the head in economic terms to actually think that that might be the case.
This Treasurer, for political purposes, decided he would play his games in regard to super. This is the Treasurer who argued that what the Labor Party had done in the super guarantee charge was pushed towards the top end. This is the Treasurer who selectively said that the Australian Labor Party had not done enough for people in the middle and at the bottom. Of course, he is joined in that by the former Liberal Treasurer and member for Bennelong—and we all remember what his record as Treasurer was. The current Treasurer makes a snide allusion almost every question time—he has been a bit quiet in the last couple of weeks; we can understand why—to what Labor's history supposedly is in a particular area. But it always occurs to me—and I often interject to this effect, remembering a bit of the history of this—that, in the allusions about interest rates and all the rest, there is a sideward barb into the Prime Minister.
This bloke thinks that he is the best that there has ever been about the place, that he has got the record as Treasurer that the member for Bennelong never had. What did the member for Bennelong end up with when we came in in 1983? Double-digit inflation, double-digit unemployment and double-digit interest rates. That is a trifecta that nobody else has been able to get up. You can accuse the Labor Party of all you want in terms of interest rates or unemployment or anything else, but no Labor Treasurer, as far as I know, has been able to get that threesome up. When the Prime Minister says, `Isn't it terrible: the unemployment rates we had under Labor were so high,' they only just pipped what he was able to do as Treasurer. Certainly interest rates were bad, and we wanted them to come down earlier. Let us cast our minds back to the period when he was Treasurer. I remember the `cocktail loans' that people had to get—the combination loans: when you got the loan from the bank it had to be topped up by a loan from the building society. Interest rates were running well over 18 per cent when you put the two elements of the cocktail together. But the Treasurer has that little dig, that little bit of an aside, and the Prime Minister reddens up a bit. He knows there has been a little bit of a dig at him. This Prime Minister's prime ministership is about trying to make up for all the deficits he had as Treasurer.
Not once in opposition did the Prime Minister ever say that he supported the superannuation guarantee. In opposition, this lot said they were against it. They said that enough was being done by what had already been provided to people from companies and government departments, that more money should not be expended from the Commonwealth. They fought against the super guarantee charge tooth and nail, budget after budget. In those budgets where we introduced changes to directly benefit people on lower and middle incomes, they criticised us because we had targeted the assistance that was going to be given.
It is critically important to understand that the current system we have is a Labor Party system. What has been placed on top of it is the head of this system, where it would have grown to, the upper part of the body of the system—a system that is so substantial at nine per cent of moneys going in that it is the fundamental bedrock for our future investment. If it had been allowed to grow to 12 and then to 15 per cent, the moneys available for investment in Australia would have provided enormous ballast in the economic system and in the stock market area. That ballast would have flowed over from blue chips down to the second and third levels and would have provided for much greater Australian participation in owning our own companies and providing a means on which we could build a platform to compete more effectively with the rest of the world. But, most importantly, this was about provision for the future.
It is entirely laughable that anybody could believe the member for Mitchell when he says the Labor Party have not done any planning and have no policy in this area and that it is unacceptable that they do not want to do it. We have already indicated that we will support what is proposed here for people on low incomes. There is a cost to the Treasury, to the tax department, in this. If you look at what the current provision is where there is a rebate, it is $10 million a year, year on year. In this new proposal we are looking at $95 million in the first year, $100 million in the second year and about $105 million in 2005-06. This is in the order of 10 to one. This helps people on lower incomes more, at a ratio of 10 to one. We are looking at an all-up cost here, if you run the three together, of nearly $300 million for people on low incomes. Isn't it passing strange that it is $300 million that the government have proposed in this bill to go to people on low incomes where people can contribute $1,000? They used to get a $100 rebate—that is the current situation. Here, what they are saying is: if you earn up to $20,000, you can put in $1,000 and they will match it dollar for dollar. Okay, good—it is a sensible approach for people on low incomes because they cannot adequately provide for their future. But here the government are also thinking of the pension moneys that they would be directly paying out. Above that they have a sliding scale, of a reduction of 8c in the dollar for every extra dollar up to $32,500. But about $300 million worth of cost to the revenue? I wonder what the situation is at the other end. What is the cost, do you think, to the revenue for the surcharge that the government wants to change by 1½ per cent a year for three years? Three hundred and seventy million dollars. Isn't it strange: almost equivalent— $70 million in it. They will be able to say, `We are treating the top and tail pretty much equally.' There is a much greater effect for those people at the bottom with the least capacity to look after themselves and to provide for their future when you compare them to people at the top.
Another comment by the member for Mitchell on planning for the future and the Intergenerational Report was that the Labor Party were terrible people—that we were going to try to delay by obstruction. If this bill goes to the Senate and we do not support it there and the others do not support it there, we would delay $370 million going into the coffers of the taxation department. That is what our obstruction would lead to—$370 million more to do good for the people of Australia. In fact, almost equivalently, you could directly provide the $300 million worth of consideration that is being given here in assistance to people on low incomes if you kept the surcharge as it is.
When the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, gave his response to the budget— from memory, two days after budget night— he said, `We will take what the government wants to do here, knocking down the higher income surcharge people. For the same amount of money, we have a different proposal, and the guts of that proposal is that we would be able to spread savings for people throughout the superannuation system, not just for those people at the top with the surcharge, and reduce the costs to them.' I will quote what he said, because this proposal is substantial:
Our alternative propositions for the use of the money are these: we can redirect the money earmarked for the few into cutting the superannuation tax for all Australians from the present 15 per cent to 13 per cent; or we can cut the tax to 11½ per cent for people over 40 years of age—the age when most people start getting serious about planning for their retirement. The last option would mean a cut of more than 25 per cent in superannuation contributions tax. It would add many thousands of dollars to everyone's retirement income whilst still being economically responsible. It would be a powerful incentive for Australians to invest in their own future, helping us to cope with our future needs. It is a fairer alternative.
I utterly endorse everything that he says there. There are other ways to do this. There are ways to do it that are not partial, that are not targeted to just that group of people at the top that this Treasurer decided to slug. He has decided to try to give them some kind of incentive to come back into the super system—or to make it look like the government is not being particularly harsh to people at the top.
If you look at the background materials to this bill, the Bills Digest—where the response of the Leader of the Opposition was quoted from—pulls no punches. If you remember, when the surcharge came in there was a cacophony from the industry, saying, `This is simply absurd, this is completely atrocious, this is really stupid. What you're imposing on the industry is the most insane and inane set of procedures, which will cost the superannuation industry money, time and effort and create turmoil—to very little effect, because you're going to lose so many people because of the surcharge.' The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation was looking into this bill, and the Bills Digest says that what the committee noted mostly was:
... its complex administration, clumsy assessment procedures and on-going administration costs that are borne not just by high income earners, but all superannuation fund members.
You would think that maybe, after that tidal wave of angst from the super community, this government might just listen to them on the practical problems of implementation. It has been a couple of years now, and have they learnt? No, they kept that in place. You would think that they might adopt a different model when they are looking at the other bill that we have here that deals with low-income earners. You would think it might just be possible that, having copped the problem, they might have decided that there were other ways of going about it—but what did they do instead? They said, `We are going to do this; that will be $300 million.' As the Bills Digest points out, there is a bit of a problem with this:
The Bill entrenches aspects of the superannuation surcharge by using its reporting system in the collection of information for assessing entitlement to Government co-contribution.
A reporting system that is a dud and has been known to be a dud—a complex dud—from the very start. The BillsDigest continues:
The superannuation surcharge has been criticised for its complex administration, clumsy assessment procedures and on-going administration costs that are borne not just by high income earners, but all superannuation fund members. Basing the Government co-contribution information provisions on the superannuation surcharge information collection and reporting mechanisms entrenches a much maligned and inefficient surcharge administration system.
Should we be surprised, though? Not with this government. They obviously do not take much notice of what their advisers might be telling them—what the people who have their heads screwed on in the Treasury and taxation departments might say about simplicity when it comes to the operation of the tax system and putting new systems in place. For both those who copped the surcharge and those who might benefit from this provision, you have to look at efficient ways of going about it to ensure that the revenue for the Commonwealth and the benefit to people that is supposed to come as a result of these changes is actually maximised. But we have seen example after example of a government that has not a blind clue about super and about what steps should be taken to have adequate income provision for the future through super in conjunction with the pension system.
If the government wants to argue that the Intergenerational Report is the basis for the changes that should be made, I have a message for the member for Mitchell and for the others: go back a generation—Labor was there before you. Labor was planning in this area and in the area of home and community care and aged care for the problems that would become manifest in the future and that needed to be properly dealt with. When we come back into government, we will clean up the inane, scrambled mess that has been created in the super area by this government. Right now we will support the measures in relation to the lower-income people but we will vote against this attempt to squeeze out of that dumb decision on the surcharge that the Treasurer made in the first place.
We will show that good policy is built on solid foundations. It is not built on the quicksand of a quick grab in the media and it is not built on the quicksand of the easy approach—running up a few symbols and trying to get measures into place that can be simply covered by flash words. Flash words will not help you when you are trying to put together a substantial system for Australia's future. You need planning, you need a sensible approach and you need to listen to the community, whether it is a community of people with a vested interest, such as those who have access to the rebate system at the bottom—the low-income earners, who here will get 10 times as much if they are earning $20,000 or less—(Time expired)
Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned.
Sitting suspended from 6.31 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2002-10-22,"—I rise to support the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2002 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2002. The bills basically involve the low-income earners contribution, which the government took to the electorate prior to the last election, and also the reduction of the superannuation surcharge rates, which will see them stepping down by 1½ per cent over each of the next three years. That is the purpose of these two bills. As I mention, they are enacting government election commitments. 
Before getting into the bodies of the bills, I would like to reflect on some of the remarks the member for Blaxland made in his contribution prior to our meal break for the evening. It is sad that sometimes a speech that seems designed to appeal to a branch meeting of the Labor Party comes in here masquerading as a thoughtful, considered contribution in a parliamentary debate. There are a number of things which the member for Blaxland said for which there is no evidence offered by him—none that can be located— that actually supports his claims. One of the two central claims from the member for Blaxland was that the Howard government has no superannuation policy, and I will come to that shortly. It seemed quite ironic, given the debate that we were having and the contribution which his speech was supposed to address. The other claim was that all we were doing was basically maintaining the Labor Party system. His conclusion from those two lines of argument was to support the Labor Party's decision to oppose these bills, which would seem in direct contradiction to the arguments he put forward. That is probably fortunate, because those arguments are spurious and I will outline why they are spurious. Firstly, if we had the Labor system that the member for Blaxland was arguing we have in place, we would not be talking about reducing the superannuation surcharge. I have not met anybody, in my seven years as an elected representative, that is fond of the superannuation surcharge. Nobody likes it. I do not even think that many people from the government go around proclaiming its virtue.
If we looked back to the time that surcharge was introduced, we would recall that it was part of a bundle of measures designed to address the black hole, the $10.3 billion budget deficit, that the Howard government inherited when it was elected in 1996. That was a $10.3 billion deficit on the back of assurances by the then Labor Treasurer and the Labor leadership, including the current Leader of the Opposition, that the budget was in surplus. I do not know anybody that actually believed that, but no-one had a real handle on the extent of the deficit. When the Howard government was elected it found there was a $10.3 billion deficit—$10.3 billion in one fiscal year gone on the Commonwealth Bankcard. The Howard government rightly sought to rectify that unsustainable financial position that the Labor Party had shifted the Commonwealth budget into in a very short time. The Prime Minister's undertaking at the time recognised what an enormous challenge of fiscal repair there was before the nation and before this parliament, and his government—a government of which I am very pleased to be a small part—was able to share the pain. I remember the debates in this House quite vividly, shortly after the 1996 election, when we were working out how to recover that deficit. The undertaking the Prime Minister and the Treasurer gave the nation was that everybody would make a contribution. The undertaking was that not one section of our community would be immune from making a contribution to repair the budget.
The superannuation surcharge targeted higher income earners. The superannuation surcharge added 15 per cent to contributions by people with an income above about $95,000—if my memory serves me correctly—on top of the 15 per cent superannuation tax that is paid. It was a revenue-raising measure. It was defensible in terms of equalising the benefits gained by Australian wage and salary earners in making sure that the discount on tax paid for superannuation contributions was not so inequitable. The 15 per cent tax on super contributions applied to everybody. It did not matter whether you were a modest income earner where your income tax rates were around 20 per cent— you paid 15 per cent on your superannuation contributions. That represented a five per cent discount. If you were a higher income earner paying 48c in the dollar on your superannuation contributions, you still paid 15 per cent on your superannuation contributions. There is an example of there being a 33 per cent gain or more for high-income earners for contributions to superannuation, whereas a lower income earner benefited by a five per cent discount. The surcharge made it slightly more equitable and generated some revenue to help to fill the Beazley black hole. That was the idea. It was not pretty, it was not terribly clever; it was designed to help the budget effort in a way that equalised the benefits in superannuation taxation.
At the time, the then leader of the Labor Party—Kim Beazley, for those that are interested—was challenged. On 24 March 1997 there was some toing-and-froing going on at question time, which often happens, between Mr Beazley and the Treasurer. Mr Beazley made an aside at the table saying that they were going to support the introduction of a superannuation surcharge—this surcharge that we now hear from the Labor Party is so evil but is so right that any move to reduce it is wrong—and that it was actually a Labor Party policy which was carried forward from the time when they were in office. None of those things are true. It was not in place because the budget black hole had not been created. It was introduced as an equity measure to help repair the budget. Now we are in a position where, through sound financial management, we can reduce the surcharge. That is what this is about. Although the Labor Party says there is no policy, that one example shows us that there is policy and there is thoughtfulness. What the government is doing tonight is part of the menu of things that have been done over seven years to try to make superannuation attractive, to make sure that government finances are sustainable and to put the nation on a better economic footing.
The surcharge reduction will ensure that superannuation remains attractive and encourages Australians to save for their retirement. As I mentioned earlier, it has got a step-down of 1½ per cent over each of the next three years from 1 July 2002. The maximum surcharge rate will be 13½ per cent for 2002-03, 12 per cent for 2003-04 and 10½ per cent for 2004-05 and succeeding years. That is what the legislation that is before us tonight is about. There is some finetuning going on to bring that surcharge reduction in with the law relating to a co-contribution for low-income earners, not with a general taxation law. Why? Because both measures are designed to encourage people to provide for their own retirement. They are two initiatives that make retirement savings provision more attractive for both higher and lower income earners, so it is right that they come together and it is right for them to be part of these bills. That is just an example of what has been done.
I want to tackle the other issue the member for Blaxland mentioned. He said that the Howard government has no policy. We know the tax concessions provided to superannuation make it the single largest tax expenditure item in the budget. It is worth about $9½ billion this financial year. I often bump into people in Frankston on the Mornington Peninsula in my electorate who say that we still tax superannuation too much, and I have some sympathy for that view. I must say, though, that although a $9½ billion discount is not perhaps what everyone wants it is none too shabby either. A $9½ billion discount is a genuine effort to encourage provision for retirement savings.
The policy platform that feeds tonight's debate is the initiatives announced by the government during the 2001 election in the policy that we know as `A Better Superannuation System'. That was aimed at enhancing the overall attractiveness of, accessibility to and security of superannuation. That policy built on a record of achievement by the government in retirement income policy and further demonstrated that the Howard government was serious about assisting Australians to build financial self-reliance in retirement. For those who seem to have missed all that, particularly the member for Blaxland, the measures in that policy covered splitting of superannuation contributions, where single-income families would have access to two eligible termination payment tax-free thresholds; two reasonable benefit limit arrangements in the same way as dual-income families; reducing superannuation and termination payment surcharge rates, which we are discussing here tonight; introducing a government co-contribution for low-income earners, the companion initiative in the bills we are debating cognately tonight; increasing the limit on full deductibility of superannuation contributions for self-employed people from $3,000 to $5,000 while maintaining a 75 per cent deductibility for amounts over that threshold; and reducing the tax on excessive components of the eligible termination payments from superannuation funds to lower the effective tax rate to no more than 48½ per cent. Other measures covered things like allowing working individuals aged 70 but less than 75 to make personal contributions to superannuation. Our law used to preclude mature-age people in that age bracket—people able and willing to contribute in the workplace—from contributing to their superannuation. That followed on from the government's earlier increase from 65 to 70 for voluntary contributions.
We are swimming in superannuation policy, which just illustrates the nonsense of the member for Blaxland's comments. The baby bonus can be contributed to superannuation. There are superannuation contributions of $3,000 per child for a three-year period. The quarterly payment of superannuation contributions by employers from 1 July 2003 will make those funds more secure and ensure that those payments are going through. Other issues are choice, the portability of superannuation and market-linked income streams, which the government has committed to examining to see whether they are a way forward. A number of policy initiatives have been built around Family Law Act amendments, including the ability to split superannuation benefits between married couples who separate. Other policies include superannuation spouse rebates and capital gains tax relief for small business proprietors using the proceeds from the sale of their business for retirement income purposes. There are a great many more policies. Frankly, when I did the research in response to the member for Blaxland's comments, I just about fell over when I looked at how much had gone on in this area.
We know that federal and state legislation requires employers to make provision for their employees' retirement. I have mentioned the superannuation surcharge step-down and how that is a timely and appropriate thing to do, given that we have done the hard work on restoring the integrity of the government's finances. Now that we are not in $10.3 billion deficit mode we are able to wind back that measure, which was introduced to remedy the deficit the former Labor government left us.
The second area is the government's contribution for low-income earners. That is really at the heart of this co-contribution bill. This legislation puts in place arrangements for the government to pay superannuation co-contributions to eligible low-income earners. This policy was part of the package put to the electorate before the last election. As I said, there were 13 reforms in that package, and this is one of its centrepiece initiatives. This bill will allow for a more generous government co-contribution for low-income earners. This means that, if a low-income earner chooses to make a personal contribution towards their superannuation, the government will match it. The bill sets out how this will be implemented. 
We anticipate that this measure alone will boost superannuation accounts for low-income earners by about $95 million next financial year and by up to $100 million to $105 million a year over the following two years. Combined with the other measures, it actually puts the option of improved savings and self-reliance in retirement into the hands of low-income earners. If we look back, we see the Labor Party saying, `Do it our way.' That is an interesting thing to hear when the member for Blaxland is actually saying that all of this is the Labor Party's work anyway. I have proven that that is nonsense.
Let us move on. This legislation will give low-income people who choose to make that contribution the incentive of having it matched by the government. It is a simple system; a whole new bureaucracy does not need to be put in place to make it happen. Under the package we are discussing tonight, the tax office will have account details provided by superannuation funds. Mr Deputy Speaker, they are the details that you and I just love being provided with. The tax office can tell us about our ballistic superannuation surcharge contributions and how they have rocketed up for another year. The income details for low-income tax returns are also with the ATO. It is a matching exercise: the ATO can make an assessment, decide where the co-contribution is to be paid and then make that payment directly into the fund of the low-income earner. There is no need for eligible people to fill out any more paperwork; all the tools needed to determine eligibility are within the tax office.
If the tax office is a little bit slow, the bills that we are discussing tonight actually provide for a penalty. Interest will be paid on contributions when the tax office is not as responsive as the legislation requires it to be. This ensures that low-income earners' retirement savings are not disadvantaged. These bills put those things in place. A minimum co-contribution of $20 applies, which is sensible. Why is it needed? It is required because the transactional costs of arranging the co-contribution should not exceed the value of the contribution. Its highest rate of matching is for people with incomes under $20,000 a year. For those people with part-time work or who have chosen not to work full time, this is a very attractive option and one which they can pursue. That co-contribution steps down as the income earner's income increases to $32,500. That makes good sense.
It makes better sense than what happened under the former government: it decided that, rather than pay people in take-home earnings, it would put money into superannuation. We are about actually providing the income earner with a choice: they can go down that pathway if they choose to, encouraged by the co-contribution incentive that we are discussing tonight. As I said, the instruments to make it happen are all in place. The Commissioner of Taxation will generally make those determinations and make the payment once all the information is received. Those co-contributions will be paid to the person's superannuation fund or retirement savings account. It is a sensible measure, and that is why I am very supportive of it.
In the community that I represent, retirement incomes matter. We have a large retirement community. We have a large number of people on the doorstep of retirement because our area is so attractive to mature-aged people. These measures are designed to provide encouragement and an incentive for those people. There have been incentives put in place for low-income or self-funded retirees through the health care card extension and other measures that were announced in the lead-up to the last election. What we are seeing is a menu of incentives and encouragement to make providing for one's own retirement accessible, attractive and something that is rewarded. In this case, we have co-contributions. I suppose making the superannuation surcharge less distasteful can be characterised as an incentive. 
I have outlined a number of the measures the government is putting in place in the area of superannuation. In addition, people who are self-funded or lower income retirees often do not have any more discretionary expenditure than somebody who is on a pension, but they miss out on a lot of the concessions. The Howard government has led the way by introducing some concessions through the health care card system that deal with pharmaceutical arrangements and the like. The government has gone forward with a further package of measures which requires the cooperation of the states and territories to extend some of the state based concessions to those lower income self-funded retirees. It is not having a lot of luck with the states and territories: they do not seem too interested in doing those things. Even just last week I received a letter from a constituent lamenting the fact that council rate rebates have not gone up for the last decade or thereabouts. There is plenty of work to be done there and, as I said, the government needs the cooperation of and some assistance from the state and territory governments.
My final comment, though, is perhaps a sign of what we could look forward to in the future. I know the Labor Party are a bit of a policy-free zone at the moment; maybe this is an idea that they might choose to think about. In superannuation, we have lower income copayment measures here. Something that I am particularly interested in is late income contributions. There are, in my community, a lot of people who had their lives ruined by the recession we had to have. You remember that recession that put a million people out of work and ruined many small business people's lives and financial security. Their retirement savings were embedded in their business and, when their business went belly up through this recession we had to have, their retirement savings went up with it.
For those people, there already are some quite encouraging measures for employer contributions. I will not go into those tonight, but the generosity of the tax treatment improves as the working person gets older. That is great for employer contributions. What I would like to see is employee contributions for people nearing the end of their working lives who have not accumulated sufficient retirement savings, a nest egg, to give them that freedom and independence in retirement, and that we give them some assistance. Maybe that is something we can look at for the future.

"Corcoran, Ann, MP",ALP,2002-10-22,"— The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 and the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2002 are essentially about reducing the superannuation surcharge for high-income earners and introducing a co-contribution for low-income earners. Let me talk about the superannuation surcharge first. The super surcharge was introduced by this government in 1996 and, at that time, the Treasurer said:
The measures I am announcing tonight are designed to make superannuation fairer.
A major deficiency of the current system is that tax benefits for superannuation are overwhelmingly biased in favour of high income earners. For a person on the top tax rate, superannuation is a 33 percentage point tax concession while a person earning $20 000 receives a 5 percentage point tax concession. High income earners can take added advantage through salary sacrifice arrangements that are not available to lower income earners.
The Government is remedying this situation.
...					...					...
For high income earners the superannuation contributions will still be highly concessional but are more in line with concessions to middle and low income earners.
In other words, the government recognised that the high-income earners were receiving a tax benefit that was out of kilter with the benefits available to middle- and low-income earners, and the government was prepared to do something about it. By now proposing to reduce that surcharge, the government is, by default, saying that it is now okay to increase benefits to higher income earners at a significant cost to the taxpayer—something of the order of $20 million per year. There has been no justification put forward by the government for reducing the surcharge for high-income earners, who make up about three per cent of wage earners, whilst not offering any tax cuts for middle- and low-income earners.
I should make the point that this tax break comes at a time when the government is asking everyone to pay a significant increase for PBS medicines because of its budgetary problems. ACOSS has pointed out that $5 billion per year is spent on tax breaks for super contributions—about the same as the annual cost of the PBS. Of this $5 billion, about half—that is, $2.5 billion—goes to one-sixth of our employees: those earning over $50,000 per year or more. ACOSS goes on to point out that the generous tax breaks for high-income earners are both unfair and wasteful. The rationale for spending taxpayers' money on tax breaks for superannuation is to encourage savings for retirement. Those on high incomes are likely to save for retirement without tax incentives and are unlikely to be eligible for the aged pension. Therefore, ACOSS argues—and it is hard to disagree with it—offering high-income earners tax incentives is a waste of our scarce resource, the taxpayers' dollar.
It is also interesting to note that this surcharge is one of the most expensive taxes to administer. Something like the equivalent of 30 per cent of the revenue raised in the first year was spent by the superannuation funds in set-up costs and administering the scheme. It remains a very expensive tax, and this cost is borne by all members of the fund. These costs are not reduced one iota by a reduction in the surcharge, so there is no advantage here in the cut but actually an increase in the cost per dollar raised.
The Labor Party has made two suggestions for a better way of using taxpayers' money to encourage retirement savings, and both of these options leave the surcharge as it is. The first option is to reduce the super contributions tax, for all those who pay it, from the existing 15 per cent to 13 per cent. This gives a tax cut to everyone in superannuation, regardless of their income. The second option is to reduce the contribution tax from the existing 15 per cent to 11.5 per cent for those aged 40 and over, which also benefits everyone over the age of 40, regardless of their income. These options will be revenue neutral if two things happen: firstly, if the current proposal to cut the surcharge is dropped; and, secondly, if the foreshadowed proposal to allow super contribution splitting—which effectively doubles the reasonable benefits limits—is opposed when this bill emerges later this year.
The second bill is the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2002. The government's proposal is that it will pay superannuation co-contributions for eligible low-income earners. The co-contribution will replace the existing taxation rebate for personal superannuation contributions made by low-income earners but will be more generous. The objective of the proposal is to encourage low-income earners to make superannuation contributions or to increase the level of the contributions that they already make. This will, of course, boost their savings for retirement. The government co-contribution will match personal superannuation contributions made on or after 1 July 2002 by eligible people with incomes of less than $32,500 per year. The maximum co-contribution is $1,000 per year, and that is payable on incomes of $20,000 or less. To be eligible for the co-contribution, a person will need to have employer superannuation support, be aged less than 71 years on 30 June of the year in question and not be eligible for release of benefits upon permanent departure from Australia.
Whilst I cannot argue with any proposal to assist those on low incomes I have to question the usefulness of this particular scheme. A person on a low income is not often able to find discretionary income from which to make a payment into their superannuation fund—as attractive as it may be to make that payment. Most people on low incomes are flat out covering their immediate and daily costs. My guess is that not many real low-income earners will be able to take advantage of this scheme. It is more likely that this scheme will be used by those on low incomes who are financially supported by others and therefore can afford to contribute. For instance, a person working part time and in a family which is relatively well off can afford to contribute and take advantage of this scheme for themselves and their family. It has also been suggested that family members will contribute on behalf of the low-income earner, and again the family will be able to take advantage of this scheme. This is not the purpose of the scheme, but it is hard to see how this misuse of the scheme can be avoided as the legislation stands at the moment.
I support the amendment that the Labor Party will be moving to include a provision that will require the government to monitor the operation of the co-contribution arrangements. The purposes of the amendment are to ensure that only those who are genuinely in need receive the co-contribution and to establish the take-up rate of the scheme by those in the target group.
In summary, firstly, I can find no justification for giving the high-income earner a tax break whilst at the same time not offering the same benefit to others. I support the amendments, which offer much more sensible inducements to save. Secondly, whilst I have no objection to the co-contribution proposal, I do question the likely effectiveness of the scheme. I support the amendment that will ensure that the co-contributions do actually go to those intended to benefit from them, and that the take-up rate is measured to test the effectiveness of the scheme once it is under way.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2002-10-22,"—I am delighted to speak on the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2002 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2002. Governance ultimately must deal with three phases of our existence. Firstly, we have to deal with the short term. In political terms, that is a three-year existence, a term of government. That is all about maintaining and promoting a nation's competitiveness. Secondly, we look to the period of 10 years, of a decade. That is about working to promote the long-term growth of a country. Thirdly, governance is about the intergenerational questions of a generation of 30 years and about the sustainability of all of the different systems which go to the core of making up a nation's viability.
The Intergenerational Report compiled by the Treasury prior to the last budget set out very clearly that, when you look at the long term, at the 30- to 40-year period, Australia is ageing. That has a dramatic impact on our future as a country. According to the Intergenerational Report, by 2042 the proportion of the population 65 years or older will have doubled. In my own electorate of Flinders, from an analysis we did recently, we expect that the number of people over the age of 60 will increase from 20 per cent of the population now to 35 per cent by 2021. These figures create genuine risks and challenges for the future sustainabilty of our economic systems and our social welfare systems. 
In that context, it is critical that the government takes action now to prepare for the higher costs of an ageing population. Central to that action is the promotion of a sustainable national savings ratio and national savings program. These bills assist in achieving that exact goal of a sustainable national savings program. They do that in two ways. First, they fulfil the government's commitment to assist lower income earners in saving for retirement. That is a laudable goal, and it is being fulfilled here, now, in this chamber, at this time. It is opposed to the generalised notion of asset based welfare—which does have laudable intent—proposed by the member for Werriwa, which does not contain the practical, simple suggestions which are being fulfilled in this bill in this place on this day. 
The second objective which is being pursued through these bills is a reduction in the surcharge on employer superannuation contributions for higher income earners. That also goes to the sustainability of the system. The heart of that reform is about increasing the desirability of making contributions for those at the upper end of the system, which in turn makes it more likely that they will be better prepared for their retirement, which in turn means that there will be more available for others to draw from the social welfare system. If you increase the pressure on the social welfare system, you decrease the ability of the country to provide for all. This works by allowing people to provide for themselves—which is a goal that we as a party seek to pursue—and also, in achieving that end, by freeing up the system to provide as well as possible for all of the others.
In looking at those objectives, I want to proceed in three stages. Firstly, I want to examine the government achievements and initiatives in superannuation and retirement income policy. Secondly, I want to examine the provisions of this bill. Thirdly, I want to examine the advantages of these two bills which are being discussed together.
Looking at the first of these, what have been the key government achievements in superannuation and retirement income policy? First, there was the introduction in January 2002 of a twice-yearly indexation of Commonwealth superannuation pensions to take account of inflation. It is expected that this will result in a real increase in benefits for around 100,000 pensioners. Second, there will be capital gains tax relief to permit revenue from the sale of a small business to be used for retirement income purposes. That is a tremendous benefit to small business owners and those who help to drive the creation of jobs throughout our economy. Third, there will be capital gains tax changes to allow nominal capital gains of superannuation funds to be taxed at the concessional rate of 10 per cent. This is where the assets are held for a minimum of one year. Fourth, the introduction of new investment rules will ensure that superannuation savings are not put at risk—an important prudential requirement to ensure that there is sufficient protection for superannuation savings. Fifth, there will be higher tax rebates for seniors. Add that to the establishment of a pension bonus scheme which entitles those who remain in the work force and who defer the age pension to a tax-free lump sum and that is a very important set of initiatives.
In addition, a series of proposed initiatives are now beginning to be fulfilled. These were set out in the 2001 election policy `A better superannuation system'. The initiatives include, firstly, a commitment to lower income earners in saving for retirement. That commitment is fulfilled by these bills today. Secondly, there is a pledge to reduce the surcharge on employer super contributions for higher income earners. At present, the surcharge applies in relation to employees earning over $90,500, with the surcharge gradually being phased in until those earning approximately $110,000 and above are subject to a maximum charge of 15 per cent. It is this surcharge, which is over and above the tax that is normally paid, that the government is committed to reducing to 10.5 per cent. That initiative is being addressed in this package of bills. Third, the government proposed to increase the maximum level of fully deductible superannuation contributions by self-employed people from $3,000 to $5,000. Fourthly, the government proposed a requirement that employers make at least quarterly superannuation contributions from 1 July 2003. All of those conditions are critical to ensuring the long-term health and care of our superannuation and retirement income systems.
How do these two bills specifically work? The first of the two bills is the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2002. Under this bill, a scheme will be introduced whereby the government will make co-contributions to the superannuation funds of low-income earners. This is a tremendous step forward. The co-contribution will work by replacing the existing tax rebate for personal superannuation contributions, but it will be more generous. The maximum tax rebate is currently $100. The maximum co-contribution will be $1,000 per annum. As a result, the government will be spending an estimated $270 million over the next three years to assist low-income earners to save for their retirement. That means people in Dromana, Rosebud, Rye, Hastings, Somerville, Pearcedale, Baxter, Lang Lang, Cowes and Ventnor will benefit. Those most in need will be able to prepare for their long-term future. The bill deals with eligibility for co-contributions, the Australian Taxation Office information gathering arrangements, the level of the co-contribution, the method of payment and the review of decisions—all of which are important and necessary steps.
The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill proposes to amend and reduce the surcharge rate on employer contributions, where they are to superannuation funds or termination payments, for high-income earners. In particular, the surcharge amendments will result in the maximum surcharge level being reduced from 15 per cent to 10½ per cent over three years. Importantly, in looking at the long term, the government has agreed to review the surcharge levels after three years to establish whether further adjustments of the surcharges are required.
What are the advantages of these bills? Why are they important? Firstly, as I mentioned at the outset, the co-contributions bill assists those most in need of incentives and assistance in saving for retirement. It provides not just assistance but a regime which encourages people to save for their retirement who otherwise might have no ability to do so. It will not solve all the problems. The member for Isaacs implied that it was less than perfect because it would not guarantee that everybody had a rich and prosperous future. It might not do that, but it does give people a much greater ability than they have ever had before to save for their retirement, particularly those who come from the lowest income brackets within our society. Secondly, it represents a fulfilment of the government's commitments to those who are disadvantaged. Thirdly, the ATO information gathering, which will be along existing lines, will help to ensure that the contribution is matched and carried out in full.
What are the benefits of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill? The critical thing is that the surcharge reduction will increase the level of superannuation savings. This will have a benefit for those who receive the reduction but, importantly, it will also increase national savings. That in turn will create an additional pressure causing interest rates to fall and investment to increase and will help to generate wealth, which will benefit everyone in the country. It is a critical step in that, by encouraging self-help, it also encourages a regime which brings national wealth and benefits to all. It fulfils a government commitment to improve the superannuation system and to counter the increasing costs of an ageing population. Above all else, it will ensure that those in higher income brackets, who can afford to save, will save sufficiently for their retirement so that they will not draw on the system, they will not seek more than their fair share and they will contribute to the stock of national wealth and national savings.
Ultimately, these bills are about a generational concern for people 20, 30 and 40 years from now. This is exactly what government should be doing. The bills fit with the Howard government's plans to examine the intergenerational aspects of our health care system, our economic system, our aged care system and our social welfare system, in addition to the environment. Put together, these bills are an important step forward in ensuring that 20, 30 and 40 years from now subsequent generations will live in a country which takes care of its elderly and which is still better equipped to ensure that the economy is productive and that there are jobs, health care and a sustainable welfare system for all Australians.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Jackson, Sharryn, MP",ALP,2002-10-22,"— Sometimes I wonder if we are actually speaking on the same legislation in this place, because I too intended to address both the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2002 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2002. Whilst I acknowledge that the bills between them contain two principle measures—that is, firstly, a reduction in the surcharge tax on superannuation for high-income earners and, secondly, the introduction of a government co-contribution for low-income earners—I have grave doubts that the kind of nirvana suggested by the previous speaker and government member, the member for Flinders, will come about.
It is our view that the surcharge reduction is highly inequitable. Frankly, it provides a tax cut to those who earn in excess of $90,527 in the financial year 2002-03. As I understand it, the figures that were provided to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which recently conducted an inquiry on related superannuation and tax laws amendments, identified that the group likely to benefit from this tax cut represents approximately four per cent of working Australians. It is interesting that it was the Howard government that introduced the surcharge tax in 1996. As other opposition speakers have pointed out, this was despite the fact that, in his pre-election commitments, the Prime Minister promised that a Howard government would not introduce any new taxes. I guess I could say that, as usual, people say one thing prior to an election and another thing after it. This is a classic example of that.
The recent report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation dealt specifically with the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No. 2) 2002 and the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Amendment Bill 2002. Originally, when the Senate committee commenced its examination, the reduction of the surcharge was proposed in these pieces of legislation. It was not until after public hearings on the issue were due to commence that the government sought to make changes to ensure that the reduction in the surcharge was implemented in the legislation along with the introduction of the co-contribution. As a consequence of that, the Senate report and the submissions received by that committee dealt with the issue of the surcharge. One thing that was very clear to me from reading the report was that serious objections to the surcharge were raised. In particular—and this is something that I understand the industry has been complaining about for some time—the surcharge is extremely complex and is an administrative burden on many of the superannuation funds as well as on the Australian Taxation Office. There is nothing in this legislation before the parliament which in any way seeks to address that administrative complexity. Also, I have grave concerns that all superannuation fund members are meeting the administrative costs of this surcharge. In other words, the administrative burden translates into higher administrative costs, those costs are defrayed across all members of the superannuation fund and, as a consequence of that, all members, including low-income members, are contributing unnecessarily to the administration costs. That is inequitable and something that I would have hoped the government would have seen the need to address.
As other speakers have already said, Labor have proposed alternatives to the measures before the House which we say are fairer and more equitable and will add thousands of dollars to Australians' retirement incomes. I will come to those two options shortly. I would urge the government to redirect the Treasurer's superannuation tax cuts from the wealthy—or, in other words, the few—to all superannuation fund members who pay the contributions tax. As I indicated, Labor proposed in the budget reply two alternative propositions which were revenue neutral to the cost of the government's proposal to reduce the surcharge tax. The first option was to cut the superannuation contributions tax for all Australians who pay it from the present 15 per cent to 13 per cent, thereby assisting the retirement incomes of all Australians rather than just those few who are lucky enough to have incomes in excess of $90,527 per annum. The second option, which I believed was also worth significant consideration, was the proposal to cut to 11½ per cent the tax for people who are aged 40 and over. Either option would have added many thousands of dollars to the retirement incomes of many more Australians than these measures will. In his earlier comments, the member for Kingston, I think, gave specific examples in practical terms of how our alternative proposals would have impacted on Australian workers and how they would have meant that tax cuts flowed to a far greater number of people than those proposed in the government's legislation.
I turn to the second measure in the bill, the co-contributions measure. Whilst the Labor Party is supporting this measure in these circumstances, I think it is fair to say that it is a pale imitation of the scheme originally proposed by Labor. The current government proposal will, on the best estimates, see something like 75,000 people receive the full $1,000—and this is from a total pool of some 4.4 million people with incomes of less than $32,500. It is my very great concern that very few, if any, will benefit from the co-contribution change.
The proposal originally put forward in May 1995 by the then ALP government, in a statement called `Savings for our future', included a proposal for government to match contributions of up to three per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings. In today's terms, I believe that is about $1,342 per annum. That did not phase out until a member achieved a wage of twice the average weekly ordinary time earnings or, in today's terms, $89,492. It is worth noting that in the lead-up to the 1996 election the current Treasurer committed an incoming coalition government to implementing the 1995 ALP co-contribution proposals. As we know, the government subsequently reneged on that promise and implemented a savings rebate which, as history records, was quickly abolished.
I am a great supporter of co-contributions as an incentive to low-income earners to make voluntary contributions to super, and that was part of Labor's original framework for the Australian retirement income system—the so-called three pillars. The first pillar is the age pension, modest though it still is. The second pillar is compulsory contributions for employees. I was active in many workplaces during 1986, 1987 and 1988. When the compulsory contribution was made good in the 1986 national wage case, we negotiated the implementation of those payments in many workplaces in exchange for a cost of living adjustment to wages. That compulsory contribution was subsequently extended by the superannuation guarantee. The third pillar is the very important part of voluntary contributions towards retirement savings for individuals— and it is exactly that: a decision for the individual. It is entirely proper for governments to look at incentives to assist and encourage people to make payments. What we have as a consequence of the changes introduced by the Labor government after 1983 and through the early 1990s is recognised as a world-class best practice model for retirement incomes. I have to say—and excuse the pun—that the current government are Johnny-come-latelies in the area of superannuation and that their tinkering with the framework of retirement incomes has not and will not substantially improve the system.
Other speakers have talked about the thousands of workers, if not more, who will benefit from the co-contribution. When you look at the annual incomes where this co-contribution will apply, you really have to ask yourself whether people are still in touch with the real life situation for struggling families. I know that for many of the families that I deal with in my electorate of Hasluck who are on incomes of around $32,500, it is a struggle on a weekly and fortnightly basis to meet the everyday costs of living, quite apart from looking at where extra or additional funds may come from to make a co-contribution to their superannuation scheme. 
I urge the government to monitor the impact of this measure which, as I have indicated, is supported by Labor. A little bit is better than nothing, but it worries me that it will have a very limited impact and that the real life situation for most struggling families is that they are not going to be able to make the voluntary contribution that would be matched by the government under this proposed co-contribution measure. I know that other speakers will talk about requiring the government to closely monitor the operation of the co-contribution arrangements so that those who are genuinely in need receive the co-contribution and so that the proportion of the target group who are accessing the co-contribution is established. If my fears are realised and very few low-income earners are in that position, I hope that the government will immediately return to the House and propose further amendments which will ensure that this target group, which is the apparent concern of so many people here, do in fact gain the benefits of improved retirement incomes.
I have talked about the framework that was introduced by Labor and about the current system. I have one further concern about the way in which this operates and it stems from the difficulties of a number of my constituents who are not enjoying the second pillar of the retirement income system, which is the superannuation guarantee charge. Given the role of the ATO in the enforcement and administration of that, and recognising the role they will play in the co-contribution measure, I think that we need to have a good look at how this system works. I have asked a question on notice of the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer in this place—
—Best of luck.
—Yes; one day, hopefully, she will answer. On our research we understand that approximately 28 per cent, or some 216,000, of the current 800,000 employers in Australia have not paid their employees' superannuation guarantee contributions correctly, and that means that there are potentially millions of workers out there who are trying to get some justice in the superannuation guarantee area. 
Senator Nick Sherry, the shadow spokesman in this area, has reported to the Senate that the tax office received some 11,000 complaints about unpaid superannuation in the year 2001 alone and that it had admitted that the amount of outstanding superannuation guarantee payments is at least $116 million. This lost superannuation not only has a devastating effect on the individuals concerned but will have a significant impact on Australian taxpayers, as ultimately it will mean a greater reliance on the pension at a time when the Australian community will be least able to afford it. As I have previously said, this is a significant issue for Australian families, particularly for some of those families in my electorate of Hasluck. They are people on very low incomes who, if they can find the funds to make a voluntary contribution to superannuation, may be eligible for the co-payment under this proposal. They are missing out on thousands if not millions of dollars in the superannuation guarantee area because of a failure to properly enforce the legislation or see that it is properly complied with.
I urge the government to address this area because if we are serious about ensuring appropriate retirement incomes for Australian workers then we need to make sure that we have in place a system where, if your employer goes bust, your retirement future is protected. Rather than have a priority which is to see the amount of tax on superannuation contributions paid by high-income earners lowered, we should be doing something to enhance the retirement income of ordinary working Australians. We know that those people who are missing out on the SGC include thousands of casual, part-time and seasonal workers, many of whom will never be in a position to make voluntary contributions to superannuation. I have already spoken about the difficulties that those employees have when they try to chase up where their payments are through the Australian Taxation Office. What I believe is desperately needed, and what I hope the government will give some consideration to, is an agency that has the resources and the will to take on offending employers by prosecuting them for recovery of unpaid benefits that, in many cases, go back to when the superannuation guarantee was introduced in 1992.
I have spoken briefly about the alternative Labor options. This area of superannuation is an incredibly important policy response to the consequences of our ageing population. The framework that the Labor government put in place in the eighties and early nineties was far more visionary and real in terms of the benefits to ordinary working Australians than the kinds of measures we understand the government think are important as a consequence of their Intergenerational Report. That is why, in this area of superannuation, we need to be absolutely certain that the people who are the targets of legislation like the co-contributions measure actually receive the benefits. I urge the government to lift their game in this area and make the retirement income system work.
The final group I would like to address some remarks to are the Democrats. I have concerns about what appears to be a shifting position by the Democrats in respect of this legislation. Originally, the Democrats supported a motion from Labor which called on the government to withdraw the measure of reducing the surcharge. I understand from recent media reports that it appears that the Democrats have done a bit of a backflip or made a change in their policy and are now set to deliver the wealthy a tax windfall while leaving many working Australians with nothing. That is one of the consequences of this proposal. In my closing comments I urge the Democrats to reconsider their position. We ought to be redirecting the changes from this windfall to the wealthy to the benefit of all Australian workers and their retirement incomes.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2002-10-22,"—In the context of the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2002 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2002, let me remind the House of the International Monetary Fund's latest report on Australia. It makes impressive reading. The IMF has concluded that the Australian economy has continued to grow strongly despite the global economic slowdown during 2001, the fiscal position is sound and growth is expected to remain at about four per cent in 2002-03. More importantly, the commentary provided by the IMF's analysts should be considered in the context of future economic policy making. That commentary includes the observation:
... comprehensive reforms of the tax, income support and industrial relations systems will help to sustain relatively favourable growth prospects over the medium term and to ensure that all Australian partake in the benefits.
The report goes on:
The staff suggested that consideration be given to lowering the top marginal personal income tax rate ...
I must say I agree entirely with that recommendation. The IMF also observed:
... relative to other advanced economies, Australia appears to be well positioned to deal with the budgetary implications of population ageing. The combination of a means-tested public pension system with a compulsory private (superannuation) system is expected to provide high replacement rates for the population and stimulate private savings.
That is certainly true, and the superannuation reforms being proposed by this government will consolidate Australia's position to the benefit of taxpayers and retirees. I want to mention self-funded retirees for a moment. Last Friday I was pleased to be invited to speak at the national conference of the Association of Independent Retirees, held in Perth. In my speech I considered the changes that we anticipate to the profile of the Australian population. The proportion of people aged 65 years and over is projected to grow from 12.4 per cent in 2001 to 21.9 per cent, nearly 22 per cent, in 2031—that is, from 2.4 million older Australians to 5.05 million. In 20 years time, the population aged over 65 will be growing at three times the rate of the population aged between 15 and 64. Based on these projections, in 50 years time one-quarter of the Australian population could be aged 65 and over.
Similar and more particular projections are envisaged in the western suburbs of Perth, in my electorate of Curtin. Within 10 years, more than one in five residents of the western suburbs of Perth will be aged over 60. I think that too often this phenomenon is described as a problem. This is a mischaracterisation; rather, the changing demography of Australia is a challenge to public policy makers. As has been noted, `an older Australia doesn't have to be a poorer one'.
In order to enjoy an affluent lifestyle, older Australians will need to be committed to self-funded retirement. Today's workers, especially those entering the work force, will need to maintain one eye on their long-term financial futures. But if self-funded retirement is to be encouraged, then self-funded retirees must be rewarded for their choices. For far too many years, older Australians who provided for their own retirement incomes were regarded as the exceptions, and as exceptions their public policy wishes could be safely ignored by governments more comfortable with an old-fashioned model based on universal and parsimonious welfare pensions. In the future, self-funded retirees—whether partially or fully self-funded—will be in the majority. In 1986 only two in five Australian employees had some form of superannuation. Due to the superannuation guarantee paid by employees, that figure is now around 98 per cent of employees with leave entitlements and 72 per cent of casual employees. In fact, more than half of all employed people aged over 40 and earning $30,000 or more annually have gone beyond the guarantee to make a personal contribution to superannuation savings.
The demographic challenge facing Australia is the crest of a wave that has been building for decades. Over the past century, Australians have added an extra 20 years to their life expectancy. In 100 years we have become a particularly urbanised nation and in the 100 years to come we will experience all the changes that will flow from quantum leaps in science and technology. This is a challenge for governments but also an opportunity. Access Economics, analysing the likely effects of these changes, has advised that an increase in work force participation of just 10 per cent of 55- to 70-year-olds will cancel out the additional costs of an ageing Australia. We as a community need to take a new approach to working, develop a mature age employment strategy and remove barriers to participation in the work force based on age. So the current debate on superannuation, retirement incomes and future social policy is very important.
The two bills before the House fulfil election commitments given by the coalition last year and will ensure that superannuation is more attractive and more easily accessible. The Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill will provide for a superannuation co-contribution to those Australians with lower incomes. As such, the co-contribution replaces the present $100 taxation rebate for private contributions made by low-income earners. By contrast, the co-contribution is to a maximum of $1,000. Furthermore, low-income earners not entitled to claim a deduction for contributions will be eligible to receive the co-contribution provided they meet the relevant eligibility criteria. These criteria will ensure that the government co-contribution will match personal contributions made from the beginning of this financial year by people with incomes less than $32,500 per annum. The maximum rebate is payable to persons with incomes less than $20,000 per annum. For each dollar that a person earns over $20,000 per annum, the accessible co-contribution is reduced by 8c. A $20 minimum co-contribution will apply. 
The income test includes assessable income and reportable fringe benefits, as per the existing rebate, and persons must be aged less than 71 on 30 June of the year in which the contributions were made. Those seeking the co-contribution must also be ineligible to access the release of superannuation benefits upon permanent departure overseas. Small business operators will be able to continue accessing a tax deduction on personal contributions, and it is the government's intention to raise the fully deductible amount by $2,000 to $5,000 per annum. In order that all eligible persons receive the co-contribution, the tax office will assess and pay the co-contribution directly to a person's superannuation fund on the basis of tax returns lodged with the ATO. While an eligible person may need to answer additional questions on their tax return, they will not need to specifically apply for the rebate. The co-contribution represents an investment in sound retirement policy. The budget papers indicate that between 2003 and 2006 the co-contribution will cost the Commonwealth a net $270 million.
The second bill, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill, amends a number of taxation and superannuation acts as a consequence of the co-contribution measure. It also makes a very important and most welcome change to the superannuation surcharge. I will not mince words here: I think that the surcharge itself is inappropriate law. I was not a member of this parliament when the surcharge was introduced and, had I been the member for Curtin at that time, I most certainly would have argued against its adoption. I well understand the budgetary requirements that drove the adoption of the surcharge in 1996. Nevertheless, I believe that the surcharge was an inappropriate mechanism by which to raise revenue, given the importance of savings integrity in the Australian economy. Since 1998 I have personally lobbied to remove the surcharge or at least to mitigate its effects. I was therefore most pleased that in this year's federal budget the Treasurer confirmed that the federal government would reduce the 15 per cent surcharge rate by one-tenth for each of the next three financial years; that is, the rate will be 13.5 per cent in 2002-03, 12 per cent in 2003-04 and 10.5 per cent in 2004-05 and thenceforth. This means $50 million will be returned to Australian taxpayers in 2003-04, $120 million in 2004-05 and $200 million in 2005-06.
After three years the government will review the surcharge to determine if additional reforms are necessary. This measure will encourage increased savings and greater self-reliance on the part of Australian retirees. It will be of obvious benefit to those persons on whom the surcharge is imposed. In this regard I should note that this reduction in the surcharge rate is not a free kick to higher income earners, merely a partial return of the extra taxation extracted from them by way of the surcharge. To believe, as some members of the opposition do, that this measure is a reversal of the Robin Hood principle is analogous to a thief returning a wallet to his victim, leaving change for the bus and then asking for a thankyou note. I commend both bills to the House.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2002-10-22,"—I am pleased to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 and I also support the second reading amendment moved by the shadow Assistant Treasurer in relation to this bill. This bill and the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2002 propose two changes to superannuation. The first is a government co-contribution for those low-income Australians who are able to make voluntary contributions to super. The second is the reduction of the surcharge tax that applies to the contributions of high-income earners. We on the Labor side of the House fully support the low-income co-contribution but we believe that there are higher priorities in superannuation than a tax cut for the wealthy few. We welcome the government's decision to provide a co-contribution of up to $1,000 for low-income earners who make voluntary contributions. This will be dollar for dollar for those with incomes of less than $20,000 a year, with a reduced co-contribution for those earning up to $32,500. It is interesting that the Liberal government have chosen to call this proposal a co-contribution, almost in memory of their short-sighted decision to drop Labor's co-contribution, despite costing it into their first budget. Labor's co-contribution would have provided an extra three per cent, a government contribution, on top of the nine per cent employer contribution required by Labor's superannuation guarantee. This would have benefited all low- and middle-income earners, whether they could afford to make voluntary contributions or not. While it is but a pale imitation of Labor's co-contribution, we support the government's proposal and hope that low-income Australians will use it to increase their retirement savings. I hope that, when the time comes to vote on this legislation, the government will accept Labor's sensible amendments removing the surcharge reduction and allow the co-contribution to pass.
The coalition government introduced the surcharge tax in the 1997 budget. At the time it was presented as an equity measure to make super fairer by requiring those on high incomes to pay more tax. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, during his macarena interview with Kerri-Anne Kennerley, even went so far as to say:
On Budget night the first Treasurer in history— me—stood up and put a surcharge in respect to high income earners and applied it to himself and every other politician; you know, we're the good guys in relation to this.
Not surprisingly given the record of this government, the Treasurer's tune has changed. Presumably after complaints from their own branch members and supporters in blue-ribbon seats, the Liberal government have decided to reduce the surcharge by a third, at a cost of $370 million over three years. According to the Minister for Revenue, Senator Coonan, the reduction in the surcharge is essential to `encourage greater saving for retirement'. However, therein lies the fundamental contradiction in the government's package. Their emphasis is on providing incentives for voluntary retirement savings. This is the principle behind the low-income co-contribution but it is a principle lost on the government in relation to the surcharge. The surcharge applies to employer contributions, including compulsory contributions for those on an adjustable taxable income of more than $90,500. In other words, a high-income individual is not required to make any additional contributions to gain a substantial benefit from this tax cut. What this boils down to is that under this legislation the wealthiest four per cent of Australians are guaranteed a tax cut while those on less than $32,500 need to find the money to make voluntary contributions to get any benefit. Those earning more than $32,500 but less than $90,500 get nothing. Let me tell the Treasurer that there are not too many people in my electorate of Braddon, on the north-west coast of Tasmania, and in the seat of my colleague the member for Lyons who earn more than $32,500. Very few earn more than $90,500.
Labor believe there is a better way, a fairer way. Labor will support the co-contribution but we cannot in good conscience, particularly in the current climate, support a tax cut directed solely to high-income Australians. At a time when the Treasurer has lost $1 billion in taxpayers' money on currency markets and wants to jack up the cost of medicines on the PBS and when the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, wants young Australians to pay thousands of dollars more than they do already to go to university, the government has not made the case for a tax cut for the top four per cent of employees. Instead, Labor propose to use the savings from opposing this tax cut for wealthy Australians and other unfair and unnecessary changes to superannuation to cut the contributions tax that applies to all Australians whose employers make super contributions on their behalf.
In advocating Labor's fairer alternative, I would like to pay a special tribute to my colleague and fellow resident of the village of Forth on the north-west coast of Tasmania, Senator Nick Sherry. I am sure all on this side of the House would agree that Nick has done a magnificent job so far as our spokesperson on superannuation. Nick has a keen understanding of how super operates and, more importantly, of the needs and concerns of ordinary working Australians as they prepare for retirement. Nick, as our shadow minister responsible for this area, has produced a series of careful yet visionary policy options on retirement incomes, and his options on the contributions tax are no exception.
We on this side of the House propose to cut the tax to either 13 per cent for all fund members or 11.5 per cent for those aged 40 and over. This second option is designed specifically to address the problem faced by thousands of Australian workers of the baby boomer generation who will not have enough superannuation to retire on because they have received super for only part of their working lives, and then only—and let this be remembered—because Labor showed the vision necessary to introduce a superannuation guarantee in the first place. This problem is clear not only from a recent report by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling but from much closer to home in the inquiries that my colleagues and I receive from ordinary Australians worried about what they are going to retire on. 
My experience in Braddon suggests that many fellow north-west coasters are deeply concerned about superannuation but that very few are worried about the surcharge. As I mentioned earlier, this is unsurprising given that the proportion of taxpayers earning more than $1,500 per week in Braddon is only 1.4 per cent—the ninth lowest for all federal electorates in Australia. Compare this to the Treasurer's electorate of Higgins where some 14 per cent earn more than this amount. Indeed, of the top 15 electorates of the proportion of taxpayers in this income range, 11 are Liberal held seats perchance including, in addition to the Treasurer's, those of the ministers for small business, education, the environment, immigration and Indigenous affairs and workplace relations. No wonder the Liberal government are so determined to throw $370 million at the wealthiest four per cent of Australians when so many of them live in the electorates of their members.
However, in proposing this legislation, they are forgetting that the majority of Australians, including a majority of residents in their electorates, do not pay the surcharge and will not receive a single cent from this wasteful tax cut. On the other hand, literally millions of Australians in every corner of the country—be it in Braddon or in North Sydney—would benefit from Labor's proposal to cut the contributions tax. Perhaps the government realise how much fairer Labor's proposals are but refuse to say so. This would explain why they have simply failed to engage Labor in a reasoned debate about the merits of these proposals. Instead they attempted to discredit Labor's costings, but in the words of Laurie Oakes the Treasurer ended up with `egg on his face' after a combination of incompetence and dishonesty saw his post-budget attack collapse in a heap.
As I said earlier, my office in Burnie, along with Senator Sherry's in Devonport, which is also in Braddon, receives numerous inquiries from Tasmanians concerned about their super. In the options paper that he released on 2 August, Senator Sherry has moved to address the issues raised by our constituents in Tasmania and, certainly on this side of the House, others like them around Australia. The Tasmanians I have spoken to are concerned about not only the taxes on superannuation but also the sometimes excessive fees they pay, the safety of their super entitlements and the complexities of the current system. Currently there are no controls on the fees that can be charged on superannuation, either in the accumulation stage or after retirement. Nor, thanks to the government's failure to negotiate in good faith with the opposition parties and consumer representatives, are there strong rules for meaningful fee disclosure. 
We know of all too many cases where consumers are sold superannuation products or retirement income streams by financial planners paid on commission. What many people do not appreciate, and what few financial salespeople explain to them, is the effect of fees on their final retirement savings. A fee equal to two per cent of assets per year—a relatively low fee by the standards of for-profit retail funds—reduces the final retirement accumulation by 22 per cent over 40 years. A five per cent fee, which is common in retail funds, reduces the final retirement accumulation by a massive 60 per cent. In a region like the north-west of Tasmania and in the seat of Lyons held by you, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, where incomes are relatively low and many employees have broken work patterns, fund members can ill afford fees like these. That is why Labor's shadow minister for retirement incomes and savings, in response to government proposals to deregulate fund membership, has flagged the option of capping the fees that can be levied against compulsory superannuation. 
An issue of serious concern to many employees in my electorate is the timely payment of superannuation guarantee entitlements by employers. A vast majority of employers in Braddon, as in other parts of Australia, pay their employees' superannuation in full and on time. However, unfortunately there are some who do not. Often this is through honest mistakes or as a result of a business going through a temporary downturn, but sometimes it is the result of a deliberate strategy to avoid paying employee entitlements. A number of employees have contacted us whose employers have not paid them or their workmates any super for a number of years. These people contact the Australian Taxation Office with their concerns, but all too often little is done to chase up their entitlements. One reason for this, I suspect, is that the ATO does not have a single officer based in Tasmania—not one single officer based in my home state—devoted to tracking down unpaid superannuation.
That the government are not serious about protecting the superannuation entitlements of ordinary Australians was clear in the changes they proposed to cut some workers out of the system entirely. Not before time, the government moved legislation to require superannuation guarantee contributions to be made quarterly rather than annually. Labor supported this measure, but we could not support changes to the exemption threshold contained in that bill. The change in the threshold from $450 per month to $1,350 per quarter would have denied thousands of workers their superannuation entitlements altogether. Those worst affected would have been workers who changed jobs frequently, particularly those in rural industries such as fruit picking and shearing. Fortunately, the government dropped this change after Labor's strong and principled opposition.
Another issue that my colleagues and I receive numerous inquiries on is the early release of superannuation to those suffering financial hardships. This is a difficult issue that requires a balance between the objective of superannuation as a source of retirement income and the immediate needs of those facing financial difficulties. The number of inquiries we receive from those applying for early access is a sure sign that the current system is too complicated. Under Labor, the system was administered centrally through the then Insurance and Superannuation Commission, but the current government changed it so that fund members needed to go through Centrelink and their super fund in some cases and through APRA in others. A unanimous report by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation tabled in January this year made a number of recommendations to simplify this system, including centralising its administration in Centrelink. The government's response to this report is overdue. We on this side call upon them to consider these recommendations in a more timely manner.
One final issue that I would like to touch on in relation to superannuation of particular concern in my electorate is the issue of where Australia's superannuation is invested. The primary responsibility of superannuation trustees is to generate the best investment returns for their members. This requires diverse investments in a range of assets, including some that are overseas. There are growing concerns, however, that very little of the superannuation savings of those living and working in regional Australia find their way back to local investment and local jobs. Indeed, it is an issue in which I share an interest with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, in our work on the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. That certainly came through in submissions made to us about how best to assist regional Australia.
Governments of either political persuasion should treat any proposals to direct investment into particular assets with caution, but more can and should be done to encourage investment in regional Australia. A discussion paper by the Senate superannuation committee discussed a number of positive developments and future options in this regard. A number of superannuation funds and financial institutions have created regional investment trusts that provide the essential link between local projects and the investment capital they need. This is a welcome development indeed, and one that should be encouraged through government assistance where necessary.
I have looked at a number of superannuation issues of concern in my electorate. I know that these concerns are shared by many on this side of the House and, indeed, I am sure by others on the other side. The experiences and concerns of my constituents go to show two things about superannuation. The first is that the super agenda is much broader than the tax issues we are considering today in this bill. Secondly, when it comes to tax, ordinary Australians deserve a helping hand through a guaranteed tax cut on their employer contributions. I urge the government to withdraw the unfair tax cut in this bill and replace it with Labor's real tax cut for all working Australians.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2002-10-22,"— Every Australian thinks about their future, whether it be paying off their own home, getting married, having a family or retirement. Continued work by the government to ensure Australians also place importance on retirement has been successful, with huge numbers of Australians recognising the need to plan for their financial future. As Australia's population continues to age, it has become a reality that taxpayers will not be able to fund an age pension into the future. It is imperative that we as a government encourage Australians to plan and save for their retirement. The government have implemented a number of measures and incentives to encourage superannuation savings since we were elected in 1996. A number of changes to superannuation were outlined before the 2001 election in the document A Better Superannuation System. This is reaffirming this government's commitment to improving Australia's superannuation system for all Australian people.
Some of the measures that are being implemented by the government through the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2002 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 will ensure that Australians have better and more financially secure retirements than at any other time in Australia's history. The coalition are determined to help low-income earners save for their retirement. We are also working towards creating a fair and equitable system for both employers and employees, and these bills do exactly that. Superannuation and a secure retirement are not designed solely for high--income earners, and that is what the government are seeking to address. We are fighting the cause for hundreds of thousands of low-income earners, many of whom are struggling to put away superannuation for their retirement.
The member for Braddon indicated that there were going to be very few people who would benefit from this and that there would be very few regional people who would be able to seek benefits from this bill as it currently stands. In fact, I have an amazing amount of people within my electorate who are constantly calling, asking about surcharge and asking about a whole host of reasons why they have to pay added charges on their superannuation. They are not rich people—they are policemen, they are Defence people. Basically, on their wages, they are all grossed up, and this all becomes part of their overall payment. They do not actually get it in their hand. I suspect that it would be a fatal blow if somebody were to refuse them being able to get benefits from the bill.
These measures that we have put in place here will widen access to the superannuation system and encourage our low-income earners to contribute to their superannuation funds, with extra incentives from the government to do so. We as a government need to encourage low-income workers to think about their future retirement, enabling them to have a secure income and spend their retirement as they wish. The government have already increased employer contributions to nine per cent from July 1 this year, ensuring superannuation funds continue to grow into the future. All Australians want to be able to retire comfortably, without the worry of financial shortfalls. By introducing these measures, we are working towards achieving a comfortable and secure retirement for all average Australians.
The bill establishes the arrangements for the government to pay superannuation co-contributions to eligible low-income earners. It will also amend a number of taxation and superannuation laws as a consequence of the government's co--contribution arrangements, and reduce the rates of the superannuation and termination payments surcharge from 15 per cent to 10.5 per cent over the next three years. It will also repeal the existing taxation rebate for personal superannuation contributions found in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. All Australians deserve to have this legislation passed in this House as it is. Termination payments and the surcharge need to be reduced, but it is Labor's intention to continually block this, as it has done in the past.
The superannuation surcharge changes will take effect from 1 July 2002. The superannuation surcharge amendments should reduce the superannuation surcharge rate by one-tenth of its current level for each of the three years commencing 1 July 2002. These amendments are expected to result in a revenue cost of around $50 million in 2003-04, $120 million in 2004-05 and $200 million in 2005-06. The government co-contribution measure will apply to all eligible personal superannuation contributions made on or after 1 July 2002 by qualifying low-income earners. This is expected to result in a budgetary cost of $85 million in 2003-04, $90 million in 2004-05 and $95 million in 2005-06. In order to simplify the way in which people can receive the government's co-contribution, the Australian Taxation office will use contribution and account details provided by superannuation funds. These details, together with the income details from the low-income earner's tax returns, will be used to assess and pay the co-contribution directly to the person's fund. There will be no need for eligible people to apply for the co-contribution. The requirement for funds to report new information from that currently required will not commence until 1 July 2003. This time frame will provide superannuation funds with a window in which to implement any necessary system changes.
By replacing the existing taxation rebate for personal superannuation contributions made by low-income earners with a more generous government superannuation contribution, we are continuing to confirm this government's commitment to equity in superannuation for working Australians. We are also assisting low-income earners to save for their retirement. The government recognised that more incentives were needed to encourage low-income earners to save for their own retirement, and the incentives this legislation will provide will boost the retirement savings of eligible individuals. Those on low incomes are currently entitled to a maximum rebate of $100 for undeducted personal superannuation contributions, and the maximum rebate applies to those on or below incomes of $27,000 and $31,000. This will be replaced by a far more generous co-contribution to match the personal super contributions of low-income earners up to an annual amount of $1,000.
In order to best demonstrate the impact of the measures outlined in this legislation, I will use an example first used in the Sydney Morning Herald in May this year. A 35-year-old on an income of $15,000 who can contribute $1,000 each year to super will have an after-tax benefit at 65 of $238,200. But, if this is matched by a $1,000 contribution from the government, the after-tax benefit at 65 increases to $351,800. The example I have just used highlights the benefits that this legislation will bring to many hardworking Australians who hope to retire with a comfortable and secure income.
From 1 July 2002, personal superannuation contributions made by low-income earners with employer superannuation support will attract an increase in government co-contribution. The maximum co-contribution of $1,000 will be payable to those on incomes of $20,000 or less. The maximum co-contribution will reduce by 8c for each $1 of income over $20,000, with some co-contribution payable to those with incomes up to $32,500. A minimum co-contribution of $20 will also apply as long as the person is below the income thresholds and has made some personal superannuation contributions during the year. This is something for low-income earners to strive for. This is saying: `This government is providing you with the commitment that, if you do your share, it will do its share.' Self-employed small business people will be unaffected, as they will be able to continue to claim a tax deduction for personal superannuation contributions. Another of our election commitments increases the amount of personal super contributions that are tax deductible from $3,000 to $5,000. Similarly, those with superannuation support but not employer superannuation support will be eligible for a taxation deduction for their contributions. The government co-contribution will be treated as a undeducted contribution, and this means that the co-contribution will not be subject to contributions tax when paid into the fund and also will not be taxed when paid out to a person as an end benefit. In situations where it is paid directly to the person, it will be treated as exempt income and will not attract income tax.
Australians realise the importance of planning and saving for their retirement and for their future, with many of us hoping to live longer and make the most of our retirement. Australia's ageing population means a greater emphasis on individuals supporting themselves in retirement instead of receiving an age pension. Each Australian needs to realise the importance of providing enough income for their retirement so that the age pension is no longer relied on. This gives people self-sufficiency, and this is what they are seeking. Young people on a low-income wage now and looking forward to having independent means do not want to rely on the government when they retire. The coalition government are committed to a safe, easily understood and fair superannuation system producing high yields for its members. We are committed to encouraging the development of a culture of saving and investment from the earliest age possible. By implementing these changes to the current superannuation system, we will ensure that Australians are better prepared for their financial future, take more responsibility for their financial future and have something to work towards.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2002-10-22,"—I rise tonight to speak on the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2002 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2002. I think it is fair to say that, when Australians have sought improvements to superannuation, they have always looked to Labor. The reason they have done that is that, when it comes to thinking long-term about low-income earners, when it comes to looking at the retirement plans of those people in the community who are most in need of retirement savings, the Labor Party has, historically, provided a plan. 
If one were to look at the period since the election of the Hawke government, for example, one would see that, from 1983 up until 1996, there was a concerted effort by governments to ensure that low-income earners—ordinary workers—were enfranchised by having some form of superannuation. Indeed, not only was the idea of universal superannuation embraced by those governments but they also built upon their initial plans, up to the point where they stopped in 1996 when the Howard government was elected. That is not to say that the Howard government has not been busy, but there really has not been any net gain for those low-income earners who will be the beneficiaries, in some very negligible way, of these bills—if indeed they are passed. The most you can expect from this government with respect to super is, I suppose, the same as what you can expect from the government with respect to the way it handles public health—that is, Medicare. You just hope that it does not wreck it, intentionally or otherwise. You really cannot expect a great deal from this government with respect to this very important area of policy. 
The history of the Labor government's policy in this area is as follows. It was called the policy of three pillars, and it was formally known as the retirement income system. The first pillar of this retirement income system was to ensure that a minimum retirement income—that is, the age pension— would be established from budget revenue. At the time, it was set at the modest level of 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings—but it was a start. It was a very important start on the way to developing proper retirement savings for people who needed those savings.
The second pillar was the system of compulsory contributions for employees, which are privately managed. Initially this dated from the 1986 national wage case when a far-reaching, forward-thinking accord between government, employers and unions supported a trade-off of a three per cent compulsory contribution to super in lieu of a three per cent wage increase. So there were some sacrifices made by employees in that they were forgoing a form of income to some extent. But it was this, with the employer contributions, that started to build the necessary requirements for those people who were to retire and, one hopes, enjoy a long and fruitful retirement. That second pillar process was built upon by the superannuation guarantee, which has now reached nine per cent.
The third pillar was additional savings over and above the requisite minimum. This pillar provided for individual discretion and took into account individual circumstances, whether it be the income of those individuals or the tax concessions they could have had. Labor had planned to ensure that these things were put in place. Further to that, Labor had planned an additional six per cent co-contribution in order to reach a 15 per cent minimum by July 2001. I think it is fair to say that, in July last year, we would have had—if we had had Labor governments—a 15 per cent minimum for employees. That would certainly have ensured that they had the necessary requirements for a decent retirement. That is what workers expect, that is what they want and that is what a government that really cared about them would deliver. However, as we know, unfortunately, upon the election of this government six years ago, this policy was abandoned in the government's first term. This position has passed us by. The noble effort and the long-term ideal plan to have a 15 per cent surety for all employees with respect to super may have passed us by for some time. Possibly it will be a long time until we reach that minimum again. 
It strikes me as a little funny that the government will quite often raise issues about its forward thinking. We have the Treasurer making remarks about the Intergenerational Report—these great forward-thinking plans of the Treasurer! But, contrary to these ideas of the Treasurer, you have the same government—and the Treasurer holding the purse strings—making decisions to prevent these low-income earners, and indeed Australians at large, having a necessary sum of money. And that is what it is in the end: a necessary sum of money, a nest egg, for their retirement. I think that is a woeful decision by this government.
Many may actually remember that the state of superannuation was grossly inequitable only 20 years ago. Low-paid workers not only received incomes which did not allow them to accumulate any discretionary moneys to put away for their super but were also very rarely in superannuation funds. The added disadvantage of being a low-income earner was not having the wherewithal to put funds into private superannuation. Compare that with high-income earners—quite often managers or people higher up in organisations—who were not only receiving moneys which allowed them a sufficient discretionary sum to save as an individual but also quite often in private super schemes.
So this inequity existed and, indeed, it was an inequity that had to be rectified. I think to some extent the inequity has been rectified, because we now have an institutionalised universal super system. The problem with this bill is that it does not go far enough. It is very much an inferior policy to the Labor Party's plans pre 1996. Further to that, not only does it not go far enough but it finds a way to ensure that the top four per cent of salary earners in this country will receive, in effect, a tax cut. That is what the 15 per cent surcharge was when it was imposed by the Treasurer and this government in 1996—a tax. The Prime Minister did promise not to introduce new taxes, but that surcharge originally was a tax and it was imposed upon that four per cent. At the time, the Treasurer's comments as to why this surcharge was introduced in the first place were as follows:
The measures I am announcing tonight are designed to make superannuation fairer.
A major deficiency of the current system is that tax benefits for superannuation are overwhelmingly biased in favour of high income earners. For a person on the top tax rate, superannuation is a 33 percentage point tax concession while a person earning $20 000 receives a 5 percentage point tax concession. High income earners can take added advantage through salary sacrifice arrangements that are not available to lower income earners.
I have to say, these were very pertinent comments by the Treasurer. Nonetheless, he imposed a tax he said he would not impose. The tax was placed upon the highest earning bracket of employees. But now I can see the reasons behind it, exactly as the Treasurer said: he was doing it to make the super system fairer. He was using taxation laws to say, `The higher paid can afford to pay some form of tax on superannuation,' so he made that decision. What is very difficult to understand is why the government has now chosen to reduce that tax. In other words, why is it that the top four per cent are going to receive a tax cut if this bill is passed while most of the millions of superannuants in Australia will receive nothing? That is something for this government to contemplate. Why would it choose to do that, having introduced the surcharge in the first place? 
There has been very little effort by this government to get superannuation right. Firstly, it imposes a tax it says it will not impose, then it decides to cut that tax to allow those high-income earners some relief. What really should be happening is what was planned in the first place by the Labor governments, and that was to ensure that income earners received a 15 per cent minimum. That is what has been recommended by experts in the field who have suggested that, if you want to ensure that ultimately we remove the increasing burden of paying pensions to people—the burden that is going to come about because of the demographic changes to our society—the only way to do that is to ensure that sufficient funds are put aside now so that they can be used when people retire. That was the contribution made by the Labor governments in the eighties and nineties, until 1996. Certainly that was something that should have been pursued by this government, but instead superannuation has been anathema to the government. It has never had an inclination towards providing superannuation.
When the superannuation retirement plans were introduced into this House by Labor governments in the eighties, they were opposed by the then opposition. The Liberal and National parties did not want to have those contributions made for low-income earners. So I suppose it should not surprise me now—it should not surprise anyone now—that, when it comes to having a chance to advance the contributions to 15 per cent and to advance the future benefits for low- and middle-income earners, the government chooses not to make the hard decisions. Instead, the government makes a paltry effort—which I support in principle because it is moving in the right direction—to look after low-income earners and it decides instead to focus its energies on mitigating what seems to be an adverse effect on the rich wage earners, the wealthiest component of PAYE earners. That is the fundamental problem with this bill: it might make references to low-income earners, but the title should have added to it that it is also about tax cuts for high-income earners. There is no reference to that in the title, but I have to say there should be because that is the fundamental problem with this bill—that and the fact that it does not go far enough. I hope that the government thinks again.
I know that the government is hoping to get this legislation through the Senate if it is passed through this House. Indeed, it is hoping that there is a possible trade-off that can be put to low-income earners and that, yes, we can be seen to be reducing the surcharge for high-income earners. But I really do think this bill is too clever by half. In the end, it does not ensure that superannuation does what it is intended to do. It does not fundamentally alter the problem that low-income earners will have, which is not having sufficient retirement funds after however many—up to 40—years they may have worked before they retire. I support certain provisions of the bill; I oppose some fundamentally. I think the reason that this is structurally flawed and the reason that the government has got it wrong is that, ultimately, it has not had any regard for the bulk of people who need superannuation. Instead, the government is playing a game with the tax it imposed in the first place and has made a piecemeal effort to look after low-income earners. But I do not think those low-income earners will be convinced that, in the end, this is anything more than a token effort.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Tollner, David, MP",LP,2002-10-22,"—I am baffled by the comments of the member for Burke. A paltry effort indeed! How much further from the truth can you possibly get? When you look at some of the things that we have faced in this country, there is a demographic imperative that things are done. The population aged 15 to 64 years, which encompasses much of the working age population, made up 67 per cent of Australians in 1999. This proportion increases slightly over the first 10 years of the projection, but then declines to 60 per cent in 2051. We have 5½ workers for every retiree now, compared to just over two workers for every retiree in 2051, according to these estimates. This ratio will further decline if the trends towards early retirement and young people spending longer in full-time education continue. The declining tax base and the increasing proportion of people who would otherwise be dependent on the age pension set the argument for doing more to promote self-funding of retirement incomes.
The member for Burke calls the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2002 a paltry effort. I was interested to see that members opposite continually refer to Labor's wonderful policies prior to 1996 and their co-contribution policy. Their policy was that they would fund a three per cent co-contribution. When you look at this bill, it says that, for people who earn $20,000 or less, for every $1,000 they put into super the government will match that contribution with $1,000. It does not take a mathematical genius to work out that, on an income of $20,000, $1,000 is actually a five per cent contribution. If that is matched with the government contribution, it is a 10 per cent contribution: five and five is 10. With the compulsory amount of nine per cent going in, those low-income earners will be receiving a 19 per cent contribution to their super funds, and 10 per cent of that will be untaxed when it goes into the fund and untaxed when it comes out as a retirement income.
It is interesting to listen to people on the other side of the House who say that low-income earners do not save and that saving is somehow restricted to people on high incomes. There may be some evidence of that, but there is also some evidence that saving is not necessarily based on income alone. In fact, I will quote a couple of examples. A very good friend of mine spent a couple of years on unemployment benefits, unable to find a job, but managed to save over one-quarter of those unemployment benefits and put money away. On the other hand, I have a friend who has worked for over 15 years earning incomes in excess of $100,000 a year. He finds himself now without a job and without a cent of savings. I do not believe at all that there is a great correlation between income and saving ability.
For the member for Burke to suggest that this government is slack on super just defies reason. Stepping back to 1996, I can recall coming home late at night, watching question time on television and listening to members on the other side of the House absolutely bleating about the fact that the government was going to introduce a surcharge and how terrible it was. Now, a few years later, all of a sudden they are great supporters of the surcharge and they want to see it maintained. 
—What a berk he is.
—He is a berk. Slack on super! I ask you. There have been a number of positive initiatives since I came to this place. Just to name a couple, the ATO commissioner can now deposit unclaimed super guarantee vouchers into members' accounts. People may not understand the significance of this but, as of 3 June, when I last spoke on the issue, there were $356 million worth of these vouchers sitting there unclaimed. The government has also put in place a system of quarterly payments, working towards maximising the compliance of employers to pay on a quarterly basis. 
The other great initiative is that parents, grandparents and even friends will be able to choose to contribute to the retirement security of people who are under 18 years of age. Of course, this is a very big step. It will go a long way to addressing the current adequacy issues that I have just mentioned. For example, a parent who puts away just $20 a week for a newborn child will have created a superannuation base in excess of $28,000 for that child by the time they have reached 18 years of age. This is based on a modest real rate of return of around four per cent per annum and a low-cost, not-for-profit fund. By the time that child has reached retirement age of 65, that base funding alone will have grown to $180,000 in today's terms. 
It is my experience that it is the Aussie battler, the average income earning Australian, who is most set upon ensuring a better deal for their children than they have had for themselves. It will be these people—Australians of modest means who have worked hard all their lives—who will utilise this opportunity to put away $1,000 a year or around $20 a week to see their kids do better. These are measures that the government has put in place already. For the member for Burke to somehow suggest that this government is slack on super flies in the face of everything that is actually happening. 
I could not stand up here and speak about the adequacy of super without speaking about the impact of fees. I join with the member for Braddon in raising concerns about the way fees are charged by some funds. A typical retail fund contribution rate of over 25 per cent is required simply to match the adequacy level achieved by a 15 per cent contribution rate for a not-for-profit fund. When I talk about not-for-profit funds, I am talking about corporate funds, government funds and industry superannuation funds. The community, the taxpayer, should not have to fund the retirement income shortfall when it is caused by high-fee products that might have a few bells and whistles to aid marketing but that detract substantially from achieving any sort of retirement goal.
The contributions and earnings taxes have a less detrimental impact on the adequacy of superannuation than do the fees charged on some superannuation products. No good purpose is served by trying to boost superannuation adequacy simply by removing contribution taxes, particularly when those on higher incomes are likely to benefit. A significant threat to adequacy comes from the financial services industry. That has been conveyed to me by a certified financial planner. He actually calls himself a certified `flogger of products'. He says that the financial services industry should be further regulated to treat adequacy if choice is introduced. 
Getting back to the fee side of things, I have some analysis here that my good friend Ross Christie, a certified financial planner, has provided me with. It compares a typical retail fund which does not charge an entry fee and has total fees of around 2.24 per cent per annum with a not-for-profit fund—a government fund, an industry superannuation fund or a corporate fund—that would typically charge fees of around 0.45 per cent per annum. At a nine per cent contribution rate, a person on average weekly earnings—and this is all in today's dollars—would receive around $177,000 at age 60, based on a modest six per cent return after taxes. The same contribution rate would produce a return of around $253,000 in a not-for-profit fund. That is a difference of some $70,000, which is a huge amount of money in today's dollars. For this reason, I join with the member for Braddon in encouraging the government to look at the issue of superannuation fund fees.
As I say, the government co-contribution scheme is a boon for low-income earners. It will do a hell of a lot to address the adequacy problems faced by superannuation funds and retirees, today and in the future. I commend the bills to the House, and I hope that the other side will support the bills when they get to the Senate. Their dithering around and talking about paltry efforts and surcharge reductions does nothing to assist the argument. I commend the bills to the House.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2002-10-22,"— In rising to speak on the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2002 and Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 this evening, I would like to put some emphasis on where the funds are going. I do not want to come into this place and say we are acting like Santa Claus in giving away taxpayers' money, but it does seem that, if the government believe that they can afford to do it, it is a very excellent thing to provide the incentive for people to save and to look after themselves in their retirement. That, of course, is the thrust of the co-contribution bill. That being the case, it will probably work out well for the government or the Treasury overall and may even be revenue neutral.
Having said that, I acknowledge that there has been a very profound change in the saving patterns in Australia. An awful lot of people in Australia look to their own affairs and say, `Some 10, 15 or 20 years ago we were able to save and we find now that we cannot save anything.' We get an excellent document in our office called Monthly Economic and Social Indicators, which we call the MESI. I was rather intrigued to see in that document that a lot of the indications are that people are better off. Average weekly earnings taken against the rise in the CPI indicate that people are a lot better off now than they were, say, 15 years ago. I take the introduction of the policies which we often describe as economic rationalism as being the take-off point for funding and savings.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2002-10-22,"—Just two years ago, Australia had a referendum on whether the Queen, through the Governor-General, or an Australian should be our head of state. Today, Australians find that we do not have any head of state; he is missing in action. The Governor-General left the country last Sunday, some 12 hours after the—
—Order! I remind the member for Grayndler that, under the standing orders, any reflection on Her Majesty or her representative in Australia is quite outside the standing orders and could not be entertained by the chamber.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I would find it extraordinary that the standing orders would exclude a discussion of the appropriateness of the Governor-General's actions at this particular point in time. If I can continue, I would compare the vice-regal performance at the moment with that at the time of the tragedy in 1999 when 13 young Australians lost their lives in the canyon streams of Interlaken. The imagery from Switzerland would sadden any heart: 13 sets of relatives grieving for the loss of their adventurous children. However, these parents were not alone. Standing behind them was a quietly spoken man, a compassionate man, who was reaching out to the parents and giving them support in an extremely personal way. We all felt better because we knew he was there. We all knew him well because he had been there for us before.
That man is, of course, Sir William Deane. He stood with us after some of the saddest events which have occurred in this country. He led the mourners at the site of the Port Arthur massacre, and he was on hand to support the survivors of the Thredbo landslide. Indeed, he was so thoughtful that he took to Interlaken sprigs of wattle from his own garden in Canberra to cast into the canyon streams. He was not there to talk to the media; he was not interested in developing his profile. He simply sought to bring people comfort. Sir William Deane did our great nation proud.
This government has made political appointment after political appointment. Many of these appointments have shown what happens when you place ideology and favouritism above suitability for appointment. It is no coincidence that the destruction of trust in our elected officials and public institutions has occurred at the same time as our public bodies have been taken over by John Howard's supporters. One of the first steps was the decapitation of the Public Service through the removal of numerous departmental secretaries and their replacement with people he could trust. Twelve of the 14 appointments to the Industrial Relations Commission have been from an employer background. There has been the appointment of Ian Callinan, who prosecuted Lionel Murphy, to the High Court. There has been the appointment of Major Brian Watters from the Salvation Army as Chairman of the Australian National Council on Drugs. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has been thrown into turmoil over the appointment of a former pharmaceutical industry lobbyist.
The ABC board has Donald Macdonald as chairman, as well as Michael Kroger and Judith Sloan. The ABC endured the embarrassing tenure of former Young Liberal activist Jonathan Shier. Carla Zampatti was appointed chair of SBS. At least 14 former Liberal MPs, ex-Premiers and senior Howard government staffers have been appointed to ambassadorial or senior overseas appointments, including to Washington, New York, Los Angeles, London and the IMF. The Board of the National Museum of Australia is chaired by former minister Tony Staley and contains John Howard's biographer and former Fraser media secretary, David Barnett; Christopher Pearson; and the daughter of BA Santamaria, Catherine Santamaria. Networking the Nation is chaired by former National Party Leader, Doug Anthony. But none of these appointments matters when compared with the appointment of the Queen's representative, our Governor-General.
—Order! I cannot allow that. I have allowed the member for Grayndler to follow a particular course, but I would remind the member for Grayndler of standing order 74, which says:
No Member may use the name of Her Majesty, her representative in the Commonwealth, or her representative in a State, disrespectfully in debate, nor for the purpose of influencing the House in its deliberations.
That is the standing order, as House of Representatives Practice indicates. I have been very generous in the way I have allowed the member for Grayndler to continue to date.
—Thank you, Mr Speaker. Can I say, in accepting that ruling, that it is time to restore faith in Australia's representatives. Let us start at the top. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Governor-General</title>,Adjournment,21,1
