"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2011-03-22,"—At the request of Senator Feeney, I move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010-2011
Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011
Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Rebate) Bill 2011
National Vocational Education and Training Regulator (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011
Schools Assistance Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill 2011.
I table a statement of reasons justifying the need for the Schools Assistance Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill 2011 to be considered during these sittings, and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—

Schools Assistance Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill


Purpose of the Bill

Amendments are required to the Schools Assistance Act 2008 (the Act) to extend the existing funding arrangements for non‑government schools until the end of 2013, and to extend existing arrangements for capital funding until the end of 2014. This is to provide funding certainty for the non‑government school sector in line with the Australian Government’s 2010 election commitment.

Reasons for Urgency

Introduction and passage of the bill in the 2011 Autumn sitting period is necessary to ensure funding certainty for the non‑government school sector in line with the 2010 election commitment.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-03-22,"—I know I am interrupting Senator Back, who was in full flight when this debate was adjourned yesterday. I apologise for that, but I think it is important, for those who have not understood the debate so far, to recapitulate what happened yesterday.
Yesterday, for three hours, we asked questions of the minister about the Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011, which will impose yet another tax on some Australians. We were asking questions about why this tax was being levied just on individuals, rather than on multinational corporations. The Greens were very keen about making sure that those multinational companies paid their fair share of tax. The Greens have been railing in this chamber about how these multinational companies rip off huge profits from Australia and send those profits overseas. Yet here is a bill that the Greens and the Labor Party are promoting that taxes individual Australians but not corporate Australians. Whilst the plumber and the electrician will pay the flood tax, BHP, Xstrata and Rio Tinto will not. Whilst the local baker and butcher will pay the flood tax, Woolies and Coles will be exempted.
We asked the minister for three hours last night: what was the policy rationale behind this? We also asked the minister which class of individuals was going to be exempted from the tax. This legislation provides that the minister, on a whim, can decide which Australians are going to pay this tax and which Australians are not. Senator Back, when the adjournment interrupted him, was raising an issue about the north of Western Australia, and I am very keen to hear him complete his question on that. But, with the typical arrogance of this Labor government—a Labor government that, you might recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, had this new paradigm for parliament; they were going to be open and accountable, they were going to address issues and they were going to tell the public what was happening—the minister, when we raised these questions for three hours yesterday, simply refused to answer them.
I know Senator Back has questions. I have some more questions, and I suspect other senators have questions. We want these questions answered. We hope that the minister has had a good night’s sleep and has relinquished the belligerent approach that he adopted last night of just sitting there and simply refusing to answer legitimate questions.
—How can you be belligerent if you are not saying anything?
—You did say something. You attacked the messenger, and then you sulked for the rest of the night and refused to answer quite legitimate questions. This bill might well have been able to be dealt with had we had some cooperation from this government that claims it is so accountable. I have other questions, but I know Senator Back is very keen to complete the question he started yesterday, and I look forward to the minister’s answers.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2011-03-22,"—I thank Senator Macdonald for his introduction and for allowing me to continue my remarks and my questions to the minister. The question to the minister goes to who is in receipt of these flood levies. We have asked the questions about floods and other natural disasters. The question was asked last night about drought, and I am very hopeful that we may receive some advice from the minister as to whether natural disaster extends to drought. We do understand. We hope, however, that the minister is going to confirm advice that was received with regard to the bushfires surrounding Perth. That advice, which came via the West Australian, was apparently the result of a decision by the Prime Minister, but it would be excellent if the Senate could be apprised of the validity of that point.
Last evening, before the discussion was terminated, I was briefly asking questions about the eligibility under the levy for funding in the Gascoyne region, which was subject to WA’s worst floods in December last year. I made the point that, under the Australian government natural disaster recovery fund, eventually, by mid-February, I was able to organise a situation in which people did receive their $1,000 per head for adults and $400 for children—which, in fact, then exempted them from paying this levy. Others have already commented, as I will. I am very keen to know from the minister: will the Gascoyne region be entitled to funding under this levy, part of which is a $1.8 billion tax grab from some individuals in Australia—not companies, and not many, but some? Will the Gascoyne region be entitled to funding under the flood levy scheme so that they can put into place mitigation bunding and avoid that disaster—which Emergency Management Australia, taking it upon itself earlier this year, decided to overrule the Prime Minister on and, in their own wisdom, made a decision to not allow that level of disaster recovery funding for the citizens of that place? Fortunately, that  has changed. I need to know now whether or not, under this levy arrangement, people of the Gascoyne are entitled to that funding.
I also want to go to a quotation by the member for O’Connor, in the other place, Mr Crook, on 2 March this year. I seek clarification from the minister, as a result of this media release that Mr Crook put out apparently after further discussions with the government. In late February this year, on the tail end of another cyclone coming down the Western Australian coast, the Goldfields region was subject to intense flooding. I was in fact in Kalgoorlie on Saturday and Sunday. To watch the desert greening as a result of that flooding was wonderful. The flood did in fact wash away sections of the transcontinental railway, which was closed for some period of time. Some of the more remote communities in the shires of Laverton, Leonora and Menzies were particularly affected. Mr Crook, to quote from his release, has advised that those shires ‘will be able to access natural diaster support’—no problem there: those arrangements are long in place between the federal and state governments, the natural disaster has been declared and it has been accepted. The question I have of the minister is this. Mr Crook’s release goes on to tell us:
As part of his dialogue with the Government regarding the Flood Levy, Mr Crook has negotiated to ensure a fair deal for WA residents, including:
-Activation of the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment … for … the Gascoyne—
which he had absolutely nothing to do with. The fact is that the Prime Minister’s decision of 11 February, following my questions in this place, activated that—but, nevertheless, he chooses to take that glory upon himself. The media release goes on—and this may help to answer questions asked by Senator Cormann last night; this is Mr Crook advising us of his dialogue with the government—to say that he also negotiated:
-Exemption from paying the flood levy for flood, fire and storm affected residents in WA …
So we now have another element to this. And he particularly tells us:
This is a very positive outcome and I am pleased to see these communities in need will benefit from the Flood Levy.
I will not read out the rest of his media release, because most of it is spent bucketing me and calling to account what he believed to be ‘political games’ that I was playing—
—Read it out!
—Well, I will—thank you very much:
Mr Crook also criticised Liberal Senator Chris Back … for playing political games while communities are in need of assistance.
This is after it was the much maligned Senator Chris Back who had arranged the payment under the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment scheme for all of the people in the Gascoyne! So the question I have of the minister extends from that. We had eligibility for flood victims in Queensland. That, as the result of Mr Katter’s intervention to win his vote, went from the Brisbane floods up to North Queensland after Cyclone Yasi, as I understand it. He secured $650 million for his vote. Poor old Mr Crook got nothing for his, largely because he came out and said he would support this stupid levy very early in the piece. But my question now is: is it the case, as Mr Crook has quoted, that he has used his relationship with government to negotiate a good outcome for Western Australians affected by disaster, for flood victims in the Goldfields, for fire affected residents—presumably the bushfires surrounding Perth; and I asked the question last night: does that involve the December fires around Cape Preston, south of Mandurah—and for storm affected residents? Those are the questions that I am anxious to receive answers to. I need to know: what is the extent of what the government is offering, to whom and why? Is it because Mr Crook gave up his vote in favour of the levy early that we now see some attempt by government to square the ledger, after Mr Katter was able to get $650 million in consideration of his vote? I ask the minister, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman: how long is the piece of string? Where does it stop? When does it stop? How much will the levy be? How much will people have to pay? And, coming back to a question asked last night: in a properly managed economy, why do we need a $1.8 billion tax grab from taxpayers when in fact we have a $350 billion budget? And why does this have to be dealt with only weeks before the budget for 2011-12 is brought down by the government?",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2011-03-22,"—I will respond on a couple of points. Firstly, to Senator Back: he was not here last night for the entire debate.
—Correct.
—Thank you. I am glad you acknowledge that. Some of the issues that you raised in what was a very, very, very long question were raised and answered last night before your presence in the chamber. Frankly, I am not in the habit and I am not going to get into the habit of repeating and repeating myself. As you know, it is against standing orders and it takes up the time of the Senate inordinately. The last questions you were asking—about how much a levy would be and why it is needed—have been well canvassed, Senator Back, in this debate, not just in the committee stage but during the earlier debate. I do not intend to repeat my contributions of last night and I do not intend to repeat my contributions either in the committee stage or in closing the debate—or indeed the contributions that have been widely canvassed on both sides of the chamber.
In regard to the positions of Mr Katter and Mr Crook, obviously I am not them. I cannot answer for them. If you wish to cross-examine or critique them, that is your prerogative, but your colleagues in the other place can do that. All I know of Mr Katter and Mr Crook is that on this issue they have represented their constituencies effectively. I accept that. They are supporting the government legislation. All that is agreed to is on the public record. The extent to which Mr Crook or Mr Katter put out their press releases is their prerogative. I am not here to comment about what is in their press releases. That is for them to do.
On the issue of the regulatory exemptions: they are on the Treasury website. They are contained in the regulation schedules, of which I have copies here, which are also on the Treasury website, so all of that detail is there for you, Senator.
To come back to Senator Macdonald: firstly, he accused me of sulking. In fact, for the first hour I did answer questions, I think reasonably and fairly and comprehensively. I think Senator Xenophon would acknowledge that with respect to his questions and others I did the same. We then had Senator Macdonald engage in what is known as a filibuster. He just repeated himself over and over and over again with questions and arguments that had been heard and answered—so it was a filibuster, Senator Macdonald. If you wish to engage in that, that is up to you. I chose then not to continue to repeat answers I had already given or answers that had already occurred in the debate, and again I do not intend to do that this afternoon. When I conclude my remarks, I will have concluded my remarks and I will sit down. I do not intend to get up again and go back over issues that have already been canvassed.
On the issue of the tax and the method on the base of the tax the government selected, I did answer the question last night. I pointed out that using the income tax system was a matter of fairness, equity and administrative ease. I pointed that out last night and I pointed it out at the very beginning of the evening, Senator, but you still chose to pursue that for some 2½ hours. That is the reason we have done it. In precedent terms, the previous Liberal-National government, of which you were a member, applied a similar type base to its levies with respect to guns and East Timor. I think they were the other two levies that had a similar type base, and I pointed that out last night.
—What about containers that you were talking about last night?
—Also, I did not interject last night and I have not interjected this morning. You just continue to reflect your rudeness, Senator, in interjecting.
So I did point that out last night. I also pointed out last night that, when you were part of that government, Senator Macdonald, you had another four levies. You had six levies for specific purposes when you were a minister and a backbencher in the previous Liberal-National government. There was a levy on sugar, a levy on milk, a levy on tickets to pay for the Ansett collapse, a levy for East Timor, a levy for guns buyback—and even a levy on containers. I pointed that out last night. Senator Macdonald, as a member of that Liberal-National party government, conveniently forgets, when he criticises us for having one levy, that the government he was a member of had six levies, and that did not include the superannuation surcharge, which they claim was not a tax. All of these issues were well canvassed last night, Senator Macdonald.
In terms of the Greens and the position they postulated, they are not here. That is their prerogative. They are the ones who argued that the levy should apply and the base should be on multinational companies. That was not an argument that the government advanced. There was no speaker from the government who advanced that as an argument, so your contention and your issue are with the Greens. Again, it is up to you, Senator Macdonald. If you want to question them on their particular approach, it is up to you. I am here representing the government. We have chosen the base of the levy. I have answered your questions, and I do not intend to answer repeated questions again this afternoon.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-03-22,"—Those comments from the minister are just completely unsatisfactory. He has not answered the very specific question on which this government is creating a whole lot of confusion. But let me just remind people of what it is we are debating here today. We are debating here today another Labor Party tax which will increase income taxes for all Australians earning more than $50,000 a year, unless they are part of one of the exemption categories. This is a tax which of course is not necessary at this point in time. It is not supposed to come into effect until 1 July 2011, and any government that properly managed its finances, any government that properly managed our public finances, would be considering the revenue needs and spending commitments in the context of the budget. This would be quite easy for the government to do on this occasion. This is a tax which is supposed to raise $1.8 billion not to fund the reconstruction of houses or property of individual Queenslanders but to fund the reconstruction of infrastructure which the state Labor government in Queensland did not properly insure, which is an issue that has been widely canvassed in this chamber.
The only reason why the Labor government are going for this tax is that the Labor Party can see an opportunity to politically get away with it. The Labor Party are looking for an opportunity to get away with yet another tax grab because they work on the basis that, quite rightly, there is a lot of goodwill from people right across Australia towards the necessary reconstruction effort in Queensland, which the coalition supports. Let me make this point very clear: this legislation has got nothing to do with the question of whether or not this investment should be supported, Commonwealth funding into Queensland to assist the Queensland government with reconstruction of their infrastructure. Of course we support that. But we think that any government that manages its finances properly should be able to fund that sort of commitment by reprioritising its current spending commitments. There is a lot of waste and mismanagement across government at present. We have widely canvassed in the past the waste and mismanagement, with the $2.4 billion pink batts program to put pink batts into people’s roofs only to take them out again, and the waste and mismanagement with the school halls. It has been waste and mismanagement everywhere.
We have got this question of who is going to be exempt from paying this tax. I asked a question about this to the Secretary of the Department of Finance and Deregulation in the Senate estimates: would people like those in Kelmscott who were subject to bushfires be exempt from the flood tax? No, said Mr Tune, the secretary of the finance department, not necessarily. I asked: why is that? Mr Tune said:
Well, the government’s decision at the moment is that those who are subject to the floods are exempt from the levy. It would require another decision to alter that.
Following up, I asked:
Only if the natural disaster you were subject to was a flood will you be exempt from the flood tax? If it is any other natural disaster, you are not exempt at the moment?
Mr Tune, the secretary of the finance department, said:
That is the situation as it stands at the moment.
This created quite a bit of interest in my home state of Western Australia, to such an extent that a journalist from the West Australian, Mr Andrew Probyn, rang the Prime Minister’s office and asked what the story is. Only those who are subject to a flood event are going to be exempt. What about the people of Kelmscott and other bushfire affected areas in Western Australia? Why do they have to pay the levy? This is what he was told: ‘Julia Gillard has said the victims of the Kelmscott bushfire will not have to pay the national flood levy.’ This was about an hour after the secretary of the finance department said that they would have to pay the flood levy. An hour later Prime Minister Gillard said that victims of the Kelmscott bushfire will not have to pay the national flood levy. The Prime Minister made the decision last night after a senior bureaucrat said that, although the fire victims qualified for $1,000 disaster recovery payments, they were still expected to pay the levy. ‘A spokesman for Ms Gillard said victims of this year’s WA bushfires would be exempted.’
The minister has now arrogantly said that he is not going to answer any more questions in relation to this. But I asked him this question yesterday and he refused to get up and confirm in answer to my question whether or not the statement that was made by the spokesman for the Prime Minister to a journalist of the West Australian stands. The minister then says this morning, ‘Go to the Treasury website.’ My office went back to the Treasury website today, Minister, and you might want to listen to this. I can see you are trying furiously to get some further advice from your advisers but you could actually do us the courtesy, even if you are not prepared to answer questions, of taking some notice of what is being said in this chamber in relation to this very bad Labor Party tax. You could at least do us the courtesy of listening to the debate, even if you are not prepared to answer questions. That would be a very good start. The arrogance of this government is absolutely breathtaking. Maybe the minister can read the comment in Hansard if he is not prepared to actively participate in the debate.
We went to the Treasury website today, and on the Treasury website there is what is called a flood levy fact sheet. If you want to check it out, Minister, it is
www.treasury.gov.au/documents/1948/PDFflood_levy_fact_sheet.PDF. Today on your website what does it say? It says:
Exemption from the flood levy
Where the person has received an Australian government disaster recovery payment in relation to a flood event in 2010-11, they will be exempt from the levy.
That is on the Treasury’s website today—in direct contradiction to comments made by a spokesman for the Prime Minister in the West Australian on 23 February 2011, about a decision that the Prime Minister made on the run after questions being asked about this at Senate estimates. You can arrogantly say to us that you are not going to answer any more questions, Minister, but quite frankly the people of Western Australia deserve answers to these questions. I tell you something else, Minister: the people who have been impacted by droughts, the people who have been impacted by storms, the people who have been impacted by natural disasters in other parts of Australia deserve answers to these questions. Who is going to be exempt? Can you confirm that it is not just going to be those people who were subject to a flood event? Can you confirm that it is going to be the people that were subject to bushfire in Kelmscott? Can you confirm that it is going to be people who were subject to storm events in other parts of Australia? Can you confirm that it is going to be people who were subject to drought events? And what other natural disasters is the government currently considering for exemption from this ad hoc Labor Party tax grab?
We understand that the Labor Party is always looking for another opportunity to get away with yet another Labor Party tax, but this is a parliamentary democracy. This is a system of parliament where the government is accountable to the parliament and where the government is supposed to answer legitimate questions that are raised by members of parliament to explain the reasons, the rationale and all of the ins and outs of a particular proposal that is before it.
You have not addressed with one single comment this morning the questions that were raised in this chamber last night by a number of senators in relation to the categories of Australians that will be exempt from this tax. I hope that you will reconsider the arrogant statement you made, which was that you are not going to get up to answer any more questions in relation to this, because it has not all been canvassed. As I have outlined, statements were made by the Prime Minister in the West Australian on 23 February. I cannot contradict the flood levy fact sheet on the Treasury website today. You are telling us that we should not worry about asking you questions in this chamber. You are telling us: ‘Go to the website’. We have gone to the website, Minister, and the website does not give us the answers we need. So we will do what our job is—that is, ask you questions in this chamber so you can give us the answers we need.
You can shuffle your papers and not even try to engage in this debate in any way whatsoever, but maybe you could interject for a moment and tell us what the answers to these questions are. But if you do not, if you are not in a position to provide an answer to these very legitimate questions, the people of Australia will be able to make a judgment on this, because the people of Australia of course know that this Labor government will impose a tax on them whenever they think they can politically get away with it. On this occasion your government clearly has made a judgment that it can politically get away with it, and so you cannot be bothered to go through the proper parliamentary process to provide answers to some legitimate questions which raise serious concerns for people in many parts of Australia but specifically on this occasion in my home state of Western Australia.
So, Minister, I would urge you to reconsider the decision that you have made not to participate any further in this debate and I would urge you to confirm for the people of Kelmscott, for people in drought affected areas and for people in storm affected areas across Australia that they also, not only those Australians who have been subject to a flood event, will be exempt from this flood levy. The people across Australia who otherwise will be hit inappropriately by this Labor Party tax deserve that explanation from you—in particular given that your government has made a decision not to pursue this tax through the normal budgetary process, which would have been very easy for you to do. It would have been, to use your words, the administratively easier way to go. But of course the reason we are wasting all these hours of debate in this parliament is that you have chosen to pursue this tax through ad hoc legislation outside any proper, normal budgetary process. You made a decision to whack on this tax because you could see a political opportunity to get away with it.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2011-03-22,"—Minister, I have been listening and I have noted your comment that you will not be on your feet again to answer questions that have already been asked during the committee stage of this debate. As far as I am concerned, the questions that I am about to ask have not been answered, so I would prevail upon your good sense to consider getting to your feet again to answer these questions.

Senator Sherry interjecting—

—Please listen, Minister. I am asking these questions because there are many people in our communities across this country who have been affected by their own natural disasters and they are wondering what makes one person’s natural disaster any different from or more disastrous than another person’s natural disaster. I am asking the following questions on behalf of those people in states across our country.
My office has visited one of the government’s websites today. We have been to the Attorney-General’s website to look at the national disaster relief fund assistance program. I note that the website talks about a state or territory being able to claim funding under the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements if a natural disaster occurs. I note that a natural disaster for the purposes of that funding is defined to include a flood, bushfire, earthquake, storm cyclone, storm surge, landslide, tsunami, meteorite strike, tornado. I also note that the Attorney-General’s website today, under the heading ‘Current disasters’, lists the financial assistance that has been granted under that program for flooding and severe weather events from November 2010 to February 2011, part of which period saw Queensland devastated by its floods. I note, Minister, that the website confirms that your government under this program:
... will provide financial assistance to Victorian, South Australian—
my own state—
Western Australian and Tasmanian communities affected by flooding/severe weather in November 2010–January 2011.
That of course is relevant, given that Senator Cormann drew to your attention before the fact that today’s Treasury website confirms that certain consideration will be given to victims of flooding. In what is listed on the Attorney-General’s website as having been provided during that period of time to the people of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, I note assistance given to 36 local government areas in Victoria, in alphabetical order beginning with Alpine and ending with Yarriambiack. The assistance given under your government’s program—and I am reading from the website—is in the nature of:
Emergency Grants of up to $1,067 to provide assistance to meet immediate basic needs.
These people have clearly been affected by their own version of a natural disaster.
They will get assistance with temporary living expense grants to assist households with the cost of temporary accommodation and living expenses. They will get re-establishment grants for repairs to structural damage et cetera. In my home state of South Australia, assistance under the natural disaster relief and recovery program has been made available for areas affected by severe weather on 7 and 8 December 2010. Personal hardship and distress assistance is being made available in the four local government areas of Clare and Gilbert Valleys, Loxton Waikerie, Mid Murray and The Barossa. That is what your government website says.
For Western Australia—and I declare that my family is still wheat and sheep farming in between Beverley and Brookton in Western Australia—I note that under this program your government, Minister, is extending assistance to 20 local governments, beginning with Beverley and Brookton, where my family continues to farm. Then there are Cuballing, Cunderdin, Dalwallinu, Goomalling, Narrogin, Northam, Perenjori, Pingelly, Quairading, Toodyay, Victoria Plains, Wagin, Wandering, West Arthur, Wickepin, Williams, Wongan Hills and York. That is taken from your website today. The assistance for those communities, Minister, includes: counter disaster operations, personal hardship and distress assistance, restoration of essential public assets, interest rate subsidies for small businesses and primary producers and professional advice grants and freight subsidies for primary producers.
For the purposes of my question today, I finish with Tasmania. Under your government’s program, the Tasmanian government has been provided with assistance for 11 local government areas, beginning with Break O’Day and ending, in alphabetical order, with West Tamar. The sorts of personal hardship and distress assistance extended under your government’s program—for which I presume your government considers that there is merit, for otherwise why would you be doing it?—include the same sorts of personal hardship and distress assistance given to the other communities to which I have already referred.
Like Senator Back, it may have taken me a long time to get to my question. But, Minister, that is because there is quite a long list of communities across Australia that your government has seen to fit to assist, and appropriately so, under the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements. My question, Minister, is this: in respect of those communities in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania listed on the Attorney-General’s website today—communities that qualified for assistance under your program—will any be exempt from the flood levy? If so, which ones and on what basis? If not, why not?",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-03-22,"—I can see that the minister is committed to keeping his promise arrogantly not to participate in this debate. He did interject during Senator Fisher’s comments, and very insightful and eloquent comments they were as well, representing very strongly the interests of people right across Australia who were affected by natural disasters. The minister interjected by saying, ‘How long do you want to keep this going?’ Minister, this can be resolved very quickly. It is very clear that the coalition—the Liberal Party and National Party senators—are opposed to this tax and we will vote against it. But, on behalf of people across Australia, we are asking some legitimate questions. What Senator Fisher has just done is read out to you a list of all the areas impacted by natural disasters that are attracting support from the Commonwealth. What you have decided to do as a government is to exempt people who were subject to flood events. According to the Prime Minister’s spokesman, you have decided to exempt people who were subject to bushfires in Western Australia, although you have not been prepared to confirm that on the record during the committee stage debate.
What about all these other people who have been impacted by natural disasters? Do we have to get a newspaper in each region in each state to ring the Prime Minister’s office so that that newspaper can get a change in policy on the run? Do we really have to get the Hobart Mercury to ring the Prime Minister’s office and ask what is going to happen to people in your home state of Tasmania who have been impacted by natural disasters and who are getting support from the Commonwealth but are being asked to pay the flood levy? Do we really have to get the Adelaide Advertiser to ring about people who were impacted in South Australia to the extent that the government is providing assistance through natural disaster relief funding and to ask about whether they are going to get an exemption so that we can get the Prime Minister to make a decision on the run? What is this process? Is the only way that we can get an appropriate decision in relation to exemptions from the flood tax for people who are hurting because they have been impacted by a natural disaster to get a journalist to ring the Prime Minister’s office? Why can a journalist get an answer from the Prime Minister when senators in this chamber cannot even get the courtesy of so much as a comment from the minister representing the government in this chamber when some very legitimate questions are raised?
Minister, there are serious questions here. We understand that you have expanded the exemption from the flood levy beyond those Australians who were subject to a flood event. On the basis of comments reported in the West Australian, it seems that it has been expanded to people who were the victims of bushfires in Western Australia in recent times, although you have not confirmed that on the record. I would like you to confirm it on the record during the committee stage debate. Secondly, why should all these other Australians who have been subject to natural disasters to the extent that they have received natural disaster relief funding from the Commonwealth not also be exempt? What is the difference between somebody who been subject to a natural disaster in Queensland or Western Australia and somebody who has been subject to a natural disaster elsewhere? What is the policy rationale for you to pick one and not the other?
Is the only rationale that there was the risk of a bad headline on the front page of the West Australian for the Prime Minister and, as such, she made a decision on the run to exempt the very good people in Kelmscott—who deserve the exemption—from the flood levy? So do we need to make sure that there is a risk of a bad headline in all these other parts of Australia before you do us the courtesy of entertaining their plight?
I do not think it is appropriate, Minister, for you to just sit back and ignore the people of Tasmania, the people of South Australia, the people of Western Australia, the people of Queensland and the people in other parts of Australia who have been impacted by natural disasters that do not fall within the narrow definition of an exemption that is currently on the Treasury website. Quite frankly, Minister, the least you should do is clarify the complete inconsistency between what the Prime Minister’s spokesman said to the West Australian and what is on the flood levy fact sheet that is currently on the Treasury website.
I say ‘currently’. It might well have been changed while we have been having this debate. It might well be that some good people in Treasury have been following what has been going on in here and they might have realised that there is an inconsistency and they might well have changed it. But as late as 11 o’clock this morning this was the advice on the Treasury website—that the only people who were going to be exempt were persons who had received an Australian government disaster recovery payment in relation to a flood event in 2010-11. The website said they would be exempt from the levy, whereas the Prime Minister’s spokesman said that the Prime Minister made the decision ‘last night’—that is, on 22 February—that Kelmscott bushfire victims would also not have to pay the national flood levy. Of course, she said that after the head of the Department of Finance and Deregulation said that they would have to pay the flood levy, that they were not going to be exempt. The spokesman for Ms Gillard said victims of this year’s WA bushfires would be exempted, and that was reported in the West Australian on 23 February 2011.
Minister, give us one objective reason as to why this is. I am very happy for the people of Kelmscott that they are appropriately being exempted, if that is what is going to happen. But I would like you to clarify the inconsistency between what is on the Treasury website and what the Prime Minister’s spokesman is quoted as saying. I want you to explain to the Senate why it is appropriate for those two categories of victims of natural disasters, both receiving natural disaster funding from the Commonwealth, to be exempted and for all the other Australians who have been subject to natural disasters and who are receiving Australian government disaster recovery payments not to be exempted. What makes all those other Australians less deserving of his exemption? That is a very simple question.
Minister, going back to your question about how long we want to keep this going, we will keep this going until you have provided a proper answer to this question, because people across Australia impacted by natural disasters deserve answers to this question. If you want to know how long we will keep it going, we will keep it going until you have given the courtesy to the Senate and the courtesy to the Australian people of providing an answer to a very legitimate public policy question that the Senate should get an answer to before we are asked to make a final decision on this legislation.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2011-03-22,"—Minister, I am sorry to say that I am, for what it is worth, offended by your interjection during the earlier asking of my questions. I am offended that you saw fit to allegedly interject with words to the effect of, ‘How long is this going to take?’ I am offended, Minister, because I think Australians are entitled to see from your government fairness and equity. Australians are fair. They will dig in and they will contribute, provided that they see fairness, and they are not seeing fairness from your government and they are not seeing equity—at a time when many of them are facing arguably some of the greatest personal hardship and distress of their working lives. That must be why your government has a program called the natural disaster assistance and recovery program. That must be why your government saw fit to provide assistance for personal hardship and distress.
So, Minister, in addition to my earlier questions, on what basis does the government consider itself able to judge the distress obviously caused to the people of Queensland and New South Wales by flooding in the 2010-11 year? On what basis does your government see fit to attempt to evaluate, in the words of your program, the ‘personal hardship and distress’ suffered by people in Queensland and New South Wales, for example, versus that suffered by others—suffered by the people of Victoria, the people of South Australia, the people of Tasmania and the people of Western Australia, whom your government has seen fit to assist under the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements? If your government saw fit to assist those communities in their personal hardship and distress, then on what basis—this is my second question for right now—does your government differentiate between those people when deciding whether or not they are to be exempt from the levy to be paid by the Australian people to assist victims of the Queensland flooding?
Minister, let’s get more particular, and I am afraid I can. Let’s look at the wording of your program on the Attorney-General’s website. The assistance being given under the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements—I hope you are not leaving the chamber, Minister. I am glad you have got to your feet. Are you answering my questions? No, it would appear not.

(Senator Marshall)—Senator Fisher, would you like to continue?
—I am just giving the minister a minute, if I may. Thank you, Chair—I will continue. On the Attorney-General’s departmental website today, there is reference to assistance given under the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements by your government for the ‘severe thunderstorm on 29 January 2011’ to 20 or so local government areas in Western Australia, beginning with Beverley and Brookton, where my family still farms. I note that list of 20 ends with the local government area of York.
On what basis does your government see fit to differentiate? Under the assumption that these communities are not proposed to be exempted from the Queensland flood levy, on what basis does your government to seek to attribute a different value to, let’s say, a farmer in Beverley or Brookton who had the roof ripped off their farmhouse by the severe thunderstorm of 29 January 2011? Because it happened, Minister. It happened down the hill from my parents’ house. It happened to the next-door neighbour. They lost the entire roof off their house through the severe thunderstorm of 29 January 2011. They also then suffered a deluge from the rain that followed. So, Minister, on what basis do you attribute presumably some lesser suffering and different personal hardship and distress to a family that lost their roof and got the entire contents of their home sodden to people who suffered similarly from the Queensland floods or, indeed, from Cyclone Yasi?
On what basis does your government see fit to evaluate the loss of human life? Not only were there tragedies suffered by our countrypeople in the Queensland floods; there were also tragedies suffered, allegedly—but certainly during the severe thunderstorm that struck—in those 20 local government areas of Western Australia on 29 January 2011. On what basis does your government differentiate between a life lost due to that severe thunderstorm—in the words of your assistants—by a person driving a car in the local government area of York and tragedies that have occurred across our country in other natural disasters, including the floods in Queensland? What is your basis? Please show us that you are able to demonstrate fairness and equity. I look forward to your answer.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-03-22,"—If the minister wants to answer, I will accede to him. But I do not notice him making any attempts to answer, so I will ask some other questions.
—They are looking at other legislation. The government are happy to waste time.
—Oh, they have a bit of a glitch with the legislative program, have they? That is why the minister is simply not answering this. I just want to say to anyone who might be listening to or watching this debate, we are in the committee stage of the debate. That is the stage of the debate where you go through the legislation line by line and you ask the minister to explain it. You ask for the facts to support it. You ask questions. In every other instance I have ever experienced in my long time in the Senate, ministers have got up and tried their best to answer questions.
The minister claimed that he had answered my questions. I have the Hansard from last night, Minister, and I would like you to identify for me, if you could, where in Hansard you answered my questions from last night. You make the bland statement, so typical of the Labor Party, that, ‘I have answered them.’ But when I look at the hard-copy Hansard of last night I cannot see anywhere where you even attempted to answer the questions I asked last night. You had some very serious and legitimate questions from Senator Back, Senator Fisher and Senator Cormann and you simply refused to answer them. Adding to your arrogance and ignorance, you turn your back and talk to others while we are addressing questions to you.
You waved some papers around and said, ‘These papers are on the website, but I have some here,’ so I got the attendant to get these papers for me. People who are listening to the debate who have a vital interest in the questions we are asking unfortunately cannot see the papers you waved around. But I have the papers that you waved around. I assume they list the people you say are exempted. They say the item for those who are exempted from the payment covers an individual if they are eligible for an Australian government disaster recovery payment under part 2.24 of the Social Security Act and the individual receives that payment by 30 June 2012. They then goes on to list individuals affected by a disaster declared under national disaster relief arrangements. The first item says the item covers an individual if a declaration is made under the national disaster recovery and relief arrangements.
Minister, you have a department of several thousands of people—a dozen of whom are sitting in the chamber assisting you. Why can’t you assist the Senate, those questioners and the people of Australia who have an interest in these questions by answering Senator Fisher? Are the communities she has mentioned subject to that declaration or are they not? It is a pretty simple question. You have a dozen advisers—highly paid public servants—sitting there advising you.
—Three.
—There are three now. There were a dozen a little while ago.

Senator Cormann interjecting—
—Hope-fully they are changing the website, Senator Cormann, now that you have pointed out that the answer the minister gave us last night and this morning is just patently wrong. You have quite clearly demonstrated that. Minister, why can’t you tell the people of Australia and this parliament the answers to the questions we raise?
I am very keen to know where the $1.8 billion that is being raised is going. You say that you cannot answer for the media releases of Mr Katter and Mr Crook that Senator Back rightly raised. But remember that it was your leader’s agreement with those Independents that allowed you to remain as a minister in this government. You are inextricably interwoven with those Independents. They said that they did a deal with your Prime Minister that allowed for $650 million to go to Mr Katter’s electorate. You say, ‘Ask Mr Katter.’ We are not asking Mr Katter; he is not even in this chamber. You should be able to tell us if your government has made that agreement with Mr Katter. It is a pretty simple thing to say, ‘Yes, we did,’ or, ‘No, we did not.’ We in this chamber want to know where you will be spending the $1.8 billion that you are collecting with this new tax that you are hoping to impose under the legislation we are debating today. We want to know where it is going.
I ask another question to add to the list of questions that I am seeking an answer to. Has the department done any assessment on the number of people who will be exempted from the payment of this tax? You told us yesterday that 45 per cent of the revenue in Australia comes from individuals. Can you let me know how many individuals that actually relates to? With the 45 per cent of tax that is recovered from individuals, how many individual taxpayers does that encompass and what is the department’s estimate of the number of individuals who will be exempted? I am trying to work out which of the individuals who pay income tax will be paying the tax and which will be exempted under arrangements that we are still struggling to find out about from you.
Minister, you are in coalition with the Greens political party. I ask you again as you have still not answered this question: why is it that individuals should pay this flood tax levy and not the major multinationals, the companies that contribute some 55 per cent of Australia’s total income tax revenue, according to the information you gave us last night? I will quote from a statement by Senator Bob Brown:
The Greens believe that these rich mineral resources and the wealth they generate should be shared by all Australians.
He went on to say:
These multinational companies that reap these rich rewards should be paying their fair share of tax.
He also issued a press release on 16 January saying:
Coal barons should help pay for catastrophes.
Minister, this is your coalition partner, the Greens political party. Why are they not helping pay for the Queensland flood recovery? They are exempted—BHP, Xstrata, Rio Tinto. They are not going to pay a cent to this, but the local electrician and the local plumber will be paying a tax. Why is it, Minister, that individuals should be contributing to the recovery payment?
I ask a further question in the hope that you will answer them. Will the money collected by this tax go to individuals or will it simply go to state governments? There is a perception around that is being promoted by the Labor Party that this flood tax levy is going to go out and help people’s homes to be rebuilt and furniture to be replaced. My understanding is that that is not true. It is simply going to the Queensland state Labor government and other state governments for roads, bridges and that sort of thing. Can you clarify that for us, Minister? I think that is something the people of Australia would like today.
To recapitulate, I want to know how many taxpayers pay the 45 per cent figure that you mentioned last night; what is the department’s estimate of those who will be exempted; what is the rationale for charging individuals rather than corporate taxpayers; and have there been deals done on where the $1.8 billion is to be spent—for example, more directly, is the $650 million going to go to Mr Katter’s electorate? Please answer that. If the answer is ‘yes’, I would be delighted. It is an electorate I cover as well, so I would be pleased to hear it. But I also want you to tell me whether it is going to individuals or just to the state government to build roads. I hope that you may be able to answer those questions and at the same time help Senator Cash and Senator Fisher in the very legitimate questions that they have also asked about this particular tax.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2011-03-22,"—I am an Independent and I am here to help, so I am wondering whether I can assist Senator Macdonald and Senator Cormann.
—Are you going to answer some questions?
—No, I am not here to answer questions that have been directed to the government. That would be improper. But I do want to refer Senators Macdonald and Cormann, I think quite properly, to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee’s report that was tabled just yesterday on this piece of legislation. I attended that inquiry from the beginning to the very end. It is important to take into account page 10 of that report, which looked at the issue of exemptions. Treasury officials advised the committee that a draft of the legislative instrument has been released for consultation. It identifies those individuals who will be exempted from the levy as being: firstly, recipients of Australian government disaster recovery payments; secondly, individuals affected by disasters declared under the natural disaster recovery and relief arrangements, the NDRRA; and, thirdly, New Zealand citizens holding special category visas who are not eligible for an Australian government disaster recovery payment, despite meeting the eligibility requirements.
In the course of the evidence given to that inquiry I asked questions in relation to the Stockport floods in South Australia. People have lost their homes in this flood event that affected this small but very precious and valuable community in the mid-north of South Australia. In response to the concerns raised, Treasury explained that in those areas of South Australia that have been the subject of a declaration made under NDRRA and where at least one of the following conditions was satisfied—the individual was seriously injured; the individual was the immediate family member of an Australian that was killed, the individual’s principal place of residence was destroyed or sustained major damage, the individual was unable to gain access to their principal place of residence for at least 24 hours, or the individual was stranded in their principal place of residence for at least 24 hours—the affected individuals would be covered by item 2 of the legislative instrument.
Mr Robinson from Treasury confirmed that individuals will be exempt from the levy in the sense that, according to the Disaster Assist website, for the severe weather situation in South Australia in early December 2010, NDRRA assistance was declared for the local government areas of the Clare Valley, the Gilbert Valley, Loxton, Waikerie, Mid Murray and the Barossa. So they were the areas covered and they were the criteria for that, and that is at page 11 of the report. That is my understanding and I think that the criteria are set out quite clearly there in the circumstances in which it applies. There are effectively two streams that would apply as to who would be exempt from it, and those declarations are usually made at a state level as part of the NDRRA.
I am quite comfortable about the administrative arrangements made. Obviously, there are issues about the administrative simplicity in terms of people being able to apply for an exemption and that is something that I think the government is acutely aware of. You do not want it to be onerous. With regard to Senator Cormann’s and Senator Back’s quite proper concerns for their constituents in Western Australia in relation to bushfires, I do not think it is contingent on the Prime Minister or a member of the government making a statement as such. If there is a declaration given for a particular area under the NDRRA arrangements then that would apply.
I think there have been other comments made, quite reasonably, about mitigation. If you look at the NDRRA document, and in particular the new NDRRA determination that was tabled yesterday—which took a number of weeks of very intense negotiations between my office and the government—you will see it sets out guidelines for those relief arrangements where the whole issue of mitigation is a principal concern. Reference is made to paragraph 2 of the guidelines: ‘A fundamental principle of the current arrangements is that they should not be seen as a disincentive to plan, mitigate or allocate resources for natural disasters nor discourage governments, individuals or businesses taking out insurance to protect their assets.’
I hope I have been able to assist the committee in relation to some of the concerns that have been raised. The report of Senate inquiry that was conducted recently by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee sorted out a number of these quite legitimate concerns that have been raised by my colleagues this morning, in particular Senators Cormann, Macdonald and Fisher. I hope that is of some assistance to the committee consideration of this bill.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-03-22,"—I really admire—constructive as ever—Senator Xenophon’s attempts to do the minister’s job when the minister, representing this Labor government which wants to whack another tax on the Australian people, is too arrogant to answer some legitimate questions. Senator Xenophon has, in his attempt to do the job for the government, added further complication to it.
I go back to the question. I am very well aware of the Senate committee report into this. It of course refers to a draft legislative instrument and talks about consultation. But we have got no idea what the final decision is. What we do know, though, is that the Prime Minister was well able to make an ad hoc decision when she was asked a question by journalists from the West Australian in relation to bushfire victims in Western Australia. It is a decision we support. We think this is a bad tax. We will oppose this tax. We do not think this tax should go ahead. We think that this should be properly managed through the normal budget process, which it easily could be. We think the government should re-prioritise its wasteful spending in other areas. However, if this tax is to become law then we think that people who have been impacted by natural disasters across Australia should be exempt from paying this tax. It does not make sense for the government, with one hand, to hand out taxpayer dollars to assist people who are in financial distress as a result of a natural disaster, and then to say, ‘We are going to take the money back from you because we are going to hit you with the flood tax—with an increase in your income tax.’
I am aware that the Senate Economics Legislation Committee has canvassed these issues during its deliberations and I am aware of the evidence that was given by Treasury. But the evidence given by Treasury, with all due respect, does not, until we are told otherwise by this government, represent government policy. At this stage all we have been told is, ‘We’ve got this draft list of people who may or may not end up in the final legislative instrument.’
I go back to what is currently on the Treasury website—unless, of course, Treasury has now removed this flood levy fact sheet—which says that those people who are going to be exempt are those who have ‘received an Australian government disaster recovery payment in relation to a flood event in 2010-11’. It says that those people will be exempt from the levy. That is very narrow. That is the advice on Treasury’s website as we speak.
We also have, as a second piece of commentary from the government, the statement from the Prime Minister’s spokesman to the West Australian newspaper to say that victims of the Kelmscott bushfire would also not have to pay the national flood levy. But as Senator Fisher previously outlined in the chamber—very eloquently, I might add—there is a whole series of people right across Australia who are impacted by natural disaster events and who are receiving from the Commonwealth government assistance in order to help them deal with the financial distress they have experienced. In Victoria there is natural disaster assistance available for 36 local government areas: Alpine, Ballarat, Benalla, Buloke, Campaspe, Central Goldfields, Gannawarra, Glenelg, Golden Plains, Greater Bendigo, Greater Geelong, Greater Shepparton, Hepburn, Hindmarsh, Horsham, Hume, Indigo, Loddon, Mansfield, Mildura, Mitchell, Moira, Mount Alexander, Moyne, Murrindindi, Northern Grampians, Pyrenees, Strathbogie, Swan Hill, Towong, Wangaratta, Warrnambool, Wodonga, Wyndham, Yarra Ranges and Yarriambiack. These are local government areas where people have been receiving natural disaster relief funding and the government has said nothing as to what the status is of Australians in those areas in terms of an exemption from the flood tax.
What about people in South Australia? Again, Senator Fisher made the point very eloquently about people in the areas of Clare, Gilbert Valleys, Loxton Waikerie, Mid Murray and The Barossa. What about people in Western Australia that were subject to a severe thunderstorm on 29 January 2011? They have received natural disaster relief funding, and there are 20 local government areas there: Beverley, Brookton, Cuballing, Cunderdin, Dalwallinu, Goomalling, Narrogin, Northam, Perenjori, Pingelly, Quairading, Toodyay, Victoria Plains, Wagin, Wandering, West Arthur, Wickepin, Williams, Wongan Hills and York. In Tasmania, the minister’s own home state, 11 local government areas have been receiving natural disaster assistance from the federal government.
—I live in one—my property actually flooded.
—For the minister’s benefit, I will say what those local government areas are. He might not be aware of people in his home state who have been the subject of this natural disaster relief assistance, but they are from 11 local government areas: Break O’Day, Burnie, Central Coast, Devonport, Dorset, Kentish, Latrobe, Meander, Northern Midlands, Waratah-Wynyard and West Tamar.
So, Minister, it is a very simple question. Senator Xenophon has very helpfully pointed you to the evidence of Treasury officials stating that some of these people may be exempt. But can you confirm in this chamber for us today that all these people who received natural disaster relief funding from the Commonwealth will be exempt from the flood tax? To be honest, the way these decisions have been made so far is highly unsatisfactory. Initially the decision was that it would be only those who had been subject to a flood event. Then the minister, at risk of a bad headline the next day in the West Australian, made a decision on the run, on the spot, to exclude and exempt the good people of Kelmscott who had been subject to a bushfire tragedy.
—That’s not right, though.
—That is exactly right. Senator Xenophon, I will read you through this sequence again for your benefit. On 22 February at Senate estimates, I had the following interchange with the Secretary of the Department of Finance and Deregulation:
Senator CORMANN—Would people like those in Kelmscott who were subject to bushfires be exempt from the flood tax?
Mr Tune—No, not necessarily. That is the government’s—
Senator CORMANN—Why is that?
Mr Tune—The government’s decision at the moment is that those who were subject to the floods are exempt from the levy. It would require another decision to alter that.
Senator CORMANN—Only if the natural disaster you were subject to was a flood will you be exempt from the flood tax? If it is any other natural disaster, you are not exempt at the moment?
Mr Tune—That is the situation as it stands at the moment.
That afternoon, on the back of those comments, a journalist from the West Australian went to the Prime Minister’s office and asked, ‘Why is that?’ I will read the first three sentences of a story that appeared the next day in the West Australian:
Julia Gillard has said the victims of the Kelmscott bushfire will not have to pay the national flood levy. The Prime Minister made the decision last night after a senior bureaucrat said that although the fire victims qualified for $1000 disaster recovery payments, they were still expected to pay the levy. A spokesman for Ms Gillard said victims of this years WA bushfires would be exempted.
That is what I call policy on the run, Senator Xenophon. I am very happy for the good people of Kelmscott, but I want to know about people in all these other parts of Australia that have been subjected to natural disaster events. If the government has made a decision that all of them are going to be exempt, why wouldn’t the minister very simply get up and say, ‘All of those Australians in all of those areas across Australia that are receiving natural disaster relief assistance from the Commonwealth will be exempt from having to pay the flood tax’? Why wouldn’t the minister just get up and say that?
I might be a naturally suspicious person when it comes to promises made by the government. But if the minister got up now and said, ‘We have made a decision that all of those people impacted by natural disasters across Australia will be exempted from the flood tax,’ then I would take his word and the word of the government for it. But he has not said that. He has not been prepared to say that. He has not even been prepared in the debate today or last night in the committee stage to confirm that the bushfire victims in Kelmscott would be exempted. To make things more complicated, the Treasury, on its own website, is saying that only those Australians subject to a flood event will be exempt. It would not take the minister much to clarify this. I can only assume that the government has not got much legislation that they have to deal with in this chamber, because clearly the minister is not interested in cutting through this, in providing a sensible answer to a legitimate question that has been asked to make sure that the Senate can get on with other business.
We know that the coalition is going to vote against this tax, but we want to know whether or not people in areas impacted by natural disaster across Australia will be exempt. It is a very simple question which has a very simple answer. I am conscious, Senator Xenophon, of what Treasury officials said during the committee inquiry as to what is in the draft legislative instrument. I want to know whether the government has made a decision in relation to all these other people. It has been able to make a decision in relation to the people in Kelmscott in Western Australia. Why can’t it make a decision in relation to people impacted by natural disaster in Victoria or in South Australia or indeed in the minister’s own home state of Tasmania?
I can only draw one conclusion from this: the government does not want to exempt all these people across Australia who have been impacted by natural disasters and the government is planning to hit all these people with this flood tax. I can only assume that the government is quite happy to provide financial assistance to people who have been subject to a natural disaster, because they are in financial distress, and then turn around and take back the money by imposing this flood tax.
If this is not the government’s plan, it is very simple for the minister to resolve this. All the minister needs to do is get up and provide an answer. It is very simple. It comes down to this, Senator Xenophon. The very simple question is: has the government made a decision and can the government give a guarantee that all Australians who have been subject to a natural disaster and who are receiving an Australian government disaster recovery payment in relation to any natural disaster, as defined on the Attorney-General’s website—that is, a bushfire, an earthquake, a flood, a storm, a cyclone, a storm surge, a landslide, a tsunami, a meteorite strike or a tornado—will not be required to pay the flood tax?
If the minister can find it in his heart to actually provide reassurance to Australians who are impacted by these sorts of events across Australia that, yes, they will be exempt and that, no, they will not be required to pay this tax, then we can progress this debate. But this minister is too arrogant to provide an answer to a very simple question, which is highly relevant for many, many people right across Australia. The government know how to whack on another tax, but they do not know how to be accountable in the parliament for the impact it has on people across Australia. There is a very specific question before this chamber which relates to those Australians who have been impacted by natural disasters that are not classified as flood events.
Senator Xenophon, I really do hope that you share the coalition’s view that this is an issue that should be clarified by the government before the Senate is asked to make a final decision on this legislation. The federal government have been able to make statements in relation to those Australians who were subject to flood events and they have been able to make a decision in relation to those Australians impacted by bushfires in Kelmscott in Western Australia. I am very pleased that they have decided to exempt victims of bushfires in Kelmscott. But why can’t the government make similar decisions in relation to all those other Australians who have been subject to natural disaster events in all those other parts of Australia, including in the minister’s own home state of Tasmania, as we have been able to identify during this debate?
Why would the government not take this opportunity to provide reassurance to those people across Australia who have been victims of a natural disaster who are in financial distress to the extent that the federal government provides assistance to them through the Australian government disaster recovery payment program? Why would the government not be able to tell the Senate, here and now, that all these people will be exempt?
It is a very simple question and it is a question that deserves an answer. People across Australia would form a very dim judgment of this government if it persists with its refusal to provide an answer. If the Prime Minister can make a decision on the run, because she is worried about a bad headline in the West Australian the next day, to exempt people in Kelmscott who have been victims of bushfires, why can’t she make a decision in relation to all these other victims of natural disasters in other parts of Australia? It is a very simple proposition which the minister should very carefully consider. I can see, Senator Xenophon, that you are very keen to jump up and do the minister’s job again and provide some explanation— (Time expired)

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2011-03-22,"—I will answer. I have answered on a number of occasions, as you well know, Senator Cormann and Senator Macdonald. The answer is yes. This debate, along with other, so-called questions, which has now gone on for about an hour and a half and which went on for three hours last night—
—On the third reading!
—on the third reading. Senator Cormann, I sit and listen patiently to you; I do not interject. But you sit down after asking an alleged question which is more in the nature of a speech. I think for those Australians who are listening to this debate, this is a time for questions, not long speeches. I pointed out last night, in the first hour of the debate—I answered the questions—that many of the questions that were being asked had in fact been asked before and had been dealt with in the second reading debate.
—You don’t answer them!
—Senator Macdonald interjects again. I listen courteously to him, but he interjects. The opposition have made long, rambling speeches about issues and have asked questions which have already been put before the Senate and have been answered. We are seeing a filibuster. The opposition are not willing to accept that the majority of the Senate chamber, on the second reading debate, supported the legislation. They are not willing to accept that. They are trying to prevent the legislation going to a third reading vote. If they want to do that, that is their prerogative. It is known as a filibuster. We have now been engaged in it for some 4½ hours. If that is the way the opposition want to behave—they know they do not have the majority in the Senate; they do not want to put it to the final vote. Let us see what the final vote is. All these issues have been canvassed, after some 4½ hours of debate. If you want to continue with this approach, that is your prerogative. This legislation will be debated and discussed in the way you are doing so for the rest of the week. No other business will be undertaken. It may in fact mean that the Senate has to come back for an extra week of sitting. If you want to persist with this approach—4½ hours of filibustering by Senator Macdonald and Senator Cormann—so be it. I am perfectly happy to sit here and answer questions. I have done so. I have answered the questions and if you want to continue to ask questions in this form for another four hours or another four days, so be it. I will sit here and, at the appropriate time, I will respond.

"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2011-03-22,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations (Senator Evans), the Minister for Sport (Senator Arbib) and the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Senator Carr) to questions without notice asked by Senators Fifield, Payne and Colbeck today.
I might as well start off by commenting that I find it absolutely remarkable that Senator Arbib, the minister, in his response to Senator Payne, would dare mutter the words ‘here comes the scare campaign’ when Senator Payne was asking the very proper question about the impacts of the carbon tax on public housing recipients. How dare Minister Arbib suggest, ‘Here comes the scare campaign.’
The scare campaign is the government’s and the government’s very own. Forget about ‘here comes the opposition scare campaign’, because ‘Here comes the sun’ is as sophisticated as the government scare campaign. That is all it is: a scare campaign as sophisticated as: ‘Here comes the sun. Therefore thou shalt have a carbon tax’—a carbon tax with no detail. It is a carbon tax at what price per tonne? We do not know. The government’s carbon tax adviser himself, Ross Garnaut, speculates that it will be something between $20 and $30 a tonne.
Who will have to pay this carbon tax? For now, apparently not agriculture. That has to reassure the nation’s farmers. Who will be exempt from having to pay the carbon tax? Who else? Which other industries? We know not. How much extra will people have to pay at the bowser and at the supermarket if a carbon tax is to be imposed? We know not. Who will be compensated? And by how much? Who will not be compensated? We know not. What we know—and all we know—is the government scare campaign: ‘Here comes the sun; thou shalt have a carbon tax.’ We know a bit more though. We know that this government is hell-bent on expending taxpayer funds on an advertising campaign. You could ask: for what? They have funded all these experts to tell them about the carbon tax.
We still do not know the details of it so who is the government going to call? Minister Combet says, ‘Thank you, Senator Nash, now I will not call ghost busters. I will not call myth busters. Who I will call is spin meisters.’ Minister Combet said overnight that the government is examining ‘a number of options for public communications’—about a scare campaign and a policy intent about which we do not know the detail. So Minister Combet said the government is examining ‘a number of options for public communications’ and that this will involve contact with public relations agencies as was ‘standard practice’. You are not wrong about that, Minister. So when this government knows not they call in the spin meisters. That is where they go for their answers, which is a bit intriguing given that the same minister told the Australian public some two weeks ago on Lateline:
It is perfectly valid when developing an important public policy like this that you release your policy intentions in the way that we have ...
So he has conceded that is all the government has: a scare campaign—here comes the sun, thou shalt have a carbon tax. It is full of intention but no detail; we do not know it yet. But a public communications firm might help with the detail—let’s hope so—because this government is going to spend our taxpayer funds on advertising it. Will the advertising campaign cost $30 million or perhaps $40 million? Will it cost the amount that you set aside to advertise your ETS?
Will your advertising campaign cost $30 million, the $30 million that was set aside for the last aborted campaign? Or what about the $13 million that your government spent on advertising the failed GROCERYchoice, on the policy intent to go ahead with choice which ultimately came to nothing? What about the government’s botched and bungled—and, thankfully, subsequently aborted—Home Insulation Program? What about the millions of taxpayer dollars spent promoting that program? What about the government’s failed Green Loans program? What about how much money this government spent advertising the Green Start program, which never started? So how much money is this government now going to spend on a policy intent, a scare campaign, that is no more sophisticated than here comes the sun and thou shalt have a carbon tax?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,3,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2011-03-22,"—I say, on the same matter, that Senator Fisher might want to move away from themes such as ‘here comes the sun’ or the Hokey Pokey or the time warp and seriously address the matters that have been before us in question time. However, I must say that, given the opportunity to review several questions asked by the opposition, we do need to seriously address what is an obvious scaremongering campaign.
Let us look at the nature of those questions today. We had them on Christmas Island escapees, political extremism and the impact of the carbon tax. Unfortunately, in this taking-note session we did not even have Senator Fisher understanding the question that had been asked by her colleague Senator Payne. Senator Payne did not, as Senator Fisher indicated, ask the question in relation to the impact of the carbon tax on people in public housing or social housing. Her question was about how many people in housing generally would be shifted into social housing. So please, Senator Fisher, before you put on a performance like that at least understand the question that your colleagues have actually asked. But I thank you at least for the opportunity to reflect on the quality of those questions.
Mr Deputy President, I was somewhat surprised by the nature of your question. I would ask you to reflect on how you question the government when you refer to people such as prison officers doing the government’s ‘dirty work’. It is no wonder that we characterise the nature of these questions as a scare campaign. When the government brings additional resources to Christmas Island to deal with the problems and the trauma—and we all know of the trauma suffered by some of those people who are on Christmas Island—it does not assist in any policy sense or in any reasonable government sense or in any reasonable opposition sense to have that characterised as doing the government’s ‘dirty work’. I would expect better from any senator in this place.
Then we moved on to the discussion about political extremism. The answer from the government here highlighted that there is political extremism across the full political spectrum and that we have seen much of that as well. I agree with Senator Evans that here in Australia fortunately we have been able to proceed politically with a level of political moderatism. If we want to promote extremism, then the opposition can attempt scare campaigns such as this and continue to try to. But I have come across in recent times several examples of where people among the general public have been led to completely misunderstand the nature of a minority government. The reason that they completely misunderstand the nature of a minority government is the way in which this opposition characterises what one is. We in this place all know what minority government is, but there is no excuse at all for the way in which some members of the opposition, particularly those that I would class as having a more extreme perspective, seek to characterise the nature of the arrangements in this parliament. We had an election result and the government has gone on to move forward and deal with the consequences of that election result. We have an opposition though who seek to take advantage of those consequences by scaremongering and using every opportunity they have to misrepresent the circumstances both in this parliament and in the policy perspectives that we are dealing with.
Let me reinforce the messages from the ministers in today’s question time in response to some of those issues. As I said, Christmas Island was also one of the themes in today’s question time. Border security has not and will not be compromised. That is very clear. This government will avoid political extremism. We will avoid political extremism on both sides of the political spectrum, and I wish the opposition would take the same approach.
Finally, this government will take responsible action on climate change. Despite a scaremongering campaign from those opposite, we will take responsible action, we will consult broadly in relation to the mechanisms we use and any scare campaign that suggests otherwise because there are not answers right now—because we will have comprehensive consultation and engagement—is simply that, scaremongering by the opposition, who should know better.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,3,1
"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2011-03-22,"—I rise to contribute on taking note of the answers to questions today. How embarrassing it must be for the Labor government. Prime Minister Julia Gillard said, ‘There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.’ That was on Channel 10 on 16 August 2010. But now Prime Minister Gillard has announced that there will be a carbon tax. That raises the question, if there is going to be no carbon tax under the government that Ms Gillard leads, who is leading the government? She is obviously not, because she has said. ‘There will be no carbon tax under any government I lead.’
Of course, it went on. On the Friday before the election, Ms Gillard stated categorically, ‘I rule out a carbon tax.’ It was on the front page of the Australian on 20 August 2010. Treasurer Wayne Swan said, ‘What we rejected is this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax.’ That was on Meet the Press on 15 August 2010. Mr Swan again, on 12 August 2010, on The 7.30 Report, said: ‘We have made our position very clear. We have ruled it out.’
But now it is in. This is a broken promise of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister. Of course, now they are throwing around the lollies—the compensation. First it was Minister Combet, then Minister Crean: 100 per cent of the tax collected will go toward compensation to households. And now Professor Garnaut has said that 50 per cent—that is his recommendation—will go to households. It is amazing to have an economist who is such an expert on science. He has read one side of the equation. I wonder if he ever listened to Professor Latif, one of the key advisors to the IPCC, who said that in actual fact the globe has been cooling from the late 1990s and will continue to cool for the next 10 to 20 years. No, they are not allowed to listen to that; they only listen to one side, obviously—Professor Garnaut.
This carbon tax, according to the spin put on it by the government, is to bring certainty into Australia. As my leader, Warren Truss, said, ‘The only thing certain about the carbon tax is shifting industries overseas.’ We had an announcement in February that there will be a carbon tax. Prime Minister Gillard and Minister Combet, flanked by the de facto Prime Minister of Australia, Senator Bob Brown, and his deputy, Senator Milne, and the Independents—Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor—announced that we are going to have a carbon tax. One would have thought that all those who were there are in agreement. But now Mr Windsor is moving away, saying, ‘We might not have a carbon tax.’
This certainty is going to be put out to Australian businesses, industries and investment. This is what they are trying to create: certainty. How much will a carbon tax be? Will it be $20, or $26 or $30? Will it go on fuel? If it is $26 and it goes on fuel, that will be another 7c a litre. What will that cost regional Australia? In towns near where I live, everything comes in on the road; there is no rail. All the groceries, all the supplies, all the food and all the products that are in our electrical stores all come in on the road, and of course everything goes out on the road. All the beef from Bindaree Beef at Inverell, off to export every day of the week, goes out on the road. Are we going to look at an extra 7c a litre on fuel? This is a certainty.
But it gets worse. After three to five years we are going to an emissions trading scheme whereby the price of carbon will be determined by the dealers on the world market. Will it be $20 a tonne or will it be $200, as the NAB flagged at one stage? This is going to bring certainty? We have a fluctuating world price, and the size of your electricity bill will determine how the traders are going on the world market. And they call this certainty. This is just outrageous. Certainty is the last thing it will deliver. The one thing that can put certainty into our economy is to never have a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. But no, this is a certainty being flagged by the government.
About 30 billion tonnes of CO2 are produced each year from the burning of fossil fuels. Australia produces around 370 million tonnes. If we lower ours by 70 million tonnes, what is it going to do if the rest of the world stays the same? It will bring C02 from about 380 parts per million down to about 379 parts per million. And that is going to save the world and stop it heating up? That is outrageous.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,3,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2011-03-22,"—The questioning today, regardless of the wider question but certainly on any issues to do with the carbon tax or emissions trading scheme, were confused, misleading and illogical, and I think that sums up the quality of debate from the opposition on this issue. I respect that the opposition is caught in a bit of a bind. Within that side of parliament there are markedly different views about climate change and global warming, and there have been some quite markedly different policy views expressed about the coalition position as well. The coalition members must be anxious about standing up and saying anything in case their leader changes policy the next day and they are caught back in the old system. So they stand here in this place and spout rhetoric, grab on to whatever slight titbit of information might come from one of the industry groups who are lobbying for their own industry’s position and try to use that to shore up their own position.
In fact, I am a bit surprised that they have raised the issue today, given the latest poll, which seems to show that they are losing support. One of the key reasons the coalition is losing support generally is this very issue. It seems that people are not responding well to the direct action proposal of Mr Tony Abbott. They are not responding well to the way the coalition is dealing with this issue, and who could blame them? Where does the coalition stand? Where is the logicality of its position? It is nowhere.
The Labor Party has announced that there will be a carbon tax and the overall design and mechanism of how it will work. We are asking for input from key groups. We are asking for input from everyone. The Prime Minister has even offered the coalition some role in all of this, which has been refused. Once the overall architecture has been announced, those industry groups who are now vigorously lobbying, as is their right, to have some input into the design will have it. The government is going out there consulting. Time after time in this place I hear the Liberal Party asking for more consultation. The population have got consulation in this time and within a particular framework. One of the bits of that framework, as the Prime Minister has made very clear, is that lower income households will not suffer as a result of the imposition of a carbon tax. Assistance will go to households.
We have also stated that assistance will go to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries. We will not export jobs offshore. That was indeed one of the bases for the emissions trading system that was previously proposed under the previous parliament. No-one is going to sacrifice 45,000 jobs, I think the figure was, offshore. That is not what is proposed and the coalition know it, but they want to embark on a scare campaign because they have not got a substantive policy to deal with it. Their direct action policy, given their commitment to a five per cent reduction in emissions by 2020, will cost $30 billion. Who is going to pay for that? How is that going to be paid? Mr Abbott has proposed cuts in programs, but we all know that that will not be adequate. And where do you go into the future with that?
We have a problem in the coalition, as illustrated by Senator Williams, who clearly does not believe in climate change. There are others in the party opposite who do believe in climate change. Where do you go? We do not know and I do not think the population of Australia knows. (Time expired)

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2011-03-22,"—Here we go again. When the Labor Party are in trouble they pretend they are not the government. They talk as if they are the opposition and they talk about this side of the chamber. All we hear from them are key phrases. It must be depressing on the other side of this chamber to have a different message about the carbon tax almost daily. We have heard different excuses and reasons and now, finally, they have gone back to the Hawke era. We have got the spirit of Bob Hawke, with Ross Garnaut coming out here to give them some momentum in this debate.
The term ‘scare campaign’ is nothing more than a fudge for Labor being in trouble. The truth here is that the Labor Party has broken an explicit promise. There was no qualification and there was no doubt. It was said directly into the camera, as contrived and rehearsed as everything else that comes out of this Prime Minister’s mouth. You know that that broken promise made the difference last year and, just like all the lobotomised state governments that are falling around the country, you hope that the Australian people will forget it. But they will not forget your duplicity and they will not forget your cowardice in refusing to take this to the people the way the coalition did with its tax package in 1998. You are simply hoping against hope that the Australian people will give you a free pass.
I would like to examine some of the arguments put forward by this government—some of the many arguments we have heard over the past few weeks, but we do not know if they will be the same ones we will hear next week. It might take another spirit from the Hawke government to come back to give them that argument. We apparently need to introduce a price on carbon because forcing up the price of electricity and fuel will lead to a substantial decrease in its use. As if the 50 per cent increase in power prices in my home state of Victoria over the past three years was not going to do it, the government wants to chuck on another 40 per cent in the next three years. What sort of economic sense does it make when you do not take into account the evidence that is already out there in the public domain? ‘The stone age did not end because we ran out of stones’ is an old economists’ truth. The other thing is that the stone age did not end because they introduced a stone tax or a stone trading system.
Pushing up the price of electricity by a few hundred dollars for each household is not going to lead to the technological breakthroughs we need if we are going to move to the greater use of renewable or low-emissions energy. This government knows that. This contrived market, this contrived price signal, is nothing more than a tax grab, and there is real concern and fear about this in the community. Only two Saturdays ago I and a number of my colleagues—Senator Fifield and Senator McGauran—were at a rally outside the Prime Minister’s electorate office in Werribee in the western suburbs of Melbourne. Over 500 people turned out that day to protest. As someone who grew up in the western suburbs of Melbourne, I can tell you that these are not people who regularly come to a rally. But there was genuine community anger because there was fear for their jobs, fear for their businesses and fear for their cost of living. They have worn the cost of this federal Labor government over the past three years, they have worn the cost increases by state Labor governments over the past decade, and they know what is coming next. They know that it is only going to get worse.
This government throws around the word ‘reform’ as if reform were somehow a lifeboat from the disaster they are in and the leaking ship that is this government. The ALP yell ‘compensation for the introduction of this new tax’. Let us just sit back and think of that for a second, compared to the history in this country. They are going to introduce a new tax and they are kind enough to give you back half of it, but only to those select Australians they approve of. Yet again the people on the other side of this chamber seek to divide Australia between those who they think are worthy of paying more tax—and having some of it given back to them—and those who they think are not. That is consistent with the divisive approach the Labor Party has always taken. When the coalition introduced the GST—I was not in this chamber at the time—10 taxes were abolished. Tell me: what taxes are going to be abolished when this carbon tax is introduced?
—None.
—Apart from you, Senator Abetz, I hear crickets from the other side of the house—the deafening silence of truth. The truth is that they are only interested in the tax grab.
The compensation is nothing more than a con. As well as it being a con that you are going to introduce compensation for a tax you are introducing, you know that the carbon price is meant to rise. You know that this carbon tax is meant to increase in price, so the compensation you allegedly are promising—a worthless promise for people tomorrow—will be worth nothing in two or three years time as you jack up the carbon price. This government will be condemned by the Australian people.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2011-03-22,"—To understand the gravity surrounding today’s matter of public importance, it is very important to set the scene. We need to understand properly what the state of Australia’s detention network was when the Howard government lost office in 2007 and then look at the state of the detention network in March 2011 under the Gillard government and after the Rudd government.
These are the facts. When the Howard government lost office, only four people who had arrived illegally by boat were in detention in Australia. Let us compare that to March 2011 under what is now the Gillard Labor government. Today, that figure is more than 6,300 and that includes more than 1,000 children. The annual budget has increased sevenfold since Labor came to power. That is Australian taxpayers’ money that is being utilised to pay for Labor’s policy failings. There has been a total budget blow-out of over $1 billion. That is $1 billion of taxpayer’s money by which this government has underestimated costs when forecasting the number of asylum seekers who would come to Australia under its policies.
Of the more than 10,000 people who have turned up by boat since this government came to power, only 160 have been returned to their countries of origin. When considering the Labor government’s border protection policy, this is what Australians are now faced with. Christmas Island is beyond capacity. It is so beyond capacity that the AFP have requested that the port be closed because they cannot afford to have any more people coming to the island.
The Labor Party are now opening detention centre after detention centre after detention centre on the mainland—without any consultation with the communities that are going to be affected. We all know that universal offshore processing is now history. We know that because the Labor government’s new policy, as of yesterday, is to ensure that the boats do not go to Christmas Island but are brought directly to the mainland. Detainees are escaping from detention centres on Christmas Island and, when you actually ask the minister how many have not been accounted for and how many are still on the loose on Christmas Island, the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship stands in this place and says that, quite frankly, he does not know. I will be honest with you—I do not think the minister actually cares either. That is an absolute disgrace.
When questioned about the failure of the government’s border protection policies, the government tries to counter its failures with a massive spin. We all saw the Department of Immigration and Citizenship’s advertisement on page 28 of yesterday’s Australian. What was it doing? It was seeking applications for an additional six public affairs and media officers, those positions paying between $56,000 and $117,000 a year. It would be laughable if it were not true. When will those on the other side understand that you cannot spin your way out of policy failures of this magnitude? Talking of spin, what did the minister say last Thursday? Following a night of rioting by some asylum seekers on Christmas Island, Minister Bowen came out with:
… the situation on the island as we speak is calm.
I do not know if Christmas Island residents would necessarily agree with Mr Bowen. After another night of rioting, the minister said:
At no stage during the week have I underplayed the seriousness of this situation.
We all know that those words have now come back to bite him. Then there was the statement by the Prime Minister, who was in complete, total and utter damage control. The Prime Minister said that the situation on Christmas Island was all under control.
Let us have a look at the situation on Christmas Island. We had the use of tear gas and beanbag rounds, we had mass breakouts, we had fires, we had rock-throwing and we had protests. We still have detainees that are potentially on the loose on Christmas Island. That is the definition, under a Labor government, of a situation that is under control. That is an absolute indictment of those opposite that they would dare to say to the people of Australia and, in particular, to the people of Christmas Island that that is a situation that is under control.
Then the minister could not help himself. He went further and said: ‘I take responsibility for it and I take responsibility for making sure the situation is under control going forward.’ Well, if the minister is going to put his money where his mouth is, if the minister is actually going to live up to this so-called responsibility that he says is his alone, then the minister needs to stand before the Australian people and have the guts to admit to them that, under the Labor government, there has been a complete, total and utter breakdown of border protection policy. But we all know that the minister does not have that guts. The minister does not have the guts to actually stand before the Australian people and admit that, under this government, Australia’s borders are no longer secure.
I was reading a comment from the Christmas Island community leader, Kane Martin, who probably would like to speak with Minister Bowen in relation to his statement that the situation is calm and under control, because this is what Kane Martin said:
People are locking their doors, people are locking their cars ...
Now while this might seem like a small thing on the mainland, this is essentially the core of what it is to be a Christmas Islander—to have that sense of freedom, to have that sense of safety and to have that sense of community all around us.
It’s certainly been challenged at every level.
That is an absolute disgrace, and it is the sole fault of the Gillard Labor government. The bad news for Australians is that this is a situation that need never have occurred. I go back to what the situation was in 2007 when the Howard government lost office. Those on the other side are very quick to throw statistics at us and say, ‘But under your watch you had thousands arriving.’ Do you know what? Yes, we did. You are right—yes, we did. But unlike those on the other side we had the guts, we had the stomach to stand up and make some very, very tough policy decisions. Once we had made those decisions we had the guts and the stomach to stand by those decisions.
We all know what the result of those decisions was. It is a statistical reality that the boats stopped coming. That is something that those on the other side cannot deny. It is also a reality that, when those on the other side decided to wind back the Howard government’s strong border protection measures, the boats started coming again.
There is only one way forward and that is for those on the other side and for the minister to realise, to stand up, to have some guts and to re-adopt the Howard government’s strong border protection policies. Despite the Prime Minister’s pathetic protestations Australia’s borders are not safe. As at 4 February 2011 there were 6,659 people in immigration detention. This is an appalling record and continues to confirm that Gillard Labor is failing to protect Australia’s borders. (Time expired)

—Order! Senator McGauran, I am actually addressing my remarks to you directly. You might do me the courtesy of listening. Cease interjecting and I will give Senator Moore the call.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and we will review the Hansard to make that clear as it demonises the debate, as we know. Today we heard lots of rhetoric and very colourful language. I forgot how many times the words ‘guts’ and ‘stomach’ were mentioned in the previous contribution. I lost track after seven times.
Basically we have a debate today about the issue of detention and about the policies that this government has put in place since we were elected. They are policies that we went, very openly, to the Australian people with. It interested me that the previous contributor kept talking about the minister taking responsibility, stepping up and using his guts and stomach, but I got the impression that what that meant was having courage to come forward and talk with the Australian people about what was going on.
I do not believe there has been a minister who has had more public commentary on the issues of his portfolio over the last couple of months than Minister Bowen. Consistently he has run the line that our policy is part of an international response to the issue of refugees. One of the things that the opposition cannot understand is that our policy is looking at responding and working with refugees through the UNHCR, using the internationally accepted processes and ensuring that the law is fulfilled but most importantly that there is compassion. Senator Cash did talk about the statistics but I am not going through a statistical argument; we have had that. We know how many people have come in and how many boats have arrived. We have seen the stunning press releases that have been issued every time by the opposition. We saw the splendid imagery in recent times that was showing large red boats attacking our—
—We saw the imagery: boats crashing up against rocks.
—Order! I will ask senators to refrain from interjecting. I again remind senators that Senator Cash was heard in silence and I think—
—Which shows enormous restraint.
—I would ask all senators to cease interjecting.
—We have a coalition that is determined to demonise people who have an absolute right to seek refuge. Once they seek that right, it is our law to ensure that they fulfil the aspects of refuge. It is a straightforward process. We work under international guidelines using our law to ensure that people who are claiming refuge have a right to that process. Not everybody receives that outcome, but under Australian law they receive the process.
We have had more boats coming; no-one denies that. Minister Bowen actually talks to the Australian community about that. He talks about the numbers. In fact there have been great efforts made in the last six months to ensure that we work with community organisations in Australia so that children who have been unfortunately caught up in this process by travelling on boats with parents, or most sadly alone, have protection while they are in our country. Through that whole process the core principles of law are retained and that has caused delays; we acknowledge that. That is one of the worst aspects of dealing closely with the law in the refugee process. We have to ensure that our security is maintained and that has been the guiding principle at work in our government law.
However, we have always felt that there needs to be a balance. The previous government’s process did not feature a balance. The temporary protection visa process seems to be the hallmark now of all the arguments being put forward by the opposition—a magic imposition of temporary protection visas will automatically stop boats. It is not such a straightforward equation, though it is a pretty good logo and it has been used consistently in media releases by various spokespeople from the opposition.
We have to understand the international situation, something which people on the other side reject consistently. They have a limited understanding of history and selectively pull out dates and times when there were periods of migration and refugee boats coming to Australia and when there were not. They do not take into account what is happening in our region. They do not take into account what was happening in Afghanistan. They do not take into account what is happening in Sri Lanka. They do not take into account any of the features that force people to make the desperate decision to throw themselves on our mercy by seeking refugee status. It is not an easy decision.
Somehow we seem to be able in these debates to differentiate between numbers and boats and people. I cannot do that. Our government does not do that. It accepts its responsibilities and understands that the numbers are all people and they must be treated with the full respect of the law. They must understand their rights through that process and there must be a clear understanding by all involved of what is in the law, what the objects of the legislation are and what the outcome will be if they are judged to be refugees under the UNHCR guidelines or if they are not. If they are not, there are processes for returning them to their home country. That is clear. The minister explains it consistently in the media, but if you have a political agenda and you are determined to demonise people who are in that situation, of course you are going to have the kind of conflict and outrage that we have heard and will continue to hear from the other side.
Certainly it is important that this argument is understood in the community. Minister Bowen is taking up that argument in the media and also in the community through community organisations, local meetings in townships and with different people who need to know exactly how the system works. If you only take the grabs in the media that we have now, the vision that is being put out for political purposes, the people of Australia will not understand the issues around refugee status.
We need, as a community, to ask the questions. We need to meet with the people who are in this situation as much as we can. Once you meet with people who have gone through the refugee process and talk with them, those statistics take on a human form and you can understand the background to their decision, the processes they have undertaken to seek a better life, how they have fulfilled the requirements of the UNHCR to determine that they are genuinely in a refugee situation and how they have fulfilled the requirements of the Australian government. Minister Bowen has made those requirements clear. People have to pass health checks to ensure that they are healthy. People have to pass security checks to verify their true identity and to ensure they do not offer a security risk to our country.
Instead of all the yelling and all the talking about keeping our borders safe, look at the situation and look at the people who are involved. See those who have made the decision, through horrific situations in their home countries and their family areas, to actually get on the boats. Funnily enough, we always focus on the people who are on the boats. These discussions never look at the statistics and see the number of people who come into our country without the appropriate visas and approvals who have not been on the boats and identified as asylum seekers. All the debate, all the anger, all the discussion about guts and stomach seems to focus around those people who are on boats. They need to understand how the system works. Certainly that is a responsibility for our government, but not our government alone. The Australian government is proud of the role it takes in the international community working with other countries who are facing these issues about the flow of people who are seeking refugee status in their own lands. We need to work collectively in an international way to get the best possible practice, to ensure that the whole debate does not get derailed by emotion or by political rhetoric, and to understand the true definition of someone who is seeking refugee status and the responsibilities of responsible nations to accept their status. We need to have strong policies that reflect UN best practice and treat people with respect but always with full regard for the law.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2011-03-22,"—Let me start my contribution to this debate by saying I agree with some aspects of what Senator Moore said. Firstly, the government have been entirely consistent for their period of office and that is consistently wrong in their approach to how they are treating refugees and protecting Australia’s borders. There is ample evidence of that which I will get to shortly. Also Senator Moore claimed that the process that the refugees or unauthorised arrivals in this country were undergoing was in full accordance with the law. She is absolutely right. It is in accordance with the law because this government changed the law. It changed the law that stopped the boats from coming and stopped providing incentives for people smugglers and for unauthorised arrivals to try to get to this country. That was offshore processing and temporary protection visas.
This government changed the law and the boats started coming in overwhelming record numbers. What Senator Moore failed to address—and may have inadvertently misstated the position on—is the fact that we are complying with our international obligations to the point that the first safe port of call for people seeking refuge is to arrive in our country. To my knowledge, none of the people coming on these boats first arrives in Australia without going through another nation. If they are fleeing Afghanistan, they go to Pakistan or Malaysia, and they normally end up in Indonesia. They pay their tens of thousands of dollars to the people smugglers right along the way. They dispose of their identity documents if they have them and then they hop on a boat to come to Australia.
That is not a legitimate claim for asylum in my book if you have travelled through three other countries and paid your way. You are not fleeing oppression in Indonesia. You are not fleeing the Taliban. You are just seeking to get to Australia by not waiting in the appropriate refugee camps that are available in many places. Every one of these people that jumps the queue by paying the money and claiming asylum in this country stops a person who is doing the right thing and is appropriately putting themselves through the proper system, a person who probably cannot afford to pay the people smugglers and fuel their outrageous trade. That is enough of addressing Senator Moore’s concerns.
The Labor Party are caught in a very inconvenient truth. I recall the day when the facility on Christmas Island was built and it was derided and mocked by the Labor Party as a white elephant. Yet the detention centre on Christmas Island has never been fuller. The minister himself has acknowledged there were over 3,000 people in that facility when it was only built for 2,500. The results are stark. Last week they came back to haunt all Australians because last week buildings were damaged there, fires were lit. There were violent approaches to the Australian Federal Police by the people that are detained on Christmas Island. There were seven days of riots—250 of these people set buildings on fire and threw makeshift explosives at police and still this government will not condemn them. Nearly 200 Australian Federal Police officers had to be flown in and quell the rioting. They had to deliver tear gas ammunition and more police to the island through the Royal Australian Air Force. A number of these asylum seekers escaped. According to the Prime Minister that is okay because they are on an island; they cannot go anywhere. Tell that to the poor residents of Christmas Island. Yet just today we have learned that an official head count still cannot account for all the people. There must be some hiding around Christmas Island. This government do not even know where they are.
The facts are that detention centres right across this country are full to overflowing. There is no offshore processing anymore. There have been three boats in the last five days. The most recent of them hopped onto the Christmas Island bypass lane and received its escort directly into Darwin. This is outrageous. It is a catastrophic policy failure not just because Australia’s borders are being breached without authority and, despite what Senator Moore says, without a legitimate claim to asylum because it is not the first safe port of call. What is happening is the outrageous waste of taxpayers’ money in dealing with these problems, the fact that people being forced to put their lives in jeopardy are encouraged to do it. You want to talk about the pull factor. The pull factor is the great way of life we have in this country and this government’s lax way of dealing with their policy failures.
The other concerns that I know many Australians share are in the words of Mr Bowen, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, about the processing of claims of the rioters. He said:
… a small group of detainees have made it clear that they would continue violent action until they were granted visas. Of course, we cannot enter into those sorts of discussions. We do not let that sort of behaviour influence our consideration of visa applications.
I have two responses to that. The first is ‘nonsense’ and the second is ‘you should’. It is nonsense because people on the Oceanic Viking were blackmailing the previous Rudd government saying, ‘Unless we get a special deal we are not coming off and we are going to go on a hunger strike.’ Did they get a special deal? Yes, they certainly did. We all forget the emotional blackmail that was played against the government and the government folded. I would like to play cards against this government because they are hopeless.
The second part of Minister Bowen’s statement is:
We do not let that sort of behaviour influence our consideration of visa applications.
I am telling you that you should. You should let it influence it because if people are prepared to throw bombs at police whilst they are in detention being assessed for security concerns, if they are prepared to escape from lawful detainment, if they are prepared to break the law to get here, if they are prepared to set fire to buildings and hurt their fellow refugees or asylum seekers, are they really the type of people we want to have in this country? That is a legitimate question, and I know it is one that many people ask, yet we do not have an answer or any embracing of this legitimate question by this government. We simply have an approach that we can build more detention centres or asylum centres, however you want to describe them. We will provide the welcome mat for more people to get in with people smugglers and ply their vile trade.
There is no question there are many legitimate refugees in the world, and many countries are struggling with this precise issue. But Australia had this issue solved. We had an orderly assessment process under the previous government and that was changed, on an ideological whim, by this government and it has proved to be a catastrophic failure. We know they do not have the will, the strength or the courage to actually change it back. We know they have the rhetoric. We know they have their plan for the East Timor regional detention centre, but, of course, that is not going to come to fruition because Kevin 11—sorry, Mr Rudd—is responsible for negotiating it and he does not want a bar of it. So we know it is another flawed and failed policy smokescreen to divert attention from the catastrophic failure of this government to secure Australia’s borders. You want to have a sensible debate on this but the first part of having a sensible debate is admitting there is a problem. (Time expired)

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2011-03-22,"—Before I go to the gist of my speech, I have to point out to Senator Cash—having listened to her, and she was rather dramatic again, talk about how many boats came—that of more than 240 boats that arrived under the Howard government only seven were turned back.
—We stopped them. That is the point.
—They stopped coming because global circumstances changed, Senator Cash. If you do not understand that you should not be here. We know that the Taliban regime fell at the end of 2001 and millions of Afghans were able to return home. So you are really rewriting history with this supposedly wonderful life under Howard and you need to make sure you get your facts straight.
To go further into the matter of public importance as submitted by Senator Fifield that is before us today, I find it slightly misleading. I say that because it tries to link two separate matters: the control of Australian borders and the issue of maintaining order in our immigration detention centres. I can only assume that Senator Fifield has chosen to link those two topics because those opposite never ever miss the opportunity to take advantage of an unfortunate situation and score political points from it. So I can only guess that the coalition strategists were thinking ‘here’s a chance for us to score another political point about border control’ and yesterday, and again today in question time, we saw them attempt that. It is really quite unbecoming. I agree with what you said, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, in your speech yesterday, that it is quite sickening to see people try and make political advantage from the human suffering and misery of others. I thought that was a great speech. I did listen intently to it and it is a shame that some of those on the other side did not listen so well.
But, as I have stated, it is important to point out that these are two separate matters. So this MPI actually addresses two completely separate issues and as such I will deal with each issue in turn. First of all we have Senator Fifield, who knows that the only people to blame about the situation at the Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre are those detainees who perpetrated the violence and unrest there. But Senator Fifield asks the Senate to note the Gillard government’s ‘failure to return order to immigration detention facilities’. We have the Australian Federal Police in control at the Christmas Island now. They are doing all they can to work to restore the security and safety of the facility and to ensure that it can go back to normal operations. The goal is to return the responsibility to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and Serco as soon as possible and they will remain on the island until that aim is met. As for those who participated in the riot, their violence is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by this government.
I am sure that Senator Bernardi actually knows that but he chooses to scaremonger and run scare campaigns about the fact that he thinks everybody that is detained and is seeking asylum automatically gets to stay. He knows that is not true. He knows that there are processes that they have to go through and he knows that one of those processes is about good character. So he should not stand up and carry on and do this scaremongering, which the opposition have been doing so much of in the past few years. It is the only approach they have and it is quite an abysmal effort.
So, as I said, we have the AFP working to restore the security and the safety of the facility and to ensure that it can go back to normal operations. As I also said, the goal is to return the responsibility to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and Serco as soon as possible. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, has made it very clear that, under the Migration Act, there is a character consideration that comes into play to determine whether somebody should be granted a visa. The AFP is conducting its own investigations and criminal charges may be laid by the Director of Public Prosecutions. This is something to be considered by any immigration detainee who may consider engaging in violent behaviour.
The government has been aware for some time of the pressure being faced at the Christmas Island detention centre and we have been working hard to relieve that. Taking account of recent circumstances, we are moving more people onto the mainland. Last year and earlier this year, the government announced new mainland facilities in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The minister has announced an independent arms-length review into the protests and escapes at Christmas Island and the preparedness and response of the department and Serco. This review will be led by two eminent former public servants, Dr Allan Hawke and Helen Williams, and, like the minister, I have great faith in their ability to oversee this review.
The opposition will continue to score political points in the meantime because that is really the only thing they know how to do. Of course, trying to encourage the opposition to develop sensible policy instead of engaging in political opportunism is like trying to teach etiquette to Sir Les Patterson. It is all a bit rich coming from a coalition whose immigration policy is little more than a three-word slogan. There is no greater example of the coalition’s political opportunism than the way they have tried to make out that the latest arrivals will be given greater legal rights than those processed on Christmas Island. It has been made clear, in legal advice to the minister, that when people are processed originally at Christmas Island or Ashmore Reef they continue to be processed as offshore entry arrivals. If they are transferred to the mainland once the process has begun, it has no impact on the way they are processed.
I will now turn to the issue of border protection and the number of unauthorised arrivals. There are a number of driving forces, as the opposition well knows, on the number of people seeking asylum in Australia. It depends on the situation in different parts of the world. For example, the number of Sri Lankans arriving in Australia has fallen as a result of improvements in circumstances in northern Sri Lanka. Italy had arrivals of 8,000 asylum seekers last month, more than they received in the whole of 2010. This was not due to any change in Italian immigration policy; it was to do with regional push factors, particularly events in northern Africa. Similarly, Australian domestic policy has no influence on the numbers of unauthorised arrivals in Australia. People fleeing persecution are desperate, and they will try to enter Australia regardless of our domestic immigration policy.
The coalition knows this but that does not stop them from unashamedly using the politics of fear and trying to beat up immigration issues for their own political purposes. What they do not seem to get on that side of the chamber is that our humanitarian visa processing regime is not a punitive regime. If there is any punishment that should be dished out it is to the vile people smugglers who trade in human misery. But the opposition is pretty intent on returning to the harsh treatment of asylum seekers that they meted out while they were in government. The opposition has not quite understood that people actually need to flee their homelands and seek a life elsewhere. They have not understood that these people have suffered human misery, torture, human rights abuses or maybe starvation—maybe one of those or maybe a mixture of those things. I stop sometimes and think it would be really interesting to walk a mile in those people’s shoes. I doubt that anyone on the opposition side, if they were walking a mile in those people’s shoes, would not use every resource they had to try to make sure that their children and their family could get to somewhere safe.
I find those on the other side to be not so caring. They purport to care in varying situations, but they want to return to the days of the Pacific solution. They want to detain people on Nauru at phenomenal taxpayer expense. They would have us return to the days of indefinite detention and temporary protection visas, of having asylum seekers grappling with uncertainty over their future or languishing in legal limbo for years on end. They would have Australia’s Navy turn back the boats, obviously putting the lives of those on board at risk. And for all the suffering this would cause, guess how many fewer boats would leave Indonesia’s shores. Not one.
Instead of the simplistic, punitive solution offered by the federal opposition, there is another way. The Bali process is a great opportunity for all the foreign and immigration ministers in the region to come together and tackle the issue of people smuggling. We are looking for an endorsement of our proposal for a regional solution to what is a regional and international problem. We want a framework of countries to work together to break the people smugglers’ business model.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2011-03-22,"—The Gillard government has failed miserably to protect our shores from the scourge of people smugglers. Yesterday the 215th illegal boat since the Gillard government took office was intercepted in Australian waters. At this rate, our northern waters will soon rival the English Channel as one of the busiest sea lanes in the world, the Indian Ocean having become the express lane on the highway for illegal boats. As I said, the Gillard government has failed to protect our borders. As other speakers have also said, it has failed to make even the slightest inroad into reducing the number of people landing illegally on our shores. Since the Gillard government took office, more than 10,000 illegal immigrants have arrived in this country by boat.
For months now we have heard talk of a regional solution. Kevin Rudd first raised this and approached the government of Indonesia about setting up a regional facility in East Timor to process illegal migrants, but nothing has come of that. It is a farce. It is something that is not going to happen. As a consequence of Labor’s failure, our detention centre is stretched beyond its capacity. The recent riots on Christmas Island outraged Australians and left this small, normally idyllic community wondering what its government had done to cause this riot to be foisted upon them. Since taking office, the government last year suffered a cost blow-out of more than $1 billion in detention centre running costs, a sevenfold increase over the costs during the period of the Howard government. A significant amount of this cost has been for the addition of a staggering 4,900 beds to detention centres at a cost of some $400,000. If only this were 4,900 new hospital beds, 4,900 new police officers or 4,900 new teachers, but sadly it is not. It is a waste, in effect, of 4,900 beds for illegal queue jumpers. More boats, more spending, less protection and less control—that is the Gillard government’s approach to border protection.
This contrasts very starkly with the reasonable and respected policies the Howard government developed over its 11 years in power. When the coalition government left office, just four people who had arrived illegally by boat were in detention. Today that figure is more than 6,300, including more than 1,000 children. In the last five years of the Howard government just 18 boats entered Australian waters illegally. Compare that figure to the armada of boats that is now coming down from Indonesia to Christmas Island.
The question we have to ask ourselves, and which has been alluded to by other speakers, is whether it is push or pull factors that are contributing to the growing tide of illegal boats. To my mind it is very much pull factors. The changes the Labor regime has made to our previously highly effective border protection policies have meant that those policies and the protection of our borders have collapsed under the Rudd and Gillard governments. As it stands, people smugglers know that they can get people to pay large amounts of money for a seat on a boat to Australia knowing full well that once on our shores there is a very good chance that they will stay here and have access to our state provided health, education and housing services, which is one of the reasons why people find it attractive to come to Australia.
I suggest that the return of temporary protection visas, or TPVs, utilised to great effect by the Howard government, would be a responsible and considered approach the present government could take to reverse its current policy failure. But both the Gillard government, and the Rudd government before it, have indicated that they have no intention of reintroducing temporary protection visas, in spite of the great success they brought. Under the temporary protection visa policy, persons who are fleeing from persecution in their homelands could come to Australia until the situation in their homelands improved and then they were returned to their own countries. This occurred with refugees from Kosovo and also from East Timor.
One of the other effects of the influx of great numbers of illegal refugees has been that the number of humanitarian migrants that Australia takes has been reduced because the number of refugees per annum is taken off the total of our refugee intake of some 15,000 people per year.
There is no doubt that Australia is rolling out the welcome mat and the people smugglers are lining up to bring more and more refugees here on the promise of permanent residency under the soft policies of the ALP government. The Australian people expect their government to protect their borders. This government is not doing that.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-03-22,"—I rise to speak on this matter of public importance and contribute to the debate on this important issue. It is an area that the Labor federal government focuses on. The government is sincerely concerned about these issues. With respect to the number of boats that are entering our waters the government is sincerely interested in and concerned for the health and wellbeing of those refugees in the centres that house them whilst they are here. To listen to some of the rhetoric I have heard since this debate commenced, you would think that we have lost control and that there is an invasion happening. The previous speaker spoke of an armada of boats. I have seen some of these boats coming to our shores and there is nothing like an armada of boats coming down to enter our nation—far from it. I suggest these scurrilous and false accusations being put forward by those opposite are just another example of the scare campaigns they run when there is no logical example or policy put forward to deal with the particular issue. We have heard more examples of those scare campaigns over the past few days in dealing with other issues like the carbon price. So, once again, it is just the latest in a long line of concentrated efforts by the opposition to distort the facts, manipulate tragedy and create fear in the electorate at the expense of the Australian people. If the opposition’s scaremongering is to be believed, it would seem that an invasion is imminent as, apparently, a ‘complete and absolute loss of control’ has rendered our national borders non-existent.
It is this accusation of loss of border control that I wish to address first. Last year I was very fortunate to participate in the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program, which involves the Border Protection Command in Northern Australia, and I know that some of the members opposite me have gone down the same path and been involved in parliamentary defence programs. It is basically a tripartite arrangement between the three forces: the Royal Australian Air Force, the Navy and the Army. They are given the task to protect our borders. I must say that our Defence Force is highly professional with committed and competent personnel who do their job extremely well protecting our borders. The ADF assets protect this vast northern area of Australia’s maritime domain from security threats including irregular maritime arrivals; maritime terrorism; piracy, robbery and violence at sea; compromises to biosecurity; illegal activity in protected areas; illegal exploitation of natural resources, such as illegal fishing; marine pollution; and prohibited imports and exports. That gives you an idea of the range of activities they perform. It is not solely just focusing on boat arrivals of refugees trying to come to this wonderful nation of ours from places where they are oppressed. It is a case of dealing with all these other activities that Border Protection Command do, and they do them well.
There are 400 ADF personnel in the area. I was fortunate enough to be on the HMAS Bathurst at the time, in June of last year. You may remember that around June we were leading up to the possible announcement of a federal election. A couple of my colleagues from the House of Representatives were on board HMAS Armidale and HMAS Bathurst and they enjoyed the same opportunity as me to see our personnel perform their duties.
These 400 ADF personnel work on the sea, in the air and on land to protect Australian borders. Customs are also involved in helping and cooperating with the agencies to protect our borders. On the second day we also went up in an AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft which went over the reefs. During that particular surveillance exercise we saw an illegal fishing boat—not a boat of refugees. The fishing boat was identified and processes were followed. The boat was photographed and the material was sent down to the areas of control and surveillance. There is no doubt that that boat would have been approached by the local Armidale boats in the area and dealt with.
Our Defence Force are doing an excellent job up north. We have seven Navy Armidale-class patrol boats in that area as well. To appreciate the job they have to do you really need to recognise the area of coverage. It is not just a case of roaming around the north of Queensland, Northern Territory or Western Australia; they have 10 per cent of the world’s surface to cover. That is the area of coverage that our ADF have to manage—it is a huge area.
One of my colleagues from the House of Representatives, the member for Dickson, asked one of the personnel on the boat what would happen if we turned the boats back. The logical answer from those Navy personnel was that the people would destroy their boats. They would damage their motors or put holes in the hull—whatever it took to be rescued. This is the issue we need to deal with when the opposition leader, Mr Abbott, makes statements about just turning the boats back. Logically, you cannot turn the boats back because of the desperate situation of the people on them. They do not want to turn back. They want to be dealt with, they want to be managed and that is how we handle this situation.
During the Howard government era, 240 boats arrived carrying more than 13,600 asylum seekers. It is vexatious for those opposite to claim that they dealt with the migration and asylum seeker situation. The truth is that they did not deal with that situation. In fact, boats stopped coming as a result of global circumstances. As we know, the Taliban regime fell at the end of 2001 and millions of Afghans were able to return home. Yet the opposition decided to go ahead and build the centre on Christmas Island at a cost of $400 million. Naturally, they planned ahead because they realised this was an issue so they built that detention centre 2003.
To return to the issue of turning the boats back, I understand only seven boats were turned back under the Howard government. So the view that turning the boats around is a silver bullet is just a fallacy. After 2003 there were no boats turned around—none whatsoever. The reintroduction of the temporary protection visa is also a con. Do not think that that is a matter that will be resolved and used to stop the boats. Only three per cent of the 11,000 people who were granted one under the Howard temporary protection visa program ever left Australia.
We then had the magic bat phone—or in this case it was Mr Abbott’s boat phone. He was going to somehow pick up a phone and say, ‘We’ll assess this boat that is coming to our shores and we will make a decision about it.’ Once again, having been on an Armidale-class boat, the HMAS Bathurst, I understand that is not possible. It is about time the opposition came up with some responsible policies to deal with this particular issue. (Time expired)

"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2011-03-22,"—In contributing to this debate, I would like to comment on two words which have been used frequently by those on the other side: ‘compassion’ and ‘scaremongering’. It has been implicit in the suggestions of many on the other side, including Senator Collins and Senator Moore, that they are the rightful custodians of compassion. I would like to ask what is the measure of compassion? Why is it that those on the other side of this chamber believe that they are the unique bearers of compassion?
I would suggest that the best measure of compassion in this debate is the effectiveness of the border protection policies of this government. Over the last two years we have seen the total unravelling and implosion of the border protection policies of this government. There is no greater example of that than what we have seen in the last couple of months. The second word, ‘scaremongering’, has been used frequently by Senator Collins and Senator Bilyk. Their suggestion is that there is not a problem and that the coalition have been heartless and scaremongering on this. That is a total denial of what is happening.
There was nothing compassionate about the boat which tragically smashed against the rocks earlier this year when many lost their lives. We were all appalled to watch the TV footage as we saw the residents of Christmas Island trying to rescue those people. There is nothing compassionate about a policy that is actually encouraging the vile business of people smugglers making a bob out of people who are destitute and seek a future here in Australia. There is nothing compassionate about that, nothing whatsoever. There is nothing compassionate—and it is not scaremongering—about the destruction of the Christmas Island facility that we saw on TV. We have heard that 250 rioters went rampant and not only destroyed a lot of that facility but risked the lives of many in the process. We also heard from local Christmas Island resident Kane Martin about his concerns and the concerns of the residents on Christmas Island for their personal safety. There is nothing compassionate about a policy that does not put the rights of Australian citizens first. There is nothing compassionate about that, nothing whatsoever.
I suggest we are seeing a total unravelling of this. The Pacific solution under the Howard government did work. It meant that by 2004 we did not have one child in detention. It meant that we did stop the boats. We have heard that people do not like the mantra, but the bottom line is that the Pacific policy solution did dissuade people smugglers from bringing boats to Australia. They knew what the consequences were. In the end, there was no business. More to the point though, in the end we did not have children in detention—none of us likes to see that. It was a solution that worked and I suggest to Senator Furner that perhaps he look at the statistics. We have heard that it is not compassionate to look at the statistics, but I think you will find that the statistics speak for themselves. We do not want an armada of boats coming from Indonesia, risking the lives of those looking for a better future. We want refugees to explore the United Nations sanctioned refugee camps and approach asylum to this country in a lawful way.

When you inquire of the public servants why it has taken them so long for them to answer the questions, why they have not abided by the orders of the Senate to put in answers by a certain date, most of the public servants, in a very embarrassed way—and they all have different styles of equivocating on this—make it clear that they have done their duty and presented the answers prior to the relevant date, but that the ministers then sit on them in their offices until the day before or occasionally the day after the next Senate estimates committees are going.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-03-22,"—After an hour and a half of going around and around in circles in this chamber before question time and going around and around in circles in committee last night, two minutes before question time the minister finally decided to come off his high horse and answer the questions that quite legitimately had been posed by senators. I refer specifically to the question of whether he could give an ironclad guarantee on behalf of the government that all Australians who have been subject to natural disasters and who are receiving natural disaster assistance payments from the Commonwealth will be exempt under this legislation. Two minutes before question time he finally answered, ‘Yes.’ He could not bring himself to resolve that issue earlier.
The reason that the opposition have been persistently asking questions in relation to this is that the information available to the people of Australia on the Treasury website up to this point in time has been saying that an exemption is only available to those who have been the victim of a natural disaster which is a flood event. I am very pleased that finally the minister has provided clarification to the Senate on this. I cannot quite understand why it took him so long. He could not have had that many other legislative priorities to deal with. Having noted the minister’s assurance in the context of the conflicting information that has been in the public domain, the opposition are happy to leave it here.
However, we are obviously not happy with flat tax. We do not support it. We will vote against it. We urge the Senate to vote against it. We think that the way this flat tax is being put forward is not the way to handle our public finances. It is an ad hoc Labor Party tax which will be imposed on all Australians earning more than $50,000 a year, unless they are in one of those areas that are exempt. We do not think that this is the way to run the financial affairs of the nation. To those people who may be listening, I make the point again that Liberal-National senators stand for lower taxes. This government will always look for an opportunity to whack on another Labor Party tax whenever they think they can get away with it politically.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-03-22,"—In the last couple of days there have been floods in Bega on the South Coast and in the Burke Shire in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Minister, will people in these areas be relieved of payment of this tax? As I understand it, a natural disaster relief declaration has to be made by the state governments. If that is done and payments are made to people in those areas by 30 June 2012, they will be exempted from payment. I seek the minister’s confirmation of that.
I also point out that I asked the minister a question that I have asked him several times. The minister did not want to answer it for some reason. Yet, as Senator Cormann pointed out, it can be very easy for the minister to answer. We have wasted 4½ hours in this chamber asking the minister a question, yet one minute before question time he gave some answers. It was pretty easy when it came to it.
I also want an answer from the minister on the number of individual taxpayers who will contribute to this tax. How many individual Australians earning more than $50,000 will pay the tax and how many of that number does the department estimate will be exempted because of the exemptions in the provision before the chamber?",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2011-03-22,"—I support this legislation. This flood levy has correctly arisen as a result of the actions of the Queensland government in failing to insure the public assets of Queensland, the infrastructure that is owned by taxpayers, because the Queensland government—unlike Western Australian, South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory—failed to take out insurance over their assets. As a result of the negotiations I entered into with the government, there is now a new determination in the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements. These are very significant changes—new guidelines and significant clauses—that will require the states and the territories to go through a very rigorous, robust and transparent process to ensure that they do the right thing when it comes to protecting their assets. Because of those safeguards, I believe that this is going to be the last flood levy we will ever need to pass in this place. I think that is a good piece of public policy. It is a good reform.
As a result of this reform, I believe that the states and territories all have to act to the highest prudential standards and act responsibly when it comes to their assets. Senator Macdonald was quite right when he was very critical of the Queensland government over their abject failure to appropriately insure their assets. That is why there is a shortfall. That is why $1.8 billion needs to be found to cover this—of which Queensland only needs to pay a quarter under the current natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements. That will change as a result of the arrangements in the new determination. That is unambiguously good for the protection of taxpayers’ assets. Ultimately, it is a good thing in terms of ensuring that taxpayers will not have to be looking at flood levies in the future with these new arrangements.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2011-03-22,"—Yes, it has been a long discussion, and most of the issues were discussed prior to the last four or 4½ hours either in the committee hearings on the bills or the broader debate. Senator Macdonald has asked about two issues, and I understand both were discussed in the committee hearings. At that point in time I understand the witnesses were unable to give a response to him.
On the total number of taxpayers who will pay the levy, we will take that on notice. I can expect to have an answer for Senator Macdonald in the next few days on that issue. On the total number of people who will be exempt from the levy because they are in disaster declared zones, we do not know what the total number is. The ATO will obviously, in their delivery of the tax, carry out that calculation as the tax is implemented and collected. Then we will be in a position to give Senator Macdonald that figure. I will take it on notice and when that figure becomes available through the ATO we will provide it, and we should be able to provide the other figure to you in the next couple of days.
This was all explained to the committee hearings on the legislation, so why we need to go through these issues again today, other than for Senator Macdonald to conduct a filibuster, which has been all too obvious in the last four to five hours, is beyond me.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-03-22,"—The arrogance of the government comes through again. This may have been discussed at the committee hearing, but I was not at the committee hearing. In fact the majority of senators were not. The rules of Senate debate provide that this is the time when senators can question the minister. In fact one of the questions I just asked was in relation to the floods happening now at Bega on the South Coast of New South Wales and at Burketown up on the Gulf of Carpentaria. They are happening now; they were not happening when the committee met. How could these questions possibly have been answered then? We see this arrogance when the government is dealing with legitimate questions of the Senate—and we are paid to be here on behalf of the people of Australia to ask these questions.
The importance of the question seems to have escaped the minister. We are supposed to be collecting $1.8 billion through this new Labor government tax. But the more people who are exempted from it, and exempted for appropriate reasons, the fewer people will be left in Australia to pay the tax. In fact, horribly as it has turned out, in the last few months there are not many parts of Australia that have not been disaster declared. We might end up finding that there are only 100,000 individual Australian taxpayers who are going to pay this levy, in which case it is not going to raise the $1.8 billion that this government seeks. It may well be that we have been through this whole exercise, this lengthy debate, to recover a pittance of the money that the federal government is expecting.
The minister has now agreed to take my questions on notice—that is great; we will get the answers to them long after the legislation is dealt with by the Senate. That is a great deal of help. I asked him these questions last night, so why could he not have taken them on notice then? He has a department of 3,000 people who surely could have got the answer for him within a couple of hours. But here is the arrogance of the Gillard government.
I would like to know what the government is likely to collect. I know how departments work, and they would have made an assessment. Sure, they do not have all the facts, but they would have had to have made an assessment to brief the minister and say, ‘Look, if you are exempting these people and, given the number of areas that have been declared disaster areas, that will take out X number of Australians and that means only Y Australians will pay, so what chance have we got of collecting the $1.8 billion that the government seems to need?’ As I read the legislation, if there is another disaster, heaven forbid, up until 30 June 2012, the people affected will be exempt too. It may—heaven forbid, as I say—end up that nobody in Australia is paying this levy. It is typical of the government’s shoddy legislation and of the shoddy way that the Gillard government treats the parliament and the Australian people.
In the expectation that the minister, true to the form he has shown to date, will not answer the questions I have raised, I want to make some other remarks before the bills proceed. I remind senators that this is legislation to impose yet another new Gillard Labor government tax. It is absolutely unprecedented in the history of an Australian parliament. Never before have we imposed a special tax to pay for recovery from any natural disaster. Never before has it happened. We have had cyclones, we have had floods, we have had droughts, we have had earthquakes through the whole of our history, but never before have we ever paid a separate tax for the recovery. It has been paid for by governments of the day, Liberal, Labor, Callithumpian or whatever, out of the normal taxation revenue of government.
This government collects something like $350 billion every year in tax. Surely, out of that $350 billion this government collects from taxpayers, they could have found $1.8 billion. We did not have to have another new tax for what started off being a single disaster, the Queensland flood. It just demonstrates that this government’s answer to any issue, any calamity or any policy question is: ‘Let’s impose another new tax.’ The government has already announced that we will be having a mining tax later this year and now we will have the flood tax—all new taxes. And we are going to have a carbon tax as well, a carbon tax from a Prime Minister who solemnly swore before the last election:
… there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.
So what faith can you put in any promises made by Ms Gillard and her ministers? That is what this bill is about—imposing a whole new tax on the Australian public.
I am going to try one more time and ask the minister why it is that this tax is only being paid by individual taxpayers. If it came out of the general revenue, out of the $350 billion collected each year, then BHP, Rio Tinto, Xstrata, Coles and Woolworths would all pay their share of the tax. And that seems fair in Australia—companies pay tax and individuals pay tax. But this tax, for some reason which nobody can explain to me—I have asked and asked and asked—is not being levied on these big multinational companies, these giants of Australian industry. It is only being levied on individuals. So I repeat: the butcher and the baker will have to pay the tax from their hard earned income, but Coles and Woolworths, with whom they compete, will not have to pay the tax. Coles and Woolworths get off scot-free. What is it about Coles and Woolworths that makes the Labor Party not want those companies to pay their fair share? Xstrata, BHP, and Rio Tinto are all very big investors in Australia. I am very grateful they are here, these multinational companies, and I am pleased that they make good profits, but why are they being let off scot-free? What is it between the Labor Party and those multinationals that they are allowed to escape this disaster recovery levy or tax without putting in a cent? Individuals—the people in here, the attendants, senators, people listening to this broadcast—have to pay the tax, but Coles and Woolies, BHP, Xstrata and Rio Tinto do not pay a cent. Tell me the sense of that.
I simply cannot believe it. I can believe the Greens would vote for that—because they are an absolute policy vacuum. But I am absolutely amazed that the Independents have fallen for this. What rationale do you have for charging individuals and not the corporate giants? When I have asked Senator Sherry this before, he has not answered the question. All he has done is get up and say, ‘Your government put a levy on containers.’ Yes, they did. ‘They put a levy on milk bottle sales.’ Yes, they did. ‘They put a levy on pounds of sugar.’ Yes, they did. ‘They put an Ansett levy on airfares.’ Yes, they did that—but everybody paid that, whether a corporate giant or a little person using the airline or using a container. Mind you, there were not too many ordinary Australians using containers. Those levies were across the board. This levy, which could easily have been imposed on everyone through the general taxation regime, is not being imposed on the corporate giants. How does that make sense? If only someone could explain to me what the policy rationale for that is. That is why the coalition is totally opposed to this new tax of the Labor government. The Labor government is addicted to taxing and addicted to spending.
This all comes about because a state Labor government, regrettably the Labor government in my home state of Queensland, was so bad at financial management that it is broke and it cannot pay for the recovery. Senator Xenophon very skilfully extracted, during the course of this debate, the admission that the Queensland government could not pay the $50 million to $55 million needed for an insurance premium. So they went uninsured and, as a result of that, the Queensland government cannot afford to do what governments are supposed to do. But their mates in the federal Labor Party have come in and whacked this tax on individual taxpayers—not on the corporate giants but on individual taxpayers—and we have to fork out.
I hope that the people of Australia understand that this tax is unnecessary. Reconstruction should have been paid for out of general revenue. This is a new tax, but it is not a tax like other taxes, which are levied across the board, including on corporate Australia—the big guys. It is only going on the individual Australians who earn more than $50,000. You do not have to be in a very highly paid job these days to get $50,000. Those individual Australians have to pay this new tax of the Gillard Labor government because the Gillard government is simply incapable of managing money. So I ask the minister yet again what that is all about.
I repeat my question: what were the department’s estimates of who would be exempted from this and did they take into account the floods happening as we speak in two parts of Australia and—I hope this does not happen—the other disasters that could well happen between now and 30 June 2012? As I say, I hope further disasters do not happen, but it could well be that not one Australian is paying the tax. This is, again, typical of the incompetence and stupidity of this Labor government that cannot be trusted with money.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2011-03-22,"—Although all of these points have been answered well in previous hearings, debate contributions and committee hearings, Senator Macdonald chooses to persist on a couple of specific points. On the Bega issue, if in fact the Bega area is declared a disaster zone, it would be exempt from the tax. My advice from Treasury is that, despite the exemption in this case and in previous exemptions, it is estimated that it will not materially affect the estimated revenue collection of $1.8 billion.
The tax is a progressive tax and is income based. It is fair and equitable and efficient. That is the reason the government is determined to use that as the tax base in the same way as the guns levy and the East Timor levy were applied. We considerably debated other levies under the previous Liberal-National Party government. There were levies that did not affect everyone as applied by the previous Liberal-National Party government. The Ansett levy applied to tickets. Clearly, many people in the community would not have flown and, therefore, would not have paid the levy. Not everyone drinks milk, surprisingly. The superannuation surcharge, through definition, did not apply to everyone.
There is a mixed record, but on this occasion we believe that the base of the tax is fair, equitable and efficient. I have taken the two questions on notice. Clearly—and this is obvious, Senator Macdonald, from the Bega example—we are not in a position to give the total number of people exempt. We cannot do that today but as soon we have the figure from the ATO we will provide it for you on notice.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2011-03-22,"—I rise this evening to make some remarks regarding the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Rebate) Bill 2011 and I am very pleased to do so. The shadow minister for child care and early childhood learning, Susan Ley, the member for Farrer, is responsible for this in the other place. The childcare rebate is available for families and it covers a percentage of the—
 (Senator Kroger)—Senator Nash, can we just hold it there. There is just way too much noise in the chamber. Could senators who are leaving the chamber please do so quietly. Thank you, Senator Nash.
—Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. It is available to cover a percentage of the out-of-pocket expenses associated with approved child care. The aim is to assist parents who are working, studying or undertaking training by providing that extra financial assistance that they need. It covers 50 per cent of those out-of-pocket expenses.
Before the last election the coalition committed to change the payments, which currently happen quarterly, to weekly payments. We certainly believe that a weekly payment is going to be far more beneficial for families who are struggling, as many of them are, to meet the costs of child care. It certainly seemed appropriate and the right thing to do to support the move to have that rebate paid weekly. This is about affordable and accessible child care for parents. It is interesting to see—and the coalition is very pleased that the government has followed our lead—that this bill requires the change in those payment to a weekly or fortnightly arrangement. The bill says it can be either a weekly or fortnightly arrangement because that depends on whether the childcare centres’ reporting is weekly or fortnightly. The majority are done weekly.
The rebate under this bill can also be paid directly to the provider. That is an option that has not been available before and one that we support in terms providing assistance to those childcare providers. Of course, if those parents choose to have the rebate come directly to them, that will continue to be the default mechanism and the rebate will still go to those parents. It is about helping parents. It is about ensuring that they have ease of access to that funding mechanism from the government. As I said, we support that from the government and we are supportive of that aspect of the bill.
It is interesting that this legislation to ease the way these payments happen for parents is actually even more necessary for parents because of the government’s changes to the childcare rebate. What we have seen them do recently, through a bill that was debated here recently and is still before the Senate, is to decrease the childcare rebate from $7,778 down to $7,500. The government has also cut the indexation for that rebate completely.
I did make some comments in the last sitting around that bill on that aspect. I certainly believe it shows that this government is out of touch with the needs of families out there in our communities, particularly our regional communities. What we have seen from this government is a cutting of the rebate through that other legislation and taking away the indexation completely. This government should be doing more to assist families with their childcare costs and childcare expenses. They should be making it easier, not making it harder. Parents will welcome this speedier mechanism for that childcare rebate because at least it will be one thing—one very small thing admittedly—that will assist to ease some of their childcare burden.
I know many of our families out there in the communities have been quite astounded by the fact that the government would actually move to cut the childcare rebate. I know many families in regional areas were quite furious that the government would move to cut that. When the government talks about assisting families and assisting working families and then turn around, drop the rebate and cut the indexation simply just does not make sense if this government really believes that families need to be better assisted.
The government has said that $86.3 million will be saved by those changes that it has made. The government claim that they need that funding to fund the national quality framework. It seems quite extraordinary that this government would be identifying funding that is going to make it more difficult for parents to fund the national quality framework, especially when you compare it to some of the waste and mismanagement that we have seen under this government. It was $81.9 million that has been wasted by this government administering an emissions trading scheme that does not even exist. It is no wonder that families out in our communities are at least perplexed and probably at worst furious with this government where they need to strip $80 million off families by lowering their payments for the childcare rebate when they have wasted around the same amount of money administering an emissions trading scheme that does not even exist.
If this government had any ability at all to manage the economy properly we would not need to see that cut in those childcare rebates to go towards funding the national quality framework. We only have to look at things like the pink batts debacle, the Home Insulation Program—$2.4 billion that has been wasted and mismanaged in that program. Yet here is the government ripping $80 million away from Australian working families to pay for another program because they have wasted and mismanaged so much money in other areas. We only have to look at things like the BER, the school halls, the Building the Education Revolution, Madam Acting Deputy President Fisher. I know you have been very focused on that and making sure that people out there in the Australian community are aware of the waste and mismanagement. It is about a $1.7 billion blow-out on the school halls program. Yet here we have the government—
—Have you talked to any parents?
—I will take that interjection. Senator McLucas asked me if I have talked to any parents. I think Senator McLucas would know that I talk to parents very regularly out there in our regional communities, having been one myself. They may well love the program, Senator McLucas, but you know as well as I do that they hate the waste and mismanagement. Interestingly, when we compare the private sector and what they have managed to do and the public sector through the state government, the waste and mismanagement in the state government sector has been nothing short of appalling. It is no wonder that we see this absolute disaster in New South Wales of a Labor government when they mismanage programs like that so badly.
The point is that the Australian people are absolutely astonished that the government can waste billions of dollars on the one hand and yet on the other hand expect Australian working families, through cuts to their childcare rebate, to pay for the national quality framework. I think anybody with any sense and sensibility would see how incredibly stupid that is. If the government had just managed to in any way, shape or form manage the economy properly they would not need to be putting this pressure on Australian families. Next they will be raiding the kid’s piggy banks saying, ‘Quick, we need a bit more money, where can we drag it out of next?’ Instead of focusing on the proper management of the economy, they do as they always do and move to taxes, move to raiding, move to cutting programs like the childcare rebate. It is simply not acceptable.
That leads me to the national quality framework itself. It is all interrelated in one way or another. It is all about child care. It is all about how government addresses the needs of the childcare sector. With the national quality framework, we believe that it sounds good if every childcare worker has to be qualified and there has to be an increase to staff to child ratios. Sure it sounds good and we all want the best system possible, but the policy needs to be realistic. I made some comments about this in this place recently. There is a critical shortage of qualified workers, and there has been some talk about exemptions—not a lot of detail around that. But if we have a requirement for every childcare worker to be qualified when we have something like three out of 10 alone in Victoria who are not, how on earth are we going to provide the workforce for those childcare centres? We have hundreds of centres currently searching for qualified staff and we are going to particularly see the impact of this on rural and regional communities. I was recently up on the North Coast chatting to a lady there. Senator McLucas will be pleased to hear I was again out on the ground talking to people in these centres.
—I do not doubt it.
—Thank you, Senator McLucas, I will take that. For the Hansard record Senator McLucas did indicate that she didn’t doubt that I spoke to those people out in the communities and I thank her for that.
The lady who was in charge of the childcare centre had 15 years experience in this centre and was working 12-hour to 13-hour days and had an amazing connection with and a real love for these children that she was looking after. It was a brilliantly run centre. Yet she has no formal qualifications, so she is in this limbo land at the moment—and I am sure there are many senators, even on the other side of the chamber, who would agree with me that this is an issue that needs to be addressed—of not knowing if she is going to have a job next year, if she is going to be able to apply for an exemption and how it is all going to work. I think we need to be very clear as to what we hear from government about how this situation is going to be managed, because we all support improving quality but we have got to be practical and realistic in how we deliver that improved quality. So we will certainly be listening very closely to the government as to how those exemptions are going to be applied and how that is going to impact on those childcare centres.
The National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care is going to put increased pressure on families. That is very disappointing for people out in our communities, particularly those in our regional communities, when what they need is assistance. They need things to be made easier and not harder. The cut to the childcare rebate is going to affect about 20,700 families. While the government have all the arguments up their sleeve about why this is a good thing, it is interesting to note that Childcare Alliance Australia has indicated, from the work that they have done, that about 74 per cent of parents will have some difficulty in meeting the $13 to $22 a day extra cost that is going to be put on their families.
That is something that we really need to be very aware of. If we allow things to get more difficult for our families in terms of being able to access child care then it is going to be harder for parents to return to the workforce, to manage that juggling between work and family. I think many of us in this place know that juggling between work and family, and it is certainly not something that relates only to this place. Families right across the country are having to balance their work commitments with their family commitments. Many choose to do it and many have to do it, but we in this place have to be very mindful of that and we need to be mindful that any of the decisions that the government takes and any of the policies that the government wants to put in place through legislation should be of benefit to those families. There should not be policies that are going to make things more difficult. Increasing the costs, so making it more difficult to access those childcare places, is by any stretch of the imagination a step backwards for those families.
I and many others in this place including, I am sure, Senator Hanson-Young, who is down at the other end of the chamber, have all faced the issue of having children in child care. It is vitally important that we get it right. On that basis, the coalition certainly believes that the government should reconsider the national quality framework to put some practical common sense into it, to put some realism into the requirements of that framework. As I said, we are all supportive of improving quality right throughout the childcare sector, but it has got to be sensibly done. There have got to be measures that improve opportunities for families and parents and in the meantime do not place a greater burden, an unnecessary burden, on the operation of childcare centres. We certainly believe that indexation should be reinstated immediately. To cut indexation simply to find some money to be able to fund the national quality framework, given that this government has wasted billions and billions of dollars, is simply absurd and quite abhorrent to many of the Australian families out there in the community.
It is interesting to note as to that national quality framework that the bill has not yet been passed but apparently Centrelink has already enacted the reduced rebate, which means a lowering of those dollars being paid to parents. It is really quite extraordinary, and I stand to be corrected if that is not the case but I do understand that indeed it is the case, that the government would move to have Centrelink do that before the legislation has actually been passed. I am sure colleagues on the other side will correct me if I am wrong about that. If I am right, I think it is an extraordinarily arrogant act of government to move down that path, to enact this before this place has even had the opportunity to deal with the legislation.
As for the bill before us and the related childcare measures, the government made promises before the 2007 election that they simply have not kept. The government said that they would make child care more affordable. We can see from the fact that the rebate is being cut that that is simply not the case. There is no way anyone can argue with that. Before the election they said they were going to make child care more affordable. Now they have cut the rebate, which is going to make it harder. Senator Williams, you do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that is going to make it more difficult for families.
—Not at all.
—So that is a promise that simply was not kept by this government.
—Another one!
—Yes, thank you, Senator Williams, and I will get to that. The government also promised an additional 260 childcare centres. I think we all remember the Kevin07-version Prime Minister. Are we going to go to a Kevin11-version Prime Minister? Who would know? The Kevin07-version Prime Minister promised to fix the double drop-off and have 260 more childcare centres.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—That woke up everybody on the other side, didn’t it, Senator Williams?
—Yes.
—So what have we got? Two hundred and sixty? No. Two hundred and forty? No. A hundred and fifty? No. Eighty? No. Seventy, do you think, Senator Williams?
—No.
—We have got 38—another broken promise from the Labor government. While we are on broken promises the best one—I cannot let this one go by, Senator Williams—is about the carbon tax. What was it that the Prime Minister said? Let me refresh my memory: ‘There will be no carbon tax under any government I lead.’ What do we have now? This has really woken the other side up, Senator Williams.
—It is so embarrassing for them, isn’t it?
—I know they defend it. It relates to the issue of government not being trustworthy when it comes to child care, because they have a track record. I think it relates perfectly, Senator Williams, because the government has a track record of this and cannot be trusted to deliver a decent environment, a decent framework, for the childcare sector, which is what we are seeing.
The cutting of the rebate is obviously going to create real difficulties for families. We support the legislation before us today because, as I said, it was our policy going up to the last election that we would change the payment arrangements to weekly rather than quarterly. I am happy to say it: that is a good thing. But when you compare this with the other measures that the government has in place for child care, it is clear that the government simply does not understand the needs of families in this community. It simply does not understand the pressures that families are under. It cannot possibly understand, because it is going to make it harder for the families, not easier. Certainly those families out there, particularly in the regional centres, are incredibly disappointed that this government has not recognised the needs of the families and has not recognised that the lower rebate is going to be a very difficult impost for them. This government should simply reconsider all of that as it moves forward.
But I will commend the government. The bill before us today is a good move forward. We have seen the move to weekly or fortnightly payments under this legislation, which I am sure will be appreciated by families. We will look to see the government reconsider some of the other measures they have in place for the childcare sector and for families and children right across the country.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHILD CARE REBATE) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2011-03-22,"—I rise today to speak in favour of the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Rebate) Bill 2011. To finally see some legislation in this place to deal with this issue is a welcome move. Of course, back in June last year, before we took a break before the last election, the Senate actually amended a piece of legislation to do exactly this—to bring forward the payments for families. So the Senate has indeed already agreed that this is a good idea. Unfortunately, because of antics in the House, we were never able to deal with that piece of legislation and get it moving for families sooner. After the Greens’ amendment went through this place and got stuck in the House, we went to an election. During that election campaign the government—the Prime Minister herself—announced that this would be a new government policy: to bring forward childcare rebate payments from quarterly to fortnightly. That was exactly what the Greens had already amended the legislation to do, but we have had to wait until March the following year to see the government fulfil that promise to families.
But it is a welcome step. Finally we are starting to see some common sense coming out of this. Look at the cost of child care to families across the country. We know that families are paying anywhere from $80 to $150, $200 or $300 a week in childcare costs, depending on the centre, the number of children and the number of days. That means that some families are waiting for three months to get their $1,800 back through their childcare rebate. That is a lot of money and a big chunk of the family budget to be waiting on every quarter as opposed to every fortnight, even though we know that most people pay their childcare fees monthly if not fortnightly.
So it is going to make a big difference. It will put money back into the pockets of families, giving them the ability to manage their budgets better and the flexibility they need, as well as ensuring that they can give their child the care they choose on the basis that they can afford it. So this is all a very good thing. It is unfortunate that this place agreed to do this in June last year, yet it has taken until March the following year for the government to agree. But there you go; that is the way this place works. Sometimes, even though the parliament decides that something is a good thing, it still takes the executive a little while to catch up.
We really want to see the Senate agree and support this piece of legislation again, because it is really important. Many of us, including several people in this chamber—Senator McLucas and Senator Bilyk—have spent a lot of time working on these issues in the past. Most would agree that the way we currently structure and pay for childcare services and early childhood education in this country would, if you were going to start from scratch, be done differently. You would start to fund the services and the quality frameworks and ensure that we have the best quality care. That is the link you would make. We are not there, but we can try to make some things easier for families in the meantime. Bringing forward those rebate payments from quarterly to fortnightly is definitely going to help.
I want to put forward here in the chamber a warning that we need to make sure we do not go backwards on this and that we see this as an opportunity to keep making things better and reforming the system. The last thing we want to see is any measure in the upcoming May budget that would make it more difficult for families to afford the costs of early childhood education and care. Let us not make it more difficult. Let us use this as an opportunity to say, ‘Yes, we agree that children in this country—the youngest citizens—deserve the best start.’ That means ensuring that families can afford to give them the care that they deserve and that they need to manage their daily lives. We all know the stories of working families juggling all those different commitments. Let us not make it harder; let us make it easier. This is a good first step towards doing that. Let us make sure that when the May budget comes around, this area of the childcare rebate—early childhood education and care—is not seen as a pot to dip into for further budget saving measures. I do not think that would be a good look for anyone.
Let us accept that this was a good idea. The Greens amended the legislation in the first place and the Senate agreed. Finally we have got the government to take it on board. Fantastic. Let us tick it off and move on. Let us start to get the money that families deserve back into their pockets. But let us also have an eye to how we can continue to make things better, easier and of course carry out delivering on those quality framework issues. I believe that we have to ensure that we are investing as much as possible in the care that we give our children in those really crucial years from zero to five. That means that we do need good quality standards. We do need good child-to-carer ratios. There must be quality standards in centres that must be adhered to across the country so that our kids are given the best quality care and the best start to life.
That kind of reform needs to be funded and it should not just end up being whacked on at the end of the bill for families to cover. If we believe as a country that the best way to give a child the best opportunities we have to start it in those early childhood years. That means not trying to find ways of saving money in that pot. It means that we have to put a bit more money in to ensure that early childhood education and care is the best it can possibly be and that Australia values it and sees it as an investment. The effort that we put in at this end pays off at the other end. We know it does. Students who graduate from high school and go on to TAFE or university are going to be much better equipped and resourced, and they will be able to do anything if they are given a good start in the beginning. That means investing in the early years and not waiting till the end and hoping that you can catch up there. It needs to be done right at the beginning.
I commend the bill to the chamber. It is a good initiative. Let us get on and start making this area of early childhood care and education something that we do not just talk about but invest in. That means we are going to have to put a bit more dosh in the pot to ensure that we can fund the system properly.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHILD CARE REBATE) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2011-03-22,"—I thank the previous two speakers for their contributions. I am one of, I understand, only two people in this chamber who have actually worked in the childcare industry—and here comes the other one in the door now: Senator Jacinta Collins. I am happy to be corrected if that is not the case. Senator Collins and I have both worked in the childcare industry. In fact I spent 12 years in the industry—
—Three!
—Sorry, Senator McLucas. I apologise. There are three people in this place who have worked in the childcare industry. I did say that I was happy to stand corrected, so my apologies to you.
Having spent 12 years in the industry both in the ACT and in Tasmania I would like to speak about the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Rebate) Bill 2011 and the important changes it makes to Australia’s system of childcare assistance payments. As we have heard from other speakers tonight, these are the really formative years and people have to be able to afford their child care.
The Gillard government is certainly making sure that people are more able to afford their child care by giving them a choice. It is an important change for Australian parents and it is an important change for Australian families. It gives Australian families choice and flexibility as to how their childcare rebate payments are made. It allows families to choose a frequency of payments and a rebate method that suits them. It builds upon the significant reforms the government has already made in improving the affordability of early education and child care. It is the most critical area, I believe. It shapes a person’s future so it is absolutely critical that child care is not only of a high quality but affordable.
This legislation will make paying for childcare services easier for around 700,000 Australian families. It shows that the Australian government understands the needs of families, because it gives families access to the childcare rebate when they need it most: when the child care fees are due. This bill will make a number of key changes. The first is that it will allow families to choose how their childcare rebate payment is made. Under the arrangements introduced by the Howard government, families had no choice as to when the payment was made. They had to wait until the end of the financial year to receive this very important payment whether it was convenient or not. For the majority of families it was not convenient.
Senator Nash mentioned that she thought Centrelink might be already enacting this procedure. I have not heard that from anywhere. I stand to be corrected, but maybe Senator Nash is confused, because the Labor government introduced changes to allow families the choice of receiving quarterly payments. So maybe she is a bit confused about that. Now we are again expanding the range of choices that families have.
With the passing of this bill, from July 2011 families will have a number of options in regard to when and how they receive their childcare rebate payments—options that they can choose to suit their needs in the circumstances of their families. Firstly, they can have their childcare rebate payment paid fortnightly direct to an approved childcare service provider on their behalf by way of a fee reduction. As at June 2010 there were around 14,000 approved childcare services in Australia, including long day care, family day care, outside-school-hours care, occasional care and in-home care. This is the fist time that these various childcare service providers are able to receive the rebate on behalf of families. This will significantly reduce the up-front costs of child care. Currently, 98 per cent of families receive their childcare benefit this way, and it can be assumed that many families will wish to take up this option, not least because it is probably the most convenient.
Families can elect to receive their childcare rebate payment directly into their bank account following the submission of the approved childcare service’s usage report to the government. Childcare service providers are required to submit their usage data to the government fortnightly, although the majority actually report weekly. That means that those families that choose this option will be paid their childcare rebate either fortnightly or weekly, depending upon when their chosen childcare service provider does their reporting.
Families can elect to have the child care rebate deposited into their bank account quarterly. This gives parents a significant quarterly payment which they can rely upon to meet expected household expenses. Finally, families can continue to receive their payments annually as a lump sum payment, as many currently do. Some families may prefer to stay with this option and, if this is the most convenient option, it is right that they be allowed to keep it that way.
Families currently receiving the child care rebate will be contacted prior to the commencement of the financial year to ascertain their preferred method and frequency of payment. Those who are unable to be contacted will default to their current quarterly or annual payments. To ensure fairness, families that were unable to be contacted and, consequently, were unaware that they were able to change the method of payment, will be allowed to change their payment method during the first year of operation.
The next major change is that this protects families from accidentally accumulating debts. In the past, some families have accumulated unforeseen debts due to mistakenly underestimating their income—a situation that has caused many families financial stress and heartache.
This bill includes a safeguard, which is the temporary withholding of 15 per cent of each child care rebate payment for those who are on higher than the zero rate of child care benefit, to ensure that families do not incur such a debt. This will ensure that families will not have to deal with the shock of receiving a significant debt due to changes in their taxable income, by offsetting any potential debts that may arise. This is a fairer mechanism than the current arrangements for the child care rebate, where the final quarterly payment is withheld until the end of financial year reconciliation.
The bill will make the payment of the child care rebate simpler for the many families who elect to have their child care rebate payment paid directly to their childcare service provider. Never before has this option been made available to Australian families. Currently, a family earning $80,000 per annum, with one child in full-time care, faces $240 per week in out-of-pocket childcare costs while waiting for their child care rebate to be paid quarterly or annually. By opting to have their child care rebate paid directly to the childcare service provider or paid into their own bank accounts fortnightly, these costs drop to around $138 a week—a significant sum for families trying to meet their day-to-day expenses.
The bill also allows families to change their payment method if they meet with exceptional circumstances, such as hardship or family break-up, part way through the financial year. The government understands that families are not static, that family income and expenses change and that flexibility is required for households to meet their expenses. A lump sum payment that may have been convenient at the start of the financial year may no longer be convenient, and families should not be tied to a payment delivery type that no longer meets their needs.
These changes continue the government’s unprecedented investment in child care and early education. It is this government that understands just how important investment in child care and early education is for Australian families. It is the Labor government that understands just how much child care costs take out of the family budget and it is the Labor government that understands that Australian families need flexibility and assistance.
It is also the Labor government that is providing them with this flexibility and assistance. We are providing $14.9 billion over the next four years through the child care rebate and the child care benefit to assist 800,000 Australian families annually to pay for the costs of child care. This includes $8.7 billion over the four years to 2013-14 to reduce childcare fees for low- and middle-income earners under the child care benefit and $6.2 billion to assist working families with out-of-pocket childcare expenses under the child care rebate.
It was this government that in 2008 delivered on our election commitment to increase the child care rebate from 30 to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs, from a maximum of $4,354 to a maximum of $7,500 per child per year. This is a fundamental change to this payment and it highlights the difference between us and the opposition. Under the Howard government, families could claim a maximum of only $4,354 per child per year—some 72 per cent less than under the Gillard Labor government.
It is this government that is delivering decreases in the cost of child care for families. As a result of increasing the child care rebate for out-of-pocket costs, after subsidies, for a family earning $55,000 a year with one child in long day care, costs have fallen from 13 per cent of disposable income in 2004 to seven per cent in 2010. Changes like these show that the government understands just how significant a cost child care is to families and their household budgets. It is changes like these which show that the government is doing everything in its power to reduce these costs for Australian families. Australian families have never had access to more financial assistance with child care than they have under this government. And now, thanks to this legislation, they will have even greater access and even greater choice.
In closing, because Senator Nash did get off the track a bit over there and started talking about all sorts of things, I would like to publicly say thank you to the workers in the childcare industry, who work very hard to deliver quality care to Australian children and to give them the best start that they can in their early education. As other people have mentioned tonight, it is very important for the future of Australia that we continue to have an affordable and quality childcare system in Australia. Certainly, the Gillard government is moving to make sure that we continue to improve it all time.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHILD CARE REBATE) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2011-03-22,"—I thank senators for their contribution to this debate. I must say, though, Senator Nash, that I heard most of your contribution, which I would reflect was truly audacious. I am sure we will get some tedious repetition of the rhetoric that was covered in other matters that may be soon before us. I was very pleased to hear that you do indeed talk to parents and I thought, somewhat glibly, that some of my closest friends are parents. But, truly, in relation to the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Rebate) Bill 2011 and the general agreement to progress what I think is a very sensible matter, I think we will keep it as light as that.
As others have highlighted, this bill will for the first time enable families to access the child care rebate no later than fortnightly, and in many cases earlier than that. This has been a particular public policy venture of mine since the Howard government introduced the child care rebate and parents needed to wait until the tax year after the tax year in which they had expended those costs. As a result of this measure, as has been highlighted by others, around 700,000 Australian families will be able to receive this essential assistance at the time when their childcare fees are due. Importantly, many families will be able to receive this payment weekly, as the majority of childcare services submit attendance information weekly.
From July this year families will have the choice of four options for receiving the child care rebate. Families will be able to elect to have their child care rebate payments made to the childcare service fortnightly, at a minimum, on their behalf as a way of fee reduction; to receive their child care rebate payments directly into their bank account fortnightly, at a minimum; to have their child care rebate made to their bank account quarterly; or to have their child care rebate payment made annually as a lump sum payment. By providing families with these choices, the Australian government is ensuring that families have significantly more flexibility to manage their childcare costs within their family budget.
For the first time, childcare services will be able to receive the rebate on behalf of families, delivering a direct fee reduction for those families that elect this method of payment. Currently 98 per cent of families choose to receive the child care benefit this way. To ensure that families do not accumulate any unforeseen debts as a result of overestimating their income, this bill also contains amendments to temporarily withhold 15 per cent of each rebate payment for families receiving a higher than zero rate of child care benefit. This is consistent with current arrangements for the quarterly child care rebate payments, where the final quarterly payment may be used to offset any childcare payment debts incurred by the family. This measure builds on the government’s impressive record of improving the affordability and quality of early education and care and it will be widely welcomed by Australian families.
In 2008 we delivered our election commitments to increase the child care rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses, from a maximum of $4,354 to $7,500 per child per year, a significant benefit to families and childcare affordability. Under the Howard government, families could claim a maximum of only $4,354 per child per year, which was some 72 per cent less than under the Gillard Labor government. I highlight these points to stand in contrast to the claims that Senator Nash was outlining earlier and to her rhetoric. The point I made earlier was that we have also increased the frequency of the child care rebate payments to families from yearly to quarterly and now to fortnightly, which is far better than in 2004, when families had to wait 18 months or so before they saw any support. Senator Nash may talk to parents, but many parents I talk to who were involved with childcare providers still remember the complexity of and the wait they had for childcare payments. At this stage I should mention that Senator Bilyk referred to herself and to me working in child care, and I should clarify that my involvement was in outside-school-hours care rather than in long day care—although outside-school-hours care is relevant here as well.
Overall, the Commonwealth is providing $14.9 billion to help 800,000 Australian families annually with the cost of child care through the child care benefit and the child care rebate. This includes $8.7 billion over four years to 2013-14 to reduce childcare fees for low- and middle-income earners, under the child care benefit, and $6.2 billion to assist working families with out-of-pocket childcare expenses, under the child care rebate. As a result of this massive investment, we now know that, since 2004, out-of-pocket costs for families earning $75,000 have reduced from 13 per cent of their disposable income to seven per cent in 2010. I think this point warrants repetition, given some of the rhetoric earlier, because there has been a huge increase in the affordability of child care in recent years. Fortunately, with a relatively considerable income, long day care is not a cost I need to meet, but for the many families who have significant childcare costs, some of whom have been referred to by other senators, this figure is very important. When people raise in debates the childcare costs to providers, it needs to be remembered that a significant proportion of those can be met by the Commonwealth government’s rebate, so in this debate we really need to be looking at issues around the out-of-pocket expenses faced by families. Indeed that is a critical and important issue amongst the issues of childcare service delivery such as improving the quality and the standards. The costs of improved quality and standards are at the very minimum met by a 50 per cent contribution from the Commonwealth through the child care tax rebate. Let me reiterate this point: as a result of Labor’s massive investment in child care, we now know that, since 2004, out-of-pocket costs for families earning $75,000 have reduced from 13 per cent of their disposable income to just seven per cent in the year 2010.
In conclusion, there are a few points that I would return to. When it comes to improving the affordability of child care, our record stands head and shoulders above the record of those opposite. Through this bill we will give 700,000 Australian families real and immediate assistance with child care. It is im-port-ant that that assistance occurs at the time they incur their childcare fees. But it is also important, in conclusion, to go into some of the broader areas covered by Senator Nash in, I reiterate, some of her rhetoric. I remember the years 2003 and 2004, when I was working as shadow minister for children and youth. The minister at the time was Larry Anthony, and I recall that there was an agenda for early childhood that the Howard government paraded and paraded with no action, to the extent that the sector became more and more frustrated. The only action at that stage was the growth and further growth of organisations like ABC child care, whom of course Larry Anthony then went to work for.
So I think the credibility that this opposition has in child care needs to be very seriously questioned. They can criticise other measures that this government has undertaken whilst supporting this bill, but what they can never claim is that they actually acted on a national agenda for children. This is a very important and critical issue for the Labor government and we will continue down this path. It may well be that there are measures that need to be addressed that will not benefit 100 per cent of Australians, but we cannot be criticised for not having a national agenda, a national plan for significantly increasing the affordability and the quality of childcare services for Australian families.
Within that broader context, we return to the issue immediately before us, which is improving the regularity of payments for Australian families. This issue has a long history, dating back to when the Howard government first introduced the rebate at 30 per cent. It is now 50 per cent and families no longer have to wait 18 months, up to two years, before they see the assistance that should be immediately associated with their expenses in supporting their children. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2011-03-22,"—I rise to speak with great pleasure to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry’s report to the parliament on livestock mortalities—or, I will say, livestock deliveries—during exports by sea for the reporting period of July to December 2010. I would like to place on record for the Senate the outstanding figure that 99.9 per cent of 408,700 cattle were successfully delivered from Australia to their end ports, and 99 per cent of 1.5 million sheep were so delivered. It is an outstanding result, particularly when you consider that the actual gross live weight of those who arrived was greater than 100 per cent of what the purchaser bought in the first place.
I compliment the many people in the trade for this outcome—the producers, transporters, feedlot managers, shippers, veterinary service providers and those responsible for the overall supervision of the trade. More than $1 billion of gross regional product comes directly from the live export trade, and there is a further $1 billion or more in the multiplier in regional Australia for people who would otherwise not gain reasonable employment in that sector. Our cattle go principally from the Northern Territory, northern WA and Queensland to Indonesia, Israel and Jordan. I am pleased to say that during this six-month period there was the introduction of a new market—Turkey. What a wonderful success that has been, both for Australian exporters and also for the Turks themselves. Sheep are principally going to the Middle East.
I will comment briefly on a couple of aspects associated with welfare and again make the observation that Australia stands unique in the world for the attention given over many years to improvements in health, welfare, husbandry and nutrition of cattle and sheep in the markets to which we send our livestock. There is continual improvement. Nobody else does this. Can we continually improve? The answer is yes. We have come a long way. I am the first to say that we can do better. We can do better, for instance, in slaughter handling of cattle, and we are already investing in this area, in Indonesia, Egypt and other places. We are using Australian technology and expertise. The challenge is there for us to improve. Can we do better with sheep? Yes, we can, but it will be a different form, simply because the demand by the customer for the sheep product, in the main, is different.
I will comment briefly on food security in the time available. I saw email evidence from the Turkish government at the time we introduced the cattle trade to that country pleading for us to pull out all the stops because of their urgent need for protein. That brings me to the point about chilled or frozen versus live export. There is a continuing and growing need for both. It is absolutely wrong for people to be saying we can replace the live trade with the frozen or chilled product. We cannot, and it is important for this country and for our farmers, producers and exporters that this trade continue.
The point has been made that we could phase out the live sheep trade in my home state of Western Australia. Let me tell you, for the last 30 years competition between meat and live exports has underpinned the value of the sheep market in our state. It is already in a parlous state because of drought conditions affecting cropping, and if we were to lose the live export trade it would be a very severe blow. Anybody naive enough to say that if we were to stop the live export trade those in the meat trade would continue to pay the same price for the carcass, as many have said, does not know very much about competitive markets. I have spoken previously in this place about the need for the live trade in markets where electricity supplies are unreliable, affecting freezers and chillers, and also in markets where most of the consumers, particularly of sheep, are what we would call ‘wet market’ consumers. They do not have refrigeration in their own homes and the markets themselves very often do not have chilling or freezing facilities.
Time does not allow me to respond to many of the negatives that have unfortunately come out in this parliament and in the wider community. There is misinformation, wrong information and an attempt to remove the viable income of many producers in this country. I commend this report to the Senate.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,"<title>Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</title>",Documents,23,1
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2011-03-22,"—In many ways Australia has taken great steps forward in the recognition of the role of women in our society and in progress towards equality between men and women. As early as 1894, women were able to vote and be elected to the parliament of South Australia. Federally, these rights were endorsed in 1902, but it was as late as 1926 before all states recognised the right of women to be elected to parliament.
A conflict of the size of World War I forced change to the traditional relationship of men and women and created an appreciation of the importance of women in our communities. This change reinforced the activism of women from the 1880s onwards. The Australian Women’s Suffrage Society was formed in 1889. During World War I, Norway and Denmark confirmed the right of women to vote. The United Kingdom, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria, the Netherlands and Canada followed soon after, at the end of World War I. However, progress has been slow. ‘Equal pay for equal work’ was not recognised until 1969. Not until 1984 was the Sex Discrimination Act passed, outlawing discrimination on the basis of gender.
The Labor government endorses the principles of equality. The recently introduced parental leave provisions are just another example. The Hon. Kate Ellis MP recently introduced a range of measures to assist with the process of equality in our workforce. However, discussion of these measures is for another time and place. In 2006, 54.8 per cent of tertiary positions were offered to women. In 2008, 30 per cent of small businesses were operated by women and 57 per cent of Public Service positions and 36 per cent of senior positions were occupied by women, but only 12 per cent of senior private sector positions were and the percentage of women as board members was even lower. So there is still a way to go.
However, today I particularly wish to recognise the organisations and women who have been added to the Tasmanian Honour Roll of Women. The honour roll was created in 2005 not only to recognise the significant contribution of these women and organisations to Tasmania, Australia and even internationally but also so that these prominent women will be seen as role models by young women and encourage them and assure them that such achievements are attainable and, in fact, very desirable. In 2011, women’s organisations have been included for the very first time, to recognise the contributions that organisations have often made to the advancement of women’s issues. A further 24 women have been added. Sadly, six of these inductions are posthumously awarded. I would like to mention each of these esteemed figures but time will not allow me to fully acknowledge or give due justice to each of these inductees.
This year the Australian Women’s Land Army, Tasmanian division, 1942-45, and the Hobart Women’s Health Centre were the two organisations recognised. The AWLA—often called ‘Land Girls’—comprised young women who volunteered to work as rural labour to offset the labour shortages on farms. The AWLA recruits initially faced reluctance and scepticism from the farming community. However, after formal farm training, the women valiantly took on exhausting dawn-to-dusk work, eventually earning great respect from the farmers they assisted. The AWLA did not receive the same recognition as other women’s services. It was only in 1985 they were able to march in Anzac Day parades, and in 1995 these women became eligible for Civilian Service Medals.
The Hobart Women’s Health Centre has taken a holistic approach to women’s health and has been at the forefront of taking health issues out of surgeries and into the community. The centre acknowledges the impact of societal influences such as income, education, gender, sexual orientation and isolation on health outcomes for the individual. The centre has continuously lobbied for improved services and programs that meet women’s needs. Nutrition and body image programs, the Encore breast cancer program, support groups for endometriosis and lymphoedema sufferers, and programs for older women are examples of the centre’s work.
Of the 24 women inducted onto the honour roll, three have represented their communities at either state or federal level. Sadly, Sue Napier, who was inducted, passed away last year. Elected in 1992 using the slogan ‘The best man for the job is a woman’, her experience in education was an invaluable asset as she served in a range of portfolios. She became the first female Deputy Premier, Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Liberal Party in Tasmania. Sue Napier will be remembered as a woman of integrity who fought against discrimination and championed the cause of the disadvantaged.
Prior to her election to state parliament in 1993, Peg Putt was the Director of the Tasmanian Conservation Trust. As a politician, Peg spearheaded campaigns around Aboriginal rights, women’s rights and the need to preserve Tasmania’s natural heritage. From 1998 to 2002, Peg was the sole elected Tasmanian Greens representative in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. Peg’s contribution to the Tasmanian parliament was recognised by voters in the 2002 state election, when four Tasmanian Greens were elected, gaining the Tasmanian Greens official parliamentary party status.
In the late seventies, the former Labor senator for Tasmania Kay Denman became a volunteer member of the Mersey Leven Community Welfare Planning Group. The group had an extensive brief focusing on social welfare issues. This led to her involvement with the inaugural committee of Mersey Leven Family Day Care, and she fought for children with disabilities to be cared for in day care facilities. This voluntary work opened up Kay’s interest in social justice issues. Kay has also been a staunch advocate for those suffering from asbestos related diseases. Having grown up in Railton, she has seen firsthand the devastating effect these diseases have on our community.
Elizabeth Clark has had a long history of service to her community with the Girl Guides, the Rural Youth Organisation, the Cressy Progress and Improvement Association, the Cressy indoor bowling club, the Cressy amateur swimming club, the Howard Hill support group and the Cressy Anglican Women’s Fellowship. Elizabeth joined the Cressy branch of the CWA in 1982 and rose through the ranks to serve as state vice president from 2003 to 2006 and state president from 2006 to 2008.
Margaret Findlay received her award for architecture. She personally designed more than 60 residences to suit the requirements of employees of the Australian Newsprint Mills, or ANM, staff in New Norfolk. Margaret was the first woman in Tasmania to qualify as an associate of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and was the first registered female architect in Tasmania. In 1945, Margaret was appointed Instructor in Architectural Draughtsmanship at the University of Sydney, the only female instructor at the school.
In 1953 Johanna Coy was appointed as Tasmanian Nutrition Officer in the Department of Health Services, a position she held for 34 years. During this time Johanna was the only nutritionist in Tasmania. She published over 50 papers, working on them in her own time. Papers included ‘Dietary Survey of Tasmanian School Children’ in 1957, a great year, and ‘Food—Problems of Pollution’ in 1977.
In the early 1970s, Connie Curtain became involved in the Talire Special School, which her daughter, Margaret, had attended. She also became actively involved with the Retarded Citizens Welfare Association. In 1978, Connie was awarded the title of RCWA Tasmanian Woman of the Year. Connie accompanied southern Tasmanian teams to the Special Olympics intrastate, interstate and overseas. Unfortunately, she passed away in 1989.
There is a long list, so I will seek leave to incorporate the remainder of the list of women and their achievements in the Hansard. I want to reiterate that these women have helped shape our Tasmanian community, and I commend these women and organisations to the Senate, the Tasmanian community and Australia as a whole as wonderful role models. I seek leave to have the list of women and their achievements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
