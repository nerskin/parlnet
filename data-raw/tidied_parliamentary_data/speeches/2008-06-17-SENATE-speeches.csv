Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-06-17,"—Family First will be opposing the Wheat Export Marketing Bill 2008 and the Wheat Export Marketing (Repeal and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 because most wheat growers want a wheat-marketing system that is owned and controlled by the growers. The single desk has served growers well, so why would we throw it out and leave farmers, and especially small family farms, to the mercy of the big grain-marketing companies? The central aim of these big companies is to maximise their profits for their shareholders, not to serve farmers.
I had to be away from the Senate yesterday because my wife was ill, but I was able to listen to a lot of the debate yesterday on my PDA. I must admit that I heard Senator Minchin, for the Liberal Party, wriggle around the issue of the single desk. If I had been up in the gallery, I think I too would have been jeering over the issue and saying, ‘What the heck is going on?’—particularly when you see something like this happening, which is so out of touch with what the wheat farmers across Australia are actually looking for. Family farmers are doing it tough, and the Wheat Export Marketing Bill will devastate a lot of farmers that rely on the single desk.
The Nationals stood here yesterday like Tarzan coming out of the jungle, beating their chests and saying, ‘We’re all for the farmers; we’re all for looking after the little guy.’ Well, where were they when they sold Telstra? When they sold Telstra, they sold the bush. Where in the heck were they when Telstra was going to be sold? Where were they with the Oil Code? The Nationals went missing in action on that one. Then we look at the sale of Medibank Private. They supported that as well. So where were they for the little guy and the bush in those cases? Then we look at Work Choices. Where were they on that one? They were supporting that one as well. And now they say, ‘We’re looking after the small guys; we’re looking after the farmers.’ That is just not true.
And now, all of a sudden, we have the Labor government with the Wheat Export Marketing Bill. I cannot believe it. The  single desk is about collective bargaining—and I thought that was what Labor was all about. The single desk was put in place in 1948 by the Labor Chifley government. Ben Chifley would not even recognise the party if he could see what you are doing here today. The Labor Party is putting the interests of farmers in the hands of the big wheat-marketing companies. This bill is about market economics. It is about big business. This is about the Prime Minister selling out to big business and not looking after the small farmers.
In November 2006, the Prime Minister, the Hon. Kevin Rudd, wrote about free-market fundamentalism as ‘the ruthless logic of the market rubbing up against a tradition which holds that those with economic power have a moral obligation to protect those without it’—a moral obligation to protect those without. This wheat-marketing bill sells those people out. Where is the moral obligation to protect those who do not have that power? Australian politics is dominated by the ideology of market economics—the free-market mantra. But what about those people who cannot fend for themselves? The old debate about collective bargaining and Work Choices has been thrown out the window with the wheat-marketing board. Both the major parties have sold these people out big time. Family First does support free enterprise, but not unfettered free markets. Too much regulation is no good, but not enough is no good either. Leaving people out on their own without any way of fending for themselves is just not right.
The interests of big business and small business are not always the same; in fact, they are often totally at odds with one another. The Labor government has chosen to side with big business, as it did when the Oil Code came around—when we were looking at petrol service stations and making sure that we had competition. Yes, Family First agrees that it was wrong for the Australian Wheat Board to bribe Saddam Hussein’s regime to buy wheat from Australia, but let us not use that as an excuse to throw out the single-desk system, which has served farmers well for decades.
Question put:
That these bills be now read a second time.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT EXPORT MARKETING BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2008-06-17,"—I am pleased to rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2008. This bill makes minor amendments to the National Health Act 1953 which are desirable either to extend the operation of the PBS in certain circumstances or to remove some anomalies. For a relatively young country, Australia has a proud record on schemes which allow equitable public access to medicines and other pharmaceutical items. My colleague the shadow minister for health in the other place, Mr Hockey, detailed some of the history of the PBS in his speech in the second reading debate. I will not repeat that, but it is certainly worth while placing some of it on the record of the Senate.
The original scheme to provide access to pharmaceuticals was the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme established in 1919, in the wake of the Great War, to provide free pharmaceuticals to ex-servicemen and women. At that time, the Hughes Nationalist government brokered agreements with the major drug houses to extend the facility not only to World War I veterans but also to those from the Boer War. The Curtin government tried to introduce a limited free scheme in 1944 but was opposed by the Australian branch of the British Medical Association, the precursor of the AMA, and the legislation was struck down by the High Court. A pharmaceutical benefits regime was successfully established during the term of the Chifley government but it was essentially limited to remote communities. It is a matter of pride to me as a Liberal that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, which underpins the operation of today’s contemporary PBS, was established by the Menzies government in 1953.
Particular mention in this debate must be made of the contribution made in this regard by Sir Earle Page. At the time Page was the Country Party leader and the Minister for Health, having served briefly as Prime Minister during the dark days of World War II. The current Deputy Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, rightly paid tribute to Sir Earle Page as the father of the PBS in an Evatt Foundation lecture in 2006. As a young surgeon, Page had contracted an arm infection while conducting a postmortem. The infection proved almost fatal. In 1942, when Page was Australian minister resident in London attending Churchill’s war cabinet, he succumbed to pneumonia and again was lucky to survive. So in 1953 Australia was fortunate to have as the Minister for Health someone who carried great weight in the cabinet as Country Party leader, who was a surgeon by profession but who also had personal experience in the dangers of infection and the benefits of antibiotics. As a doctor himself, Page was also able to act as a peacemaker with the BMA after their vehement fights with the previous Labor government. With such a happy line-up of the planets, Page established far-reaching public policy. Over five years from 1950, Page successfully piloted through parliament legislation to provide free essential drugs to the community, to maintain free medical services for the poor, to support private health insurance funds and to increase federal government grants to hospitals. All of these have endured through bipartisan support over the last 60 years, though I must say that the Rudd government’s recent budget decisions regarding a Medicare surcharge have severely undermined one part of our health system.
The bill before the Senate today extends pharmaceutical benefits to government officers working outside Australia and their accompanying spouses and dependent children. It also extends pharmaceutical benefits to couples, whether married or in a de facto relationship, who live apart owing to illness or infirmity. Couples in such circumstances will be able to continue to be considered as a family for the purposes of their entitlement to safety net concession and pharmaceutical benefit entitlement cards. I commend the government for making both of these changes. They certainly have the opposition’s wholehearted support.
The bill also widens the criteria used to determine that brands of pharmaceutical items may be co-marketed. The Bills Digest questions what effect this change will have on the industry, and I would be interested to know the answer to that query. There are areas of health policy on which the government and the opposition profoundly disagree. One of those is the constant spectre of the socialisation of medicine, which seems to be the concern of many in the medical profession, through the ill-considered development of GP superclinics. Those who remember the Whitlam government’s ill-fated community health centres will know exactly what I mean. However, with regard to fair and reasonable access to essential and life-saving medicines, there has never been any disagreement. Consistent with the bipartisan nature of the support for the PBS, on behalf of the opposition I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2008-06-17,"—I do not wish to make a long speech but just acknowledge the Australian Democrats’ support of the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2008. It is largely technical and non-controversial and we welcome the improved access to the PBS safety net for those who are separated by ill-health or service overseas working for government. I must respond to Senator Colbeck’s remarks about the ‘ill-fated community health centres’, in referring to the socialisation of health in this country, and tell him that in Victoria they are not ill-fated at all; they are thriving and are a very important part of our medical system.
I indicate that I have circulated an amendment which would fix the discrimination against same-sex couples that is inherent in the PBS safety net and which, as we all know, exists in so many other bills. But I will not move that amendment because I have an undertaking from government that this matter of discrimination will be sorted out in the spring sittings of parliament.
I also take this opportunity to condemn the opposition for effectively delaying bills which will fix same-sex discrimination in Commonwealth laws, until 2009. It is unwarranted. HREOC produced a very substantial report which demonstrated the reasons why we need to fix these problems. There is no good reason, in my view, for the matter to be further delayed. As senators in this chamber will recall, the Democrats have put our standard amendment, as we call it, to many bills for many years in this place, and it is very disappointing that we have to leave the Senate with this bit of business not yet done. I would ask the minister with the carriage of this legislation to just confirm for the public record that this amendment will be dealt with in good time, so there will be no need for me to move the amendment, which I have circulated in the chamber.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-06-17,"—The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the PBS, is regarded as one of the best systems of its kind in the world. It provides affordable access to high-quality medicines for all Australians by subsidising the cost of PBS medicines and delivering them through local pharmacies and hospitals in our communities. The PBS safety net insures that families and individuals who require large amounts of medicines are protected from high cumulative costs. The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2008 contains amendments to the National Health Act 1953 which, although unrelated, will help to ensure that the PBS remains current and operates effectively for all Australians, whether as PBS users, suppliers or the medicines industry.
One of the amendments improves access to the PBS safety net. This will mean that couples living apart, due to illness or infirmity, will be able to use the safety net jointly. These couples will be able to combine PBS co-payment contributions towards the same safety net threshold. Both persons will be able to be included in the same safety net card and will have access to safety net benefits once the threshold is reached. In effect, the PBS payments required for both members of a couple to reach the safety net will be the equivalent of one safety net threshold, not two. This has the potential to reduce the out-of-pocket costs for PBS medicines for such couples by an amount equal to the relevant safety net threshold. PBS medicines required by either person can then be obtained at the reduced safety net rate for the remainder of the calendar year. This amendment strengthens the ability of the PBS safety net to deliver real benefits in savings to the people who need them. It recognises that when couple members need to live apart, for reasons of ill-health, frailty or dependent care, they do not cease to be part of a family. It provides continuity for joint access to safety net entitlements for these couples, despite their living circumstances having changed permanently. It will improve the affordability of PBS medicines for these people at a time in their lives when they may be most in need of PBS benefits.
The bill also amends the act to extend access to the PBS for government officers working outside Australia. Current PBS eligibility, supply and export restrictions prevent pharmaceutical benefits being provided to government officers when working overseas, despite eligibility for the PBS in Australia. However, accessing medicines outside Australia can be difficult and uncertain. The changes will allow pharmacists to dispense PBS prescriptions for medicines required by these officers, accompanying spouses and dependent children and for those medicines to be sent outside Australia in quantities required for their personal use. This will provide access for these Australians to quality, affordable medicines and PBS safety net entitlements.
The amendment to the criteria for determining co-marketed brands will ensure that the legislation operates as was originally intended. The amendment will allow co-marketed brands to remain co-marketed in certain circumstances and to continue to have the co-marketing pricing benefits, even if they are brands of more than one pharmaceutical item. In addition, the amendments provide that the minister may, by legislative instrument, determine that co-marketed brands cease to be co-marketed. The ministerial determination will have precedence over the regulations prescribing co-marketed brands. This is an important amendment as it facilitates timely and efficient administration of the PBS co-marketing arrangements. In response to Senator Colbeck’s question as to how the co-marketing provisions affect industry, I am advised, Senator, that this will be positive for industry, because co-marketed items are protected from statutory price reductions. If there is further information that you would like on that, I am happy to provide it.
This bill also contains minor and technical amendments which change the way that two definitions are referred to in the act and removes the requirement for gazettal of certain ministerial determinations. The relevant determinations will be legislative instruments for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. In response to the question posed by you, Senator Allison, I acknowledge that you have indicated that you will withdraw the amendment that your party has consistently applied to lots of legislation, including PBS legislation. I want to put on the record that the Labor Party is committed to a consistent and comprehensive response to the broad suite of legislation that does not recognise same-sex relationships. This will be part of the audit that we do of legislation to ensure that same-sex couples are considered. There will then be a full response, hopefully, in a short period of time—but not short enough, unfortunately, for the Democrats to be able to vote for it. We acknowledge the Democrats’ persistence, throughout the time they have been in this chamber, in attempting to ensure that same-sex couples are not discriminated against—a view that is shared by the Labor Party.
Finally, I want to thank Senator Colbeck and Senator Allison for their contributions to the debate and for the support of this bill. The changes in the bills strengthen the PBS and improve access to PBS entitlements. The government will continue to monitor the PBS to ensure that it is operating as intended and to ensure that access to necessary medicines is available when needed by those Australians eligible to receive them. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-06-17,"—The opposition will support the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008 and I want to speak briefly to it. It is almost identical to the coalition’s bill last year that lapsed because of the election, and it has bipartisan support. It has also been amended, as I understand it, in the lower house by also including non-controversial schedules 2 to 6 from Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill. I wish to speak briefly to the bill.
As I said, it contains schedules relating to tax law reform. The first schedule relates to amounts misappropriated by an employee or agent. This measure fills a gap in the existing tax laws. It is a measure that the coalition announced in May 2007 and addresses the inequity of a taxpayer effectively being taxed on an amount that the taxpayer has not received. Typically, the situation could happen where the taxpayer sells an asset that has been depreciated for tax purposes. Under the measure, the taxpayer still includes the excess in their assessable income but, in recognition of the fact that the proceeds have been misappropriated by the employee or agent, a deduction is allowed for the amount of the sale proceeds. Where the asset is not eligible for depreciation or similar relief but is taxed under the capital gains tax—the CGT rules—a sale would ordinarily result in the proceeds being taken into account in calculating the amount of the gain. Under the measure, the amount of the proceeds will be reduced by the amount that was misappropriated by the taxpayer’s employee or agent. Specific rules are being introduced to cater for the situation where the taxpayer has calculated their tax position as a result of a misappropriation but later recovers all or some of the amount misappropriated.
The second schedule that is supported relates to extending the superannuation guarantee late payment offset. When announcing the change to the superannuation guarantee late payment offset, the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Governance appears to have made a mistake. He appears not to have been aware of a press release that had been issued by the former Assistant Treasurer, the member for Dickson, that initially announced the decision to change the offset. The measure addresses the situation where an employer is late in paying their compulsory super and thus has a contribution shortfall. The employer who is late in paying a superannuation contribution for an employee must also pay the same amount to the ATO as part of the superannuation guarantee charge. Under this measure, the employer who pays a late superannuation contribution will be able to offset that payment against the liability for the superannuation guarantee charge. Thus the employer pays the amount of the super contribution only once. The employer will still be liable for interest and an administration charge for not making payment of the employee’s super on time.
The third supported schedule in Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008 is the capital gains tax market value substitution rule for interests in widely held entities. It is another measure that my colleague the member for Dickson announced last year. It is a sensible measure which we support. It will ensure that shareholders in widely held companies and unit holders in widely held trusts are not disadvantaged when their interests in the entity are cancelled. The current position is that the market value substitution rule will replace the actual market proceeds received, say on a cancellation, with the market value of the equity where the capital proceeds are more or less than the equity’s market value. What the former coalition government wanted to ensure was that the equity owner would be taxed on a capital gain based on the amount agreed to be paid to them, not on some other value that they did not receive following the cancellation. The measure will also simplify the current legislation that applies to transactions or dealings covered by this type of capital gains tax event.
The fourth schedule supported is the Endeavour Research Fellowships and Executive Awards. Both the research fellowships under the Endeavour Awards and the amounts received under the Endeavour Executive Awards comprised a number of payments. The tax rules resulted in some complexity. I will not go through it all in great detail, but under this measure, which as I said we support, amounts received from research fellowships under the Endeavour Awards or from the Endeavour Executive Awards will be exempt from tax from 2007-08 regardless of whether the recipient is a full-time student.
The fifth schedule deals with early completion bonuses for apprentices. The coalition gave strong support to apprentices and technical education. In government we recognised that a trade or a technical career should be seen as a highly valuable, satisfying and rewarding career. When we came to government back in 1996, there were some 154,800 apprentices in training. By March 2007 the number of apprentices in training had risen to 414,300, an increase of 168 per cent. We had established 21 Australian technical colleges around the country. The Australian technical colleges allowed students to complete their final years of high school while at the same time starting down the track of an apprenticeship that would allow them to work towards a successful and rewarding career. This support for apprenticeships was backed by an increase in investment in vocational and technical education from $1.1 billion to $2.9 billion, an 87 per cent increase in real terms. As further evidence of this support, which I think it is fair to record, the coalition announced in 2007 that the first $1,000 of an early completion bonus paid to an apprentice would be exempt from tax. The measure in schedule 5 of the bill will carry this decision into effect. It was part of the suite of measures we had designed to support technical education.
Early completion bonuses are payable under schemes offered by a state or territory. A bonus serves to reward an apprentice who completes their apprenticeship more quickly than normal and the bonuses should also go some way to reducing skills shortages in the trades. Regulations will prescribe what kinds of occupation are eligible for the early completion bonus tax exemption so that skills shortages are addressed in the relevant time frame. I note that currently an early completion bonus is available only from the Queensland government and I note that the government intends to list the Queensland early completion bonus scheme in regulations as soon as the bill receives royal assent.
The sixth schedule relates to deductible gift recipients. I will not go through each of them, but each of the deductible gift recipients named in the schedule is very worthy of public support and, as I have said, we support this measure.
I now want to turn very briefly to the additional non-controversial elements of the original Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill. They also contain very sensible measures, which we are pleased to support. These measures also had been introduced by the former government last year but had lapsed due to the election. The first one is tax-free super for the terminally ill. I am particularly pleased to support the taxation exemption for superannuation payments to the terminally ill. When the member for Dickson announced this policy last year, he stressed that it is very important for parliament to seek to remove as many stresses and challenges as possible for people who are facing this terrible prospect. In particular, he mentioned the story of Christina Fiddimore, who unfortunately passed away recently because of breast cancer. She had wanted to ensure that she was not a financial burden on her family during her difficult fight with breast cancer but could not access her superannuation tax free. The government and the opposition were very cooperative and there is strong bipartisan support for this measure. I take this opportunity to extend condolences to Ms Fiddimore’s family. This measure will mean that when someone is faced with a terminal illness they will be able to access their superannuation in the form of a tax-free lump sum.
The next schedule deals with capital expenditure for the establishment of carbon sink forests. We are pleased to support this measure, which provides for the establishment of a deduction for capital costs incurred in establishing carbon sink forests. This will provide an incentive for the planting of trees, which is, I think we all agree, a very welcome development.
The next schedule is a tax offset for those affected by the equine influenza outbreak. It provides for an extension of the beneficiary tax offset to equine workers. The measure will help support those many low-paid workers and sole traders who have lost their jobs and have lost substantial income because of the equine influenza outbreak last year. The purpose of this measure is to add a tax offset to the wage supplement that was given. This will mean that those affected by equine influenza will be able to receive ongoing support.
There are two more schedules. One deals with tax relief for grants issued under the Tobacco Growers Adjustment Assistance Program, which is also very important. Where a tobacco grower undertakes to exit the industry, the grant that they will receive for doing so will be tax free. The grants will be up to $15,000. It is a measure that was introduced earlier but had lapsed because of the election.
Finally, there is the Farm Management Deposits scheme. This is a largely administrative measure that seeks to better realign tax law with other government guidelines as to which geographical areas and which primary producers in those areas are subject to exceptional circumstances. I believe that those clarifications are needed and it is important that they are now made.
These omnibus bills are always quite complex in the way in which they have to be dealt with, put together and thought through. It is very important that the tax law continues to be amended to either address anomalies or to make provision for circumstances such as some of the ones that I have outlined in my brief remarks. I am very pleased to see these bills brought to the Senate, and the opposition wholeheartedly supports them.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-06-17,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008 is an amended bill. We have a revised explanatory memorandum and there are some amendments coming through in the committee stage. But it is one of those measures that wrap up a lot of outstanding elements with respect to taxation law. Taxation law is such that it does continually need finetuning and adjustment. These measures are welcome as they update and improve the areas they address.
The schedules that are covered in the bill include amounts misappropriated by an employee or agent, extending the superannuation guarantee late payment offset, capital gains tax market value substitution rule for interests in certain companies and trusts, income tax exemption in the Endeavour executive awards and research fellowships under the Endeavour awards, early completion bonuses for apprentices, the usual update of deductible gift recipients, payment of a superannuation lump sum to a person with a terminal medical condition, capital expenditure for the establishment of trees in carbon sink forests, extension of beneficiary tax offset to the equine workers hardship wage supplement payment, tax-free grants for certain tobacco growers, and farm management deposits. That is a list that you can see is very eclectic. There is not much interrelationship between each of those; they stand on their own.
Schedule 1 proposes changes to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to correct the inconsistent treatment of amounts misappropriated by an employee or agent following the disposal of an asset that has been dealt with under the uniform capital allowance provision, which, under current law, fails to recognise the loss of economic benefit experienced by the taxpayer arising from the misappropriation. These amendments will effectively enable CGT events and uniform capital allowances to be written down to reflect the misappropriated loss. The explanatory memorandum says the compliance cost impact will be negligible and the financial impact is unquantifiable. With that, we should not be frightened that it is going to cost a motza; it will not. These measures will only apply to amounts misappropriated in the 2007-08 and later income years.
Schedule 2 is welcome. It extends the superannuation guarantee late payment offset to remove the double-payment provision that currently exists within superannuation law. Under present conditions, employees who make late superannuation guarantee payments are penalised by being required to pay a superannuation guarantee charge, which includes a contribution shortfall amount, a nominal interest component and an administration charge. However, late payments cannot presently be used to offset the contribution shortfall amount included in the superannuation guarantee charge, thereby heavily penalising late paying but well-intentioned employers. According to the EM, the financial and compliance costs are expected to be negligible. This is a fairness and equity measure.
Schedule 3 proposes amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to exclude the market value substitution rule from capital gains tax events involving holdings, in widely held companies or unit trusts, which are cancelled, surrendered or brought to an end in similar ways. This ensures that there is an equitable taxation outcome for affected individuals, who would otherwise potentially face a tax bill larger than the proceeds of the aforementioned cancellation. Small compliance costs are expected from this amendment and ongoing compliance costs are forecast to be minimal. The EM again says that the financial implications are unquantifiable. Again, I would suggest that you not fear that statement. It does not presage a high cost. And again I say to you that this is both an equity and a fairness measure, and it will simplify the law.
Schedule 4 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to facilitate the income tax exemption of scholarship funds received through the Endeavour executive awards, including research scholarships. This award is an internationally competitive, merit based scholarship program, administered by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, for bringing leading researchers, executives and students to Australia to undertake study and research and professional development, with reciprocal arrangements abroad for Australians.
Schedule 5 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to exempt early completion bonuses paid by state or territory governments to apprentices for the early completion of apprenticeships in skill-shortage occupations. The forecast cost to revenue over the forward estimates is $8.7 million. The logic behind the exemption of an apprenticeship bonus from income tax is questionable in light of the fact that an early completion of a course facilitates the apprentice to work for higher wages. Thus one could argue that there is sufficient financial motivation for early completion, besides the payment of a bonus. The loss of revenue associated with this schedule could arguably be better used in promoting greater uptake of apprenticeship positions, or in the financing of additional apprenticeship places. So, I am lukewarm about this schedule but I am certainly not going to oppose it. I think it is probably unnecessary, but the apprentices will love it because it gives them some extra dough.
Regarding the deductible gift recipients list, the proposals have retrospective application but that is of benefit to those concerned so I have no objection. But I would take this opportunity, while briefly commenting on schedule 6, to recommend to both the government and the opposition that they look carefully at the Democrats notice of motion in my name and in the name of Senator Allison, which is to be considered later today. It deals with referring the issue of not-for-profits and charities to a Senate inquiry. This area of law to do with the administration and management of not-for-profits and deductible gift recipients, I think, needs reform. The previous government thought it needed reform and failed with its attempts at that time. A Senate review process is a proper one to re-address this issue. I would recommend, particularly to the opposition, since they have the numbers and control of the Senate—and I hope the shadow minister, Senator Coonan, is listening to me carefully—is she?
—Absolutely.
—Good. I recommend they take an active interest in the proposal we have put to the chamber.
Moving on to schedule 7, dealing with superannuation lump sums paid to a person with a terminal medical condition, this is a wonderful initiative and we support it. Schedule 8 deals with capital expenditure for the establishment of trees in carbon sink forests. There is much one can say about these matters, but this is just tidying up existing policy so I am not going to indulge in the topic. Schedule 9, dealing with the extension of the beneficiary tax offset to the equine workers hardship wage supplement payment, merely tidies up an existing problem, and schedule 10 does the same thing. We already have an adjustment assistance program for tobacco growers. It is underway for those who wish to exit all agricultural enterprises, and this is a measure to assist in that matter.
Last is the farm management deposits area, where schedule 11 to the bill amends the Farm Management Deposits scheme to align the laws with the guidelines for declaring either all primary producers in a geographical area or specified classes of primary producers within a geographical area to be in exceptional circumstances. This is actually a very intelligent technical amendment which will be of great assistance to those affected, and we certainly welcome it. I recall that in 1996, when I was first campaigning to go into the Senate, the chief policy officer for Western Australia’s Pastoralists and Graziers Association first outlined to me the proposals for the Farm Management Deposits scheme, which he was promoting. If my memory is accurate, his name was Mr Price. I was taken with the scheme and I was therefore pleased when later on the coalition government embraced and introduced it. I think it has had material benefits in equalising income for a notoriously cyclical industry, the agricultural industry. What is interesting is that I never foresaw or understood quite how much money would end up in those deposits. Again, if my memory is accurate—and perhaps the shadow minister would remind me, if it is not—I understand there is well over a billion dollars these days. So it was certainly a very significant policy.
With those brief remarks, I indicate to the government that the Australian Democrats will be supporting this bill.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-06-17,"—First of all, I thank Senator Coonan and Senator Murray for their contribution to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 2) Bill 2008. The bill makes a number of improvements to Australia’s tax and superannuation laws. All the measures in this bill are seen to be relatively uncontroversial.
Schedule 1 addresses a technical inconsistency in the tax law when an amount is misappropriated by an employee or agent after they dispose of an asset on behalf of a taxpayer. Schedule 2 removes an anomaly in the superannuation guarantee system by extending the superannuation guarantee late payment offset. To reduce the incidence of employers having to pay the same superannuation amount twice, once as a penalty and once the actual superannuation payment has been made, the period within which an employer can make a contribution for their employee after the due date for making the payment and still be eligible to use the late payment offset is extended.
Schedule 3 amends the tax law to ensure that the market value substitution rule does not apply to certain CGT events. This will provide consistency with C2 CGT events and result in a fairer treatment of taxpayers who may otherwise end up with a tax bill larger than the proceeds of a cancellation of shares. Schedule 4 provides an income tax exemption for the Endeavour executive award and for all research fellowships under this award. Schedule 5 exempts from income tax the first $1,000 of eligible early completion bonuses paid by state and territory governments to apprentices where certain conditions are met.
Schedule 6 amends the list of deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. They include the AE2 commemorative Foundation Ltd, Ian Thorpe’s Fountain for youth, Wheelchairs for Kids Inc., the Amy Gillett Foundation, the Spirit of Australia Foundation, the World Youth Day 2008 Trust, the Memorials Development Committee Ltd, the Council for Jewish Community Security, Playgroup Australia Inc., the Dunn Lewis Youth Development Foundation, the Finding Sydney Foundation and Australia for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Amendments in the House added five schedules to the bill. These five schedules are identical to schedules 2 to 6 in the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 measures No. 1) Bill. These amendments were necessary to ensure that certain measures of benefit to taxpayers that were in TLAB 1 are passed before the end of the income year.
Schedule 7 makes tax free superannuation lump sums payed to persons with a terminal medical condition. This important change assists in relieving financial stress which terminally ill persons and their families may be suffering due to their situation. The amendments will have effect for payments made on or after 1 July 2007.
Schedule 8, which like schedules 10 and 11 was introduced by the former government in Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 6) Bill, provides a concession for the costs of establishing a carbon sink forest. This measure will encourage the establishment of carbon sink forests and in turn make an important contribution to carbon sequestration.
Schedule 9 extends the beneficiary tax offset to the equine workers hardship wage supplement payment. Schedule 10 provides tax-free status to grants under the Tobacco Growers Adjustment Assistance Program 2006 to tobacco growers who undertake to exit all agricultural enterprises for at least five years. The grants are being paid following the loss of a market in Australia for domestically grown tobacco.
Schedule 11 makes minor technical amendments to the early withdrawal provisions to the Farm Management Deposits scheme. This amendment will improve the Farm Management Deposits scheme by ensuring that all primary producers who are eligible for early withdrawal due to exceptional circumstances will retain the tax benefits.
I would again like to thank those who participated in the debate and I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2008-06-17,"—I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and the First Home Saver Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. It is timely given that yesterday the Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability in Australia, which I had the honour and privilege of chairing, tabled its report. It is timely that I have the opportunity to speak in this debate. The housing affordability problems that Australia faces are well documented and are reaffirmed in the documentation tabled by the select committee yesterday. As a committee, we had the opportunity to hold hearings across metropolitan and regional Australia and to hear evidence and receive submissions from across the breadth of the community. The committee heard not just from academics, to whom I know Senator Moore referred yesterday afternoon, particularly from AHURI, but from members of the public, local government, planning experts, the Real Estate Institute and from Commonwealth and state departments—that is, in some cases, those state governments which were inclined to support the committees inquiry constructively, which was a distinct minority of state and territory Labor governments, disappointingly.
The evidence that we received in that process, the evidence which the government would say brings about this legislation today, is quite clear. The cost of housing has increased from roughly four times the average wage to seven times the average wage—if I may paraphrase—over the past decade. It is also the case that in evidence provided to the committee both by industry experts and supported by the federal Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and the RBA, we are conservatively estimated to be underbuilding dwellings in Australia by 30,000 a year. When you bear in mind the demand that already exists, the challenges currently on the supply side and perhaps even add to that mix the government’s most recent announcements in relation to increases in immigration numbers, this is a very significant challenge which we face.
Most would say, and many of those who gave evidence to the select committee would say, that many young Australians now face the prospect of not being in a position to own their own home—certainly not in the short to medium term. As my colleague in the other place the member for Farrer has indicated, the coalition will be supporting the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 primarily because we believe that any measure that encourages a culture of saving, as is intended with this particular product, should be encouraged. We want, however, to place on the record a number of concerns that we have in relation to the legislation and that includes a number of potential disincentives inherent in the legislation and its structure for potential first home buyers who might be considering committing to these accounts. Some of these disincentives, we are concerned, have not been addressed by government.
We also have ongoing concerns that the first home saver accounts do not address a number of the fundamental causes of the decline in housing affordability and we do wish to place on the record our concern that, unless more is done to address the constriction of the supply of housing, this bill may in fact result in increasing prices, which would be an undesirable outcome from all perspectives. As has been stated before and elsewhere, there are a number of conditions that the initiative presented in this bill is required to satisfy if it is to boost the purchasing power of home buyers relative to the market. Firstly, it needs to be taken up by home buyers. It must be offered by sufficient financial institutions to facilitate competition in the market and to give consumers opportunity and choice. It should not make housing more expensive than it would otherwise be and it should also be cost-effective in both its implementation and its administration.
We examined the question of whether first home buyers will actually be prepared to commit to this particular savings scheme initiative. To satisfy the basic criteria for a government co-contribution, a potential home buyer is required to make a contribution of $1,000 in four financial years. The government is then indicating that they will provide a contribution of 17 per cent of what the first home buyer pays in, up to a maximum of $5,000. That equates to a maximum government contribution in any year of $850. It is important to note that the government contribution is not, in fact, automatic. If you only saved $1,000, you would get $150 from the government and you must wait a minimum of four years before you can access those funds for any deposit on a first home. Realistically, four years is a long time for a first home buyer. Their plans, their circumstances and market conditions can all change very quickly, and in fact we see that every day in Australia at the moment. A minimum four-year commitment does not necessarily allow potential home buyers to respond to changing circumstances.
Potentially, another deterrent for first home buyers to commit to a first home savers account is the lack of flexibility that exists with regard to contributions. As I have said, payments can only be made to purchase that first home if personal contributions of at least $1,000 have been made in respect of the first home saver account holder in each of at least four financial years. So the accounts, as they are designed, do not make any allowance for fluctuating incomes. In what is a particularly dynamic labour market in 2008, and particularly in the economic circumstances that pertain to Australia, that may be an issue. For example, in today’s very flexible job market, a potential first home buyer might be in a position to contribute more in one year and less in another. So there is that inflexibility that surrounds these accounts, particularly from the perspective of some young people who we know might not be inclined to commit to anything that locks them in for a considerable period of time.
I also want to make a couple of observations about the level of complexity associated with the accounts, which could present some concerns or act as a deterrent to potential first home buyers. These issues were aired both in submissions to Treasury in the development of the policy, as I understand it, and in submissions to the Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability in Australia. Complexity is a challenge in the market, as we all know. When you are contemplating the level of financial literacy that exists amongst young Australians, it can often be regarded as relatively low itself. Abacus, the peak organisation representing building societies and credit unions, raised that particular concern in their submission to Treasury. We should not be expecting young first home buyers to commit to a scheme that they might not understand. That was also evidenced in the committee’s report, which I will make some reference to. Abacus, in their submission to the Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability in Australia, indicated:
Optimising the FHSA initiative will require FHSA products that are attractive to, and understood by, young people. Each additional layer of complexity and the regulatory framework will reduce returns to savers, dampen competition and choice, and slow the arrival of FHSA products to market.
Because Abacus is the organisation that represents credit unions—and I have a previous professional history with their predecessor—they have, over the years, as credit unions made a great deal of effort in relation to financial literacy to engage their customers and potential customers on these issues. I understand very well the point that they are making: their indication that it would be very unfortunate if the standing of the First Home Saver Accounts policy were tarnished by any evidence that young Australians had in fact made investments in the products without really knowing what they were doing and perhaps, and there is the potential for this, having gone backwards in capital value terms and, therefore, exacerbating for them the very disadvantage that the First Home Saver Accounts policy was designed to address. That might happen if, for example, the potential buyer cannot keep up with the repayment of $1,000 for four years and the account stalls. These are things which we think need to be taken into account.
If the first home saver account is offered by a registrable superannuation entity and the product is investment linked, it is not capital guaranteed. We all know that superannuation can go backwards as an investment; it is a long-term investment. But this is actually a short-term exercise, so these issues need to be taken into consideration. In such events, the first home saver account holder may be left worse off than if they had just used an ordinary savings account or had scraped together the money for a home deposit from day one.
I also note another potential deterrent: the concern expressed by some organisations that the FHSAs could be outstripped by housing price rises. A potential first home buyer, who is locked in for four years, might find at the end of the four years that housing prices have risen faster than their savings. As I understand it, and as was reported to the committee and discussed elsewhere, these concerns were raised during the public consultation process for the accounts and have not actually been addressed.
In terms of account providers, I referred in my earlier remarks to the importance of competition in the marketplace for the provision of the accounts. For the accounts to offer a robust product that is competing well in the marketplace and, importantly, giving the best value to first home buyers, there needs to be competition amongst many providers to ensure quality and to allow for portability of the accounts. We need to be very cognisant of the level of support that there is for potential providers to back the government’s scheme.
There are some bureaucratic arrangements attached to the scheme which some potential providers have expressed concerns about. Again, they were reiterated in the select committee’s hearings, particularly in our first hearing in Sydney. That bureaucratic burden, if you like, can be a very heavy disincentive for providers. The whole process of aligning their systems to work with these new requirements is not an easy one. It is not an inexpensive one for them either, and they would need to be assured that the product is going to be one which has significant take-up before they actually work their systems down that line.
Approved deposit-taking institutions and life insurance companies, of course, have to notify APRA, as the regulatory authority, before they can offer first home saver accounts. They have to obtain the licences that are relevant in this area and, in many cases, they have to establish whole separate trusts. Financial institutions themselves, as they should—but nevertheless it needs to be noted—need to keep detailed records because earnings are taxed to the account provider at 15 per cent rather than to the individual account holder. That means more detailed reporting requirements, particularly to the Commissioner of Taxation, who will be administering the government co-contribution. The Commissioner of Taxation is required to undertake the compliance work, which may be considerable given that the requirement in the outline for the account is only to live in the house for six months after it is purchased or constructed.
I want to make a couple of comments about restrictions on supply in the market in Australia. Whether it is state and territory land taxes and levies, whether it is land release policies, or whether it is a lack of investment in a number of key areas in transport and infrastructure, they all combine to artificially restrict the supply of housing. The Senate committee evidence showed us this. They are issues which need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Clearly, if the government is going to add to demand with initiatives of this nature then it must also add to supply to avoid those prices escalating. The Housing Industry Association contends that the housing industry should be building at least 175,000 new residential dwellings each year to satisfy the demand which currently exists.
I reiterate the remarks I made at the beginning of my comments today: we are currently under-building in Australia by an estimated 30,000 dwellings a year. The Reserve Bank of Australia says that any efforts to improve housing affordability should focus on policies regarding land use and improving efficiency in the supply of land and housing. Clearly, with this measure, which is a relevant measure in the debate, the government is not yet at the main game in terms of addressing the problem of housing affordability by taking up the issues of supply shortages to make its consequent policies most effective. The supply of land to build entry-level first homes is not keeping up with the demand. By adding more dollars to the demand side of the equation, you end up giving people more money to spend in what is already a very tight housing market. And there is the concern—which has been expressed by a number of commentators and is recorded, as I said, in the committee’s report—that this increased spending and increase in demand has the capacity to inflate housing prices further than they already are. That means that the public benefit of any co-contribution would end up being bid away in higher prices.
As I said, the coalition are not opposing the first home saver account bills and this initiative, because we do appreciate and have long said that any incentive that encourages young people particularly—and, in the first home buyers market, that is essentially what we are speaking about—to save is an important and positive outcome. But the government’s maximum co-contribution can only be achieved by saving $5,000, a difficult target for a young person who is probably currently renting. There are complexities surrounding the rules that govern these accounts such that a young potential homebuyer may look at them and decide that it is easier to pursue other saving options. They may well recognise that the small advantage they might accrue over the four years for which they held the FHSA could be very quickly outstripped by the rising costs of housing in Australia.
I said at the beginning of my remarks that the debate on these pieces of legislation is very timely with respect to the tabling of the select committee’s report on housing affordability in Australia, which was entitled A good house is hard to find. I do not often commend reports to the Senate—we all have enough to do with our time—but I would commend the detail of this report to the Senate in terms of the breadth of its examination of the issues right across Australia in both regional areas and capital cities and in terms of the opportunities which were presented for witnesses to come forward to the Senate select committee and provide evidence on the challenges not just in relation to homeownership but more broadly than that, as I referred to yesterday. It is a very important resource for us as senators, for us as a parliament and I would hope, in fact, for the government. I hope that the government looks very carefully at the recommendations that the committee has made and responds constructively to those.",SENATE,<title>FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2008-06-17,"—I rise in the Senate today to speak on the First Home Saver Accounts Bill 2008 and related bills. The Rudd Labor government understands that homeownership is vital to the economic and social wellbeing of all Australians. The home is a stable base from which to participate in our society and the primary asset for most families. According to official statistics, it has never been harder for first home buyers to purchase a home in Australia. The average home now costs seven times the average annual wage, up from four times the average annual wage just 10 years ago. Nationally, first home buyers are now spending 31.7 per cent of their total income on mortgage repayments, up from 17.9 per cent in 1996. Many Australian cities are experiencing large increases in rental costs and a shortage of rental stock. This is of particular concern because of the current shortage of housing supply affecting the most disadvantaged people in the Australian community.
The Rudd Labor government also understands that the cost of living is rising more rapidly than it has in more than a decade. Over the past year, food costs have risen 5.7 per cent, mainly due to increases in the prices of a broad range of household groceries. For example, a litre of milk has gone up 11.6 per cent over the past year, and a loaf of bread is now nine per cent more expensive than it was 12 months ago. The Rudd Labor government understands that all Australians are finding it hard to make ends meet, which is why it is tackling the housing affordability crisis head-on with the First Home Saver Accounts Bill.
In essence, the first home saver accounts are a simple, tax-effective way for Australians to save for their first home, through a combination of low taxes and government contributions. The first home saver accounts will bring the dream of homeownership closer to a reality for hundreds of thousands of young Australians. The Rudd Labor government understands that one of the greatest obstacles to buying a first home is saving for a deposit. From 1 July 2008, a couple each earning average incomes will be able to save a deposit of more than $88,000 after five years of disciplined saving. This is up to $12,600 more than if they were to save using an ordinary deposit account, depending on returns. Ultimately, having a large deposit reduces the tax burden for young homebuyers and can help them avoid incurring costly mortgage insurance.
Federal Labor’s First Home Saver Account scheme forms part of our responsible approach to economic management. First home saver accounts are an important element of the Rudd Labor government’s five-point plan to win the war on inflation, encouraging private savings and helping to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. This initiative will help boost national savings, with the accounts anticipated to hold around $4 billion in savings after four years. The government understands that there is no single solution to the crisis in housing affordability, which is why the first home saver accounts will work in conjunction with federal Labor’s existing $1.1 billion worth of commitments to increase the supply of affordable first homes and rental properties. They include the first Housing Affordability Fund, which will increase housing supply by providing money for local infrastructure and giving state and local governments incentives to lower development charges; the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which will provide investors with tax incentives to increase the supply of new affordable rental properties across Australia, saving 50,000 low- to middle-income families 20 per cent on their rental bills; and introducing a better approach to land release, with all surplus Commonwealth land being free for housing development or community infrastructure.
Many Australians are having trouble finding affordable housing, and they are using a growing proportion of their income to keep it. This is a long-term measure to assist more Australians to achieve their dream of homeownership. Whether people can afford to buy or rent, the federal Rudd Labor government has a plan to comprehensively tackle the housing affordability crisis. The Liberal Party’s inflation legacy has made it harder for working families, especially first home buyers, to save a deposit and buy themselves their first home. The new government has an ambitious housing policy agenda. After more than a decade of neglect, this country is in dire need of direction. The Rudd Labor government is fixing the problems created by the previous, Liberal government. We now have a Minister for Housing, the Hon. Tanya Plibersek, backed up by the departmental capacity in the department of families—

Prior to the election, Prime Minister Rudd told us that he was going to reduce elective surgery waiting lists. He even told us that the buck stopped with him.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-06-17,"—The government is committed to delivering better health systems for modern Australia. On this side of the chamber, a better health system for Australian communities is at our core. But you have to appreciate that the Liberals left us with a huge mess. After 11 years of neglect, we are beginning—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Clearly they agree that they left a mess and they are now trying to defend that mess. The Liberals did leave us with a mess, and we are beginning the important task of rebuilding the Australian health system. And, let me tell you, there is a lot of rebuilding to do. As we go around the country, that is reflected in what needs to be done.
The Treasurer announced the creation of a $10 billion health and hospital fund. It is important to note that this will be the single biggest investment in health infrastructure ever made by an Australian government. This will go to address waiting lists and problems in the health system right around the country, including Tasmania—which were ignored by the Liberals over the last 11½ years. The health and hospital fund will support future health infrastructure priorities, including health and hospital facilities and equipment; medical technology and equipment; and major medical research facilities and equipment, including projects and facilities which will support links between hospital based clinical research and high-quality clinical practice. This is a major step towards building the future and demonstrates this government’s commitment for a better health service for Australians now and into the future.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. My question was about hospital waiting lists and the Tasmanian budget, which was brought down last Thursday. I would ask you to remind the minister of the question.
—The minister is in order.
—As I said, this is a major step towards building for the future—unlike what the Liberals did in their 11½ years. They neglected the issues and did not do what needed to be done. This government is committed to providing a fund for the future. But that is not our only investment in health; we are also investing an additional $1 billion for public hospitals in the next year, which will also go to the waiting lists that are being talked about by the opposition. It is a shame that the opposition did not look at how to address this when they were in government. This government is committed to addressing these issues. In addition there will be $600 million to slash elective surgery waiting lists, $780 million for dental care and $275 million to deliver GP superclinics in local communities.
This is not something that the opposition did when they were in government; it is something that this government is committed to do. This government is committed to deal with this matter over the course of its term. In fact, for the first time, total Commonwealth funding for health and ageing will top $50 billion next year. That compares favourably with the previous government’s health and medical infrastructure fund, which was scheduled to receive an initial allocation of $2.5 billion in the 2006-07 budget, which would have led to $150 million invested in a year’s time.
Our concrete steps to prepare for the future stand in stark contrast to what the Liberals left—the previous government’s 11 years of neglect in this area. In 2003 those opposite made the crucial decision to rip $1 billion from the public health system. No wonder they are complaining about it now in this place. And who were the losers from that decision? (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-06-17,"—What this government will guarantee is that we will commit to rebuilding the Australian health system, unlike what the opposition did. You left us with 650,000 Australians on public dental waiting lists, a nationwide nurses shortage of almost 6,000—

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-06-17,"—I thank the senator for the question, although I did discuss this with him in estimates. It seems that the senator may still not have grasped the issue. The first thing to say is: this is not a result of this year’s budget. This impact on not-for-profit organisations and their workers is not a result of this government’s budget. It is actually a result of action taken by the former government, of which you were a senior member, Senator Boswell. It was contained in measures in the 2006-07 budget. So this was not a dorothy dixer, I hasten to add.
It was legislated by the previous government. I accept it may have an adverse impact on employees in the not-for-profit sector who salary sacrifice. I have friends in that situation and I know how much salary sacrificing has been going on—and quite frankly my personal view is that it has gone too far. That is a personal view, but we did have the debates in this parliament over recent years arising out of the Productivity Commission’s original report. The Democrats were active on the issue. Nevertheless, we have a large number of workers who have salary sacrificed to a huge degree. As I indicated, this was a decision of the previous government and it is now coming into effect. We are increasingly aware of the particular effects it is having on people who work in the not-for-profit sector. We are very concerned that it is going to impact on them, because these are people helping the most vulnerable in our community. For a lot of them, salary sacrifice is what gives them the capacity to work for what are traditionally quite low wages, and they have been poorly paid in the past.
The tax benefits that people are currently receiving from their salary sacrifice arrangements are not affected by the changes; however, some employees, depending on the circumstances, may have a net loss of family benefits. The change is to use the gross value rather than the net value of reportable fringe benefits in determining a person’s income to determine what level of family assistance they are eligible to receive. As I have said, this is not part of this year’s budget; it was a decision taken by the previous government that is to be implemented now. We are aware of the concerns. The minister has undertaken to investigate those concerns. Clearly, it is likely to have more impact than perhaps was first thought, but I do stress that these are measures that have been expected for some time—they are a result of the 2006-07 budget. We want to try and treat people equally, not give advantage to people who salary sacrifice in order to gain access to government benefits. But there is no doubt that there are some consequences of this measure appearing that are going to hurt people quite seriously, and the minister has undertaken to discuss this with various groups to try and work through the issues.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-06-17,"—I do not know whether we are at cross-purposes or whether Senator Boswell does not follow this closely enough, but I refer him to Budget Paper No. 2 of the 2006-07 budget and the speech by the then minister, Mr Brough, as a point of reference for him for these issues. I want to make that clear. The government will attempt to resolve the issues involved, Senator, but I do not think it is fair for you to pretend you do not have to take some responsibility for this. But we are happy to address the issues and the concerns.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—It is interesting that you are all care and no responsibility now. The point is that concerns have been raised genuinely. The minister has offered to engage with people to work through those concerns. But, as you know, the clear principle is that people ought to be treated equally and not access benefits unfairly by lowering their assessable income. As I have said, we are working through those issues and hopefully we can find a resolution that at least helps. (Time expired)

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2008-06-17,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Human Services (Senator Ludwig) to a question without notice asked by Senator Colbeck today relating to hospital admissions and waiting times.
Senator Ludwig’s answers today effectively bell the cat on promises to the Australian people made by the Rudd government prior to the election where they said they would actually reduce hospital waiting lists. The revelations in the Tasmanian budget papers effectively expose the impact of the ill-considered measure of the Rudd government in changing the Medicare levy thresholds, particularly given the lack of work they did on this measure as part of the overall budget consideration. Mr Rudd has made a big deal about keeping his promises and the people of Tasmania will be very disappointed to find that, rather than a reduction of hospital waiting lists that he promised them, they will in fact see an increase of 627 over 2007-08 levels in the 2008-09 year. That is a seven per cent increase, not the decrease that was promised by the Rudd government. Now the Tasmanian government were well aware of all the measures, the $600 million, that Senator Ludwig told us about when he responded to the questions that we asked during question time. They are aware of all those programs. In fact, they already have some of the money that was allocated under the first $150 million, so the program would have started. But despite that, their budget papers say that they expect to see a seven per cent increase in hospital waiting lists in Tasmania.
We know that other states also have concerns about this measure and the impact that that is going to have on their hospital waiting lists. And we know from our questions at estimates that, when calculations were made about the impact on private health insurance companies, there was no calculation with respect to children; children were not included in the numbers, so the estimates that were provided to us by the government fell short. We know that if you include children that puts the numbers at over 700,000 people. Therefore, the estimates that were ridiculed by the government from the industry and from the medical fraternity are in fact much closer to being about right. Estimates of 700,000 to one million people moving out of private health insurance are obviously going to have an ongoing impact on people who still have private health insurance. Therefore, people will be moving into the public health system and, as the Tasmanian government has admitted, will be placing additional pressure on waiting lists around the country.
We know that the government did not take all of the effects of this into account. We found that out through the estimates process. They are about to embark on new five-year Commonwealth-state funding agreements and yet they did not consult the body that they put together to advise them on health—the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission—at all on this measure, despite the significant impact that that was going to have on health, going forward. They did ask the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission to advise them on the five-year health funding agreement between the Commonwealth and the states, but they did not mention the fact that they were going to attack a significant chunk of the health system in this country and they have not even costed the potential second-round impacts that might occur. So they have no idea, going into the five-year health funding agreements with the states, what the costs are going to be. They have no way of knowing what claims are going to be made against them by the states to compensate for this or whether those claims are genuine or not. They are just effectively going to have to take the state government’s word for it.
At this point in time, despite the first reports on the reduction of waiting lists being due on 6 May, we still do not know what is happening with those. At estimates a couple of weeks ago we were told that the first quarterly report that was supposed to be provided by the states would be available in the next few weeks, yet we still do not have that information.

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2008-06-17,"—The election, of course, was a devastating loss for the Liberal Party and I can understand that they have not quite got their balance and bearings today. It will take some time for the party to settle down and get a decent policy position, because we have seen some amazing U-turns and backflips on policy here today—none more than this one here today as outlined by Senator Colbeck. I mean, this sympathy for the states is just extraordinary when before the election, for month after month, we heard attacks on the states; attacks on their health policies and attacks on every policy that they had; attacks about not spending enough; and attacks about their management of the hospital system. And now we have sympathy for the states. Now we have acceptance of their costings; now we have acceptance of their estimates of what is going to happen with their health policies.
The difference is that the Rudd Labor government are actually talking to the states; they are actually discussing funding needs with the states and what they need with their health systems. So it absolutely rings hollow to have this pretend sympathy as to the state system because no sympathy was shown under the Howard government—no sympathy at all. They were squeezed down in their health budgets and their funding; they were squeezed down in every direction so that the Howard government could claim superiority and direct money to programs that they wasted their revenue on.
So we now have this attack on this policy. What is this policy going to do? It is going to remove from lower income earners a tax slug that was put on them in the past. The Liberal opposition is trying to stop the removal of a tax slug on low-income workers on the basis that it subsidises the hospitals. I am sure, if you spoke to anyone who is struggling on $50,000 a year, that they would have absolutely no sympathy for that argument whatsoever—and neither should they. For year after year the Howard government refused to adjust that income level and the result is that people on those low to medium incomes were paying more than they should have into the healthcare system while tax cuts kept being given to higher income earners. The Rudd government are now redressing that system and they are balancing that by discussing with their state counterparts how to make sure that the health system starts to work properly after 12 years of neglect by the Howard government.
It just astounds me that, having suffered that devastating loss in the election, the Liberal Party have not, it seems, learnt a thing. They are now telling people in that income group that they are going to block a provision by the Rudd government that removes this tax impost on people earning $50,000 a year or more. It is just breathtaking. I have to say that it just shows how little the Liberal opposition have got in putting together their policy. The Leader of the Opposition said at one stage that he believes that people earning over $150,000 are doing it tough. We also have the opposition trenchantly opposing the luxury car tax, and yet it is okay for people on a $50,000 a year income to pay this extra tax impost that gradually crept upon them over the years of the Howard government. I would be very astounded if the opposition again go to an election with that kind of policy. I mean, if they are a good opposition then I think they need to go back to the drawing board, recover from their devastating election loss, look again at their policies and look again at the kind of legislation they are blocking.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2008-06-17,"—I also rise to take note of the answer provided by Senator Ludwig. In his answer today, the minister again tried to defend a bad public policy decision by ignoring the facts and totally ignoring the impact on our public hospitals. The challenge for any government is to set up a policy framework that will ensure that all Australians have affordable and timely access to quality hospital care. In Australia, we aim to achieve that through a mixed health system, with a public hospital component and a private hospital component. When we last came into government in 1996, that system was totally out of balance. In 1996, private health insurance membership was in free fall. It bottomed out at 30 per cent before we were able to turn the ship around. How did we turn that ship around? Through a three-pillar policy supporting Australians who were prepared to take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking out private health insurance. This was done through the 30 per cent rebate, through lifetime health cover and, yes, through the Medicare levy surcharge policy. Those policies were exceptionally successful.
In the 12 months between December 2006 and December 2007, nearly 400,000 additional Australians took additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking out private hospital insurance. By December 2007, 9.4 million Australians had taken out private hospital insurance. Now we have a government that comes up with a Treasury-driven bad public policy which is ill thought out and short-sighted and will have a devastating impact on our public hospitals. What did we find out in the Senate estimates process? Treasury did not understand the difference between what is called in industry jargon ‘single equivalent units’ and ‘persons covered’. ‘Single equivalent units’ are adults. ‘Persons covered’ are adults and their dependent children. That is why the Treasurer was out there for weeks on end trying to tell Australians that only 485,000 people would leave private health insurance as a result of this measure. We have found out since then that it is going to be significantly more; it is going to be well in excess of 700,000 people.
We then tried to assess the impact on public hospitals. If you look at the budget papers, the government expects to save $959.7 million as a result of not having to pay the private health insurance rebate to those Australians who will leave private health insurance as a result of this measure. Yes, there will be a loss in revenue of $660 million, but that means that the government is still $300 million in front. Today the minister said, ‘We’re providing a $600 million package to compensate for this and reduce waiting lists.’ That answer was misleading because, if the minister looks at his own budget papers, there is $300 million, which is made up of a first stage—$150 million to immediately reduce waiting lists—and the second $150 million is funding into infrastructure and not into services. The second stage of $300 million is actually only available if the state governments meet certain performance targets. There is absolutely no way that the states can meet those performance targets, due to the impact of this measure. The states will never be able to get access to their $300 million. Quite frankly, this is just a farce. The Commonwealth is actually in a cost-neutral position on this.
As a result of this measure, $960 million no longer has to be spent by the Commonwealth due to people leaving private health insurance. That is only the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. The total funding lost to the health system as a result is well in excess of $3 billion. When we asked questions in estimates about whether the Commonwealth had consulted with the states or modelled, costed or in any way assessed the impact of this measure on state public hospitals, the answer was, ‘No, we have not.’ Treasury said, ‘We don’t cost, model or assess second-round effects.’ What a joke! There is a tsunami of additional demand about to hit public hospitals across Australia. We have a Prime Minister who, in the lead-up to the election, was telling Australians that he would end the blame game and would start a new era of cooperative federalism in health. Yet here they are taking $3 billion out of the Australian health system without any meaningful compensation and trying to hide it through smoke and mirrors. It is an absolute disgrace. Quite frankly, there is a very serious need for some additional scrutiny on the impact of this measure. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2008-06-17,"—We had a very interesting situation in question time today. On the one hand, we had Senator Boswell, who was very much concerned about the impact on low-income earners—people earning about $50,000 on FBT and salary sacrificing—and then we had Senator Colbeck attacking a measure that seeks to alleviate the tax burden on people earning $50,000.
Senator Colbeck is again playing politics with the Tasmanian health system. Those opposite did it during the election, with the Mersey hospital, and they are doing it again here. I remind the Senate of what actually happened under the previous government in terms of hospital funding to Tasmania. We do not have to go too far; we only have to look at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare’s Health expenditure Australia 2005-06 report, which was released last year and showed that the Australian government’s share of the public hospital bill declined by more than five per cent in the four years to June 2006, with the load shifting to the state government. That meant that the Howard government short-changed Tasmania by $70 million each and every year. It was funding that would have paid for more nurses and opened more beds to allow for more operations to be performed across Tasmania’s public hospitals. That is the situation. That was the situation under the previous government, and Senator Colbeck well knows that.
I will also inform the Senate exactly what Labor has delivered to Tasmania’s health system. The recent budget delivered significant investments in Tasmania’s health. These investments underpin the recommendations of the clinical services plan and include $15 million towards the establishment of an integrated care centre in Launceston; up to $2.5 million towards the establishment of a GP after-hours clinic in Burnie; up to $5 million towards the establishment of a GP superclinic in Devonport; up to $7.7 million for an additional radiation oncology unit in the north or north-west; $1.25 million for mental health counselling with the Sisters of Charity; $60,000 towards the redevelopment of the Penguin Medical Centre; $3.5 million to support the purchase of a PET scanner at the Royal Hobart Hospital; up to $8 million towards the establishment of a GP superclinic for the eastern shore, with clinics at both Bellerive and Sorell; and $10 million for patient transport services. This is what the Rudd Labor government has delivered to Tasmania, as well as it being part of the $3.2 billion National Health and Hospitals Reform Plan. What we saw from the previous government was a ripping out of $70 million from the Tasmanian health system.
I will just go back to the Medicare levy surcharge. The surcharge was introduced by the Howard government in 1997. The then Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, in his speech introducing the surcharge, indicated that the surcharge was aimed at high-income earners, the people who could afford to pay for private health insurance. However, under the Howard government, the levy income threshold has remained static over 10 years, while average weekly earnings have increased by nearly 50 per cent. The Howard government’s refusal to increase the levy threshold meant that close to 50 per cent of Australians, many of them only earning the average wage, were being slugged with paying the surcharge despite the fact that this was not who the surcharge was intended to impact on.
In his speech in reply on the budget, Dr Nelson railed against what he labelled as ‘bracket creep’ and ‘tax increases on the sly’. However, such claims are hypocritical when applied in retrospect, considering that the now opposition did nothing—I repeat: nothing—for 10 years and effectively imposed tax increases on the sly on working families in Australia by simply not increasing the Medicare surcharge threshold.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2008-06-17,"—Allow me to contaminate some of the arguments put by the Labor members in this place with a few facts. First fact: it is not the case that this adjustment in the Medicare levy surcharge thresholds is to account for inflation since the measures were introduced in 1996. If you had made that adjustment, as you claim you were trying to do, you would have ended up with a singles level threshold of something like $70,000, depending on whether you were adjusting for increases in the price of goods or of wages. So this argument that putting it up to $100,000 for singles and $150,000 for couples is simply about adjusting pursuant to the policy of the previous government is absolute and arrant nonsense.
The second fact is about the argument that this is a tax slug which the government believes should be taken off the shoulders of working Australians. The fact is that there is tax relief and there is tax relief. Not all tax relief is a good thing. You need to consider the downstream effect of any decisions of this kind on the total picture in the area that you are affecting. Take this example. If the government had announced in its budget that it was going to decrease the burden on working families by reducing the excise on tobacco products, what would we say? Of course, there are some families who would pay less for their tobacco products, but what would the effect be on the health of Australians? It would be to cause a deterioration of the health of Australians overall—and so with this measure. We need to pose the question: is this actually in the interests of Australians’ health generally?
Let us look at the effect. We know that this will cause hundreds of thousands of Australians to surrender their private health insurance. We know that means that when those people get sick the chances are that they will move into the public health system to obtain medical treatment. We know that that will increase waiting lists. We know it will increase pressure on public hospital systems in this country, systems which are already seriously burdened by very large numbers on their waiting lists. Take dental care as a particular example. It is sometimes said that people who are younger and fitter are the ones who will give up their private health insurance under these arrangements. But people of any age need dental treatment. They need check-ups. They need fillings. They need the sorts of things that have to happen throughout our lives. What will happen to these people, these 700,000-plus Australians—as Senator Cormann points out—who have given up their private health insurance, when these people need dental care? The chances are that either they will have to bear those very severe costs themselves, and we all know that going to the dentist is no cheap affair—so much for helping working families in Australia—or they will have to join the public dental waiting queues, very long queues that are increasingly under pressure, growing all the time, which are not going to be much relieved by the decisions of this government, to be perfectly frank, and we are going to find more people under pressure because of the state of their dental health.
The fact is that this has not been thought through by the government. They have not taken this step in order to relieve the pressure on working families; they have taken this step because they have an ideological opposition to the entire concept of private health in this country. They want to get people out of private hospital lists, out of private health insurance and into public systems, for reasons which are very hard to determine indeed. If those systems were working well, if they were under less pressure than they are now, you might understand it, but the truth is simply that they are not. That ideological position will cost Australians in terms of their health very dearly in the future.
Let us be clear about this decision. It will increase the cost of private health insurance—no ifs, no buts; it will certainly do that. Medibank Private has already said it is going to lose 10 per cent of its customers. What will it do to its premiums in those circumstances? It will have to put them up—and those opposite claimed they were going to bring premiums down, not put them up. It will force more Australians out of private health insurance and it will force more people into public hospitals and onto waiting lists for public health services.
With this decision, Labor will dishonour spectacularly its election promise to put downward pressure on public hospital waiting lists. There is no other consequence which can be foreseen except that that will occur. That is an absolutely gross dishonesty towards the Australian people. It is time, as Senator Cormann said, that we have more debate about this, that we expose the reasons behind Labor’s decision and that we bring to light the true downstream effects of this decision, because they are extremely damaging to the health of Australians.

Leave granted.

That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in Hansard.

The statement read as follows—
On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I have pleasure in presenting the Committee’s report entitled Advisory report on Schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008.
The Senate asked the committee to review the bill, which proposes to discontinue the tax deductibility of political donations.
The committee supports the discontinuation of tax deductibility for political donations and recommends that Schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008 be passed by the Senate without amendment.
Discontinuing tax deductibility for political contributions and gifts is estimated to save $31.4 million over the four years to 2011-12, with savings commencing in 2009-10.
The policy of discontinuing tax deductibility for political donations was taken to the 2007 federal election by the Australian Labor Party. The bill will give effect to this pre-election commitment and deliver ongoing savings of over $10 million per year. Delaying the passage of this legislation will lead to these savings disappearing from the budget bottomline.
The savings estimates prepared by Treasury represent the best available estimate given the lack of information from tax returns, donations to political parties and political party membership.
While some inquiry participants argue that tax deductibility should be considered as part of a broader inquiry, it is doubtful that the future political financing landscape will retain such an unbalanced and inequitable scheme.
Tax deductibility for political donations was introduced in an ad hoc way in 1991 following amendments to electoral legislation in the Senate by the Coalition parties and the Australian Democrats. While initially only applying to donations by individuals and their party membership fees to a cap of $100 per year, in 2006 the government extended tax deductibility to businesses and lifted the threshold to $1,500 per year.
At the time, opposition members of the Electoral Matters Committee expressed their concern that these changes would encourage individuals and other entities to make extensive political contributions, in secret, and at taxpayer expense.
Discontinuing tax deductibility for these payments will remove the inherent inequity of the tax system which provides higher income earners a larger subsidy for contributions to political parties. Abolishing tax deductibility for business taxpayers will remove a loophole under which payments by businesses to political parties are subsidised by the taxpayer to the tune of 30 per cent.
There is no evidence to suggest that removing tax deductibility will necessarily lead to reduced participation in political activities. Members of the community can still join political parties and individuals and businesses will still be able to donate to political parties and candidates for public office. However, the inequity created by the tax system will be removed and provide a fairer basis for political participation.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow committee members for their contribution to the inquiry and those that participated by making submissions or appearing at the public hearing. I would also like to thank the committee secretariat for their assistance.

And:
That the provisions of Schedules 1 and 2 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 3) Bill 2008 be referred to the Economics Committee for inquiry and report not before 18 August 2008.
And on behalf of Senator Ronaldson:
That the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008 be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for inquiry and report on 30 June 2009 in conjunction with the committee’s inquiry into the 2007 Federal Election.
To clarify the terms of the notices: when I gave notice, the bills were still in the House, and my notices therefore referred to the provisions of the bills. Now that the bills have arrived in the Senate, I make it clear to the Senate that in relation to notices No. 7, No. 11 and No. 12 I am moving to refer the actual bills and not just the provisions off to committees.
There are a number of bills involved in this matter and we are conducting a cognate debate in order to save time. I believe it is best that we take each of these bills in turn in relation to the merits of referral to the respective committees. But, before I do, I think it is useful as a backdrop that I remind the Senate of statements made previously on the referral of bills to Senate committees. In this regard, I would refer to the following statement:
Whether or not this government has a majority in the Senate and whether or not the Liberal government won the last election, the Labor Party are not required to say, ‘Oh, well, we’re just going to roll over, agree to everything the government has announced and do nothing for the next three years.’ That is not the approach in a democracy …
That statement was made by Senator Sherry on 16 June 2005. Indeed, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, on 14 June 2005, stated:
It is our responsibility to provide an alternative view of legislation, to speak out when we think things are wrong and to fight for those people whose interests we represent.
That is precisely what these referrals are all about: providing adequate time for those pieces of legislation to come under the scrutiny of Senate committees and, furthermore, providing stakeholders with a vital interest in these bills with an opportunity to have a say. Of course, we understand the government has an agenda. We have notified that a number of bills are non-controversial and, indeed, a number which are time critical. In that regard, we have referred three packages to Senate committees for reporting by next week. The coalition recognises that there are bills which are time critical and that we can conduct the scrutiny of those in the next fortnight and have them dealt with according to the government’s agenda.
But I am dealing here with something quite different. We have a package of bills, many of which were not election policy statements of the government in the recent election and many of which, we believe, have no budgetary impact. In fact, we say that the government, in painting a picture that this is in some way vandalising the budget, is conducting a completely false exercise in misrepresenting to the Australian people the process that we are pursuing. We are pursuing here the referral to Senate committees—and in one case to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters—important bills, some of which the Australian community has had little or no notice of.
I will turn to them in order. The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008, which we seek to have referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for reporting on 30 June 2009, is an important piece of legislation dealing with political donations and related matters. The coalition is committed to a holistic reform of election campaign finance laws in the wake of many scandals which we have seen, particularly the Wollongong ‘sex and bribes scandal’. We make it very clear that having a piecemeal approach to electoral reform will not result in the outcome that all would desire.
We have heard from the government that they are pursuing electoral reform. We say: let that be in an informed manner and let the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which deals with a review of each election, have available to it the means and the standing to conduct this review. This particular bill should be reviewed with other matters in relation to the recent election.
In relation to the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—Superannuation) Bill 2008, the government intend to introduce further legislation dealing with other recommendations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report. The coalition believe that this piece of legislation requires careful scrutiny. The coalition have said that we support this bill in principle, but there are details in this bill and in the government’s proposed bills—and I refer to the comments of the Attorney-General in this regard—that require scrutiny which you could not offer in just two weeks. We believe that, despite the fact we have given in principle support, it would be irresponsible of us as an opposition to simply wave it through and wait for further like legislation to come along which could have unintended consequences as a result of not being considered holistically with this bill. I might just add that this was not an election policy issue. I concede it was in the platform of the ALP but not one which was canvassed in the election campaign.
The Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy Surcharge Thresholds) Bill 2008, to be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics for reporting by 26 August, is an extremely important bill. We have recently learnt that the Rudd government did not ask either Treasury or the Department of Health and Ageing to model, cost or in any way assess the impact of the change to the Medicare levy surcharge on public hospitals. That is just one matter which requires close scrutiny. It is imperative for the health systems run by the states, territories and the Commonwealth of this country that we have careful scrutiny of this bill, and 26 August would provide that opportunity for the appropriate scrutiny to be conducted. Again, I reiterate the precise terms of this bill are not ones that I recall being an election policy of the government in the last election.
Similarly, the luxury car tax was not an election policy and it involves the government introducing another tax without consultation with industry, motorists or other stakeholders. This is an area where you could have flow-on effects which could be detrimental to motorists across Australia. The Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008 also requires careful scrutiny by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. In our motion, we have put a reporting date of 26 August.
Similarly, the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits—Cost Recovery) Bill 2008 was not an election policy of the government and we would seek its referral to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs for reporting on 18 August. This is a measure which has had absolutely no consultation. Concerns have been raised about the independence of the PBAC, and that needs to be looked at. Other measures in this bill could have effects on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which affects so many Australians. That needs careful scrutiny. The Fuelwatch bill was done overnight, in a matter of 30 or so hours, with public officials working through the night. It was not an election policy, and we believe that it has such consequence that it should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, to report by 29 September.
No less than four government departments have briefed the Rudd government against the introduction of Fuelwatch including the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance and Deregulation, the Treasury and the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. We have a number of departments briefing against this legislation, and the government is intent on rushing it through. This concerns something which is uppermost in the minds of many Australians: the price of fuel. This is something which demands close attention and we have asked that the committee concerned not report until 29 September to give the Australian public the chance it deserves to have input into this important piece of legislation so that it is not simply rushed through in these last two sitting weeks of the financial year.
We would seek that the Excise Legislation Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2008 be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, for reporting on 26 August. This, again, was not an election policy and could well have ramifications in the energy sector. The government is making much of the fact that it says this will cost taxpayers $177 million if not passed by the end of this month. This bill is capable of amendment to such an extent as to recapture any excise from the date it was announced. There is absolutely no problem with that. The opposition has had a briefing from Treasury. I would defy the government to prove beyond doubt that this is the case, because it cannot deny the fact that an amendment—

Senator Chris Evans interjecting—

—It does. The government stands charged with misleading the Australian community in saying that this will cost $177 million of lost revenue to the taxpayer. What that is saying is that this bill, as such, will cost that amount of money if not passed by the end of the month. The government has not looked very far, because you can just amend this bill to allow it to recapture the excise for a longer period and to allow for this scrutiny—for the industries and the companies concerned to make submissions to the committee—and you could still have no loss of revenue. There is absolutely no basis at all to the argument that there would be lost revenue or that this will cost taxpayers money.
What we have on the other side of the ledger is a measure which could well see inflation in relation to the price of gas, increased taxation on gas, a clean energy—and this is a government which talks about greenhouse emissions and clean energy. Here we have a further tax being placed on gas. This is of essential importance to all Australians and also for foreign investment, which has brought much prosperity to this country.
We also have Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 3) Bill 2008. That again was another piece of legislation which was not an election policy. This is a bill in response to a 2007 High Court decision known as McNeil’s case. It is a complex piece of legislation and one which merits close attention. It is not one that I think most senators would be across, nonetheless it deserves that scrutiny. As I said at the outset, we have agreed to three packages being referred to Senate committees for the scrutiny that can be offered in the fortnight that allows that and that they are time critical. But with these bills we do not accept that there is the cost involved that the government says. We reject that totally. We do not accept that they are time critical. We believe that they are of such importance that the Australian community deserves an opportunity—and especially those stakeholders who have an interest—to make submissions to the Senate committees. The July-August break provides a golden opportunity for that to be done. The coalition have a proud record in referring matters to committees.

Senator Chris Evans interjecting—

—We can look at the facts. In 2006, the first full year of the coalition’s Senate majority—perhaps those commentators who take an interest in this might have regard to it—the coalition government supported the referral of more than 100 bills to Senate committees for inquiry and report. This was the highest number of bills ever referred to committees in a calendar year and double the average number of bills referred to committee when the ALP was last in government. Let us see what the Rudd government is going to do about referring matters to Senate committees. Let us see if it can match the coalition’s record of 100 in a calendar year. Let us see if the Rudd government will agree to these referrals. Or is it going to deny the Australian people the chance to scrutinise important legislation which in some cases came with little or no notice?
I have mentioned the fact that the government has made much of the cost and the effect that this will have on the budget. These measures are all capable of being dealt with by referral and scrutiny without the attendant loss of revenue that the government claims. If the government were at all on its game, it would be able to remedy any aspect of delay especially in relation to the fuel condensate bill. I have outlined how it can do that. It is a matter which is capable of simple amendment. There is absolutely no vandalism or denial of revenue at all in any of these measures. It makes eminent sense, when we have the time, to deal with them together, for example in the case of a bill such as the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—Superannuation) Bill 2008—especially when the Attorney-General has said there will be others to follow. Yet this government wants to do it piecemeal, which will result in unintended consequences. It is similar with electoral law reform. We say you can have the law reform. It should take its course and it should be dealt with together with other aspects of reform. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, as I recall, has been around for in excess of 25 years. That is its job. That is what we are asking it to do: to look at political donations and to incorporate it in the other aspects it is looking at in relation to electoral reform.
Any denial of these referrals is one which will deny public scrutiny and will be, in any shape or form, an arrogant denial of Senate process. We have carefully considered those bills which are needed and where time is of the essence. We have indicated to the government that we will comply with the government’s agenda in relation to those budget bills and getting through its package of bills in this fortnight. There are around 40 packages, as I recall, and we anticipate getting through those packages in this fortnight. However, there are some that have to be referred to Senate scrutiny by virtue of its committee system, and that is what we are all about. Where that can be done quickly we have pursued that path, but of course you could not do all of these bills justice by sending them off to Senate committees for reporting back by next week. That would be an abrogation of our responsibility in the Senate and as an opposition.",SENATE,<title>SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS (EQUAL TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH LAWS—SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Referral to Committees</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-06-17,"—I think anyone listening to that contribution would realise that the Liberal opposition is dissembling. There is no coherence at all about its position. This is a very important debate because it is about whether the elected government of this country is allowed to deliver its budget, whether it is allowed to deliver its election commitments and whether it is allowed to deliver the surplus that underpins its attack on inflation and rising interest rates. This is fundamental to the government’s budget. It is fundamental to what we were elected to do only six months ago.
What we have seen today is an opposition who are prepared to say: ‘We lost the election but we are not going to allow you to govern the country. We are not going to allow you to deliver your budget. We are not going to allow you to deliver your election commitments.’ They concede that these are election commitments but they say: ‘We know better. We don’t accept the view of the people. We don’t accept the election result. Most of us, as former ministers now in opposition, think we should still be allowed to determine the size, shape and nature of the Australian budget.’ Unfortunately for them, the budget is drawn up by the government. The first Rudd Labor government is remarkable for the fact that this was the first budget in many years that delivered on election commitments made by the government. It also delivered on our commitment to fiscally conservative policy to try to keep pressure on interest rates. That is fundamentally undermined by a debate in which the coalition, in their dying days as a majority in this chamber, say they are going to use their power to destroy the budget strategy, to prevent the government introducing the revenue measures that were going to help fund the surplus. That is their arrogance—that they think it is permissible for them to try to destroy the financial and economic strategy of the government by looking to defer and delay revenue measures that underpin that strategy and underpin the $22 billion surplus that is fundamental to that strategy.
This is economic vandalism. It is economic vandalism because it serves no purpose. It does not achieve anything. The opposition are not actually saying: ‘We oppose these measures. We are going to defeat them.’ They are saying: ‘We are going to delay and defer. We are going to act as vandals. We do not have a point of principle here.’ They are not making the argument against the measures; they are making the argument that they ought to delay and defer, because they can inflict vandalism on the government’s budget. They hope to gain some short-term political advantage from that.
When they were asked today about the measure to remove the excise on condensate and were accused of achieving what they would by their position—which is to destroy a revenue measure that will return $177 million to the Commonwealth during the period for which they delay it—they said: ‘But we are not opposed to the measure; we just want to defer and delay.’ They do not have a position. Like everything else the Liberal opposition reflects at the moment, they are confused, lost and have no position or principle. What they are going to do is delay—and rob Australian taxpayers of $177 million that would help fund the economic strategy of the government—so they can consider the issues. They have had six weeks to consider the issues. This budget process is the same as every other. The government brought down the budget on 13 May. The opposition have had six weeks to consider their position and still they have not got a position. Still they hide behind process. Still they say: ‘We don’t necessarily oppose it; we just need to think about it longer. We just need to consider it more.’ They do not have a position other than that of vandals and other than that of hiding behind process in order to prevent the government achieving its economic strategy as contained in the budget.
Where they thought there was political pressure, where they thought they were under the pump, they have given in and said: ‘We’ll consider those bills quickly. We’ll consider the bills that deal with FTBB and the baby bonus.’ Because they have decided they do not have the political courage to oppose those, they are going to consider them quickly.
—Do you want us to now?
—I do not know whether you are going to. I have been waiting six weeks for you to find a position.
—Make up your mind.
—You get the chance to tell us what your position is today on all these measures, Senator Abetz. You have an invitation, and I hope you do not hide behind process. I hope you do not use the coward’s answer. You can tell us what position the coalition has on each of these bills, because quite frankly if you have a position we can have the vote and get on with it. If your answer is that you have no position and you need to think about it some more, that shows the political cowardice which you stand accused of. You do not have a policy, you do not have a coherent position, you cannot agree among yourselves.
I understand you walked out of your shadow cabinet meeting today after deciding to knock off another measure. The opposition are going to move a disallowance to our dentists reforms. There was no mention of that in Senator Ellison’s contribution today. The election commitments that the Labor Party made are apparently going to be disallowed in the Senate because they decided they could. They have got about eight days left of their Senate majority and they are going to wreck that measure as well. Why? Do they have an alternative that they have any hope of putting in place? No. They are doing it just because they can spoil and be vandals, not because they have a constructive alternative or any policy outcome capable of being achieved. By seeking to undermine these measures, they are going to delay and vandalise the budget to prevent the government from delivering on its election commitments and from governing in an economically conservative way.
Despite what Senator Ellison indicated, some of these measures will cost the Australian taxpayer. The delay will cost us millions of dollars. There will be consequences and a loss of revenue from this delay. There will be $220-odd million that the Australian government will not be able to collect as a result of the opposition’s actions. We will nail the opposition with the price of this. They are going to vandalise the budget by using their numbers to prevent the collection of that revenue. Their leisurely consideration will come at a cost, at last count, of about $220 million to Australian taxpayers. But the position changes so quickly so I cannot be authoritative on this; it was $300 million earlier in the week but it is now down to $220
million. With the dentistry measures they
are going to oppose, it may have gone up again.
I do not know what their position on the bill is. All I know is what their position on process and procedure is. If you ask them where they stand on any of the great issues in Australian politics, they cannot tell you. They are all over the place. I look forward to the opposition senators contributing to the debate because we will then hopefully know where they stand on the condensate bill, on same-sex relationships, on the Commonwealth electoral amendment to make political donations more transparent, and on the increase in the luxury car tax. Are they going to support the luxury car tax increase or are they going to oppose it? I have no idea; they are hiding behind process—they are unable to say and need to look at it longer. They have had six weeks, including estimates. They have had ample opportunity.
These are not questions of broad public policy. These are small amendments to existing taxation revenue measures.
—If they are so small, how can they be vandalising?
—Because they are very important economically. This is not for some important broad social or economic policy like the Telstra bills, which I recall the Liberal opposition, when in government, rushed through with a one-day inquiry and with two-days notice. So, to be lectured by Senator Ellison on Senate process and proper behaviour is obscene, given their performance when in government.
We in the Labor government support the right of the Senate to examine policy issues contained in legislation. We support the role of the committees and we will continue to do that. But the debate today is about the government’s budget; it is about normal process and whether the recently defeated opposition are going to allow the government to deliver its budget. The weight is now on the opposition. They actually have to say what they stand for, if they stand for anything at all. They cannot hide behind process. They can have these bills referred and brought back next week if there are serious issues they want to examine. But these are not issues of wide application or broad public policy. They are very specific measures that, if you like, are much more narrow than some of the measures they have agreed to consider and bring back next week.
This is all about political vandalism and their inability to cope with the responsibilities of opposition. The Liberal Party are in a mess all over the country. They may make themselves relevant at some time down the track, but we do not have to worry. But they are relevant today because they are trying to destroy the budget and undermine the economic strategy of the government of this country.
It is an absolute irony of this chamber that the coalition come into this chamber and say: ‘Oh, no, we need to follow all these processes that we absolutely refused to apply when in government. We are going to apply them to the nth degree and drag them out for as long as we can to deny the government revenue and the capacity to deliver on its budget.’ But they will not do this on measures that they are opposed to; it is on measures they have not quite made up their minds about yet. They have not had enough time to work out whether they support or oppose the budget so they are going to drag it out until September, denying $220 million of revenue to the Australian government at the expense of taxpayers, while they decide whether or not they have got an opinion.
They have got a chance to have an opinion and do their jobs by voting in the Senate. They have got a chance to consider the legislation that is before them, which they have known about for six weeks.
—You have said the same thing a hundred times. Add something new to the debate!
—Senator Abetz, I have listened to you for years saying how terrible it will be if the Greens have the balance of power; how awful it would be to hand over to the Greens, to the Democrats or to the Independents the capacity to influence legislation and to hold the balance. And what are you doing today? You are saying, ‘We will defer these measures until we lose the numbers. Then we will leave it to the Greens and the Independents’—sorry, Senator Bartlett, not the Democrats, because they will no longer be with us. The great irony is that the opposition are so confused, so lost, so without direction and are such a rabble that they have decided to hand the decision to the Greens. They are saying: ‘We could vote on this now, but it is too hard. We are so confused, so divided, so lost and so lacking in any political courage that we are going to let the new Senate deal with it—the Senate where we do not have the majority.’ It is a cop-out. It is political cowardice at its worst. You can defend some of this behaviour on the basis that they have had a crushing electoral defeat, that they have a leader who is making no impression with the people of this country and that they are a dispirited rabble. But they have got to the position of making the decision—it is a strategy and Senator Abetz was no doubt part of this cunning plan—and they have said: ‘We will give up our right to make a decision on the budget. We will hand it over to the Greens, Senator Fielding and Senator Xenophon.’
—They’ve seen the light!
—They have obviously seen the light, Senator Siewert, because this is certainly a change in their position. Senator Abetz and others have railed against you having the power to decide these things for years. But, somehow, now it is kind of convenient, because they want to run and hide. They do not want to take responsibility. What they want to do is hide behind process. They want to say: ‘We need to look at this for much longer. We have had six weeks, but we haven’t got a position yet and we would kind of like it if, when we come back, somebody else has to wear it. Senator Fielding is the swing vote. He will get to wear this. We can sort of oppose it but not have to carry the public criticism of our position. We could probably safely oppose it in July and August because Senator Fielding and the Greens will wear the criticism.’ What cowardice! What an absolute abrogation of your responsibilities.
This Senate has the capacity to debate—and pass or defeat—the government’s budget bills this fortnight in accordance with the normal process. It has the capacity to have short committee inquiries, as has been recommended by the opposition, into a number of matters that could be extended into the other bills in the motions before us. But the political cowardice of the opposition does not allow them to do that. They are going to try to run and hide. You cannot run and you cannot hide. You have to front up in this Senate and answer questions. Do you support these measures or not? Are you in favour of removing the exemption on the excise on condensate or not? Are you in favour of increasing the luxury car tax or not?
—I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 196. It appears as though the honourable senator was given one paragraph to read out. I think he is now on the 26th—
 (Senator Marshall)—What is your point of order, Senator Abetz?
—version of the same paragraph. It is tedious.
—There is no point of order. Resume your seat, Senator Abetz.

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—Senator Abetz, resume your seat.
—I think that just confirms my earlier analysis.
—You are tedious and repetitious; that is right.
—Senator Abetz, you have, if you have the moral and political courage, the opportunity to vote on the government’s budget this fortnight. It is your chance to put up or shut up. You can hide behind process, but you will be found. There is nowhere for you to hide. Your political position now is to say, ‘Let’s defer it and hope the Greens and the Independents make the right decision.’ That is your political decision. I have never seen anything as cowardly in all my time in the Senate. You have the chance to deal with the legislation. Senator Minchin invited me to come to him and work with the opposition on the passage of legislation through this place. I have made that point to my colleagues. That ought to be one of the things we first look at. Well, here is your chance. Here is your chance to support the right of a government to deliver on its budget. Here is your chance to ensure that the budget strategy of the government is not undermined. Take your opportunity, Senator Abetz and the opposition, and show you have some political courage. Do not try and hide behind process, because you have been exposed.

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—Order! Senator Abetz!
—In addition to all of the budget bills—

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—You can’t take it, can you?
—I rise on a point of order. Mr Acting Deputy President, you are quite right to chide me for interjecting. But when you allow the Leader of the Government in the Senate to personally address me non-stop—
—What is your point of order? Are you dissenting from my ruling, Senator Abetz? What is your point of order, Senator Abetz?
—If I can get the point of order out, you might hear it. What I am inviting you to do is to require the Leader of the Government in the Senate to abide by standing orders and not address senators directly across the chamber, because, when he does that in this thuggish, arrogant way—guess what?—I am tempted to interject.
—Senator Abetz, resume your seat. Senator Abetz, you have been consistently speaking directly to the Leader of the Government in the Senate—
—As a result—
—No, not ‘as a result’.
—Check the Hansard.
—They have been tedious and repetitious interjections. If you refrain from interjecting—
—Be very careful, Chair.
—If you refrain from interjecting—
—Be very careful.
—I beg your pardon, Senator Abetz?
—I am inviting you to be careful.
—Yes, well, thank you, Senator Abetz. I do not need your advice. If you would cease interjecting, I will ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate to direct all his comments through the chair.
—Thank you. I accept that I should do so. This is, as I said, a very important debate. It is important that the budget is delivered. It is important that the government of the day is allowed to deliver on its election commitments. The opposition have to answer the question: what gives them the right to deny the government the ability to deliver on its election promises? They were defeated at the last election for two reasons: (1) because the public lost faith in them because they failed to deliver on the promises they made to the electorate and (2) because of their abuse of their Senate majority. Here we are, within six months of the election, and they are seeking to carry out those two things that hurt them most at the last election.
All the government is asking for is the capacity to pass its budget. We accept the reference of matters of interest to Senate committees, but we ask the Senate to allow them to be returned in time for the bills to be debated and voted on by the end of this last sitting fortnight. It is the same process that has always applied to the budget. The opposition have had more than enough time to consider the bills. What they have not been able to do is find a position. They are so internally divided that they cannot work out what to do. They think that, by hiding behind Senate process, somehow it will all be resolved for them.
The bottom line is that it is economic vandalism. It is action that reeks of arrogance and reeks of the despair, disunity and weakness that the opposition are showing. It is important that the government gets its budget bills through. We urge the Senate to allow the government to pass its budget bills and not to hide behind process. Proper consideration can be given to bills, but let’s not hide behind process. Let’s debate the bills and vote on them. Let’s have some political courage from the opposition. We ask them to support the budget bills and ensure that this government is allowed to deliver on its election commitments and pass its budget.",SENATE,<title>SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS (EQUAL TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH LAWS—SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Referral to Committees</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-06-17,"—As senators would know and as Senator Evans reflected on briefly, this is my final fortnight in this chamber. I have been working in and immersed in the Senate for 18 years, as an adviser and then as a senator. In some ways it is nice that, even after 18 years of seeing everything that gets thrown up in this chamber, one can still be surprised by the level of absolute, bare-faced, extraordinary hypocrisy being put forward by the coalition here. After seeing all the things that get put forward for political reasons with the most ludicrous propositions being used to justify decisions and actions that are clearly politically driven, this is something that still leaves me breathless. I guess in some ways it is nice to not be so drenched in cynicism that I can still be surprised, or maybe the coalition are so creative that they can still find new ways to absolutely dredge the depths of debauchment of democratic process, weasel words and two-faced positions. The sorts of justifications that are being put forward by the coalition in regard to at least some of this legislation is nonetheless a disgrace and an insult to intelligence.
We are dealing with a whole lot of committee references cognately here and some of them are justified. I would certainly ask that we get to vote on some of them separately at the end, because clearly some of them are justified and appropriate but, frankly, some are ludicrous. Some of the suggestions that are being put forward to justify what is being done are completely offensive. We had some statistics from Senator Ellison saying that, when they controlled the Senate for the first year, they referred more bills than anybody else ever did—another wonderful example for those who like to catalogue lies, damned lies and statistics. It was a debauchment of process that the coalition used their Senate majority to block inquiry after inquiry into a whole range of areas at the same time they were bulldozing through other inquiries, which were sometimes into extraordinarily complex pieces of legislation, with a one-week turnaround.
Indeed, I can still recall another area where initially my breath was taken away with the audacity of the position being put forward. The coalition, when in government, would come along to the Selection of Bills Committee, which is the process used to consider whether or not to refer bills to a committee, and refer their own bills to committee before the bills had even appeared with a requirement that they report back, in some cases, by the next week. The committee was getting a bill that actually did not yet exist. I can recall being on Senate committee inquiries—and I am sure you can as well, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall—where the committee would get a bill and would be sitting there asking: why are we looking into this? Who has got an interest? What is the issue of concern? There were no answers; the government were just bulldozing them all through like a sausage machine to try and use these debauched non-inquiries as a way of ensuring that their legislation got pushed through as quickly as possible.
It is also a sick irony that, after all the years of listening to the coalition whingeing about a hostile Senate and about how the government of the day could not get on with its program because issues were being examined by Senate committees, which the Democrats and the crossbenches often quite rightly insisted on, and after the coalition went so far as to block inquiry after inquiry when they had a majority, we are now getting this mantra about how we need proper accountability. We have seen it already of course. After no Senate select committees were put in place to examine specific issues at all over the last couple of years, three or four were put forward with coalition chairs and coalition majorities in the first week or two that we got back here after the election.
I will leave the argument about the potential budget impact to others to make. That is something that the government is much more aware of than I would be. Frankly, I think there are different arguments that can be made about some of the budget bills, but to me the major issues relate to the referral of bills that do not have anything to do with the budget. I think some of them are being sent off for longer than they need to be.
There is one other component of these motions that I must say again I find interesting and which I do not recall having seen before, despite my 18 years of experience. A whole range of bills are being sent off for August reporting dates, or September for the Fuelwatch bill, containing the wording not that the committee report by a set date, but that the committee not report before that date. Quite what that means, I am not sure. It is quite an interesting innovation whereby, even if the committee examines the matter, decides it has all it needs to look at and finishes its deliberations, according to this motion it is still not allowed to report before the date that the coalition is insisting on. I am not sure how that fits in terms of standing orders and it looks like a fairly curious innovation to me. If anything, it looks like another example of the coalition’s absolute insistence on forcing it off for as long as possible and refusing point-blank to allow the committee to report back any earlier, even if it has finished its job. Presumably the coalition will cover its ears, chant noisily and do everything possible to refuse to examine these issues, even if the committee has finished its job before the date that is set forward. It is interesting that that wording is not used for the ones that are reporting back next week; it is simply for the ones that are reporting back in August. The committees are being prevented, at least in theory, from being able to report back earlier, even if they decide that is valid.
One thing that particularly astonishes and appals me is the suggestion that the legislation dealing with political donations should not report back until June 2009—more than 12 months away. I know it is nice to be thorough, but need we take 12 months to examine an issue that is not that complicated? What is in the bill has also been dealt with before by previous Senate committee inquiries: the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has dealt with it in the broad, and other committees have examined the whole issue of electoral donations in narrower contexts. To try and make any sort of argument that that issue cannot be dealt with on its merits in isolation outside of the entire electoral matters committee inquiry into the last election is an insult to the intelligence. That is fine when you have the numbers in this place; you can insult everybody’s intelligence—the numbers are the numbers and you can bulldoze things through or block things as you desire. But do not think that it is just the intelligence of other senators that you are insulting. You are insulting the public’s intelligence. That sort of argument is simply ludicrous; it is farcical. And to apply it to try and prevent, for over a year, debate on legislation dealing with political donations is clearly just a matter of naked political self-interest, and it will be seen as such and should be condemned as such.
Having said that, the opposition go one step further in regard to one other piece of legislation. The electoral matters bill, the political donations bill, they sent off for a year, with the report not due until 2009. But the bill relating to superannuation entitlements for people in same-sex relationships who have public sector superannuation, they are sending off, potentially, forever. It is quite an amazing reference: they are sending off the bill for the committee to inquire into and report on, but the committee is not actually allowed to conclude its inquiry into that bill and report back on it until it has looked at any other related bills that might be introduced down the track to give effect to the recommendations of a human rights commission report. Who is going to determine whether or not every single bill that is ever going to appear in regard to a recommendation from that report has appeared? Is it going to be the committee? Is it going to be the Senate? It is not stated. What we have is an open-ended inquiry—one, potentially, going on into the never-never—that is not able, according to this form of words, to report back until every related bill that may ever be introduced has also been examined. How farcical! How disgraceful, particularly when it is on a basic matter of justice, and particularly on a matter which, the coalition would have us believe—Senator Ellison’s own words would have us believe—they support in principle. Do not be so ludicrous. If you support that matter in principle, you would not send it off to a Senate committee to inquire into but never report on. It is simply a disgrace.
Adding to the disgrace is the history of this legislation and the issue involved. The Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—Superannuation) Bill 2008 deals with a matter that has been examined time and time again by Senate committee inquiries. It was examined as part of a general, wide-ranging inquiry that was reported on to this chamber back in 1997. It was examined as part of a Senate Select Committee on Superannuation inquiry into work patterns in the mid-1990s. It was examined again by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, specifically in regard to another private senator’s bill, in 2000. The legislation of the Democrats that specifically aimed to address this matter has been debated in this chamber on at least one occasion, if not more, as have many individual amendments specifically relating to superannuation. The issue was examined specifically in relation to superannuation by a Senate committee as part of inquiries into the government’s superannuation laws and the superannuation choice laws in early 2000. The government, with the support of the Democrats, passed legislation containing similar measures to what is in this bill, in regard to personal superannuation, through this chamber. Yet we have Senator Ellison saying: ‘We cannot deal with this single bill in isolation from all these other measures, even though we support it in principle, because it would be irresponsible, because it requires careful scrutiny.’ How much more careful scrutiny do you need?
You were able to deal with a one-off piece of legislation that dealt with superannuation and issues relating to same-sex couples and interdependence on its own, in isolation, with the support of the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Howard. I had a joint press conference with Mr Howard out in his courtyard when I was leader of the Democrats, it was so important to him. It was the only time I ever had a joint press conference with Mr Howard in his courtyard. It was with regard to the superannuation choice legislation, which contained measures specifically enabling people in same-sex relationships to have equal rights—the same issue that is contained in this legislation. Five years later, you want to come in and say, ‘It would be irresponsible to deal with that in isolation, and we cannot pass it—we cannot even report on it—until every other piece of legislation that might appear, ever, at any time in the future, has appeared.’ Do not even try to suggest that you can make any sort of argument like that with any sort of integrity.
To cap it all off, last year this chamber considered a proposal by me to review a piece of legislation that would implement the recommendations of the human rights commission inquiry—the very report that you now say has to be examined in extensive detail, potentially forever. And that proposal, to examine a piece of legislation that would give effect to the recommendations of that report, you blocked. You stopped it being looked at, at all—not even in a one-week inquiry. Why? What was the pathetic, dishonest, dishonourable excuse you gave at the time? It was: ‘It has already been inquired into. We do not even need to look at it because it has already been looked at.’ You make me sick.
But what makes me even more sick is that people have been waiting for this injustice concerning superannuation and same-sex couples to be rectified for a long time and, year after year, they have had to listen to weasel words like ‘we support it in principle.’ Mr Howard said that he supported it in principle back in 2005. I wrote to him then and said: ‘We’ll cooperate. Anything you want, we’ll put it through.’ There was nothing. No action, no inquiry, no legislation—nothing. The coalition cabinet debated legislation concerning same-sex partnerships before the last election, and they refused to act on it when they could have. The current government proposes to act on one part of the issue which, according to the majority view, the coalition actually support but now want to send off to a committee with no reporting date. It is disgusting.
I, and also on behalf of Senator Nettle, who has worked on this issue over the years, propose to move an amendment that has been circulated in the chamber. The amendment seeks to rectify the flaw that I identified in the coalition’s notice of motion No. 6—namely, a reporting date. My motion provides a reporting date of 24 June, which is only next week. As government speakers themselves said last year, this issue has already been inquired into extensively; it was looked into only last year. The government’s legislation deals with only one part of this issue—public sector superannuation. That is clearly self-contained, as anybody who has been examining the issue for any time would know. So, frankly, one week is ample. One week is all that is being proposed by the coalition to look into the budget measure bills that deal with changes to the baby bonus eligibility, the family tax benefit, the Commonwealth seniors health card and the eligible age for partner service pension. The coalition can do all of that in a week, apparently. Therefore, I am quite sure that they could deal with this piece of legislation in a week—and that is what should happen. I, and also on behalf of Senator Nettle, move:
At the end of subparagraph (1)(a), add “by June 24, 2008”.
Omit paragraph (2).
It makes me angry to be treated like an idiot. Part and parcel of being in this chamber is that you have to listen to people give laughable excuses and then they expect you to take them seriously. To some extent, that is part of what happens in politics. I appreciate all of that. I am not trying to be high and mighty about these things, but this is an issue of injustice and it is a very serious injustice. As I have said, over a long period, it has been identified time and time again in a range of Senate committee reports. To use such facile excuses to delay justice once again, potentially indefinitely, is not only unjust—obviously—but extremely hurtful to a lot of people. Many people have been waiting for this injustice to be rectified for a long time. One of the reasons that it is time-critical, apart from the fact the bill has a 1 July start-up date—although, that can be changed—is that injustices come into effect in this area particularly when a person’s partner dies. That time is often very distressing to people. To have that distress compounded by this ongoing injustice is, I think, unconscionable.
People recognise that occasionally things take a while, but excuses are being used to indefinitely delay the implementation of measures that have a big impact on people. Those people whose partner dies between 1 July and however long this legislation is delayed for will bear the brunt of this political gutlessness. That is what is at play here. If anyone can make a good argument for what is being done here, I would like to hear it. You can say that this is to allow proper consideration and prevent anomalies—I have heard those sorts of excuses many times when I have moved amendments in this place—but what you are really doing is pandering to bigots. That is bad enough but, when people have to suffer injustice as a consequence of that, it is acceptable. When my amendment comes to a vote, I urge everyone to give it special consideration, because there will be a direct personal impact in what you do.",SENATE,<title>SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS (EQUAL TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH LAWS—SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Referral to Committees</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-06-17,"—The government has built a budget surplus of $22 billion to fight inflation and put downward pressure on interest rates. With these referrals, the Liberals are threatening the surplus. This is the surplus Australia needs if we are to fight the inflation that we inherited. We have to ensure that we put maximum downward pressure on interest rates, and the Reserve Bank board minutes released earlier today are a stark reminder of that. They reveal that inflation remains a key challenge. The minutes state that, over the past year, inflation has picked up at an uncomfortably high rate against a background of limited spare capacity and earlier strong growth in demand. The minutes also highlighted the role of the government’s strong surplus in fighting inflation.
The actions of the Liberal Party in this referral are clearly irresponsible. They are using, without good reason, their numbers in the Senate to delay key revenue measures in the budget. The bill contains straightforward measures that need to be passed by 30 June to ensure their implementation. These are not novel pieces of legislation. These are not grand policy initiatives. These are budget bills. The details can be considered either in a committee on Friday or in the Senate during the committee stage. That is the process that has been adopted in the past. We have a May budget, which means that implementation dates are from 1 July.
In opposition, the Labor Party had to deal with legislation in the time available. We came to a conclusion on the bills. We did not send them off to the never-never. We took the responsibility that opposition provided to hold the government to account for decisions in their budget. We dissected their budgets. We considered again the measures that we opposed, and we supported those measures that were beneficial. We did that so that the then government could implement their measures by 1 July. The May budget provided a time frame for us.
In this instance, this government wants its budget to be passed so that those matters can be implemented by 1 July. From what the opposition have said, you could really say that they are playing politics with it, but the truth is that they are ditherers. They are dithering about these 13 bills—not one bill, not two bills, but 13 bills. They cannot come to a concluded view about what their position is on these bills. The Liberals would rather play politics with the condensate bill. They would rather that those who can afford luxury vehicles not play a role in fighting against inflation. There is now a real threat to the inflation-fighting surplus. Those opposite, the Liberal Party, are delaying, perhaps even planning to oppose, several measures, but we do not know about that. They cannot find the gumption to come to a concluded view to inform the Senate what their position is on these bills. In fact, if the budget measures of these bills are not passed by 1 July, the next chance they will have is in early September. But the budget has to be passed. It should be passed. The first Rudd Labor government’s budget should be passed so that those matters contained in the budget measures can be implemented by 1 July.
The Treasury estimates the cost of delay that those measures will see at $284 million, and that will come directly off the budget surplus. You would think, from the way the opposition are behaving, that they do not care—that they do not care about working families, do not care about working Australians, do not care about those who are doing it tough in the community—because they do not want to assist this government in putting maximum downward pressure on inflation. They do not want to see those working families, those working Australians, those that are doing it tough, try to get the benefit of these budget measures.
It is time that the Liberals stopped using the Senate process to defer their responsibilities. The internal party tensions—I suspect—over leadership should not spill into this chamber. They are hiding behind the Senate processes now. It is irresponsible. They should not be doing it. They are delaying consideration of legislation at the expense of the Australian community. The reality is that the opposition have sent three bills to committee for Friday. It is within their ability to send bills to be dealt with by a committee on Friday if they think there are measures that require inquiry or that they wish to explore further. That is the opportunity that we have adopted in the past. We have met those challenges in the time available to ensure that the Senate can perform its function of scrutinising legislation but also meet budget considerations such as implementation dates of 1 July.
Of course, the Liberals could have treated all the bills in that way, or they could have actually come to a concluded view on some of them and informed the Australian public what their views about these bills are rather than hiding behind them. In fact, they are now doing a curious thing. By delaying, they are clearly handing over the responsibility to a future Senate that they do not have a majority in. They do not want to exercise the control that they have exercised in the past. It is curious because in the past they did exercise control—badly, I think. They used this place as a sausage machine. They processed bills through it. They used Fridays for committees. They had one-day inquiries. They referred all bills, whether they needed scrutiny or not, to committees to jump up their numbers, quite irresponsibly, to make sure that they could then come into this place and argue, if they had a mind to, that they were being responsible and ensuring that the Senate processes were being dealt with. It was a farce. What they were really doing was using the Senate as a sausage machine.
In opposition, they cannot let go of the reins. They cannot accept that the government of the day should have its budget dealt with appropriately by this Senate and the bills passed so that matters can proceed. Of course, when the opposition were exercising their numbers, they did not have regard to the matters that Senator Ellison talked about today. They did not have regard to the due processes that the Senate has. They had regard to the stark political reality that numbers win. That is what they had regard to. What they do not accept is this: they pretend to hide behind the process, but it is a fig leaf. What they are doing is transparent. The Australian public will judge them adversely for this role that they now play.
Senator Bartlett makes a very good point about the same-sex couples bill. It is a point that is worth reiterating: the essence of the subject matter of that bill has been dealt with many, many times in this place. The government has decided, according to its election commitments, to meet those commitments, but the opposition have decided to refer the bill off to the never-never. One questions the referral in itself, in that by referring it they have said ultimately that it will be referred contingent upon some unknown future event. One wonders whether it is in truth a deferral rather than a referral. In my view, it is a deferral because it is not contingent upon some known fact that we can ascertain so that the bill can be dealt with in truth.
The opposition should be reminded that they need to consider how these matters are dealt with and dealt with appropriately. The Rudd government recognises that working families, those people in the community who are doing it tough, need the inflation pressures alleviated. Let us look at what the opposition have done. When they got to opposition—if that is a better way of phrasing it—they immediately put in four select committees to deal with matters that they wanted to scrutinise—matters that they wanted to reflect upon, examine and inquire into. Here, they can pass the bills. They could refer these matters off to committee to have a look at their substance if they were really concerned about them. It is not necessary for them to take the role of simply deferring these measures. If they want to maintain an opposition’s role of being accountable, to scrutinise the government’s actions—
