"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,2000-04-03,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Report 30: Treaties tabled on 8 and 9 December 1999 and 15 February 2000, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The report I have just tabled contains the findings of the treaties committee's review of four proposed treaty actions and two treaties that have already taken effect. The proposed treaty actions are the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, a scientific and technological cooperation agreement with Korea, an agreement to establish the International Development Law Institute and a denunciation of the Convention on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface. The treaty actions that have already taken effect are a series of amendments to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals and the agreement between Australia and the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor on the continued operation of the Timor Gap Treaty. In this report we express our support for all six of these treaty actions.
Our accession to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification is perhaps the most significant of these agreements. This convention came into being in December 1996, and it has been the subject of lengthy debate in Australia. In June 1997 the former treaties committee gave some preliminary consideration to this convention. They concluded that considerable further consultation with the states and territories was required before the government should consider ratifying it. At the time there were concerns about the potential impact of the convention on land management responsibilities within Australia. This debate has continued to the point where all state and territory governments now accept that the convention does not require any changes to the federal division of land management responsibilities in Australia or to the land management policies or practices of any Australian government. The Commonwealth government has agreed to confirm this understanding by making a public statement at the time it ratifies the convention. To ensure there is no further confusion about this matter, to make things absolutely clear, we believe the government should submit its public statement to the Secretary-General of the United Nations with its instrument of ratification. Australia has considerable experience in dryland management, and the ratification of this convention will allow Australian expertise to be harnessed in tackling land degradation problems around the world.
The other particularly notable treaty action considered in this report is the agreement with the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor about the continued operation of the Timor Gap treaty. This treaty was negotiated with Indonesia in May 1990 to establish a regime for the joint development of the natural resources in the Timor Sea between Australia and East Timor. Following the Indonesian government's decision to transfer sovereignty in East Timor to the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor, it was plainly necessary to renegotiate the original agreement. Given the scale and potential of exploration and development activities to be undertaken in the Timor Gap and the pressing geopolitical and commercial time frames involved, the government exercised its right to take urgent action to implement this treaty before it was tabled in parliament. We have no quarrel with this decision—we do not quarrel with people often—and we note that, shortly after binding action was taken, a consortium of six companies committed itself to a $2.9 billion gas exploration program in the Timor Gap Zone of Cooperation. This program is expected to reap considerable rewards for the companies and the state, territory and national governments involved, including the emerging government of the newly independent East Timor.
I would like to conclude by thanking my colleagues for their continued diligence in reviewing proposed treaty actions. Few efforts among the committees of this parliament would equal that of the treaties committee—the amount of time and effort and the sheer brain power and sweat that is put into the consideration of these treaties. They come up in great numbers and, whilst we would not put down the efforts of any of our colleagues, I think it is about time we gave ourselves a bit of a pat on the back.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,0,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2000-04-03,"—I concur with the remarks made by the chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, the member for Wentworth. The latest report from the treaties committee contains a number of important issues. It might be noted that there is cross-party, unanimous support for the recommended actions, so I will not cover similar ground. I will restrict my comments to the migratory species treaty and the International Development Law Institute agreement. In both cases action has already been taken which binds Australia at international law to the terms of these treaties. The migratory species convention was established in 1979 to encourage the conservation of migratory species of wild animals and their habitat. The convention compels governments to take action individually or collectively to conserve and undertake research into species which migrate across and outside national boundaries. The convention also encourages member states to conclude regional agreements to conserve endangered species. At the moment 65 nations are members of the convention, 10 having acceded to this convention during 1999.
This treaty is seeking to add seven new species to the endangered species list and 31 new species to the list of animals in the unfavourable conservation status. Eight of the latter are of particular interest to Australia as they range through our territory, and they are the Indian Ocean bottle-nosed dolphin, nominated by Australia, six species of petrel, nominated by South Africa, and the wild shark nominated by the Philippines. The minister has previously advised the committee that the convention contains provisions that resulted in amendments agreed by all parties automatically coming into force within 90 days of the parties agreeing to the amendments. These were agreed to at a conference of parties at Cape Town in November 1999 and entered into force on 14 February 2000. It was decided not to conduct a full review but merely to assure ourselves of the reasons for the treaty actions and that their early entry into force was sound. The committee believes that the Bonn convention provided a valuable framework for worldwide efforts to conserve and protect migratory species of wild animals. The obligations are within our capacity as a nation and we hope that no action by the federal government will lessen the importance of the treaty system and its operation.
The other agreement for the establishment of the International Development Law Institute was done in Rome on 5 February 1988. The agreement and the institute are both already in operation. There are 14 countries who are party to this agreement. The IDLI has three main purposes: to encourage and facilitate the improvement of the use of legal resources in the development process, to encourage adherence to the rule of law in international transactions and to improve the negotiating capability of developing countries in the fields of development cooperation, foreign investment, international trade and other international transactions. It is in Australia's interests to become a member of the IDLI assembly and we would be in a position to directly contribute to the development of the IDLI priorities. All that the institute is offering is also consistent with Australian foreign policy, particularly in the field of economic law and good governance. It also helps us with the AusAID objectives. Accession to the agreement may benefit the Australian legal profession both financially and non-financially, as they have had a history of involvement with IDLI activities and are becoming increasingly involved with running training courses in the Asia-Pacific region.
It is ironic that we are assisting in the development of human rights through legal assistance from Australia through this IDLI while reneging on our own human rights with the nonsensical mandatory sentencing laws in the north and west of Australia. We are jeopardising our position as a forward thinking, modern democracy by some of the stands taken by the federal Liberal Party and its leader.
The committee is keen to see a regional office established in Australia. Although there are some reservations about supporting yet another international organisation based in Europe, a possible solution would be a regional office over here in Australia, as well as in Manila. It is important to help developing countries improve their legal and governmental systems and the aim of encouraging adherence to the rules of law is important in international transactions. The committee has decided that it was definitely in Australia's interests to be a party to this treaty and the other six treaties that we recommend in this report.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,0,1
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2000-04-03,"—I rise to speak to report 30 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and concur with the chairman's comments and also commend the chairman for his outstanding leadership of the committee. I wish to focus my remarks on section 5 of this report, which deals with the denunciation of the Convention on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface, 1952, or the Rome convention. Some 52 per cent of all aircraft taking off from Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport pass over my electorate, and my constituents take a special interest in the nature of this particular agreement. It is a little different from others, and we are denouncing a particular convention.
This convention, to which Australia has been a signatory for over 40 years, has failed in its primary objective, which has been the provision of uniformity in the compensation of the victims of damage caused by foreign aircraft. One in four of the member countries of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, are subject to this convention, which puts Australia at a significant disadvantage, even more so when one compares the safety standards of Ansett and Qantas with some overseas international carriers. This convention is not one to which countries are flocking to sign and ratify. It is largely seen as outdated, having been drafted to protect a developing aviation industry post World War II, which at the time comprised airlines that could not sustain sizeable payouts. In denouncing this convention, we follow other countries like Canada which have denounced the Rome convention for exactly the same reasons the Australian government's treaties committee recommends in this report.
The government believes that this convention lets airlines off too lightly with regard to their legal obligations to the victims of aviation accidents. A compensation limit of only $36 million is likely to be grossly insufficient should a large plane ever crash in an Australian metropolitan centre. Of course, the vulnerability of my own electorate makes us pay particular attention to this, and of course this convention, drafted at a time when we did not have the current round of jumbo jets flying regularly into Kingsford Smith. So it is particularly important that we are not party to the provisions of the old 1952 agreement, and both of our large carriers, Ansett and Qantas, support the treaties committee's decision on that.
Denunciation of this convention to the ICAO by the government brings into force the Damage by Aircraft Act 1999. This act replaces the Civil Aviation (Damage to Aircraft) Act 1958, through which Australia has complied with the Rome convention since 1959. So we are not just leaving it out there; we are bringing forward the Damage by Aircraft Act 1999 which substantially increases the penalties involved, and that is more appropriate in line with recommendations from Canada.
Following a six-month period following notification to the ICAO, it will be up to the courts to decide what level of compensation to innocent third parties on the ground suffering death, injury or property damage will be appropriate. As the member for an electorate in close proximity to Kingsford Smith, it is very clear that in one accident you could have hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to property alone, without considering the human loss, if a large aircraft did crash in that area. 
We are particularly pleased that the government has legislated in the meantime to stop damage by aircraft in one critical area in particular. Through the Air Navigation (Fuel Spillage) Regulations 1999, penalties have been set for the jettisoning of fuel during flight. In an emergency, air traffic control can give permission for fuel dumping over areas where such dumping would not create a hazard. If during inspection it is found that an aircraft will dump fuel, it can be grounded and also penalties of up to $13,750 will apply for any illegal release of fuel in flight. That has happened quite a number of times. The airline Evergreen has been caught on five occasions. People in my electorate are very sensitive to that.
I commend the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson, for his efforts in this regard and for his sensitivity to the issues. I also commend the government for bringing forward the legislation. I for one, as a member of this committee, am very pleased to see the government's legislation in this area.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,0,1
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2000-04-03,"—I am very pleased as always to rise in support of the tabling of yet another report from the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties—our 30th such document in a little under four years. It is probably, as committee work goes, some sort of record that has been set as far as the number of items we have looked at and reported to the parliament on.
It is always important to restate the general principles under which we are operating as a committee. The notion of `What's in it for Australia and why are we signing this?' is the raison d'etre of the committee on an everyday basis. At every particular juncture when we are inquiring into matters—be it something as controversial as the draft MIA through to review of the Convention on the Rights of the Child through to some of the more mundane and everyday matters—we are still, nevertheless, applying that same general criteria on behalf of all senators and members in this place and of course, through them, the people of Australia.
What is important to know on the tabling of this document today, though, is that, as a result of almost four years work, I believe the committee has achieved a change of culture amongst a lot of the government departments of this country. It is interesting to reflect upon some comments at this morning's hearings from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the level of consultation that they are now undertaking. The departmental official said to us this morning—and I think I am paraphrasing it correctly enough to report it to this place—that consultation now opens them up to a wider community opinion. 
The Department of Family and Community Services, who copped a fair old shellacking from the committee a few months ago because of their failure to consult, have learnt a valuable lesson. They are now saying that they have learnt a lot as to what they can gain from the consultation process, that they are now factoring consultation with the community into their long-term planning of their activities as a department and that consultation is now a matter of course. I think that is a tremendous thing that has occurred over the four short years of this committee being in existence, because it is important, as our laws are governed not just by what we aspire to in this nation but also by international linkages, that the people of Australia feel very comfortable with what is put before them as a result of treaties and other matters that are negotiated by people within the public sector on behalf of all Australians.
It is worth also reflecting on the 48-hour trip that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties took to New Zealand last week at the direct invitation of the New Zealand parliament and at their cost, I should add too, Mr Speaker. We thank your opposite number in the New Zealand parliament, the Speaker, the Hon. Jonathan Hunt, for his generosity in making it possible for eight of us to venture over. We found that the New Zealand parliamentarians are in fact in awe of the process that we have been undertaking as a committee.
Graham Kelly MP, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committee of that parliament, hosted the trip, but it was the conversations with a couple of distinguished jurists that stuck in my mind about just how important the processes are that the Australian parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Treaties undertakes. We spoke with the Rt Hon. Sir Kenneth Keith, a landmark jurist in New Zealand, and also the President of the New Zealand Law Commission, the Hon. Justice Baragwanath. He made an observation that is worth repeating here: that laws are being made more and more often overseas and that, whilst judges used to make their own assessments based on the local criterion of a particular nation's values and sets of laws, now all criterion are not exactly always local and, as a result, we can get some inconsistency between international agreements and local laws. That in itself justifies the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.
We have to maintain a deal of faith—or perhaps in a lot of instances restore faith—in key institutions in this country. The people of Australia must be comfortable with the laws that we create in this place and in state parliaments, because if people are not in support of the laws that are created they may find it impossible or at best difficult to adhere to them. So the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is proud of its record of exposing the processes of the bureaucracy that were in the past hidden. I think it is one of the great achievements of the Howard government to bring this process into place, but I must add that members on both sides of the chamber of all political parties and representatives in this place and in the Senate are very supportive of this consultation process, of this exposure process, brought about by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. 
—The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Does the member for Wentworth wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?
—I do. I move:
That the House take note of the report.
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted. 
—In accordance with standing order 102(b), the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting, and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,0,1

Attempting to do justice to the motion, debating the historic links between public education and democracy in Australia, is basically impossible in 10 minutes. For that reason I have relied heavily upon the works of two very important publications: firstly, an article by Associate Professor Alan Reid of the University of South Australia in Australian options May 1999 `Public education and Australian democracy' and, secondly, the watershed report by the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne The state of our state schools. I hope they understand my not attributing every phrase I have borrowed from the two publications due to the constraints of time. What is public education? According to the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne, public education is:
... a quality education system open to all, irrespective of social, economic, ethnic or religious background, which offers equal access to that knowledge and values which are widely shared in our society which enables society to draw upon the widest possible range of abilities in our population which prepares people for effective participation in a democratic society'. 
Public education grew with the rise of the modern democratic state. It has been both the expression and the guardian of democracy.
Public education may support neither the imposition nor the suppression of religious beliefs, political views, ways of life and so on.
Education is fundamental to citizenship. Schools have a special role in building social cohesion. What is democracy? According to Associate Professor Alan Reid, a democratic society needs a sense of community. He wrote:
A democratic society relies on the creation of shared and common values. A democratic society nurtures differences. Shared values and differences should be kept in healthy tension without one dominating or obliterating the other. A democracy requires a public and publics don't just happen; they are made. The institution of public education more than any other in our society is central to the making of democratic publics.
Public education has steered the majority of Australians for almost one hundred years towards a common national and civic identity.
This cannot be achieved when a schooling system is organised by division, separation and stratification.
People need to live out associations beyond the comfort zone of a narrow group.
Some people seem to have forgotten or taken for granted that Australian democracy was founded on the secular state. What has happened to public education? Until 20 years ago we had in Australia a first-class education system. Public education is now under stress. We have increased expenditure on non-government schools—not a bad thing—but at the expense of government schools, which is a very bad thing. We have placed unnecessary competition on both the public and the private systems. Schools have closed. Class sizes have increased. Curriculum has changed. Management systems have been revamped. Policies to rectify social and location disadvantage are being dismantled. And how is this for democracy? State governments are now averse to making available information which might be used by critics of its policies. Teachers and others employed by departments of education in this country are forbidden to comment upon government policies. Welcome to the modern Australian democracy.
What has happened to public policy in public education? Public education is a major prerequisite of a democratic society and is essential for the individual and common good. Until 20 years ago, the development and expansion of public education in this country was seen as a priority by successive governments of both sides of politics. State education was seen as the symbol and the means of national unity. 
But today we are confronted with a changed vision of education. Education is being marketised. Efficiency is supposedly increased. Management is supposedly increased. Responsibility for funding cutbacks pass from government to the school supposedly reducing political pressure. The impact on education and democracy is totally ignored. The application of market principles to education has the potential to destroy the public education system in this country. The subsequent detrimental impact on democratic processes in this nation may be far swifter than many people in this House are prepared to admit. 
While markets have an important role in our economic system, the rules of the market are insufficient for the government of a society. To set citizens in competition with each other, so that there are winners and losers in everything, is to undermine the development of community and hence democracy. To value education in purely financial terms is to seriously undervalue it. 
Much of education brings intrinsic rather than financial reward—a love of literature and the arts, enjoyment of sport for its own sake, respect for law and order and respect for the rights of others. These attributes enrich all our lives. There is no financial reward for that. To meet the needs of some in education at the expense of others is anti-democratic. To increase division, separation, stratification is anti-democratic. To encourage competition—laugh, laugh—between inadequately resourced schools will produce and is producing the alienation and resentment that fragments and threatens democracy. It is no mistake that depression now is the second biggest disease in this country and splits heart disease and cancer. The democratic purposes of schools are being impaired by various private purposes.
What happened to expenditure? The 1998-99 Commonwealth budget provided $2,243.7 million to non-government schools compared to $1,289.1 million for government schools. Today state and federal governments contribute an average of 75 per cent of running costs in non-government schools compared to 40 per cent in 1974. In some schools it is 90 per cent. Not surprisingly, the proportion of students in non-government schools has increased from just over 20 per cent in 1974 to over 30 per cent now.
Who are the opponents of public education? The opponents of public education argue for maximum choice. Privatising the public education system is very popular with some religious and ethnic groups who wish to transmit their particular culture to their children. But it comes at a cost. The social cost of privatising schools is increased inequalities for disabled children, rural children and children from poor socioeconomic areas. The weakening of national cohesion is a threat to democracy as we know it. The capacity of the public school system to be the major source of national unity, as it has been for the last century, is now being threatened.
If private and economic purposes are allowed to be determinants of education, democratic purposes cannot be achieved. In an environment where public education is privatised into stand-alone schools, the following questions should be asked: who will undertake the full educational task? Who will accept the social commitment to ensure that good quality education is available to all regardless of a capacity to pay, status, ability or location? Do we now accept the suppression of social solidarity and the normalisation of inequalities? It is extraordinary that the compassionate and democratic values that inspired public eduction to include all—no matter what their status, ability, capacity to pay or location—should now have to be defended and defended vigorously. But if we value democracy and education we must defend the right of all to be included in education.
Only a centralised public education system run by the state is able to achieve the democratic purposes of education because only the state can be inclusive of all students. The present public policy of emphasis on choice and denial of the need for resources for public education is just plain wrong. The government believes in blurring the divide between public and private schools. It has forgotten the damage done to public secondary education in the creation of the single comprehensive high school. Sameness is dangerous; diversity is safe. With the drift to private schools now actively rewarded by the federal government, so the diversity of public schools—and inevitably private schools—will diminish. This is what is forgotten: private schools are going down a very dangerous road which will harm them as well.

"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,2000-04-03,"—I rise to support the words of the motion moved by the honourable member for Port Adelaide, being `That this House acknowledges the historic links between public education and the development of democracy in Australia'. If I might, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will concentrate on two words. The first of those is `democracy'. Democracy means to me equality: equality before the law, equality of opportunity, equal treatment by all, freedom of religion, freedom of expression and freedom of association. All of these concepts are contained within our understanding of the word democracy. When I talk about public education, I speak about the mass education of all of our citizens, both young and old, and not in the finite descriptive terms of the member for Port Adelaide who talked about the differences between so-called private and so-called public.
In the 1800s Alexis de Tocqueville, the noted French philosopher and essayist, travelled from France to the United States and wrote several books as a result of his experiences, trying to come to grips with what this word democracy meant. The outcome of some of the writings of De Tocqueville was concern that, in that very early democratic country, transferring education from the elite, from the landed gentry, to the entire population—that is, making it universally available—would detract from the quality of education, reduce the numbers of brilliant thinkers in society and the numbers of those who really contributed to the advancement of society. De Tocqueville could not have been more wrong. It is demonstrable that the broad based education of the masses not only enhances democracy but in many cases leads to its very formation. We empower individuals by getting them to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to work with others and to contribute to the whole thing called society. Empowering the individual through the mind is what has opened up society and made this world so much greater in the last dying hours, days, weeks and months of the 20th century.
Young Australians have frequently shown a lack of interest in the institutions of government. They have shown, however, much greater interest in broader debates, such as debates on the so-called republic, on immigration and on reconciliation between Aborigines and the rest of Australian society. That is appropriate. I have noticed in my own electorate that there seems not to be a great emphasis on the structure of government, of our constitution and of our formal systems which allow us to practice democracy, and perhaps to our detriment. But nonetheless somehow we wind up with 18-year-olds becoming entitled to vote, going to polling stations and managing to inform themselves about the issues that are being debated around any election—be it local, state or federal—and voting according to their consciences. That is the point about democracy, and it also links in to education: without a good education, it would be impossible in these days of so many words and so much mass communication to be able to understand the issues if one were totally deficient in education.
Australia was one of the first countries to provide public education in the early 1900s. I believe that civics education actually started in schools in about 1901 and continued until the 1930s. In the early 1900s we moved to universal suffrage, and that meant everyone—firstly, every male in Australia and then, very soon, every female as well—had the right to vote. And we were one of the first countries in the world to give the vote to women. It is to Australia's great credit that these milestones and these achievements were made. That took away from those who were the landed gentry, from those with property rights, the sole right to determine how people lived their lives, where they lived them, and the outcomes for individuals.
This business of democracy is not very old, yet Australia, small in number though we are, has been at the forefront of democratic institutions since Federation—indeed since before—so that we have been able to give our citizens an understanding of what democracy means through mass education. I believe Australia is classified as one of the most radically democratic countries in the world as it has broad based democratic institutions which far exceed many and most other countries. Through the years we have instilled in Australians the idea that they should fight for their democratic way of life, and through a number of wars and other actions Australians have shown their valour and their determination to fight for their country and to fight for their fellow Australians, and they have died on battlefields to prove their belief in a democratic way of life.
I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that democracy is really a very fragile institution. If we do not continue to work at it constantly we run the risk of losing it. I remind honourable members that in Chile democracy was lost—it was displaced by a military dictatorship—and that only recently has it been won back again. Chileans are determined never, ever to lose their democratic institutions again.
Civics education is an important part of this process. In addition to education generally, I believe very strongly in civics education so that young people can come to an understanding of how our democratic institutions evolved and are written down, what they mean, what is the balance of power between various democratic institutions in Australia, and how those power balances are played out. In this place we argue between one side of the chamber and the other over detailed issues, but we have never argued that Australia is not a democratic country. 
In 1996 I had been sitting on the other side of this chamber for some six years, and, in April or May when we reassembled after the March 1996 election, I found it quite remarkable that those who had been sitting on this side moved over to the left side of the Speaker and we moved here. Not a gun was raised; no bullets were fired; no-one told people what to do. We simply went to our set places because that is what we knew was right and was expected. So the former Prime Minister was no longer Prime Minister and we had a new Prime Minister and a new government. It was democratically and freely and fairly done.
In the 1970s we again started to teach civics. It was a separate education subject in schools, generally known as politics. In the 1980s civics education re-emerged at a national level. It was highly likely that that came about because of the 1988 bicentennial celebrations which heightened interest in Australia's identity. Currently we have a program called Discovering Democracy, which is the latest attempt at civics education put in place by this government in 1997. It is different in the sense that it includes citizenship education activities. Not only does it educate students but it also educates adults as well. It is fundamental to the outcome of this program that not just the institutions of government themselves but also all the issues surrounding the institutions and the political issues that are alive and well in Australia at the current time are discussed within that program. This is fundamentally a part of the Australian ethos—that we are able to debate openly and freely all the concerns that we have as a free society.

"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2000-04-03,"—The denial of a permanent licence to Central Victorian Gospel Radio has generated a considerable amount of bad feeling in rural Victoria. This is demonstrated by the many thousands of people who signed the petition presented to this House on 13 March. Central Victorian Gospel Radio had been operating successfully in this region for 15 years, without relying on government assistance or support. It provided a 24-hour service, seven days a week. This service has now gone and a comparable service will not be offered by any of the other radio stations operating within central Victoria. Many people within the rural community feel that denying Central Victorian Gospel Radio a permanent licence will deny many Christians access to this outside contact, thereby denying them access to their religion. I refer to those people who are unable to attend church services for a variety of reasons and who look to these broadcasts as a substitute for attending those church services.
I would appreciate it if the minister would look into this matter personally to provide a solution to this present dilemma, bearing in mind that Central Victorian Gospel Radio ceased broadcasting on 31 March. This is just another example of another service being withdrawn from regional Australia, a service which is badly needed and which was appreciated by many thousands of people throughout central Victoria. I would urge the minister to intervene—he has that power under the act—and to make sure that there is another frequency available to allow these people to receive these broadcasts, which had been going on for some 15 years without a hitch.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Broadcasting: Central Victorian Gospel Radio</title>,Statements by Members,2,1

That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition from moving that government business order of the day No. 28, the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999, from the Senate be brought on forthwith.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-04-03,"—by leave—I move:
That this House censures the Prime Minister for:
(1) his betrayal of his 1996 pledge to govern “for all of us”, as well as his 1998 promise to commit himself “very genuinely to the cause of true reconciliation”; and
(2) his attempts to divide the Australian community, including on issues on indigenous affairs, for base political motives and to divert attention from the messes his Government has made of the GST and its implementation, nursing home standards and the future of Telstra.
It is not possible to comprehend the Prime Minister's reneging of his 1998 statement that this term of his office would be about true reconciliation for the centenary of Federation, his preparedness to accept that mandatory sentencing is wrong but to refuse to act on it after he himself has been party to actions both against the Northern Territory government legislation on one matter and in regard to legislation affecting the whole Commonwealth on another matter, and the leaking of this statement of the government and the content of this government's statement. It is impossible to comprehend why these things are out there in the public, this apparently hypocritical stance in relation to statements that he has made previously—and which he himself allegedly still believes, in the case of mandatory sentencing—unless you consider the political context of the times. The political context of the times is this. The government is facing a botching of a very unpopular tax where business in this country cannot get answers, where charity cannot get answers and where many in the community cannot get answers to the responsibilities that they face in regard to the reporting of this tax.
It is impossible to understand it unless you understand the fact that we have a mess in many areas of aged care policy that the public has tumbled to and the media is focusing on. It is not possible to understand it unless you comprehend how deeply divided and how extraordinarily difficult now the government is finding handling its Telstra privatisation agenda, so unpopular now in regional Australia now they have tumbled to it. Until you comprehend that political context, you cannot see the classic Textor wedge politics diversionary tactic which is being pursued now against the jobless, against the disabled, against supporting parents and against indigenous Australians. The problem is that in each one of those public policy areas there are serious matters of public policy to consider and for them to be made, instead of the object of great deliberation and great sensitivity, merely the argy-bargy of politics—which is the intention of this government—demeans this nation and is demeaning this nation internationally through no fault of ordinary Australians.
The Prime Minister is failing in his charter to uphold the dignity of ordinary Australians and to ensure that the reputation of this nation is whole in the international community and to ensure domestically that all Australians feel they are part of this nation, including the 250,000 long-term unemployed, including the one million disabled pensioners and supporting parents, including the 300,000 Aboriginals in this country and including the 40,000 or 50,000 in nursing homes. They are part of us, they are part of all of us, and because they are the most vulnerable they deserve the special attention of all of us.
The Prime Minister—in his best Uriah Heep mode—in the course of question time went through the process of, `I am all innocence; the opposition all evil on this. Take a look at this proposition and argue it in detail; say where you think that these things in our submission are factually wrong. Ignore the timing of the leak—ignore all these sorts of issues. Take at face value our redefinition of true reconciliation as practical reconciliation.' In other words, our pilot literacy programs amongst the Aboriginal community are enough to deal with the things of the spirit in Aboriginal hearts that are there as a result of that report—which has not been properly addressed by this government—and are there as a result of the belief that they are treated very unfairly in the legal system, and there are plenty of reports to demonstrate the consequences of that.
The Prime Minister invited us to make this report the answer to that deeply moving, highly detailed, highly factual report. Merely because a report moves the emotions and merely because a report strikes at the heart of our self-image and strikes at the deepest of our concerns does not mean it is not factually based. The case studies have names attached to them, Prime Minister. The batterings, the rapes and the appalling problems that were confronted with the collapse of identity, forcible removal from families and subsequent maltreatment all, in that report, have names attached to them, Prime Minister. There are statistics there and there are names. There is evidence. There is not, Prime Minister, evidence in your document. You chose to take an ABS statistic of 1994. I have news for you, Prime Minister: the statistics in the stolen generation report that you ignore postdate those. That particular set of ABS statistics dealt with the low end of the human rights committee's report on how many were actually affected. That low end is 10 per cent, but up to one-third in particular generations—because we are not in fact talking about one generation—went through that process of forcible removal.
Prime Minister, for your information, so that you may take this away and consider it, I will tell you what the Aboriginals most object to in your response to that highly detailed, evidence based report as opposed to the submission that your government has issued under your instructions and the personal supervision of your office. The propositions that they most object to are these. Firstly:
The proportion of separated Aboriginal children was no more than 10 per cent, including those who were not forcibly separated and those who were forcibly separated for good reason, as occurs under child welfare policies today. There was never a generation of stolen children.
Your Western Australian Liberal Premier—who can by no means be described as on the left of Aboriginal debate in this country—tells you your report is a nonsense, as he knows from his own studies. That is one that the Aboriginal population deeply object to. Let me go to another that they most deeply object to—and they object to the whole lot of this nonsense but these are the things that really hurt. I have gone through one of them. Another is:
The Commonwealth does not seek to defend or justify past policies and practices, but it does assert that the nature and intent of those events have been misrepresented and that the treatment of separated Aboriginal children was essentially lawful and benign in intent, and also reflected wider values applying to children of that era, as recorded in other recent official reports concerning illegitimacy, adoption, child welfare and institutional practices.
How could a report purportedly dealing with Aboriginal affairs of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s possibly arrive at the conclusion that it was simply an extension of other child welfare mechanisms that existed at that time? How could they possibly come to that conclusion?
There was a 1937 conference in which the various so-called protectors of the Aboriginals got together and said, `Our policy must be to remove'—what were described as, and I use their term—'half-caste Aboriginals from their parents to integrate them into the white community,' to ensure that they came up with white values and forgot their Aboriginality and, through time, would be blended out of the Aboriginal community. Ignoring the fact that the Aboriginal community does not make distinctions on racial grounds at all, they could confidently expect that over time the full-blooded Aboriginal community would die out.
That was reiterated in 1951 at various gatherings, and the policy fundamentally continued. Where else in the Australian community was there such a policy that a group of Australians should be bled out of their culture and some other set of human beings created as a result? Where else was there a section of the Australian community deliberately targeted because of their race? How could you, Prime Minister, say that you are in favour of true reconciliation when your office, which is responsible for overseeing the drafting of this response, could include those two paragraphs which have mortified and deeply offended Aboriginals who have been your interlocutors? Remember the comments, because you got up there talking about extremists. Lowitja O'Donoghue sat in your office and tried to cobble together with you what she would regard as an acceptable preamble. Aden Ridgeway did the same. The scales have fallen from their eyes. Why would two people who have extended such goodwill to you feel so utterly betrayed by you now? They approached you. They take you at face value. They take your protestations to their hearts. They believed you when they thought you were a man of reconciliation. They accepted your word and they, as have all Australians on so many other issues, have been fundamentally betrayed by you.
Just as all Australians have been betrayed with the never ever promise, just as all Australians were betrayed when told in the 1996 election that one-third privatisation of Telstra would do, just as all Australians were betrayed when told that you had an aged care policy that would guarantee there would be spot checks to ensure that ordinary Australians who found themselves in aged care accommodation were being fully and properly looked after—just as each one of them has been betrayed by you and your undertakings—so has the Aboriginal community on this matter.
Then we go to your position, Prime Minister, on mandatory sentencing and why the Aboriginal community is so worried about that issue. Let me just go through a couple of cases because in many ways the consequences of all this are happening all over again—now and in this generation. Let me just go through a couple of cases that have occurred with your complete indifference. A young Wurramarrba boy was sentenced to 28 days in prison. Locked up far away from home, he was found hanged in Darwin's Don Dale detention centre on 9 February 2000, only a couple of days before he was due to be released. His mother died when he was a baby, and his father died in a car accident a few years ago. The 15-year-old boy stole pens, pencils and liquid paper from the local community council offices in Groote Eylandt. Their value was less than $50. 
Another case from Darwin illustrates how absolutely unjust and inflexible those laws are. Matthew Bradley, a 17-year-old boy from Darwin, left prison on 15 July 1997 after serving 14 days imprisonment for stealing yoyos and computer games valued at $579 from a toyshop. The Darwin Magistrates' Court was told that Matthew was an above-average student at St John's College and a first offender who had paid full restitution for the thefts and damage. He had also apologised to the manager of the toyshop. In fact, Matthew had confessed to his father, who had taken him and the stolen objects to the police station. So Matthew did the right thing, showed genuine remorse, confessed to a crime that the police had no idea he had perpetrated—and society dealt with him for doing this by sending him to prison for 14 days. How many would tolerate that sort of treatment of our own sons?
But, because principally it is the Aboriginal community who is affected by it, there is no action. It was good enough to act to deal with the issue of euthanasia in the Northern Territory, it was good enough to act to support the position of the homosexual community in Tasmania—they were fully supported by the Prime Minister—but it is not good enough for this Prime Minister to act when it deals with the problem of those youngsters I have referred to. The Prime Minister wanted examples. I could give him examples a yard long, but I think those two will suffice to make the point. 
Those kids will go through the same process in their own minds—as so many did in that stolen generation before. It is the case that the issues we deal with in that stolen generation report do not deal with contemporary politics. That is the case. They do, however, deal with events in the lifetime of contemporary politicians—the Prime Minister and me—and, more important than that, our response to that report determines whether our fingerprints as a country are still on that document or whether they are wiped clean. That is the issue, Prime Minister, which is why that report requires more of a response than you have given it.
You are prepared to tolerate, Prime Minister, in this report a process whereby those who have been traumatised, those who have used the normal psychological effects that come with a suppressed memory, have teased out those memories and relived their trauma. They have done that through the process that you have chosen in your report by pointing them in the direction of actions in the courts to recover where they can demonstrate the sort of abuse that you deny effectively took place—or which you sought to paper over. You have challenged them to go out and do it. 
You think there is a risk to the taxpayer of some $4 billion, a considerable augmentation on your budget papers of $700 million. Why can't we in this country deal with this like the Canadians dealt with it? They had, I must say, a much worse problem than we did. Bad as our figures are, their figures were worse. They scooped up just about all of the native Americans living in Canada in their school system and created enormous trauma for them. Nobody debated in Canada whether or not there should be an apology. Once the royal commission revealed it, the apology was issued. Nobody debated in Canada whether or not there should be compensation. They did not send those native American kids, now very adult, through the court process; they arranged for an amount in compensation which they could access without legalities. They actually settled it quite modestly, not the multimillion dollar settlements that we see in damage cases in this country and elsewhere—the $100,000 settlements. They settled quite modestly in the same way as the Aboriginal community would settle here. They just want to be presented with some understanding and some degree of material recompense for what they have gone through. 
This, Prime Minister, is a major opportunity for you which you have spurned. This, Prime Minister, is a major opportunity for this nation which you have spurned. This would give a practical demonstration to the rest of the world that we are a mature enough society to handle these sorts of issues and to deal with them effectively. The Swiss government apologised to Romany victims of child removals. The Canadian government, as I said, apologised for the detention during World War II of Japanese Canadians. In 1993, the US Congress, in a joint House and Senate resolution, apologised to native Hawaiians on behalf of the US for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii 100 years earlier. The Norwegian King apologised for the injustices committed in the past against the Sami people by the Norwegian state through harsh policies of Norwegianisation. And I have already indicated what the Canadian government did for their indigenous communities. There is the opportunity here to deal with this problem and settle it once and for all. You will not settle it, Prime Minister, despite the fact that you seem to have got the language right when you talked about reconciliation, because you deny yourself an opportunity for wedge politics—wedge politics as far as our most vulnerable people, the most vulnerable element in our community, are concerned. 
It is important that the education needs of the Aboriginal community are met. I have to say that I do not believe $27 million over four years is going to do the job. It is important that their health issues are met. I would offer praise for any effort made in the health concerns of Aboriginals and their being met is a matter for the attention of government. But it is the things of the spirit, Prime Minister, which determine your dignity; it is the things of the spirit which give you a sense of confidence and that you have an equal share in the opportunities presented by this nation; and it is the things of the spirit that you deny this community, despite your promises to do otherwise with them. It is for those reasons, Prime Minister, that you should be censured by this House on this matter. This neglect by you is the reason why you should be censured by this House on this matter. This opportunism of yours is the reason why you should be censured by this House on this matter. (Time expired)

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2000-04-03,"—I, in a sense, thank the Leader of the Opposition. It is not normal that you thank the Leader of the Opposition for moving a motion of censure, but it does give me an opportunity in the course of the next quarter of an hour to expand on some of the things that I said at question time and to deal very sincerely with a difficult issue. The Leader of the Opposition said that things of the spirit mattered a great deal in our community. I agree with him. I agree with him that things of the spirit do matter a great deal. One of the things of the spirit is to have enough generosity to accept that you, no matter how strongly you might hold the view, do not have a monopoly of morality or a monopoly of decency when it comes to your approach to the less advantaged in our community. 
The thing that I think angers people on my side of the parliament more than anything else is not so much a disagreement on an issue, not so much that you might argue that there should be a formal national apology and we do not, not so much that you argue that there should be amendments to the native title legislation beyond what we have agreed and not so much that you should have a different view on whether we should override the state of Western Australia or the Northern Territory in relation to mandatory sentencing. They are legitimate areas of difference and debate. I have sat in this parliament for 25 years, and I have seen people on both sides of the parliament over the course of that 25 years, for good and proper reason, take different positions on different issues even though you may think those positions are inconsistent. My former leader Malcolm Fraser took a very strong position on the use of the external affairs power when it came to the construction of the Gordon below Franklin Dam in 1983. He stood on the principle of non-interference in a state matter, even though I know he personally was very sympathetic to the point of view being advanced by the environmental movement at that time. Of course, as the Leader of the Opposition points out, I supported, as he and many on both sides did in a free vote, the overturning of the Northern Territory euthanasia legislation. I would distinguish that from just about every single issue that has come before—
—Why? 
—I will tell you why I would distinguish it. Because if it had been carried it would have established a new moral paradigm in this country. 
—And this doesn't? 
—Just a moment.
—The Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence and exactly the same courtesy will be extended to the Prime Minister.
—I listened carefully to what your bloke had to say. If you want to stay here, give me the same courtesy, because this is a serious issue and it ought to be debated. I supported the overruling on that occasion, and I did it for the very simple reason that if we had not done that we would have established a new moral paradigm in Australia, a law that could have been taken advantage of by every citizen in the country. I took the view that if in an area like that we were going to establish a new moral paradigm then that ought to be something that was resolved by the representatives of all of the Australian people, not the representatives of 140,000 Australian people. 
These are issues on which we can passionately hold different points of view. But may I say with the greatest of respect to the Leader of the Opposition, who I know feels deeply about many issues, as do I, that the thing we on this side of the House find completely unacceptable is the moral unction with which the Labor Party approach so many of these issues, the idea that the Australian Labor Party would argue that they alone have a monopoly of compassion on these issues.
The Leader of the Opposition berated me during the last few minutes of his speech about our handling of the whole question of compensation for indigenous people. Does he remember that, in 1995 when the then Keating government was contesting the claim of Kruger in the High Court of Australia, the Keating government, through the Attorney-General, put a submission to the High Court of Australia which said, inter alia:
In the event that the Commonwealth is found to have been in breach of any of the constitutional rights, guarantees, immunities, freedoms or provisions of the Constitution as alleged by the Plaintiffs, the Commonwealth denies that any such breach gives rise to a personal right of action for damages in the Plaintiffs independent of any common law action.
In other words, he was inviting by using the words `independent of any common law action' those plaintiffs to do the very thing you are now condemning me for doing. That is what you were doing when you were in government, just as the Leader of the Opposition had one view on Telstra when he was in government and a different view now that he is opposition.
—I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.
—So it is that he had one view when he was a member of the Keating government in 1995 and a completely opposite view now that he is in opposition. Some may call it by a word starting with `h'. I wonder what that is. That characteristic does not of course stop there. He ignores the fact that the New South Wales government led by the most successful Labor politician in Australia at the present time fiercely contested a claim for liability by somebody who was forcibly removed from her family before the courts of New South Wales in exactly the same attitude. The exact same attitude was being taken. That person—I think her name was Joy Williams—was put to strict proof of everything. I do not remember the Leader of the Opposition getting up, getting on the phone and saying, `Bob, this is your moment of destiny. You can cure all of this by settling up.' Of course he did not do that. Once again, the Leader of the Opposition has demonstrated a degree of—how shall we put it?—walking both sides of the street, on this occasion, at a different time.
This censure motion moved by Leader of the Opposition is driven by the publicity that followed the publication in the press on Saturday morning of the submission presented by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to a Senate committee. I remind the House and the Leader of the Opposition that we did not seek to orchestrate the presentation of this document. As far as I am concerned, the Senate committee requested the submission. The submission was prepared in the ordinary course of events through the department. It was cleared through the minister's office and other appropriate offices and presented to the Senate. The idea that we set out on some divisive expedition in order to win for ourselves all the newspaper headlines that I saw this morning defies imagination. I love those headlines—they are fantastic. You have somebody in the Daily Telegraph saying `Howard denies stolen generation'. It says that it is all a black myth. You have other headlines saying that Howard does not understand it. I am meant to enjoy all of this; I am meant to invite all of this. What an absurd proposition. No party leader and no Prime Minister in his right mind would set out to get that kind of reaction.
Of course I regard this as a difficult, sensitive and potentially divisive issue in the Australian community. I care as much about the happiness of indigenous Australians as I do about any other Australian. The idea that you over there, because you sit behind the leader of the Australian Labor Party, have some kind of monopoly on concern, love and compassion absolutely fails any test of reasonableness and commonsense. Do you imagine that when I read the Bringing them home report I was not moved by those stories? Of course I was moved by those stories. Do you think I am not moved by stories of young people being sent into incarceration and imprisonment? Of course I am moved by those stories. May I remind you that I am also moved by the stories of elderly, lonely men and women in their 80s and 90s who are terrorised by thugs. I am moved by those stories.
—What's that got to do with it?
—It has a lot to do with it because it helps to explain the fact that there are many people within the Australian community who genuinely in their hearts, Daryl, believe that they are entitled to the protection of the law against people who wantonly invade their homes. That is what I am talking about. The Leader of the Opposition reminded me that I pledged when I was elected Prime Minister to govern for all of us. That elderly lady is one of us, just as much as any other person is one of us. That elderly person is entitled to understanding and to some kind of sympathy.
—Does that go for Riverside?
—Oh, Riverside—now called Gladesville. One of your colleagues, having sat mute for weeks while Jenny Macklin demanded the place be shut down, was on television on Sunday wanting it reopened. He wanted it reopened. He said that, as soon as he got back to parliament, he was going to call for its reopening—another example of the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition.
Let me return to the censure motion of the Leader of the Opposition. That censure motion is based upon the totally false proposition coming from the Australian Labor Party that we have walked away from our commitment to reconciliation. We have not done anything of the kind. I repeat the words of the censure motion. It reads as follows: 
His betrayal of the 1996 pledge to govern for all of us as well as his 1998 promise to commit himself `very genuinely to the cause of true reconciliation'.
Let me say for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, for the benefit of all of those who sit in this place today and for the benefit of all of the Australian people: we remain committed to that cause. We do not pretend that it is a journey that will easily be completed. You should have the intellectual honesty to acknowledge from your own experience in government that the indigenous portfolio was one of the most difficult and turbulent that you had any experience with. When I heard perhaps the best known identity in indigenous politics giving me a bit of a character reference on the Today show this morning, it reminded me very much of some of the arguments that went on when he was the head of the then Department of Aboriginal Affairs, when Gerry Hand was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. It was not easy then, and I do not remember the Labor Party going out of office getting universal plaudits from every section of the Aboriginal community. We are committed to the cause of reconciliation. We may have a different way of achieving it from the Labor Party, we may differ as to our methodology and we may argue about some of the facts—and by all means let us do that—but let us not have any of this moral drivel that the only people who care about the indigenous in Australia are those who sit behind the leader of the Australian Labor Party.
I can go back through the long history of my party and I can think of the compassionate contribution to the cause of indigenous affairs by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. I can think of the member for Aston, who has a very deep and abiding interest in indigenous affairs and who sat for a number of years on the council for reconciliation. I can go through a very large number, but time does not permit it. We are committed to reconciliation. We did not set out with this submission to the Senate committee, as the Leader of the Opposition so falsely and indecently alleges, to create a wedge in Australian politics. It does not benefit the body politic, Labor or Liberal, to have a divisive debate about indigenous affairs any more than it benefits the body politic, Labor or Liberal, to reopen the Native Title Act. I cannot think of anything more calculated to cause division with the Australian community.
The cause of reconciliation is a decent and noble one. We will differ along the path, but let us not be so uncharitable as to pretend that either of us has a monopoly of moral commitment to that long-term cause which is based on one fundamental proposition: that all of us are together Australians. We have a common identity as Australians, we have a common ownership of this great country and, if we can work decently and productively together, we can have a common future. That ought to be the goal of every last one of us.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,6,1
"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2000-04-03,"—The Australian people deserve better. They want more of their Prime Minister. This Prime Minister had an opportunity during question time, and during the 15 minutes in answering the censure motion, to come out and clearly disown the following offensive and insulting paragraph in this Senate submission by his Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs:
There was never a generation of stolen children.
That is the input of the submission to the Senate committee by the minister for Aboriginal affairs and his Prime Minister. It is the first time in three years that this argument of statistics has been used. Is it any wonder that the community is outraged? This Prime Minister uses dog-whistle politics on these issues. He came into government on the basis that he would govern for all of us, and that we would be comfortable and relaxed. We now know that that is qualified. At every opportunity there have been olive branches. He mentioned getting a bit of a bake from a character on Channel 9 this morning. That was Charlie Perkins. Where was he in 1996? He was part of John Howard's distinguished persons group. He gave John Howard the tick in the lead-up to the 1996 election, and he has since walked away from him.
—He was also part of Hewson's kitchen cabinet.
—As the member for the Northern Territory rightly said, he was also part of Hewson's kitchen cabinet. What is disturbing is that this government was given another opportunity, particularly by the Senate, for a dignified response to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report. Let us not forget that, before this report came out, the government went out and put the drip on the authors, Sir Ronald Wilson and Mick Dodson, and it was in denial mode. This government was asked to submit to the Senate committee a submission in relation to an inquiry that is looking, other than through the court system and through the legal system, to finish off these cases—to finish off this sad chapter in our history. And what is the government's submission? No retreat, no surrender, no admissions.
He talked about Joy Williams in New South Wales. I will tell you what Bob Carr and his government did, Mr Speaker. They did not force her to go into the witness box. She did not give evidence in person—an affidavit was tendered. The New South Wales government actually allowed affidavit evidence in that case. It did not go to strict proof. It compressed the nature of the case, and it did not require the trauma of evidence in the witness box. That is what Bob Carr and his government did. What did this mean-spirited Prime Minister do? He sent up a QC to the Northern Territory to cross-examine, up hill and down dale, people who are victims. The bill now is more than $10 million, a fraction of which it would have cost to settle the case. What is the underlying basis of this grubby submission to the Senate? It says:
There already exists at common law an avenue for the consideration of legitimate compensation claims and it is unlikely that a statutory scheme would be more effective or efficient, unless the bulk of claims were to be accepted at face value, with consequent financial implications as indicated. Such a scheme would also be divisive and humiliating for the unsuccessful claimants.
So it is all about money. It is the government that is obsessed with compensation. The submission then says:
The cost of a proper judicial assessment of such claims is not inconsiderable—reflecting the complexity of researching, reconstructing and adjudicating distant events—but that cost is insignificant compared with the potential compensation costs of a less rigorous process.
It is the government that is obsessed with compensation. When the human rights commission report on the stolen generation talks about reparation, it talks about counselling and about bringing families back together—adopting the Canadian approach. We have a precedent: the Canadians. It is not as if we are in isolation. They had a royal commission. What was the response of their government? An apology, an unqualified apology, a statement of reconciliation given on 7 January 1998. Their commissioners crossed the country, collecting five volumes—3,500 pages—of evidence and 440 recommendations. And what did they do? Give an unreserved apology. It is estimated that approximately 100,000 children attended the schools that were investigated in Canada. That is what we judge this Prime Minister on: on what the Canadians did. They spent $350 million in support of a community based healing strategy to address the healing needs of individuals, families and communities arising from the legacy of physical and sexual abuse at residential schools. That is the Canadian approach—and they have moved on. What happened in relation to the question of litigation? This is the Canadian government approach:
With respect to civil suits which allege physical and sexual abuse, the Government of Canada's preference is to pursue resolution of these lawsuits in a non-confrontational manner outside the court system. As much as possible, this protects the privacy of individuals and avoids the stress of a courtroom setting. It also means that the Government is ready to accept its responsibility in those cases where allegations are substantiated and the relative liabilities of all parties (e.g. religious organisations and the federal government) are clear. With these cases we are moving to settle out of court if all parties can reach agreement.
The attitude of this government is knock down, drag down court cases further exacerbating the problem. But do you have a minister—and this is why there is outrage in the community—who is in there on their side, who is listening and responding to them? Not the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. He is out there insulting them—using statistics that are an insult. That is why there is current outrage. It was not my commitment but the Prime Minister's who, on re-election night, wanted to genuinely commit himself to the cause of reconciliation. With respect to accuracy, Budget Paper No. 1 on statement of risks at 4.31 talks about 2,200 claims for damages and, if they are successful, compensation in the order of hundred of millions of dollars. On page 51, the figure is now up to $3.9 billion. Where does this come from? How accurate is that?
The Prime Minister spoke today about the resolution last year in relation to the stolen generation. Again, he is selective about what happened in this parliament. The Labor Party did not support that motion. We moved an amendment and, when that failed, we remained silent, because that is what the stolen generation asked us to do. We remained silent as our protest, because we were given two hours and we were ambushed because of the backroom deal with the Democrats. Generosity of spirit! That is why the Prime Minister deserves to be condemned. It is he who offered this. This was his promise. And what is happening now? It is always `shoot the messenger'. The UN committee are copping a serve now. We will not see the government release their legal advice; the Attorney-General again hides from it. When an independent expert committee examined our 1993 act, the act was given a tick because it conformed with the convention. This government were on notice. The fact of the matter is that the Native Title Act does have problems in relation to international conventions, and the government have been pinged on it. 
In terms of mandatory sentencing, statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics last week showed that in the Northern Territory 67 per cent of all prisoners are indigenous. Imprisonment rates for indigenous people in Western Australia are 21 times the non-indigenous rate. There is a crisis in our jails. People are being sent to jail, not for serious criminal offences but because the judiciary have had the discretion taken away from them. What do we have? A Pontius Pilate approach. What will it take for this government to act or for members of the government to cross the floor? Another death in custody. We had a $40 million royal commission. It said, `Imprisonment is a last resort. Look at alternatives.' This is not a law and order debate. Judges and magistrates in the Northern Territory have been given no discretion. But what does the Prime Minister do? He says, `I don't like mandatory sentencing, but I don't want to act.' Why? He is driven by low-grade politics, the politics of the conservative Northern Territory constituency that he does not want to upset and Richard Court, on mandatory sentencing. But give Richard Court his due. We have our differences on native title but, on this one, not even he can cop the minister for Aboriginal affairs's submission or the Prime Minister saying there was no stolen generation. That is the key to it. Richard Court is not one of ours. He is not one of the Labor Party's.
The fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister is the emperor without clothes. He blames us for asking questions in question time. How did it get on the agenda? Because his Aboriginal affairs minister and his advisers leaked the report to the press, and you have got headlines in the Adelaide Advertiser: `Sorry, you didn't exist'. And we are being blamed. This government is inciting, provoking indigenous Australians. This Prime Minister also, when he did his exclusive interview with the Australian, abandoned his pledge to reconciliation. Why? What was his defence? Expectations were being raised for the May event—unreal expectations.
No-one expects him to apologise—but to go out on the basis of polling! And what does this submission contain? Opinion polling as the basis for defending why there is no apology from the government. Paddy McGuinness—I get on reasonably well with Paddy, but he has lost his way—is cited as a justification for questioning the statistics. It is not as if the human rights commission did not question. It said at page 36 it was not possible to state with any precision how many children were forcibly removed, even if that inquiry is confined to those removed officially. Here is the nub of why they could not do it: because this government did not cooperate with them. The Attorney-General took a submission to cabinet and it was pulled because it did not suit the Prime Minister and his advisers. So a modified submission went after the event to the human rights commission—that is the story—in October 1996 after the deadline, and it did not provide them with any facts. That is the real story. The government did not cooperate with them. 
Three years after the event, we have this invention that a stolen generation is not a generation unless all the kids were taken. So the generation that suffered through World War I was not really a generation that suffered, because all our kids were not killed on the battlefields of World War I! What a nonsense. That is why this Prime Minister deserves to be censured. We expect better. He offered better. His covenant with the Australian electorate, if he was to be elected, was a covenant of trust. He was supposed to raise hopes and expectations and grow in office, not diminish in office and diminish the nation. It is no accident that since the 1967 referendum we had a great history in international forums that spanned Labor and Liberal governments. Malcolm Fraser led the charge against apartheid and even he says we should say sorry. This generation can say sorry, and it will not cost a cent, because we did not do it: it is empathy.
But the Prime Minister cannot empathise because he has not got it in him. Low-grade politics drives this Prime Minister. The time for action has well and truly passed. There is no doubt now; it is beyond doubt. There is no reasonable doubt when it comes to this Prime Minister. On every issue in relation to minorities and the disadvantaged he goes after them, he divides them and he uses them for political gain. He does not protect them. That is the job of the Prime Minister, especially in a free market economy, to protect people and not to use them as political fodder.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2000-04-03,"—This motion is about division. If the opposition were not about exploiting division on this question and on like questions, they would not be promoting the sorts of divisive debates that we have heard today. To use, as the Leader of the Opposition has used, the Prime Minister's statement of wanting to govern for all of us, as well as his promise to commit himself very genuinely to the cause of true reconciliation, in the context of betrayal, leaves open only one view; that is, that the opposition want to exploit the views of the Prime Minister in a way which can achieve political advantage for themselves. Of course, then to go on and accuse us of division in indigenous affairs, of a failure to apologise in relation to claims for compensation, in relation to a failure to administer effective programs for the benefit of Aboriginals, indicates what the opposition want to do with these particular questions.
In my comments today it is important to make clear that this division by the opposition will not in any way deflect the government from its objectives in relation to ensuring that we have better and more effective relationships between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the rest of the Australian community. The Prime Minister has made it very clear that he supports the reconciliation process but he sees it as one that will continue beyond the year 2000 when the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation ceases its work. The fact is that the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation has been working, in accordance with the requirement of an act of parliament, to have ready for tabling in the parliament a report on reconciliation. That report will set out a means of giving effect to proposals that were contained in a document of reconciliation which was submitted in draft form but which, when finalised, is to be launched on 27 May at the Sydney Opera House. The council will also spend time in the remaining six months of its term seeking commitments to that document from a range of stakeholders. 
The government has indicated its support for the reconciliation process. It has indicated its support for consultation in relation to the document of reconciliation. All of that commitment was greeted, when we had resolutions in this parliament, by the opposition saying, `Yes, we accept the generality of your support for these matters but, in relation to specific areas, we do not think you have gone far enough.' In other words, what the opposition was seeking to do was to distinguish itself by setting out areas of difference. In other words, it was seeking to divide. Of course, the Prime Minister saw it as being important to indicate, in line with advice that he had been receiving from the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation—a council that the member for Banks is a member of, and where he would know that there had been caution expressed time and time again about whether reconciliation could be achieved, and where there had been caution expressed in relation to a number of issues in which it was considered that it was not possible to set down, at this point in time, definitive views that would necessarily achieve a broad consensus within the Australian community—the council itself was setting out that these matters were `unfinished business'.
In that context, when the Prime Minister was informed that there are issues where the council itself does not believe that it will be able to produce a final document which will be definitive on all issues, which will achieve `reconciliation of all Australians', the Prime Minister was condemned for simply putting on the public record his recognition that reconciliation will not be magically achieved by a particular document put down on a particular date. We remain committed to working for reconciliation. But when reconciliation has to be about a meeting of minds of the whole Australian community, if you are going to bring all the Australian people on board you need to do so in a way which is unifying and which recognises some of the difficulties that you are going to have in bringing on board all the Australian people.
But the government does support the aims of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. We acknowledge and respect our indigenous people and the way in which they have worked constructively in relation to these issues, and we are appreciative of all the others who take a genuine interest in these matters and want to work positively to see a resolution of them. We are committed to working in partnerships with other government organisations, with business, with peak organisations and with community organisations to achieve a genuine outcome from this process of reconciliation. The Prime Minister has indicated to the council that we will look at ways and means of supporting an ongoing process which the council itself believes will be necessary after it has completed its document of reconciliation.
I want also, in the context of this debate today, to draw attention to the double standards in the way in which the Labor Party has handled the issues relating to separated children. The fact is that the issues that we are dealing with are not new issues; they are issues that were very much alive when the Labor Party was in office. They are issues the Labor Party in office would have been able to deal with by way of any statement of apology that it wanted to make at that time and by dealing with the litigation that the Prime Minister referred to that came to the High Court—Kruger and Bray v. the Commonwealth. The fact is that the issue of compensation was very much alive. It could have been dealt with by the Labor Party in office. But, as the member for Denison made clear in his own comments, the Labor Party dealt with it by giving it to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to have it off the agenda until after the election that was due had passed. That is what it was really all about. The same opposition has been playing a duplicitous game on this question of compensation. It knows that, within the Australian community, if you were dealing with very large numbers of claims from people who were saying they were separated—whether it was justifiable or unjustifiable—the amount of money would be very large indeed.
—British child migrants—
—The member for Denison!
—The Labor Party in office ran away from that issue. They allowed the litigation to run. They held out, and continued for a time to hold out, the view that the issue here is the issue of an apology. They even had the audacity from time to time to say that, if an apology were made in the form they wanted it, litigation was likely to stop and compensation as an issue would disappear. That is what they were holding out.
—That is right.
—But now we see a much clearer picture emerging—and it is one that the Labor Party will have to think through very clearly, particularly in the run-up to any future election—that is, what are they actually proposing now? I notice the words that the Leader of the Opposition was using today in relation to this issue are what the Aboriginal communities now want: `material recompense'. That is not about words; that is about money—that is about financial compensation. The member for Banks has today been arguing that the Commonwealth should settle the current litigation because it would be cheaper than arguing all the claims in court.
—It would be.
—The member for Denison has twice drawn my attention in question time and now twice in this debate. I will not be as generous again.
—The case, if it yielded an outcome which involved compensation, may open the possibility for other suits, but the case disposed of in relation to culpability will close the issue off.
—Yes, it will. The case would close the issue off, if this is the best case to be argued by all the organisations that have hunted up hill and down dale to find people on which to launch a test case—and that is what the organisations funded by the Commonwealth, generously, to assist in relation to Aboriginals have been doing over a period. I would be reasonably satisfied that it would be unlikely that you would find cases which would present a range of circumstances more auspicious than those that are presently before the court upon which others might be able to be predicated. But, if the opposition are arguing that these matters ought to be taken out of the hands of the court and settled by a general offer of compensation, then that is what they need to be prepared to spell out in policy. It was not what they were prepared to do in government, and that is the basis upon which they ought to be judged. I have been fascinated over time in relation to this issue of apology about which the opposition appears unwilling to recognise the generosity of the Prime Minister's personal comments by way of apology—
—You're joking!
—in relation to separated children. Of course, I am sorely disappointed that the opposition see fit to disparage the resolution of this parliament, which was a resolution of sincere and deep regret for the events that have occurred in the past. But when I listened today to the comments of the Leader of the Opposition about where apologies have been given, I was very interested in the experience in relation to the `apology' that was given in Canada, because I recall well the criticism that was offered from those who said it did not go far enough. And I can well recall the situation where in South Africa the Truth and Reconciliation Commission—
—Member for Grayndler!
—headed by Bishop Tutu, brought down its report and found it roundly condemned by the National Party and by the ANC—
—Howard opposed sanctions.
—The member for Grayndler is warned.
—because each of them was unwilling to recognise that there were comments that reflected upon their involvement in the recent past. If you look at the experience of the Pope in relation to the apology offered by the Catholic Church now, you find exactly the same: a situation in which an apology—well meant, well conceived, well constructed—is still seen by some as not enough. It would not have mattered whether the Prime Minister had used the word `sorry'; there would have been people in the Labor Party arguing that he had not expressed sincere and deep regret for the events of the past. There has been a confected anger over these issues, and the confected anger comes from those who seek to make an issue of these matters for the purposes of division, and that is where the Labor Party stand on these matters.

Question put:
That the motion (Mr Beazley's) be agreed to.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,6,1
"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2000-04-03,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	notes the increase in deaths caused by heroin and the increase in the number of first-time users under 25;
(2)	notes the positive results in the use of Naltrexone in the treatment of heroin dependence for some addicts; and
(3)	regrets the recent decision by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to exclude Naltrexone from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme other than for the treatment of alcohol dependence.
Despite the Howard government's Tough on Drugs strategy, heroin is used by an estimated 300,000 Australians, and the number is rising. The National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre says that heroin is now one of the leading killers of young Australians. There has been a 120 per cent increase in heroin related deaths in south-western Sydney between 1992 and 1995. The number of Australian teenagers who have tried heroin has jumped almost threefold in the past three years. In Cabramatta, in my electorate, residents and business proprietors are understandably unsympathetic. Nationally, an average of 48 property offences are reported to police every hour, and the Australian Institute of Criminology blames 90 per cent of household break-ins on heroin addicts. This is from a letter I received last week:
Unless the illegal drug trade in Cabramatta is completely cleaned up by 30 June 2000 the concerned citizens of Cabramatta will contact the international news media and warn them that overseas visitors will be in grave danger of being bashed and robbed by desperate drug addicts heading to Cabramatta to buy their drugs.
Mr Deputy Speaker, you can see the frustration we are facing with this situation, and people are much more candid when you talk to them in the street. Let me read you another letter, actually to the Prime Minister, written by a patient at a naltrexone detox clinic just up the road from my electorate office. It says:
I am writing to you in the hope that I can help you understand the benefits of treating heroin and methadone addicts with rapid detox using naltrexone. Last January—
That was January last year—
I was able to pay for my treatment. It was the beginning of life for me.
This 41-year-old mother of two had been on methadone for the last 10 years. She says to the Prime Minister:
I have a real understanding of the drug problem in Australia as I used for twenty-three years in Sydney, Melbourne, Queensland and South-East Asia. I have been charged for trafficking in Melbourne, using and possession in Sydney and the Gold Coast. I understand how it feels to be treated like society's refuse. I have changed from a useless junkie into a caring responsible productive citizen ... Naltrexone is really a miracle drug. I am here alive today because of it. Please—
she says to the Prime Minister—
don't let any more Australians dependent on heroin or methadone endure one more day. Please give them back their freedom. My father fought in World War Two for this country so we could be free. Please don't let drugs take that freedom from us.
The rapid detox centre in Speed Street, Liverpool, which incidentally assists a limited number of people who cannot afford to pay, has hundreds of letters of gratitude. A common phrase is, `My life has been saved.' The Westmead Hospital naltrexone trial made riveting TV. That is how open and transparent it was. About two-thirds of the patients are drug free after six months, and that is a good success rate.
Dr Jon Currie, who led the trial, believes naltrexone can help some, not all, heroin addicts. He says that it should be on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. He says that it is a tragic thing that it is not. Dr George O'Neil over in Perth, another genuine front-line, hard-nosed medico who has treated well over 1,000 people, says the same thing. Dr Siva at the Liverpool detox centre says the same thing. These people are close to the problem, close to the families and closer to the realities than most of us would like to get. I put it to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee that naltrexone, which they recognise as being effective for alcohol addiction and have approved for inclusion in the PBS, is also effective for treating heroin addiction.
It will work for less than a fifth of alcoholics. The people it will help overcome alcohol dependence will have to be carefully screened and naltrexone prescribed under authority. It should be the same with heroin addicts. We know it gets people drug free for a sufficient interval for some life changing to be done. Naltrexone is not a cure for any addiction, but rehabilitation best starts free of physical addiction. And that is where the real story begins. The psychosocial reasons for addiction are complex, and we are only just beginning to develop psychological approaches to maintain drug-free lives. It is the behavioural therapy, not naltrexone, which counts most.
The evidence that was used in rejecting naltrexone just was not appropriate. In fact, because the reasons behind every person's addiction are different and complex, there is no perfect measure. This is not a headache, and naltrexone is not aspirin. Heroin addiction might be an epidemic, but there is no single medication for it. You cannot stamp out heroin use. You have to stop the reasons behind it, and that is going to be different for each and every addict. That is the reason naltrexone should be available as one of a number of treatment options.
We as a society, as well as those whose addiction most alienates them from society, need every tool available to deal with this dragon. Naltrexone has been around for more than a decade. The popular perception is on the instant cure side, the magic wand, the silver bullet. That is completely wrong. So too is the rapid detox side of naltrexone. It is very useful for detoxification, but it does not matter how someone with a drug dependency gets detoxed. What is so useful about naltrexone is its blocking ability and its safety. It does two important things. It takes away the urge to use, and it blocks a high. If you have a drug dependent person who has real motivation and the support of family and friends, naltrexone is a godsend. Without motivation, it is of no value.
That is where the PBAC decision is so cruel. Naltrexone is only suitable for those with the spirit to break the cycle. Their despair is greater having seen naltrexone based programs almost come within reach. They are left with counselling—and a lot of good work is done there—and they are left with methadone. Counselling accepts a high relapse rate, and methadone provides a substitute addiction which you can feed up with continued heroin use. Naltrexone works on methadone addiction too. Naltrexone offers a next stage to methadone—which, incidentally, can be a lifetime's supply. Naltrexone, for what it is worth, offers a cheaper treatment option.
I am not against methadone. The numbers, around 23,000, on methadone are growing at about 15 per cent a year. It is estimated that every dollar we spend on methadone saves the community $4 to $5 in reduced health costs and crime. Those are the minister's figures. Naltrexone could be in the same league. Heroin is down to about $20 a cap in Cabramatta. You cannot stop it. About 80 to 90 per cent of women in Mulawa have a drug problem. Narcotics are coming into our jails, and if we cannot keep them out of there we cannot stop them coming into the community and bringing increasing grief for families. Naltrexone, used properly, can save lives. It can be cost effective. In the right professionally run program with prescriptions under authority, it can be rigorously monitored. We can see what we are getting. Let me read a letter from `Amber' to show the kind of happiness we or the PBAC could bring to a troubled world:
Dear Dr Siva and Staff
I won't ever be able to thank you enough for your treatment and support. You saved my life!
Since being rapidly de-toxed at your Liverpool clinic I have been able to go on and lead a happy and normal life.
My family still cannot believe that they have their daughter back and my younger sister has all of a sudden got an older sister!
When I wake up in the morning instead of thinking of heroin I think what a precious gift life really is. I'm now six months clean and at the end of my treatment. I cannot explain the pleasure I get from the simplest things in life.
So many doors have opened for me since being detoxed.
Can we deny this to so many who cannot afford the medication? Aren't our young people worth giving at least a second chance? That chance is naltrexone based treatment. I beg the PBAC to reconsider its decision and to give a chance to some of the 300,000 Australians trapped in dependency.

"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2000-04-03,"—In speaking today on the issue of naltrexone treatment, at the outset I would like to applaud the Prime Minister on the government's Tough on Drugs strategy. It was a strategy that was long overdue. I will speak on the facts surrounding the use of naltrexone, and those facts may be for the benefit of those who are desperately in need. The figures of the former Department of Health and Community Services show that the prevalence of heroin consumption in Australia has remained at a relatively low level between 1988 and 1995, with one per cent of the population over 14 years reporting that they had used heroin and less than 0.5 per cent of the population reporting that they had used heroin in the 12 months before 1995. Consumption was concentrated in persons aged less than 30 years. While prevalence rates are low in comparison with other illicit drugs, the trend in more recent times for younger age groups appears to be towards more, rather than fewer, persons using heroin.
These figures are supported by the Australian Institute of Criminology data, which reveal that the number of deaths from heroin overdose or dependence has been increasing steadily since 1992. A recent study by the Turning Point Alcohol and Drug Centre in Melbourne has found that the increase in the total number of deaths is primarily due to the high incidence of deaths among males. However, the number of teenagers and women using heroin is increasing, with many naming heroin as the first drug they injected. This research, based on information from ambulance officers, has given a disturbing picture of heroin overdoses and the changing patterns of the use of the drug. While noting the increased use of heroin among young people and women, the study's preliminary findings also show that overdose victims in Melbourne are most likely to be male and aged about 27. It appears that the falling price of heroin and increased availability was fuelling a growing street scene, allowing our children easy access to this scourge on our society.
Naltrexone has been touted as a possible non-addictive alternative to methadone for the treatment of heroin addicts. Naltrexone operates by blocking the human body's receptors for heroin and other opiates such as morphine, so the `high' that an addict gets is not present when the drug is administered. Several pioneering clinical studies have been performed using naltrexone. These studies were successful in confirming the pharmacological effectiveness of the drug and demonstrate that naltrexone is a viable alternative treatment for heroin dependence. A study conducted by the Australian Medical Procedures Research Foundation in 1999 validates that naltrexone, when used in association with a rapid detoxification program, can be effective in increasing the recruitment of young heroin addicts into the program at an early stage of their addiction.
Similarly, a trial conducted at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, and backed by the New South Wales government, found that 60 per cent of former heroin users were not drug dependent after one year. The Westmead trial noted that, despite 90 per cent of users being treated with naltrexone not having heroin cravings, long-term maintenance is required to effectively keep former users from relapsing. With only methadone being available for 20 years in Australia, the opportunity to give the patients treatment at an early stage of their addiction has been lost as so many of the younger addicts reject the use of methadone when their addiction has been present for only a short time.
Naltrexone is available by prescription from GPs. However, the financial status of many users preclude them from gaining the benefits associated with the treatment. The clinical study conducted by the Australian Medical Procedures Research Foundation importantly identified that many patients, especially young mothers, found the daily cost for naltrexone tablets too high and dropped out of the treatment. Cost for naltrexone tablets in clinical trials are quoted at $7 to $10 per day, or $250 to $350 per month. The clinical data highlights that a 12-month detoxification program is required for most people. This equates up to $3,600 per year.
Figures provided by the Department of Health and Aged Care demonstrate that methadone has a cost per public patient of $2,100 per annum. With methadone's reduced costs compared to naltrexone, it is plain to see which treatment low income users are most likely to adopt—the addictive opiate, methadone. If naltrexone were to be listed through the subsidised Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, prices would be likely to drop by half. Before a medicine can be subsidised via the PBS, it must be assessed by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The member for Fowler should take note that the PBAC is a totally independent body, not a government committee.
In view of the importance of heroin addiction, consideration of naltrexone for PBS listing was fast-tracked and a special meeting was held in July 1999 by this totally independent committee. Unfortunately, naltrexone was unsuccessful in gaining listing on the PBS at this meeting. The reasoning behind the unsuccessful bid was quoted as being due to naltrexone's modest clinical efficacy in outcome measures of relapse and retention rates. There was also concern raised about the drug's toxicity and about the difficulty in treating patients who require strong analgesics in an emergency situation whilst on naltrexone.
The PBAC also quote that naltrexone showed no evidence of significant medical effectiveness. Coupled with the price of the medicine, the resulting cost effectiveness could not justify PBS listing. It would be my belief that it is the heroin that has the toxicity, not the naltrexone. It is the heroin that kills. Naltrexone can prevent the death. People who die after using naltrexone usually die because they have returned to their habit, not through using naltrexone. The company which produces naltrexone took legal action against the PBAC in an effort to have its product listed. The PBAC subsequently reviewed naltrexone and, in its December 1999 meeting, approved its listing on PBS purely for alcohol dependence. It remains unavailable on the PBS list for opiate addiction.
Naltrexone is a non-addictive alternative to methadone that has demonstrated in clinical trials that it is effective in the treatment of heroin addiction and has few demonstrable side effects. General practitioners have been prescribing naltrexone for a period of time specifically for the treatment of opiate addiction. The United States has had naltrexone approved for many years for the treatment of opiate dependence. The total number of clients in methadone treatment programs in Australia as at June 1998 was 24,657 people. Of that, 12,107 were from New South Wales. That is half of the total. There is a definite need for an expansion of treatment options. In the media release of the Australian National Council on Drugs on 29 May 1998, the chair of ANCD, Major Brian Watters, said:
... the Council agreed that there is substantial body of research evidence that supports the WHO and the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy's endorsement of drug substitutions like methadone and buprenorphine, as legitimate treatment options for the management of heroin addiction.
“However, the Council believes that there is need for an expansion of treatment options that are grounded in evidence of effectiveness, that are adequately resourced and reflect the range of consumer preferences,”...
I admit the effectiveness of naltrexone programs depends on the social and psychological support system available to the addict. For naltrexone to be successful, it requires patients to have very competent carers and appropriately staffed detoxification centres and rehab units. I am a strong advocate of increasing the availability of rehab centres and am currently supporting the establishment of a rehab centre within the Riverina. My electorate has been clearly identified as an area of high need.
I conclude by saying that naltrexone is not a radical drug, and I believe that, by adding it to the PBS list, addicts will have the choice to join a detoxification program that can offer far more rapid results than existing programs without their having to endure financial hardship or resort to illegal activities to fund their treatment. I support Dr Jon Currie, Director of Alcohol and Drug Services at Westmead Hospital, in saying that I hope too that, when results of these trials are available, there will be sufficient evidence to support a re-application for PBS listing. It is vital that we have options for heroin and other opiate users who are aiming at a drug-free life that are not prohibitively expensive.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2000-04-03,"—Firstly, it is nice to support the motion proposed by the member for Fowler, which regrets the decision made by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee about naltrexone. Indeed, it is nice to follow a government member who is, in a bipartisan way, very supportive of the thrust of the honourable member for Fowler.
I think it is every parent's worst nightmare to discover that their son or daughter is addicted to drugs. It is not something that one can blame parents for. You cannot develop relationships with your children that can absolutely guarantee they will not become drug dependent. Of all the drugs that our children might become dependent upon, heroin is perhaps the most deadly. Most frightening is the fact that in 1999 heroin addiction increased 22 per cent from the financial year 1997-98. That is a terrifying statistic. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has produced statistics which state that Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT seem to have a particular problem because, whilst the national average is 12.3 per cent of drug offenders being addicted to heroin, in New South Wales it is 15.8 per cent and in Victoria it is 34.3 per cent. Nationally, it is 12.3 per cent. These are rather horrifying statistics.
No-one can stand up in this parliament and say that we have the perfect treatment for a drug addict, but what we should do as a society is give people choices about how best to tackle their addiction. I might say that I was very pleased late last year to open a clinic in the Minchinbury Private Hospital which provides naltrexone. I welcomed the opening of that clinic, but what really disappoints me is that most of my constituents are not going to be able to afford to attend it. So there is great irony in the fact that I have no fewer addicts than anywhere else but the people who will utilise the facility in my electorate will not come from my electorate. 
The up-front costs of the naltrexone treatment are quite great—not because the stay in hospital is extended; it is something like 24 hours. I agree with the honourable member for Riverina that what is critical is the family support and the professional care during the period after detoxification. That largely determines the success or failure of the treatment, and that costs money. Even where a family may be able to afford the up-front costs of the treatment, there is the ongoing cost of the daily naltrexone tablet. It is bitterly disappointing that, in a nation that is really concerned about our drug problem, we have a situation where people are being priced out of the treatment and priced out of the ongoing taking of the tablets.
I accept the fact that the committee that made the decision is an independent committee, but sometimes I think we ought to take a few risks, particularly in areas like this, rather than wait for every bit of empirical evidence to come in. After all, the minister's answer given on 30 March to a question I placed on the Notice Paper said:
Australia approved the use of naltrexone ... in January 1999. Twenty-eight other countries have also approved naltrexone for these indications of addiction, including the U.S.A., France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Italy, Israel, Spain, Denmark, Netherlands, Oman, Austria, Pakistan, Brazil, Bahrain, Finland, Canada, Egypt, Colombia, Peru, Kuwait, Taiwan, Argentina, Bolivia, Eire, Hungary, Korea, Lithuania and Thailand.
In the United States, it has been going on since 1984. We are hardly being radical and revolutionary in pursuing this as a policy. The last thing I would like to say is that drug offenders addicted to heroin spend 96 per cent of the proceeds of burglaries on their drug habit.

"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2000-04-03,"—I commend the member for Fowler for her longstanding interest in and commitment to doing everything—and I mean everything—we can possibly do to reduce drug uptake in our community and to support measures to ameliorate its impacts. Having said that, I do not, because of the lack of scientific veracity behind it, currently support the listing of naltrexone on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The second point that ought to be made is that the average heroin addict in Sydney who has a fairly serious habit will spend about $3,000 a month maintaining their addiction, whereas what we are looking at here is potentially a cost of between $250 to $300 a month for naltrexone. 
Despite the public frenzy that followed the 1997 tabloid headline `I woke up cured of heroin addiction', naltrexone is neither new nor the cure for heroin addiction, which the member for Fowler recognised. Although naltrexone blocks the impact of heroin and other opiates on the brain, it is not a cure for heroin because getting off the drugs is not about the drugs and the chemicals; it is about choices—and they are damned hard ones at that. To suggest you can wake up cured avoids the ambivalence and the motivational issues, which are of course central to drug dependence. As Mark Twain once said, `Giving up smoking is easy. I've done it a hundred times.'
What is new for a drug that has been available since 1972 is combining a general anaesthetic with its intravenous administration, a climate of sophisticated marketing of the treatment to government after a media blitzkrieg and personal testimonials. For some people—and if you understand the people in whom the addiction is occurring and their families—it represents a kind of symbolic exorcism, and that is why ultra rapid opiate detoxification is so important to them. You can also go trainspotting. You can lock yourself up in a room with a can of tomato soup and a blanket, and you can argue that that is considerably less expensive and it is certainly safer.
Since July 1997 the Australian media has uncritically reported therapeutic claims that naltrexone can be used to cure heroin dependence when what naltrexone is about is adding to that important smorgasbord of treatments that we might have available to us and having a treatment which is appropriate to the individual in which the addiction is occurring. Naltrexone has been studied, as I say, for over 25 years. The things we do know about it is that induction is difficult, and that is why the concept of giving it under a general anaesthesia has been introduced, that compliance is poor, that the therapeutic retention rates are disappointing at best and that abstinence is in fact an uncommon outcome. It has a limited role in street users, but it is certainly best for parolees and for professional people who are drug dependent. 
Perhaps one of the best studies done in Australia to date until next year when the result of the national evaluation of pharmacotherapies for opiate dependence is available is that done by James Bell and his colleagues, published in the Medical Journal of Australia in July last year. They studied naltrexone accelerated withdrawal under light sedation, followed then by naltrexone maintenance, in 30 patients. They were followed up for three months and, at the end of three months, seven were still abstinent from heroin but only two were still taking naltrexone, one had died from a heroin overdose—in fact the mortality rate for heroin addicts who undergo naltrexone treatment approaches that of those who do not have any treatment at all—18 had returned to heroin or methadone and, of the six still taking naltrexone, four were engaged in the very risky practice of using heroin after briefly interrupting their naltrexone treatment. 
Those treated in the media highlighted ultra rapid opiate detoxification tend to have shorter careers of heroin dependence, and they have stronger family and social supports. The role of not only naltrexone but other drugs used to assist opiate withdrawal will be better understood next year when controlled trials of the combined procedure with and without anaesthesia will be available as part of the national evaluation of pharmacotherapies for opioid dependence. The fact remains at the moment that we cannot yet say that naltrexone is in a cost-effective way a suitable treatment that ought to be added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, although in time that may be proven to be the case.

"Wilton, Greg, MP",ALP,2000-04-03,"—I would like to submit my third contribution in this place to the continuing debate surrounding the Riverside Nursing Home in Patterson Lakes within Isaacs—a timely addition to the debate, given that the time is indeed fast approaching for the former residents of Riverside currently located at St Vincent's Hospital to be once again uprooted and sped across town to yet another new location.
Not once did the Minister for Aged Care or her department talk over with the residents or their relatives the real possibility that the nursing home would be closed, during the furore which erupted over the unfortunate kerosene baths incident. Not once did the minister or the delegate recognise a strong desire amongst the overwhelming majority of residents and their relatives to remain at home—that is, their home at the Riverside Nursing Home. That would be, of course, following a major injection of capital, a significant upgrade and a renaming of that maligned facility.
Not once was the commitment of the nursing staff to the aged residents acknowledged. Instead, the staff were utterly demoralised and were made, by and large, to feel as if they did not care about the residents when, overall, nothing could have been further from the truth. The nursing staff at Riverside—and I know them well—loved those residents as if they were all part of a large family and had always worked tirelessly with the interests of the residents at heart. The overwhelming consensus amongst the relatives and friends that I have met and spoken with is that the staff were loving, bright, caring and attentive. 
Now that their time is almost up at St Vincent's, the former Riverside residents are to be moved yet again—not back to Riverside but to a place called Ripplebrook Village, about 10 kilometres from Riverside as the crow flies. I have been to Ripplebrook Village and I have seen the facilities. I and the residents, relatives and friends simply cannot understand how a decision to relocate these 30 frail aged and elderly residents to this location could have been reasonably reached. I cannot believe that the minister, had she visited the place, would have made the decision to place people requiring a high level of care in a facility like Ripplebrook, which is, at this stage of its development, not capable of sustaining that higher level of care that the Riverside residents need. 
On the face of it, Ripplebrook is fine. It is brand new and is newly fitted out with facilities and new carpet. However, it is unfortunately pretty remote and inaccessible and poorly serviced by public transport in regard to those relatives and friends who would attempt to get there by that means. More importantly, it is purely a purpose built hostel and not a nursing home. Therein lies the crux of the matter. The carpeting throughout would necessarily impede wheelchair access and, of course, carpeting is inappropriate for the incontinent, a matter which you would think would be one of the highest priorities in attending to the needs of frail aged, immobile residents. In addition, the rooms have windows which look out onto courtyards but which do not reach the floor. It is fine if you at least can move around and look out the window over the windowsill; but, if you are confined to a bed, then it is impossible to look out onto a courtyard from your window that does not extend to floor level. These are the sorts of things that the minister really needs to see in person in order to consider the needs of the frail and the aged at this particular venue, which may meet required specifications on paper but certainly does not in reality.
Well might we ask: what happens to the 30 places to be absorbed by the former residents of Riverside? These 30 places were allocated to Ripplebrook Village due to a perceived future demographic need for 30 hostel places in the Carrum Downs and surrounding areas. My guess is that by and large as a result of this decision 30 people in the area requiring hostel level care, and currently on a waiting list for places eagerly anticipating the opening of Ripplebrook, will now be displaced further down the queue for an indefinite period until a further 30 hostel places are made available for them. Furthermore, what about the remaining 27 former residents of Riverside who cannot go to Ripplebrook because only 30 can? And how can the minister remedy the shortfall of 60 beds created by the closure of Riverside? In short, the answer to those questions is: by considering, without any form of bias, the logic and merits of the submission which was put to her department by the owner of the building, Maniwest Pty Ltd, for a comprehensive refurbishment and upgrade. Other submissions may emerge which may be of equal merit and value, but I have seen Maniwest's proposal and it is a comprehensive, far-reaching set of ideas that was worthy of detailed consideration by both the minister and her delegates.
Not only does the comprehensiveness of this proposal demonstrate the commitment of Maniwest's directors to the provision of quality care to the elderly and frail; it also addresses the care issues identified in the risk reports prepared by the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency. It provides for an immediate cash injection of $1 million which would see the nursing home brought up to the government's and Australia's best standards, and a further $2.5 million down the track to address future upgrading requirements. The immediate $1 million would go towards establishing—and I have got a fairly long list here—a new auto sprinkler and smoke detection system, a new reverse cycle airconditioning system, a PA and nurse paging system, new security cameras, improvements to external recreation areas and landscaping, new floor coverings, new lighting, refurbishment of the kitchen, and privacy improvements—to name just a few. What Maniwest submitted was, by and large, a detailed, comprehensive and viable proposal which addresses all the care issues identified in the risk reports. It demonstrates beyond doubt the commitment of the directors of Maniwest to the provision of quality care to the frail and elderly who would be under their care. Additionally, we have an approved provider who was both ready and willing to take on the costs of all the necessary improvements that are required. Who was going to pay for the necessary changes to upgrade the new Ripplebrook facility to meet the needs of the former Riverside residents who require constant and detailed attention? And yet it is a proposal that was deemed not worthy of detailed consideration by the minister's delegate.
This lack of consideration demonstrates the minister's inability to deliver on her so-called commitment to the frail and elderly. Until such time as she considers the proposal—and any others that might emerge—seriously and on its merits, until she visits Riverside to see first-hand the facilities and the fit-out at Ripplebrook Village and realises that the care and the needs of only 30 of the 57 former residents of Riverside Nursing Home would be inadequately met, she will continue to make knee-jerk decisions from a distance and she will continue to act in a manner contrary to the best interests and needs of the frail and elderly Australians to whom she claims to maintain a strong commitment. The concerns of relatives and friends about the effects that the compounding stress of the temporary move to St Vincent's, followed by a second move to another location, would have on the health of these frail and elderly residents have largely gone ignored or at least unheard. So too has their overwhelming desire to see a renamed, refurbished Riverside reopened under a new management structure. Perhaps by the time the move actually takes place the minister and her department will finally have come to realise the toll recent events have taken on the residents, and perhaps that will not be ignored. It could even prompt the government to finally start treating these frail and elderly Australians with the respect, the care and the dignity that is theirs by right.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Nursing Homes: Riverside</title>,Grievance Debate,10,1
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2000-04-03,"—I rise to speak on the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. In doing so I indicate that it is the intention of the opposition to oppose the main amendments contained in this bill. The amendments contained in schedules 1 and 4 of the bill are, from our point of view, non-controversial. We will have no problems with respect to those amendments. We will seek to move some amendments in the committee stages going to the proposed deletions of schedules 2, 3 and 5 of the bill. There are also a number of minor amendments, that the opposition also supports, that correct drafting errors and remove gender-specific language. However, as I have indicated with respect to my intention to move deletion of schedules 2, 3 and 5 in the committee stage, we cannot and will not support the amendments contained in these schedules of the bill.
The amendments in schedules 2 and 3, going to industrial relations provisions, endeavour to bring all workers on Christmas and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands under Western Australian industrial legislation, namely, the Western Australian industrial relations law. As these are Commonwealth territories, the opposition contends that currently the Commonwealth Workplace Relations Act 1996 applies on these islands. I refer in historical terms to the fact that in 1955 and 1958 the Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas Island acts respectively realised the hand-over of the islands to Australia. The Commonwealth government then assumed legislative responsibility for the islands. However, Commonwealth acts were not to apply on the islands unless it was expressly requested that they do so. The power to make ordinances was reserved to the Governor-General. 
A review in 1992 of the legislative arrangements on the islands concluded that Western Australian law should be extended to the two islands, providing them with a living body of law. This recommendation was implemented in amendments to the principal acts. The Commonwealth retained the power to extend its legislation to the two islands and the Governor-General retained the power to make ordinances. A provision was also inserted in the two acts which applied Commonwealth industrial relations law where an industrial dispute arose. The interstateness, as then required by law under the act, which is otherwise to activate the relevant provisions, was removed because of the nature of the two islands. Under the new legal regime there was also provision for the Commonwealth to enter into service delivery arrangements with the Western Australian government to ensure the effective application and administration of the law in force in the territories. Agreements have since been reached with most Western Australian government agencies.
At the time the new regime was introduced, the Western Australian government became concerned with the operation of Commonwealth industrial relations law on the islands, as many Western Australian public sector employees would be working on the islands under arrangements established by those service delivery agreements. They were also concerned that a dispute arising on the islands could, for example, spread back to Western Australia, fulfilling the interstateness requirement and bringing into operation the Commonwealth industrial relations act. For those reasons, the Western Australian government sought to have WA public sector employees working on the islands exempted from the operation of the Commonwealth industrial relations law. In responding to this, the Australian Council of Trade Unions—and I had some responsibility at the time in my former occupation—gave a commitment to Western Australia that neither the ACTU nor the Trades and Labour Council would seek to apply conditions of work on the island to mainland employees.
However, unfortunately, the Western Australia government was not satisfied with those undertakings. It therefore sought to enter into formal negotiations with the federal government and the ACTU. Accordingly, early in 1994 it was agreed that the Christmas and Cocos islands acts would be amended to apply their industrial relations provisions in relation to WA public servants. The implementation of this agreement did not occur before the 1996 federal election, and in 1996 it became caught up with the introduction of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Unfortunately, we have not heard from the government on this issue since. The truth of the matter is that for those reasons, that is, its failure to act after the 1996 election, the issues remain unresolved—hence the current bill.
The problem is that today we have before us an attempt to bring Christmas and Cocos islands under the Western Australian industrial relations scheme which, I might say, was clearly not the intent of discussions entered into by me as president and by members of the Western Australian government back in 1995. The amendments contained in this bill are not only to supply Commonwealth industrial relations law operating on the islands with regard to WA public servants; they are also, unfortunately, broad enough to cover all private sector workers as well. This goes far beyond the original agreement of the Western Australian government, the Commonwealth and the union representatives.
In complete disregard for an agreement that was reached after extensive discussions, including meetings in Perth involving Commonwealth and state representatives, this government is now seeking to introduce a whole new industrial relations regime to these island communities. I argue that its contempt for democratic processes has gone further. There has unfortunately also been no consultation with employer-employee groups on the islands concerning these matters. That the government should ask anyone to support these bills for those reasons is untenable.
The opposition therefore does not support the overriding of an agreement reached between all parties concerned. The opposition also does not support this government's contempt for the communities that would be affected by the proposed amendments if they were to be carried by the House. The opposition does not support an extension of WA industrial relations law to Christmas and Cocos islands and will not support the bill for those reasons.
In addition to the schedules going to the industrial relations framework on Christmas and Cocos islands, there are also a number of other changes. I go to the question of parliamentary secretaries, better known as `jobs for the boys' in the Northern Territory, the friends of the coalition government. This is another matter of contention to the opposition in the bill before us today—the proposal regarding the creation of parliamentary secretaries in the Northern Territory parliament. Currently in the Northern Territory there is one parliamentary secretary. In 1998, a Secretary to the Cabinet was appointed—effectively a parliamentary secretary's position.
The 1978 Northern Territory Act that set up the Northern Territory Assembly makes no reference to parliamentary secretaries. This means that the 1998 appointment does not carry a separate salary. It is not just about jobs for the boys but is also about perks for the boys in the Northern Territory. Nor can the appointee participate as a member of the Territory's Executive Council, and I understand the sensitivities about looking after mates on the other side of the House.
The Howard government here today is asking the House to basically give it the opportunity to create additional positions with associated perks and salaries for friends in the Northern Territory. As one who has worked in the Northern Territory over an extended period I understand that there are more extensive problems facing the Northern Territory and other rural and regional communities at this point in time and I wonder why that is a priority. But that is what the government wants; that is the priority in the bill this evening. It is not coming to terms with some of those special challenges—including, dare I suggest, the issue of the difficulty with respect to the legislation in the Northern Territory relating to imprisonment of principally Aboriginal young people at the moment. They are more concerned about not confronting those contentious issues but, more importantly, an amendment which goes to a question of giving them a capacity to appoint people to more perks and lurks for their mates in the Northern Territory.
I would have thought that they should have been more committed this evening to doing something for rural and regional communities in the Northern Territory, rather than giving the Northern Territory parliament the opportunity to merely allocate more financial resources to looking after politicians in the Northern Territory. It almost seems as though they have forgotten their priorities. Perhaps, for example, this money could be better spent on helping the victims of the devastating floods experienced recently in the Top End of the Northern Territory. No; it seems that we are not interested in those difficulties. We are more interested in trying to come to terms with how we appoint a friend to a parliamentary secretary's position in the Northern Territory rather than worrying about the devastating impact of floods or the serious concerns relating to justice in the Northern Territory.
The opposition will therefore oppose the proposal by the government, as before the House today, to give the Northern Territory parliament the capacity to allocate more money for their mates in the Northern Territory. In doing so I would remind the House that the Northern Territory is the most governed of all the jurisdictions in our country. Its legislature has 25 elected members, which in essence effectively means one member for every 3,200 votes. I might say that, in my own seat of Batman, the city of Darebin in each of its nine wards would have more than 3,200 voters. Yet we are now not content with having 25 elected members and a significant number appointed as ministers: we are now also going to extend it to create additional perks and lurks for a new position of parliamentary secretary. They obviously think that 25 paid representatives for fewer than 200,000 residents is not quite enough.
That is interesting because this is at a time when the Territory is facing some very serious issues. We have this government coming to this chamber and asking for money to go to the most governed of all jurisdictions. This is the very same government who brought Max the Axe into the Australian Capital Territory to hack away at the Public Service. It likes small government, or so it says. But when it comes to looking after itself, small government is all out the window. 
The opposition will therefore oppose the amendments going to parliamentary secretaries in the Northern Territory. We will suggest that the government sit down with its mates in the Top End to decide what it is going to do about the 15-year-old Aboriginal boys dying in jail, locked up because they have stolen some paint and a couple of texta colours. I would have thought that is a bigger priority this evening than worrying about parliamentary secretaries being appointed to the Northern Territory house of assembly.
We therefore suggest that the government focus on that at the moment instead of wasting the parliament's time with an offensive request for money for their mates at a time when the Northern Territory is facing such serious issues. I suppose, when I think about it, it would have been more appropriate this evening to actually debate the issue of justice in the Northern Territory and its divisive impact on the Northern Territory community, rather than wasting the time of the House debating whether or not to have a few parliamentary secretaries in the most governed place of all constituencies in Australia at the moment.
Having made those comments, I go to the issue of what we are prepared to support with respect to this bill. The remaining amendments in the bill which we are concerned with relate to the implementation of the 1991 Madrid protocol on environment protection to the Antarctic treaty, and the changed quorum requirements for the National Capital Authority, which we regard as not controversial and which will therefore be supported by the opposition. We also support the minor amendments that correct drafting errors and remove gender specific language.
In conclusion, I say on behalf of the Labor opposition that we cannot and will not support the bill as it is currently framed. We believe that the bill disregards democratic processes and bypasses processes of consultation and negotiation. We contend that, from the Northern Territory's point of view, it seeks to misuse scarce taxpayers' money, money that would be better spent on rural and regional areas around Australia and money that those areas are crying out for—not hand-outs as we are going to give to the parliamentary secretaries in the Northern Territory but, more importantly, a capacity to build the infrastructure requirements of regional and rural Australia. We regard the bill as an insult to the intelligence of the Australian community. We think that it actually represents a further statement of the hollow promises of this government with respect to the serious problems that confront this nation.
This government should be concentrating on those serious issues Australians living in rural and regional areas are facing at the moment. The government should be rethinking its approach to the regional issues confronting Australia, an approach that has overseen the withdrawal of vital services to these communities. The Howard government must acknowledge what it has done wrong and make a genuine commitment to a new approach on the regional front. The opposition therefore challenge the government to get on with the task of providing some real leadership and working with communities to produce better outcomes. That would be better than wasting the time of the House this evening on a proposal which is about creating additional parliamentary opportunities for a small, select group in the most governed area of Australia—the Northern Territory. The opposition therefore clearly indicate that, whilst we will oppose the bill, when we go to the consideration in detail stage we will move amendments that oppose and delete schedules 2, 3 and 5 of the bill and, in that context, support that which is contained in schedules 1 and 4 of the bill.",REPS,<title>TRANSPORT AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,2000-04-03,"—The Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 amends a number of acts under the Transport and Regional Services portfolio to help rectify some specific operational and technical anomalies. A further amendment contained in the bill relates to the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988, which currently requires that the full-time member, normally the chief executive, must be present at meetings of the National Capital Authority for there to be a quorum. The amendments in this bill remove the requirement for the full-time member to be present at meetings for there to be a quorum when the full-time member has disclosed a pecuniary interest. These amendments are relevant and necessary changes to be in place for a situation where a full-time chief executive of the authority or a full-time chairperson is the member who declares a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in a matter to be considered by the authority and is therefore unable to be present at any deliberation of the authority with respect to that matter.
Under these amendments, if the full-time member is the chief executive and is unable to attend a meeting because of a declared pecuniary interest, a quorum will be formed by the part-time chairperson and two other members. If the full-time member is also the chairperson and the chief executive officer and is unable to attend a meeting because of a declared pecuniary interest, a quorum will be formed by any three members. Currently, parliamentary secretaries in the Northern Territory government—as the member for Batman has alluded to in a fairly crude fashion from the other side—are not members of the Northern Territory Executive Council and therefore are not eligible for remuneration for their services. Under the amendments prescribed, parliamentary secretaries will become members of the Northern Territory Executive Council and will receive remuneration, allowances and entitlements as determined by the Remuneration Tribunal.
These changes follow on from a letter sent to the Prime Minister in October 1997 by the then Chief Minister for the Northern Territory pointing out that the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 made no provision for the appointment of a parliamentary secretary to the Northern Territory government. One consequence of this was that there was no means of providing remuneration to the member of the Legislative Assembly who was performing the functions of cabinet secretary. The Chief Minister asked for amendment of the self-government act to provide for the appointment of parliamentary secretaries in the Northern Territory government and to enable them to become members of the Northern Territory Executive Council and therefore be eligible for remuneration for their services. The Prime Minister agreed to that proposal and it was an intention that these amendments be included in the department's Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment (Portfolio) Bill. The Office of Legislative Drafting was unable to provide the necessary resources to draft the amendments until October this year.
The bill amends the commencement provision of the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1992 to overcome a technical difficulty that prevents a proclamation being made for the commencement of the amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983. In addition, the bill amends the Christmas Island Act 1958 and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955 for three purposes: firstly, to remove the reference to a Western Australian court which has been abolished; secondly, to remove the application of certain provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to Western Australian employees who work wholly or mainly in the Territory; and, thirdly, to remove obsolete provisions relating to prisoners and accused persons. The bill also proposes some miscellaneous amendments to acts which contain drafting errors and gender specific language.
I note that the member for Batman made a few comments about rural and regional areas. It is probably timely to remind the House that it was not that long ago that the Labor Party was the government of the day and, in its enthusiasm in wishing to raise revenue in this country, it raised the excise rate from 6c or 7c a litre to 36c a litre. If there is one tax that impacts on rural and regional Australia, it is fuel excise. It is a truly regressive tax; that is, in rural and regional areas, the further you travel the more you pay. When you sit that alongside an urban transport subsidy, estimated to be about $6.5 billion in this country, you can see the sort of equity that you can expect under a Labor government.
The member for Batman made some mention of vital services. Much has been said in recent years about services to regional Australia. He made no mention whatsoever of the specific nature of any loss of service, and in my experience there has been very limited loss of service—and, in most cases, no loss of service. It is more accurate to say that under this government there has been an improvement, an increase, in services. I can point to Medicare agencies. I can point to the transaction centres. I can point to the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund, which has meant we have telephone services, particularly mobile telephone services, in Australia which a Labor regime would not have got within a bull's roar of.
I challenge the Labor Party to put on the table what they will actually do for regional Australia. It is a cheap shot in opposition to make these sorts of accusations. But in actual fact, until we see the colour of their policies, see the colour of their money, they can only be treated according to their previous form. When Paul Keating was Treasurer, one of his first acts was to abolish the fuel freight equalisation subsidy. His first act was to ensure that those people who lived in regional Australia paid significantly more for their fuel than did those living in urban Australia. Let us not forget those figures: the excise rate on fuel moved from 6c or 7c a litre to 36c a litre in the life of the Labor government, after collecting some $10 billion to $12 billion.
I will conclude by just making a few general comments about mandatory sentencing. In the context of what a self-governing territory is about—moving towards self-government—the coalition government does believe that it should dictate to states and territories what is their lawful and constitutional duty. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate for the Northern Territory administration, the Northern Territory government, and the Northern Territory people to make those laws and to vote in those members which they think most appropriate. It is not the role of the Commonwealth government to intrude upon those people who freely elect their own parliament. It is for us in the Commonwealth, who have this centre of government in Canberra, to facilitate the states and the territories in the exercise of their duly authorised power. It is a very clear principle in my mind that you should bring the laws and the authority of the state closer to the people, and that should be done through the states and through the territories and, wherever possible, through local government. I am a great believer in the separation of powers. We need a balance in this country and not a centralist government dominating and dictating from Canberra.",REPS,<title>TRANSPORT AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,2000-04-03,"—I am pleased to make a very short contribution to the debate on the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, which in effect tidies up a number of acts and helps rectify some specific operational and technical anomalies. I might say at the outset that, though the member for Batman has indicated that we will not be opposing schedules 1 and 4, we will be opposing that contained in schedules 2, 3 and 5, for reasons which my colleague has outlined.
I am particularly concerned about the amendments as they deal with the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 regarding specifically the discharge of sewage and disposal of garbage from ships in the Antarctic area. There is a technical argument concerning the commencement provision regarding the date to be fixed by proclamation being the day on which the Protocol on Environment Protection to the Antarctic Treaty enters into force. This happened on 14 January 1998 but a proclamation was not made by that date. Given the date that Australia ratified the protocol was in 1994 it could be argued that Australia has been in technical breach of its international obligations since 1998 by failing to ensure that it could effectively enforce the terms of annex 4. The proposed changes are intended to correct this situation. As I said, it was a technical situation but it is now being amended.
Behind these rather legalistic and jargonistic words is the desire to protect Antarctica—not only the landmass but the seas around it—as the common heritage of mankind. I suppose, given the pollution of the oceans of the world and the lack of movement in the seas surrounding Antarctica, one could well argue what would it matter if some sewage or other waste were disposed in the waters around Antarctica. But it is important. It is important that there be one part of the world that is not polluted, one part of the world where plastic thongs do not wash up or where waste is not deposited. Antarctica is an area of incredible beauty, pristine beauty. It is one part of the world where man's imprint has not been great, and it should be left as such. Just as we are returning to the mainland waste left by previous visitors to Antarctica, so we should support these measures—as the Labor Party does—that will prevent the disposal of pollution, be it sewage or anything else, in the waters surrounding Antarctica.
I now move to schedule 2 and schedule 3 of the bill. Schedule 2 seeks to amend the Christmas Island Act 1958. During most of the 20th century Christmas Island was governed by colonial administration in Singapore. Responsibility was transferred from the United Kingdom to Australia in 1958, and Christmas Island is now an Australian external territory. The 1958 act sets out the legal framework applicable to the territory. And, as the member for Batman said, it was transferred to Australia, not to Western Australia.
Schedule 3 amends the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955 in the same manner and with the same purpose as the Christmas Island Act 1958 discussed above in relation to schedule 2. The Cocos (Keeling) Islands were originally settled by John Clunies-Ross in the 1820s. Title to the island was granted to the Clunies-Ross family in 1886, subject to the right of repossession by the Crown for public purpose. Responsibility was transferred from the United Kingdom to Australia in 1955 and it is now an Australian external territory. The 1955 act sets out the legal framework applicable to the territory.
I agree with the reasons put forward by the member for Batman about why the ALP will oppose these schedules seeking to replace Commonwealth law with Western Australian law as it applies to industrial relations. The same argument put by the honourable member for Batman applies to schedule 5. While I was interested in what my friend and colleague the member for Grey had to say, he did go on at the end of his speech about mandatory sentencing. I guess this has been a wide-ranging debate, but I would just like to point out something to him. He made much in his speech about the right of the states and the territories to enact the laws that the members of their legislatures were duly elected to enact. That point is all very well, but it did not hold true when this parliament intervened some two years ago in Northern Territory law as it applied to euthanasia.
This is a basic contradiction that a lot of people on the other side of the House fall into on mandatory sentencing—it is right to intervene in one area of jurisdiction but not in another. That was a bill that I actually supported—I supported the right of the Northern Territory to pass that euthanasia legislation. You can employ the argument that the duly elected legislature of the Northern Territory had passed that law and that the Commonwealth therefore did not have the right to intervene, but those on the other side of the House argued that the Commonwealth did have the right to intervene. Now they are putting up a different argument. They are saying now, when it does not suit them, that the Commonwealth does not have the right to intervene. I might say that there is an element of inconsistency there. I just put that in to respond to the honourable member for Grey.
The member for Grey made another point about the Northern Territory and its legislature but, in so many respects there, the Commonwealth picks up the tab. We pick up a fairly hefty tab for the administration of the Northern Territory, be it for their parliament house or whatever. I think we do have some right to intervene, especially on an issue which is so damaging, I believe, for Australia and such a denial of basic human rights. As I said, the Labor Party supports two schedules and some of the minor changes, such as the language that has been tidied up. Of the five schedules being put here, we will be supporting schedules 1 and 4 and opposing or moving amendments to schedules 2, 3 and 5 for the reasons that my colleagues have outlined.",REPS,<title>TRANSPORT AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2000-04-03,"—I have quite a bit to say in my short contribution here about some of the issues concerning the question of water pollution, but seeing as the issue of parliamentary secretaries in the Northern Territory was raised by the member for Batman I thought I might have my two cents worth on that. It is continuingly ridiculous to see a debate going on in the parliament of the Northern Territory and that debate being duplicated down here in Canberra. When the member for Batman compared the Northern Territory legislature to his local council I think that was an interesting comparison in terms of the number of voters. But his council is not stuck on the other side of Australia in the way that the people in the Northern Territory are; but, then again, they do not have to put up with the Commonwealth government appearing every five minutes and interfering in their affairs either. If we do what the member for Batman wants us do, we will be setting out to interfere in those affairs again.
We keep on setting up situations in Canberra where, I think, we shield the Northern Territory from the impact of its own decisions. If you want to have a government in a remote place like the Northern Territory it should be allowed to govern. There is a great tradition up there, just as there is in my home state of Queensland, of Canberra-bashing. Whenever the evil bureaucrats in Canberra set out to interfere in activities of the Northern Territory, it provides, I think, a cushion for democracy in that state, and I do not think it is appropriate for us to continue to do that. We have put training wheels on that government up there and I think it is time those training wheels were taken off. I am aware that they had a vote against self-government. I think that was because there is an element of people up there who like to have their cake and eat it too. I think, fair dinkum, we ought to hand over self-government to them and let them be totally responsible for the decisions that they take. It is of course the responsibility of a democratically elected government to reflect the needs of its people. If those issues, like mandatory sentencing or anything else, become so significant that people want to vote the government out, they should. There should not be the opportunity for a democratically elected government to go and blame another government in another place for what might be seen as their misfortune. I think it is wrong of us to keep setting up that situation, and I think we should desist.
Meanwhile, one of the provisions of this bill is to look after the Antarctic environment, as has been discussed by the member for Throsby, in relation to the pollution of the sea from garbage, sewage and those sorts of things from passing vessels. This raises an issue about the sea and the environment and how much they contribute to the worth of our great nation. I note that when it comes to the issue of garbage, for example, there have been two successful prosecutions of vessels in other parts of Australian waters for polluting the sea with garbage. One of those involved the cruise ship Fairstar and another one, earlier on, in the Cocos Islands, involved a yacht that dropped garbage bags over the side. In fact in the case of the Fairstar, when garbage was dropped over the side, a lot of that garbage involved luggage labels. So they were in fact labelling their garbage, indicating whom the polluter was and where they could be contacted. Those prosecutions are definitely something that we need to undertake, but I think we need to review the value of the sea and access to the sea in all parts of Australia. 
I would like to bring to the House's attention the value to Queensland of the Great Barrier Reef in terms of the amount of Australian trade that passes through those waters and the potential for Australian trade to be severely hampered if ever there were an incident in which those trade routes were affected by, say, an oil spill or something like that. A situation in which trade through those Great Barrier Reef ports in Queensland was restricted because of an oil spill and the natural public outcry that would follow such an eventuality are things that we should bear in mind.
I have done a little bit of digging on that. If we look in Great Barrier Reef waters, there are several important points. I am indebted to the Department of Transport in Queensland for these figures, which have just been released. I will take it port by port. There are currently 10.2 million tonnes of coal going out each year through Abbott Point, 1.6 million tonnes of silica going out each year through Cape Flattery, 53.9 million tonnes of coal through Hay Point and 468,000 tonnes of sugar going out from Lucinda. Unfortunately, I do not have figures on the port of Mourilyan. Quintell Beach is handling 3,178 tonnes of general cargo. Thursday Island handles 70,292 tonnes of general cargo, and the port of Brisbane has 20.7 million tonnes of cargo of all sorts. There are 42.8 million tonnes going out through the port of Gladstone, and that in itself has a value to the economy of $3.1 billion. The port of Mackay is handling 2.3 million tonnes. I do not have figures on the port of Rockhampton either. Townsville has 8.1 million tonnes, including 4.8 million tonnes of imports and 3.3 million tonnes of exports. There are 1.1 million tonnes coming through Cairns.
Those are all significant figures and show that the industry is absolutely the basis of the Queensland economy and a very large proportion of the economy of Australia as a whole. Many articles have been printed and warnings have been repeated regularly by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, for example, that it is not a matter of if but when some kind of incident happens, whether it be a major oil spill or something of that ilk, in Great Barrier Reef waters. We could lose access to it. It is time that governments started making plans to arrange our shipping and our activity to tread more lightly in those waters and to protect that important asset, just as we are protecting the important assets that have to be exported and imported through that area.
I would like to remind the House that there is a developing port at Karumba, which is outside Barrier Reef waters, and the ports of Brisbane and Bundaberg are outside Great Barrier Reef waters in Queensland, but it is important that we keep in mind the need to look for development in those areas so that some of the current weight is taken off reef waters. I have looked up the value of trade going through those areas. If we take exports through ports in Queensland, $15,322 million worth of products in the year ending December 1998 went through all Queensland ports. Of that, $10.3 billion worth or 67.7 per cent of Queensland's trade went through Great Barrier Reef ports. I think that is a significant situation, and the state of Queensland ought to be addressing that and making preparations, just as the Commonwealth should, for the development of alternative ports. It is not that you would want to strip development out of that area, but we need protections for safety in that area and development in other areas to provide a more balanced level of trade.
We should remind ourselves in the process that in the past significant oil spills have occurred in Australian waters. Members would remember the Kirki incident in 1991, when 17,000 tonnes of oil were lost from a particular tanker over in Western Australia. In Queensland waters themselves, the Oceanic Grandeur in 1970 lost a total of 1,067 tonnes of oil in reef waters. I think it is something that we need to bear in mind. Just recently, in November 1997, there was the grounding of the Nol Amber, a Singapore registered container vessel. It was fortunate that the vessel was refloated from the area in the Torres Strait in which it ran aground without any leakage of oil. But it is a situation where we need to protect safety and, as the member for Throsby has said, it is an issue where we have to be on the lookout for ships of shame.
I will go over some of the situations in relation to those vessels. In 1999, 145 foreign vessels and one Australian ship were required to undergo detention as a result of Australian officers inspecting vessels for safety. In February this year alone, there were 241 inspections of foreign vessels and eight of Australian vessels. There is quite an effort going into identifying ships that have a problem and that may well cause a problem in our waters. The sorts of things we are talking about are vessels operating with holes in hatches and bulkheads or with inoperative oil valves. I think members from Sydney would recall that inoperative oil valves were a serious part of the recent incident in which the Italian oil tanker polluted the harbour of Sydney. That vessel had sailed through the waters of North Queensland with those valves inoperative, and a little while later it was the centre of an oil spill in the centre of Sydney. Other problems are that some ships are sailing the waters of the world with no radio, no distress flares and inoperative lifeboats. In one celebrated case, a ship was sailing along with a main engine that would not operate in reverse. Heaven knows what they would have done if they had encountered the Great Barrier Reef. Their only option would have been to crash into it.
In closing, I would like to mention the value of the coal export industry alone to Queensland. The value of exports of coal from Queensland in 1998-99 was $5.39 billion. The amount of employment created in Queensland through the coal industry was at 30 June last year 6,133 jobs in the open-cut mining industry and 2,428 jobs underground. This is an industry that is totally reliant on being able to export effectively through Queensland ports. We must make adequate preparation for the servicing of those industries. There will certainly one day be a problem in relation to shipping, just as AMSA keeps warning. We must make sure that preparations are made. Just as we are preparing through this legislation for the protection of the Antarctic environment, I think we should be making sure that we are protecting other important parts of the environment as they relate to Australia, not only in an environmental sense but also in an economic sense.",REPS,<title>TRANSPORT AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2000-04-03,"—The Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, with its cocktail of schedules relating to discharging of sewage in the Antarctic, industrial relations coverage for Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands employees, adjustments to meeting quorum requirements at the National Capital Authority and upgrading of parliamentary secretaries in the Northern Territory is as broad a range of schedules as you could find in one bill. I want to concentrate on the last of these amendments, relating to the proposal for parliamentary secretaries to become members of the Executive Council in the Northern Territory. The House would be well aware of my position in regard to parliamentary secretaries in this place.
We recently saw the House pass the Ministers of State and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, which provided for the further extension of political patronage to the parliamentary secretary system in this parliament. There was not a dissenting voice, except mine, in the House as the parliament converted the strongly arguable, unconstitutional position of parliamentary secretary into a de facto junior minister. The main problem is these junior ministers, complete with their extra payments, are not answerable to the parliament. They cannot be questioned by backbenchers on their duties—so much for their accountability. Not only does this office further separate the executive from the parliament, it increases the degree to which backbenchers on both sides are beholden to their seniors, living in hope of an executive position—albeit junior—that ensures their solidarity and meek acceptance of the party line, whatever they might privately wish to say on matters of conscience. And such matters are about us in spades in recent days.
And so to the Northern Territory. We cannot take the moral step of moving against mandatory sentencing, but we can endorse the creation of these parliamentary secretary positions in a parliament that has—wait for it—25 members. So we are attempting to legitimise the appointment of junior ministers who presumably will also not be required to answer any questions without notice from ordinary members in a parliament of just 25. At the moment, there are nine ministers in the Northern Territory, and this bill leaves open the number of parliamentary secretaries to be determined by the Administrator. There are 18 government members, and half of them are ministers. It can be assumed that maybe half of the balance of nine government members stand to be appointed as parliamentary secretaries—a job perhaps for all of them.
—This is their job creation strategy!
—That is the job creation strategy in the Northern Territory. What an absurd situation—all of these extra junior ministers then able to access higher payment but, importantly, not able to respond to questions from the other side. There will be none from their own side, because they are all executive, by the look of it. This potentially leaves anything up to 50 per cent or 60 per cent of the parliament not answerable to their electorate and constituents but answerable to the executive. A 1993 independent study of the role of parliamentary secretaries concluded this office of ambiguous constitutional parentage could well be seen simply as political reward to friends and allies. There is certainly not much room for same-party enemies in the Northern Territory's parliament. With only 18 members on the government side and nine of them ministers, almost all the remaining government members are in the front line for potential candidature for a junior ministry under this bill. The rationale for appointment of parliamentary secretaries in this junior parliament is allegedly to spread the workload of government. On that argument, on a pro rata basis we should have at least 50 ministers and parliamentary secretaries in this place. We are certainly on the way. It underlines how ridiculous, how self-indulgent, this argument is.
This is about patronage and political reward. It diminishes representative government and further concentrates executive power in a parliament and administration that is largely funded by the Commonwealth. At a time when we should be amending the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act to strike out mandatory sentencing of juveniles and children, at least, and re-establishing the integrity and independence of the judiciary, we are amending the very same Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act here tonight to provide more rewards for the political elite. What a set of priorities—looking after the financial and political interests of a select few, looking after human greed, while human rights and justice go begging.
According to the Northern Territory government's home page, at the moment the Northern Territory has one parliamentary secretary, but he is not a member of the Northern Territory Executive Council and thus is unconstitutional, illegitimate—as were this parliament's parliamentary secretaries until they were elevated to the ministry without any opposition, except from here. We are all supposed to pretend that they are really not ministers. Like those parliamentary secretaries who have masqueraded as junior ministers in this place over the years, any parliamentary secretary in the Northern Territory legislature at the moment is unconstitutional. Hence the rush to get this bill through. This is the real intent of this schedule. As the minister said, currently parliamentary secretaries in the Northern Territory are not members of the Executive Council. I would say that they are therefore unconstitutional, as they pay loyalty to the executive and not their constituents. That is the key to this, and that is exactly what happens. Anybody who would like to argue otherwise about the constitutionality I am quite willing to debate.
Now they are to become members of the Executive Council, and they will inevitably receive remuneration allowances and entitlements. What a rort. If you are on the government side in the tiny Northern Territory parliament and you do not win one of these gigs, you are going to be a very lonely person, having a feed alone in the cafeteria and looking across the room at the seven opposition members while your mates are at an Executive Council meeting. You may have one person on your side who, for whatever reason, has not been able to score one of these jobs. Such is the contempt for proper detail on the so-called need for Northern Territory junior ministers, we had a two-sentence explanation in the minister's introductory speech to this bill and a meaningless explanatory memorandum. There is absolutely no justification for this move to create extra executive positions in a parliament of 25 looking after the interests of just under 200,000. This is a territory whose budget is largely met by Australian taxpayers outside the territory, a budget currently enjoying almost $1.4 billion support from Canberra—more than Tasmania, which has just under half a million residents. In the case of the ACT, there are 17 members for 300,000 residents, there is $679 million from the Commonwealth and there are no parliamentary secretaries, probably because there are a few Independents to make sure it does not happen.
This legislation is all about legitimising and expanding these junior members of the executive, closing them off from questioning by backbenchers—those who are left and who have not been rewarded, that is. It is so outrageous that even the opposition in this place, which was all too quick and happy to support the upgrading of the parliamentary secretaries in this parliament, has decided this time it is just too much, too blatant and totally inappropriate at a time when the nation's attention is focused on far more serious business in the Northern Territory.
In the climate of the most passionate public debate on abuses of basic human rights in the Territory, the Howard government, with breathtaking lack of sensitivity, finds time in this parliament to legitimise political patronage. While it will not let the people's house even debate overturning the Northern Territory's mandatory sentencing laws, it has no problem opening the door to more lurks and perks for an already overgoverned territory. The majority of Australians oppose mandatory sentencing and almost 50 per cent support the Commonwealth overthrowing these unjust, inhumane and discriminatory laws—laws that are a blight on our country's oft proclaimed but often so shallow belief in a fair go.
I totally reject this schedule of the bill. I only support those opposition amendments so far as they relate to schedule 5. Unless the government excises schedule 5 from the legislation, I really have no option but to oppose the bill in total.",REPS,<title>TRANSPORT AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2000-04-03,"—I want to thank the previous speaker for his contribution and say that I agree with much of what he said. I have to admit an interest in that for a period of six years I was a parliamentary secretary of this parliament but, I might add, without the pay.
—You earned every cent you were paid.
—Every cent of what I got, which was nothing. So, whilst I can accept the merits of his arguments in relation to schedule 5 of the bill before us, I am afraid that I do not concur with some of his more general comments about the role of parliamentary secretaries. While it is not my intention to go into an advocacy of those positions at this time, I do want to make a point about the Northern Territory which was made by both the member for Batman and my friend. It is worth while pointing out that, when this matter was raised in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on 2 March this year, the Chief Minister was asked:
This Country Liberal Party government has asked their mates in Canberra to amend the Territory's Self-Government Act to provide for unlimited parliamentary secretaries. Each secretary will, of course, be entitled to a substantial pay rise. We already have 9 well paid ministers to oversee the affairs of just under 200 000 Territorians. There are far more urgent priorities in the Territory, calling for government funding, than a pay rise for politicians. Is this the Chief Minister's way of delivering a pay rise to his entire backbench?
The response from the Chief Minister, who I have just observed parading his skills on Four Corners, was:
Mr Speaker, I have never, since I've been Chief Minister, written to the federal government with regard to the appointment of parliamentary secretaries. That avenue is available to me. There is one parliamentary secretary, Mr Steve Hatton—
and I will comment on Mr Hatton in a moment—
assisting the Chief Minister on statehood. That position carries no—and I would emphasise—no remuneration, and no benefits.
The title that's been given to him simply is to ensure that everyone is aware that he is assisting me directly on this most important issue.
So in terms of the nature of the question, I know not from where it comes.
From that you would take it, I am sure, as I do, that there has been no communication between the Northern Territory government and the federal government about this question. I find that very difficult to understand, as I am sure you do. I know of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Chief Minister. He was a previous Chief Minister. He is perhaps the only Chief Minister, certainly in my experience, who has not waged a racist election campaign in the Northern Territory. Whilst I do not agree with him on many issues and we are poles apart on most, I have to say that I do respect him for the way in which he carried himself in the context of the election campaigns that he was participating in as the then Chief Minister.
I cannot say the same thing, however, for the current Chief Minister, his boss, who we saw tonight on television parading his skills. His skills certainly left me wondering whence he came. It is very clear from his performance tonight on national television that he is basically a man bereft of integrity and a man bereft of any compassion or understanding. In response to a question from the ABC about the issue of mandatory sentencing, `If you were to be proven to be in breach of the international conventions in relation to this matter, would you change your position?' he said no. I think that says it all about the Northern Territory's Chief Minister.
He has either lied directly to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly or we have got an unannounced gift from the federal parliament by way of a fiat to the Northern Territory government in relation to parliamentary secretaries. I have a piece of correspondence which I would like to share with the House. It is a letter to the Hon. John Howard from Clare Martin MLA, Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory. Because I am sure I will not be given leave to table the document, I will read it into Hansard. It states:
Dear Prime Minister, 
I am writing to you in relation to the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 introduced into the House of Representatives on 8 December 1999 which would if passed, provide for paid Parliamentary Secretaries positions to be created in the Northern Territory. 
There is no justification for the creation of paid Parliamentary Secretaries in the Northern Territory. There are currently 9 Cabinet Ministers in a Parliament of 25 members, representing just under 200,000 constituents. 
The capacity to create paid Parliamentary Secretaries for the Northern Territory is not worthy of support. Further pay rises for Territory Politicians simply cannot be justified. 
I have also written to the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator the Hon. Ian McDonald in these terms. 
Yours sincerely 
Clare Martin MLA
Leader of the Opposition 
That letter was written on 6 March. We are currently at 3 April and, as of today, there had been no response to the correspondence to the minister, Senator Macdonald, although advice had been received from Mr Howard when he acknowledged receipt of his correspondence that Senator Macdonald would reply. He has not. 
—He doesn't even answer questions in the Senate. 
—He is not known for his integrity, but I might just say a number of things. Where does this leave us? We have a Chief Minister who claims to have no knowledge of this proposal about parliamentary secretaries being put forward in the parliament. We have a Prime Minister who acknowledged receipt of correspondence and passed it over to the minister to respond to, and the minister has not responded to date. We have a piece of legislation before us which proposes to give an open-ended cheque to the Northern Territory government to appoint as many parliamentary secretaries as they please.
My friend has just outlined in a very considered way what that means in the context of the Northern Territory. We have currently 18 government members, nine of whom are ministers, one of whom is the Speaker and one of whom is the whip. That leaves seven members, one of whom is a parliamentary secretary unpaid. That leaves six. What are they proposing?
—Do you want to go back to an Administrator?
—They have one of them, too.
—For the purposes of the member—
 (Mr Mossfield)—Order! I ask members to address their remarks through the chair. 
—Through the chair, for your edification, they have an Administrator. For your edification, this parliament, as a result of the 1978 self-government act, has the ability to override each and every piece of legislation of the Northern Territory. Until you understand what the regime is here, don't offer an opinion.
—Do you want to get rid of self-government?
—Parliamentary Secretary, I don't want to get rid of the government. 
—Warn him!
—Yes, get into him. This is one of a piece. It is the way in which this parliament is being treated with contempt by the government. It is a very small thing in the general scheme of things but a very big thing when you are looking at the way in which they are delivering largesse to their parliamentary colleagues in the Northern Territory.
I want to say very clearly that I endorse wholeheartedly the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I reject absolutely the notion that we should provide an open-ended commitment to the Northern Territory government for them to appoint as many parliamentary secretaries as they please.
It is worth while elaborating just for a moment. Under this proposal, a new section 34A would be inserted which would allow the number of parliamentary secretaries and their respective responsibilities to be determined from time to time by the Administrator. If there were a need for these parliamentary secretaries, it would be a debate which would be argued in the public domain in the Northern Territory. What we saw when the matter was raised in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was feigned ignorance by the Northern Territory Chief Minister. There has been no debate about this in the public domain in the Northern Territory, apart from the rejection by the Chief Minister: this was not a proposition he was considering. If he is not prepared to acknowledge it and advocate it in the Northern Territory context, why should we do it here? So I say to members of the government: do not be blinded by the way you are being misled by the Prime Minister and his ministers. This is just another example of how that is so.
The other matter I want to deal with is that part of the bill which seeks to amend the Christmas Island Act 1958 and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955. As has already been said by the member for Batman, we will oppose these proposals and we will seek to have them excised from the legislation. 
It is worth while contemplating just for a moment the historical facts, and I am aware of them because I was the parliamentary secretary responsible for territories at the time. I want to put this in another context and go to the point that this is not something which is accepted by the people of Christmas Island or the people of the Cocos Islands. There has been no appropriate process of consultation or deliberation about these proposals by those communities. 
When I have been in a position to discuss these proposals with people in the communities—and I was there reasonably recently—they have said that they oppose them outright and that they want to stick to the agreement which was made in 1994 between the then federal Minister for Industrial Relations, the Western Australian government and the ACTU which applied to the then industrial relations act 1988. It is worth noting, perhaps in the true course of the way in which this government deals with many issues, that there has been no consultation over this issue with the Union of Christmas Island Workers, the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union in Perth or employers on the island.
These amendments would potentially allow all island employees to move to the Western Australian industrial relations system so that all private sector workers would be brought under Western Australian law, in this case well beyond the original agreement of 1994. The employees of the island administration are Commonwealth employees. The amendments would result in two industrial jurisdictions on the island and there is absolutely no need for that at all. In fact, I would argue, and I have argued here before, that what we should be doing is transferring more responsibility into the hands of the residents of Christmas and Cocos islands, citizens of Australia, to make their own decisions, but we are far away from that. The government has moved to reimpose its order over the communities, and this is just another example of the way in which they are being dealt with. 
It is our view, and it is certainly my view, that in developing our relationship with these territories we should accept that they need to be able to make decisions themselves and that we should be moving along a path which provides for them the capacity to determine which laws of Western Australia apply and how they apply after consultation with the Western Australian legislature and with the Commonwealth minister. 
The point is that the people of Christmas and Cocos islands have no voice in the Western Australian parliament. Their only voice is through this parliament. They have not chosen to be nor do they want to be part of the Western Australian legislative system. They do not want to be part of the Western Australian political system. They are happy the way they are. In fact, what they want, and they have argued this consistently, is more autonomy. What we need to do is move towards giving them that autonomy, to move to a position in which the people of the Christmas and Cocos islands can feel confident that when they are dealing with the federal government they are dealing with someone who will actually take notice of what they say. 
Currently we have an administrative structure—there is an Administrator responsible for both Christmas and Cocos islands. That Administrator is responsible directly to the minister. There is no compulsion on the Administrator or indeed the minister to negotiate over issues to do with the community. There is no compulsion upon the Administrator or those he works with to seek a consensus over what should happen on those islands in terms of the legal regime. There is no compulsion on the government to see how these communities would like to advance themselves. 
I argue that we should be moving towards the establishment of an Indian Ocean territories authority. This authority would have the responsibility for making decisions over budget issues relating to the territories but would not override the independence of the shire councils of either Christmas or Cocos islands. Rather, the authority would have a coordinating responsibility and take a major role in promoting development and capitalising on economic opportunities in the region through a regional development board. This authority would become the minister's chief adviser on issues to do with the territories, and the current staff who are employed by the territories office, apart from the small cell to advise on policy issues, would be transferred to the territories authority and that staff with their budgets would move across so that there would be an administrative structure with which the territories authority could work. 
What this would do is provide the capacity for the territories' citizens to assume far greater responsibility for decisions that affect their lives without the heavy-handed interference of a remote state or territory government, which is currently the case. Whilst there have been investigations into this issue by the Commonwealth, they have not released their reports or their responses to reports which have been developed. We have yet to see what the government's view about the future vision for the Indian Ocean territories is, but we know by their past practice what it is likely to be. I have to say—and perhaps I have a jaundiced view about this government—that I hold no great confidence that they will advance the interests as they are perceived by the Indian Ocean territories' citizens in the way those citizens would like them advanced. 
We know from past experience—and this bill just demonstrates yet again what is likely to happen—that they will not be consulted. They will not have a role in decision making. Their views will not be properly accommodated. If this government are fair dinkum about advancing the interests of these territories, they will not impose on them by fiat, as they have done in this instance, their view and perhaps the view of their colleagues in Western Australia. What they will do is consult with the people of those communities and make laws which reflect their priorities, not the government's priorities. I see the member opposite arguing about self-govern-ment in the Northern Territory. How about a measure of self-government for the people of Christmas and Cocos islands? It is about time. ",REPS,<title>TRANSPORT AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2000-04-03,"—Two weeks ago the member for Parramatta sparked a debate about regional Australia. He made the valid point that hyperbole and melodrama will not solve the problems of depressed suburbs and country towns. In fact, it is a disservice to regional Australia to assess its problems through hysteria rather than factual analysis. It is a disservice to regional Australia to create a culture of complaint instead of a culture of solutions. It is a disservice to regional Australia to engage in crude pork-barrelling when more serious and sophisticated solutions are needed. 
I wish to use this Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill to make this point with regard to the Darwin to Alice Springs railway. I acknowledge that there are several passionate advocates of this project in the House. It is quite a shame, however, that their passion and commitment to the project has not been matched by the rigour of this government in applying feasibility studies. This project has not received proper scrutiny. It has not passed an adequate cost benefit analysis. In fact, it reflects one of the complaints of the member for Parramatta, that this government has a Field of Dreams approach to regional development: it believes that it can build it and they will come.
I take my lead from former finance minister and senator Peter Walsh. He wrote in the Australian Financial Review in March 1998:
The money is to come from the $1 billion Federation Fund ... and $100 million has been allocated for the Darwin-Alice Springs railway.
Since that is unlikely to be enough, another $100 million transfusion or two will be demanded and probably paid ... Little of this money will generate additional income or ongoing employment.
As it is, Walsh's prediction came true. Another transfusion of federal money was announced by the Prime Minister in October last year. The Commonwealth is now spending $165 million, the South Australian government, $150 million and the Northern Territory, $165 million—a total public outlay of $480 million, near enough to half a billion dollars. One would normally expect for the government to spend this amount of money only on the basis of a positive cost-benefit outcome. The feasibility of this project however has been based on electoral margins, not financial margins.
I first asked questions on this matter of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services in November last year. I followed up with a question on the Notice Paper on 17 February—the answer to which I received earlier today. This answer is a damning commentary on the competence of this government and its shoddy approach to regional development.
The first questions I asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services were as follows: on which study is the government relying to justify its $165 million investment? What cost-benefit outcomes were forecast in this study? Listen to the minister's reply—a minister of the Crown spending $165 million of taxpayers' funds: 
The Commonwealth's decision to contribute funds to the project was not based on any one particular feasibility study, but on the significant benefits that the rail link will provide to the Northern Territory, South Australia and the entire nation.
It is a justification by assertion, not by fact and not by a feasibility study. The minister can point to no feasibility study that this government is using to justify the use of $165 million of federal funds, nearly half a billion dollars, of taxpayer funding overall.
My next question related to his assertion that 7000 jobs could be expected. I asked: would these be generated in the construction phase or would they be generated on an ongoing basis? Listen to the minister's reply—a minister of the Crown spending $165 million of taxpayers' funds: 
The Commonwealth has not conducted a detailed analysis of the likely breakdown of the employment that will be generated by the rail link. The AustralAsia Railway Corporation in its 1998-99 annual report forecast that the project will increase national employment by 7,100 jobs in 2001-02.
There has been no independent study and no independent feasibility assessment. He is relying on the annual report of one of the agencies involved to justify nearly half a billion dollars of taxpayers' expenditure. This is policy making by ignorance, not policy making by information. It justifies the complaint of the member for Parramatta that this government has a knee-jerk, short-sighted electorally driven attitude to regional Australia that will not deliver results in any part of the country.
I then went on to ask a further question of the minister: what estimates does the government have for the potential of the project to improve Australia's export opportunities? I get used to the National Party rambling on in this place about export growth and what it claims to have done for the export sector. Listen to what its leader had to say on this question of export potential arising from a $165 million public investment: 
The Commonwealth has not conducted in-depth forecasting of the export opportunities that will be created by the project. However, it is expected that the rail link will facilitate the growth of export based industries.' 
Again, it is policy making by ignorance, not policy making by information. It is policy making by assertion, instead of policy making by a detailed feasibility study and analysis.
My final question to the minister was as follows: is it a fact that if the project has a $480 million public investment in it, then the average public cost per job is $69,000? If so, how does the average cost compare with alternative job generating projects in regional Australia, including through improved public investment and education? The minister's response again points to his ignorance and his lack of research: 
While a large number of jobs will be created during the construction and operation of the railway, it is not appropriate to compare the cost of each job associated with the railway with that of other projects. 
And get this one: 
This is because the railway is not primarily a job generating project. 
That is what the minister for regional development has had to say about the much touted Darwin to Alice Springs rail line: `This project is not primarily a job generating project.' We had the Prime Minister calling it the `steel Snowy'. The minister has revealed it to be the steel shonk. It is not a job generating project. He has pulled the rug from under the Prime Minister, just as the member for Parramatta pulled the rug from under him. This is a government in chaos on the question of regional development and a sensible policy approach. I repeat, `The railway is not primarily a job generating project.' It leaves all those taxpayers funding the half billion dollar investment asking, `What is it for? If it is not for job generation, if it is not for export development—because there has been no feasibility study into that—what is it for?' Why is the government spending this huge amount of public money on a project without clear objectives, clear goals and stated cost benefit for the country?
It really is absolutely amazing that the government conducts regional development policy on this basis. My question about alternative projects of course related to the fact that, in my electorate in south-west Sydney, there is a big transport and capital works project that has passed not one but two environmental impact statements and has been subject to not one, two or three but four cost-benefit studies and feasibility assessments of its employment potential. It is the second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. The research over a decade or more has shown that that project can generate more than 30,000 jobs over the next 20 years in a region starved of employment. Yet since 1996 this government has not spent a single dollar and has not made even a single decision about the progress at Badgerys Creek airport.
It is absolutely amazing: with no research, no studies, no feasibility, no export work and not even a job generating project for the Darwin to Alice Springs railway, the government spends $165 million of its own funds as part of an investment of half a billion dollars of public money, yet when it comes to Badgerys Creek which would create 30,000 jobs over a 20-year period—it has jumped through numerous hoops and passed numerous tests and studies—the government cannot even make a decision. The Australian taxpayers deserve better than this when it comes to regional development. As I mentioned earlier, the government members have created a culture of complaint about regional Australia. They are not coming up with a culture of solutions based on sensible studies and projects that have a cost benefit for the country.
This answer from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services represents a perversion of process. It confirms everything the member for Parramatta has been saying about this government: it has no policy framework, it has no clear vision, it has no sophisticated analysis and it has no decent policies for regional Australia. Of course I would anticipate the member for Kennedy and maybe a few others standing up and saying, `There goes the member for Werriwa again being economically rational.' Well, too right, I am being economically rational. I will tell you this: the alternative is economic irrationalism. What has that produced on the Darwin to Alice Springs rail line? It is policy making by spin the bottle and see where it might turn; it is policy making by speculation; it is policy making by assertion and ignorance instead of dealing sensibly with the facts.
We have enough white elephants in capital works and transport in this country. One international air terminal was built that now has the grand total of two international flights a week. That was built for electoral reasons in one of the nation's cities. We have had too much of these electoral margins driving policy instead of financial margins. We have had too many white elephants built in this country. There may well be good reasons for this rail line to be built, but at least the parliament and in particular the executive government should have had the decency to do the appropriate studies and to run it through the appropriate feasibility work before this massive public investment was made. 
It is incredible that the minister has now declared the railway is not primarily a job generating project. For all those unemployed people in Western Sydney who want the job generating project of the second Sydney airport—the decision this government dare not make— they will be asking, `Why can't we have some of the public money to get moving with a project that has long been on the drawing books and has long passed the appropriate studies and research?' I join with the member for Parramatta in condemning this government's approach to regional development. I hope he is going to add this shameful episode of the Darwin to Alice Springs railway to his armoury, I hope he is going to add it to his research bank of shoddy decision making and I hope he continues with his campaign to stand up for better policy making for the regions of this nation. ",REPS,<title>TRANSPORT AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Brough, Mal, MP",LP,2000-04-03,"—I want to thank everybody for their participation this evening in the debate on the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. In wrapping up the debate for the second reading I will make a few comments on some of the schedules and outline again, for the benefit of the House, the benefits of each of the schedules to the people of Australia and also repudiate some of the remarks by those opposite. Schedule 1 amends the commencement provision of the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1992 to overcome a technical difficulty that prevents proclamation being made for the commencement of amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983. Those amendments relate to the discharge of sewage and disposal of garbage from ships in the Antarctic area, and they are supported by the opposition.
Schedules 2 and 3 of the bill will make almost identical amendments to the Christmas Island Act 1958 and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955. The amendments will remove the reference to a court of Western Australia which has been abolished, make changes in relation to industrial disputes and repeal obsolete provisions relating to the removal and the return to the territories of accused persons and prisoners. Those opposite have said that this is somewhat of a witch-hunt by the government and their industrial relations push. There was a clear misunderstanding by those opposite which was demonstrated by the member for Northern Territory when he stated in the debate that this piece of legislation would involve all the workers of the Christmas and Cocos islands. This is simply untrue. I believe that is a politically motivated point. They often refer to the unions over there which are very strong—and so they should be; there is no problem with that whatsoever. This does not impact on those several hundred workers. This relates to no more than 10 per cent of the work force—those members of the work force in the Cocos Islands and Christmas Island who are actually Western Australian based employees and, hence, more often than not working for the state government. The opposition does not seem to support these changes which are intended to align workplace relations arrangements in the Indian Ocean territories for employers based in Western Australia with workplace relations arrangements on mainland Australia—or mainland Western Australia particularly. 
The opposition opposes these changes because they are different from what the ACTU supported during the term of the last ALP government and the Union of Christmas Island Workers was not consulted. The amendments will not affect the workers of the Christmas Island union; the amendments will affect only those people in the territories who are Western Australian based employers and their employees. Western Australian based employers and their employees should have the same choices between federal and state workplace relations coverage as they do on the mainland. That is what these schedules will do. We consider that this should apply in the private sector as well as in the public sector. Consistent with coalition policy, external territory residents should have the same choice, the same rights and the same obligations as Australians on the mainland. The ALP and those opposite clearly have another view.
Schedule 4 amends the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 to remove the requirement for the full-time member of the National Capital Authority, normally the chief executive, to be present at meetings for there to be a quorum when the full-time member has disclosed a pecuniary interest. This schedule is of a minor nature and will be agreed to by those opposite. 
The final schedule, schedule 5, amends the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 to provide for a mechanism whereby the Administrator of the Northern Territory may appoint parliamentary secretaries. This schedule came in for some criticism from the member for Calare as well as from those opposite. Let us make it clear that this bill does not make provision for remuneration for any parliamentary secretary that may be appointed under this legislation. That goes to the authority of the remuneration tribunal of the Northern Territory and for that government to decide. There is only one parliamentary secretary in the Northern Territory, and that is a parliamentary secretary to the cabinet, I believe. I find it ironic that a former President of the ACTU, who is always championing the rights of workers to be fully remunerated, would on this occasion decide that this particular worker should work unpaid. I think that is hypocrisy at its best, and I am sure that, if he were a member of the union, he would have a different point of view.
I also make the very salient point that the ALP member for the Northern Territory and the member for Batman are very much opposed to anything positive in the Northern Territory government because this is a CLP—Country Liberal Party—government and has now held power there continuously since its formation. There is very little likelihood that the numbers of the measly six or seven members—or whatever it is now—of the ALP opposition will ever be extended whilst they maintain the sorts of policies they have in the Northern Territory. It is simply sour grapes on the part of those opposite that they have not been able to be on the government benches since 1978 when self-government was proclaimed. It is okay to support parliamentary legislation for the Commonwealth. That was done unconditionally here, as the member for Calare said, by those opposite. But the ALP again becomes paternal in regard to the Northern Territory. There is no provision for any additional money for parliamentary secretaries. That is a mechanism, as I said earlier, for the self-governing territory, a decision for them, not for Canberra. It is up to the Northern Territory government and the Northern Territory remuneration tribunal. It is simply misrepresentation by those opposite, mischief making of the facts, to represent it in the way that they have—a typical approach for those opposite. I again thank all the members who have participated in tonight's debate and I commend the bill to the House.
