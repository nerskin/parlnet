Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (13:52):  I rise to respond to the Navigation Amendment Bill 2011. This bill implements two entirely different measures, which I will speak to separately. The first, schedule 1 part 1 of the bill, implements the Maritime Labour Conventionin Australia. The MLC was adopted by the International Labour Organisation in February 2006 and establishes minimum requirements for working and living conditions for seafarers working on ships engaged in commercial activities. The MLC consolidates and updates 68 existing agreements and sets minimum requirements for seafarers to work on a ship to ensure that they are medically fit, of appropriate age and have access to a regulated recruitment and placement system.


Importantly, the MLC addresses various conditions of employment for seafarers, to ensure that they have a fair employment agreement and are paid; have regulated hours of work and rest; have adequate leave, are able to return home and are compensated when a ship is lost; work on board ships with sufficient personnel, with safe, efficient and secure operation of the ship; have decent accommodation, food and drinking water provided under hygienic conditions; and have access to medical services on board and ashore.


The MLC will come into force in international law 12 months after the date on which it has been ratified by 30 ILO members with a total share of the world's gross tonnage of ships of 33 per cent. Countries with over 50 per cent of the global tonnage have already ratified the MLC, with the most populous flag states, such as Panama, Liberia and the Marshall Islands, already completing the ratification process. However, at this point, 30 ILO member countries have not ratified—in fact, to date it is only about half that many. However, it is my understanding, from consultation with industry stakeholders, that a number of other countries, including China, Japan and the member states of the European Union, are actively pursuing ratification, and it is believed that the MLC will reach the 30 member state requirement by the end of this year.


The implications for Australian shipping should the MLC come into force and Australia not have ratified its provisions are significant, and for that reason the coalition will not oppose the bill. But when a Labor government implements changes to labour arrangements on ships, everyone has good reason to be suspicious. Sweetheart deals and union thuggery over the years have delivered an Australian shipping industry which has been uncompetitive and in decline. There are now only 22 Australian-flagged ships left. In spite of the important role that shipping can play in both domestic freight and as a national carrier in our international trade, our shipping industry has been in steady decline.


It is, in my view, important that we express our confidence in the Australian industry and do what we can to make it return to competitiveness. That is especially important as our national freight task grows. Every time a ship retires from service or is not replaced it means more trucks on the road. So, in my view, if we had ships better servicing our capital cities, it would take pressure off the national highway system, and that would have major national advantages. I am concerned that this legislation, the government's carbon tax and its announcements about shipping changes last week do not hasten the demise of the Australian shipping industry and leave our nation's volume exports more exposed to low-priced competition.


The bill will remove inconsistencies between the MLC and the Navigation Act and will provide for the issue of declarations of maritime labour compliance and maritime labour certificates to Australian ships. In Australia, the MLC will apply to Australian ships of 200 gross tonnes and over, whether on domestic or international voyages. However, the requirement to carry documentation as evidence of compliance with the MLC applies only to ships of 500 tonnes and over engaged in voyages to or from ports outside their country of registration. The declaration of the maritime labour compliance certificate will list the requirements that must be met by a particular ship to meet the standards set out in the MLC and will list the proposed measures that must be undertaken by the shipowner for initial and ongoing compliance with the MLC.


The maritime labour certificate will be issued after the ship has been inspected and found to meet the requirements of the MLC. They will be subject to periodic evaluation and will last a maximum of five years before they must be renewed. The bill also establishes an inspection regime whereby all ships in Australian ports will be inspected by surveyors employed by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to ensure that the ships comply with the requirements of the MLC. AMSA will undertake inspections of foreign ships at Australian ports during routine port state control inspections to ensure compliance with the MLC. But ships carrying out the relevant certifications are considered to have prima facie evidence of compliance with the MLC. Australian ships will be subjected to the same requirements at foreign ports that are party to the MLC.


Australian law and practice generally already comply with the MLC, which means that ratification should have a relatively low regulatory and cost impact on the Australian shipping industry in order to comply. However, if Australia fails to ratify the MLC and it does come into force as expected, Australian ships in foreign ports could experience significant delays due to the extensive inspection requirements imposed on ships not carrying appropriate documentation. This would only occur in ports in countries that have ratified the MLC. Should Australia not ratify the MLC, ships would encounter delays at the ports of some of our major trading partners—for example, both China and Japan have indicated that they will be pursuing ratification. This would hinder our export business and could potentially make Australia a less attractive trading partner.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  I move:


That the House express its deep regret at the death on 13 September 2011 of the Hon. David Francis Jull, a member of this House for the Divisions of Bowman and Fadden from 1975 to 2007 and Minister for Administrative Services, and place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Members were saddened to learn today of the death of David Jull, a member of this House of very long standing, and a friend to many in this place on both sides of the parliament.


David Jull was born in October 1944 in a place fabled in Australian politics: Kingaroy. He was a Liberal and a lifelong member of the Liberal family. I know that the Leader of the Opposition will make some remarks on behalf of the Liberal family today. First elected in 1975 as a young MP, only the Hawke juggernaut of 1983 could deny him victory in elections. He was elected 11 times to this parliament, retiring just four years ago in 2007. He gave good years of service to the committees of this parliament, both to the House and to the parliament's joint committees. Most especially he served on committees for foreign affairs, defence and trade and intelligence and security. Many members in the parliament today would have worked alongside him on those parliamentary committees. As a minister David Jull experienced what Hasluck called 'the chance of politics', but he remained a faithful servant of the Howard government through the whole of its four terms.


David suffered ill health while still here, and I am sure we all remember that. Many friends of his on both sides of the House shared his great relief, and his family's great relief, at overcoming the cancer which he suffered in 2005. After 30 years of public service I am sure that he and his loved ones hoped for a much longer retirement than just four years.


On behalf of the government I offer my condolences and the government's condolences to his family, his friends and his former colleagues on this day

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:03):  I think all members of parliament were shocked and saddened to hear of the death earlier this morning of our friend and former colleague David Jull. I thank the Prime Minister for her gracious words of appreciation for his life and service.


David was the member for Bowman in this place from 1975 to 1983. After a brief interruption he was the member for Fadden from 1984 to 2007. When he left the parliament he was the fourth longest serving member of this parliament. In some respects, but not in all, the highlight of his public life was his service in 1996 and 1997 as Minister for Administrative Services. In those days this was a large and complex portfolio dealing with the multifarious operations of government. As a minister in a cost-cutting government, David was required to find savings and he used to tell the story that in those days any government driver who was on the road for more than seven hours was apparently entitled to a new pair of pyjamas at the taxpayers' expense. David rescinded this edict, but he never wanted to say how government drivers subsequently slept.


He was always disappointed never to have been minister for tourism, because tourism was his great love. He was a former deputy manager of the Queensland Tourism Corporation, but the fact that he was never the minister did not stop him from providing copious, welcome and helpful travel tips to all of his colleagues who sought them.


He did not languish in the parliament after leaving the ministry. For a decade from 1997 to 2007 he was the chairman of the ASIO committee, subsequently the intelligence and security committee. He chaired this committee during a tumultuous time for our country, a time when the security and intelligence services necessarily expanded massively to cope with the threats subsequent to September 11, and the war on terrorism. The fact that Australia has avoided any direct terrorist outrages in this country over this difficult period is in some way a credit to his good work as chairman of this committee.


David was a gentleman member of this parliament in every sense. He had a great temperament. He was, for instance, never bitter about the circumstances of his leaving the ministry, although many in similar circumstances would have been. He was great company, particularly when he had a cigarette in his hand—as he did perhaps more often than was good for him. Above all else, he had great judgment. He said back in 2007 that he entered parliament after 'the nation was absolutely wrecked by Whitlam, and I leave it during a tremendous John Howard-led period'. What wise words. It has been a lesser parliament since he left. On behalf of the coalition, I mourn his passing. I offer deepest condolences to his former wife, Erica, to Jay and Michael Goldman, to his sister, Gwen, to his brother, Peter, and to Peter's sons, Stephen and Andrew. We will miss him. He made a great contribution.

The SPEAKER
 (14:07):  I join the Prime Minister and that Leader of the Opposition in expressing my condolences to the family of David Jull. I think that Jully left this place a friend of all, no matter what their political persuasion. When I say 'all', he left as a friend of all of those that worked in this place. I do not think that there would have been a Comcar driver that regretted the pyjama story. It is hard to believe that no longer will an aircraft registration number be put into his travel diary. On behalf of all members who have not spoken, but will perhaps get an opportunity to do so later, I express my condolences to his family and friends. As a mark of respect, I invite members to signify their approval by rising in their places.

 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:10):  My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of her former view that offshore processing was costly, unsustainable and wrong in principle. I remind her of her current view that people have to be sent to Malaysia in order to destroy the people smugglers' business model. I ask: is she now admitting that the Rudd-Gillard government was wrong to dismantle the Howard government's 2008 border protection policies, policies that worked?

",HoR,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,5,1,question
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2011-09-13,"



Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:11):  In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, what the government has done is work through a new and innovative solution—that is, the Malaysia agreement—a transfer agreement, not something done under the Howard government, but something that according to the best possible advice that we have received is the strongest deterrent available to us now. 



Opposition members interjecting—




Ms GILLARD:
  To the Leader of the Opposition I say this: it is important that the Leader of the Opposition and the members of his front bench who are interjecting now absorb the facts of what is happening with people smuggling and asylum seekers. I know the word 'facts' always causes the opposition to guffaw because actually absorbing and understanding the facts is never their strong suit. 


But the facts are these: we have the clearest possible advice from the same experts who advised the Howard government that the strongest deterrence message we can send now is the agreement with Malaysia. We have the clearest possible advice to that effect. We have the clearest possible advice that having offshore processing on Nauru without having other measures like the Malaysia agreement would not have the deterrence value that we seek. We have the clearest possible advice to that effect. But I understand, that in this parliament and beyond, it will be controversial between the government and the opposition as to whether the best solution for people-smuggling issues is to have the Malaysia transfer arrangement or to have processing on Nauru. 


The government will maintain, standing on the basis of the best possible advice available to us, that we should implement the Malaysia arrangement. I expect the Leader of the Opposition to maintain that he opposes the arrangement with Malaysia and he seeks to have processing on Nauru. That debate will continue, but the issue that will come before the parliament and the issue that needs to be determined is whether or not executive government, any executive government, should have the power and authority it needs in order to put in place and beyond legal doubt offshore processing measures. I will be seeking to amend the Migration Act so that that legal authority is there. We will use that legal authority to implement the arrangement with Malaysia and to have a processing centre in Nauru. I fully understand if the Leader of the Opposition were ever elected Prime Minister of this country he would use that power in order to have processing on Nauru.




Mr Hockey:
  Processing on Nauru—that's what the Prime Minister said?




Ms GILLARD:
  Sorry, Malaysia and PNG. The Leader of the Opposition supports processing in Nauru. 



Opposition members interjecting—




Ms GILLARD:
  They are always on the substance and the issues of big principle, Mr Speaker!


And so the question that the Leader of the Opposition needs to answer is not whether he agrees with the government about Malaysia and PNG—




Mr Simpkins:
  Failure after failure!




The SPEAKER:
  The member for Cowan is warned.




Ms GILLARD:
  The question he needs to answer is whether he will support legislative amendments that enable executive government to make decisions about offshore processing. We await his answer, and I hope he answers that question not in the spirit of the interjections today but in the national interest.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2011-09-13,"



Mr SWAN
 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (14:32):  I thank the member for Deakin for that very important question, because tackling dangerous climate change is one of those fundamental economic and environmental reforms for our nation but most particularly for the jobs of the future. This year Australia is experiencing its 20th year of continuous economic growth. One of the reasons why we saw in the last national accounts that there was a resilience in the Australian economy, despite all of the headwinds we can see in the international economy, is that governments in this country, over the past 25 years, have fronted up and dealt with the fundamental economic reforms that are required to strengthen our economy and to meet the challenges of the future. That is why everyone on this side of the House is so proud of the clean energy package introduced into the House today—because this is all about the jobs of the future. We on this side of the House understand that in the 21st century you cannot hope to be a first-rate economy unless you are powered by cleaner energy, particularly renewable energy. That is why we need a price on carbon.


We on this side of the House accept the fact and accept the evidence that a price on carbon is the cheapest and most efficient way of driving that investment in cleaner energy and in renewable energy, because we will face up to the future. We will not turn our backs on the 21st century like those opposite. We understand the need to drive fundamental reform in our economy. If you look at the modelling that has been done you will see that it forecasts 1.6 million jobs through to 2020 in our economy, building on the nearly three-quarters of a million jobs that have been created. But those opposite are carrying on. They are dismissive of the importance of employment and they are dismissive of the importance of fundamental economic reform to drive the jobs of the future.


This government has a reform agenda when it comes to coping with the big changes that are going on in our global economy—the movement from West to East in the global economy, and the mining boom. That is why we are investing in skills and education; it is why we are putting in place the NBN; and it is why we understand that we need to put a price on carbon, like so many other countries around the world. It is also why we understand the need to spread the opportunities that come from these fundamental reforms.


That is why the Household Assistance Package that has been introduced in the House today is so important. Nine in 10 households will receive a combination of tax cuts and increased payments. Of course, all of this assistance to households will be simply clawed back by those opposite, as the minister was explaining in this House yesterday, because those opposite do not understand the importance of fronting up to fundamental reform and taking the people with them, nor do they understand the importance of fundamental tax reform. At the core of this package is the proposal to lift the tax-free threshold—to triple it to $18,000. This is a fundamental reform that recognises the hard work of so many people on low incomes, and in particular the importance of secondary income earners.


So what we on this side of the House are going to do is charge the large polluters and provide assistance to households and industry. Those on that side of the House are going to tax households $1,300 and hand it to the big polluters. That is just another one of their crazy policy propositions, which shows just how unfit for high office they all are.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2011-09-13,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (15:29):  What an extraordinary performance we have seen from the Prime Minister today. The Prime Minister of this country is demanding that someone who is alternately a 'precious petal' and someone who is a person of 'monstrous arrogance' should help her out of a problem of her own making. Let me say this: it is not the opposition's job to support bad policy from a bad government. It is not the opposition's job to save the government from a mess of its own making when there is an alternative, and when that alternative has been proven to work.


I am not so inclined under the circumstances of today's performance by this Prime Minister to rescue her from her own difficulties. It is not the job of the coalition and it is not the job of the opposition to rescue a failed and failing government. It is interesting that the first sign of discomfort from this Prime Minister—the first sign of gracelessness from this Prime Minister, whose every day in this place betrays a bearing unworthy of the high office she holds—was when she started talking about the visit to this country of President Obama. Let me make it absolutely crystal clear that the coalition welcomes the visit to this country of President Obama. We will always welcome a visit to this country by the President of the United States. The big question is: will this Prime Minister be around to welcome the President of the United States when he gets here?


The coalition has a very, very clear policy. It is a policy that has been proven to work. Our policy, in a nutshell, is offshore processing at Nauru, it is temporary protection visas and it is the option of turning boats around where that can safely be done. Our policy is a policy that has been shown to work.


It did work. It did work in the past; it can work and it will work in the future. When the coalition's policy was put into practice by the former government between 2002 and 2007 we averaged just three boats a year in this country. Just three boats a year! Since that policy was junked by members opposite, led by the former Prime Minister and the current Prime Minister, we have had at some stages no fewer than three boats a week. Three boats a year under the coalition's policy and three boats a week under the government's policy. I say to the government: go back to the policy that worked. Drop the stubbornness, forget the pride, drop the 'anywhere but Nauru' policy and go back to the policy that worked. If you had any respect for the welfare of our country, if you had any respect for the safety of boat people and if you had any concern to preserve good relations with our neighbours you would go back to the policy that worked. That is what members opposite should do.


The Prime Minister used to delight—when she had another job, and in another time—in putting out press releases. The press releases were invariably headed 'another boat, another policy failure'. There were not very many press releases, I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because there were not very many boats. Since this government and this Prime Minister changed the policy there have been 240 policy failures; 240 boats and more than 12,000 illegal arrivals in this country—all the fault of this government.


It is all the fault of this government because this government was not magnanimous enough to leave well enough alone. All the riots in detention centres and all the terrible tragedies that we have seen have arisen because this government was too arrogant, too proud and too stubborn to accept that its predecessors had it right. This is a disgraceful government—a really disgraceful government—and nothing better illustrates that than the squirming that we see from them now.


What have we seen from this government? We have seen a government find a solution and create a problem. We hear constantly from this Prime Minister the demand—she says she is asking—that the coalition adopt a particular policy. The Prime Minister is abusing us to adopt a particular policy. If she wants a bit of cooperation, what about facing up to some facts? The only reason the people smugglers have a business model is that this government created it. This government created the people-smuggler model when it abolished temporary protection visas and dismantled the Pacific solution.


The Prime Minister constantly says, 'Take the expert advice'. I have two responses to this: what did the experts say to her before the High Court decision? What advice did she get before the High Court decision? If she was following expert advice, the expert advice turned out to be not very expert. The other question I have for the Prime Minister is: what did she do with the expert advice, that she was given repeatedly in 2008, that to dismantle the Pacific solution would put the people smugglers back in business? Why did the Prime Minister and her former prime ministerial colleague the now foreign minister, completely ignore the expert advice at this time?


What we have seen from this government is complacency followed by panic. First of all we had the processing freeze which just caused the numbers in detention to go up and up and up. Then we had the lurch to the right that the former prime minister so presciently warned us about. Shortly after the member for Lindsay's jaunt round Darwin Harbour on a patrol boat, we had the East Timor solution—the solution that got lost somewhere in the Timor Sea. Then we had the Manus solution, a solution that was announced before it had been negotiated and which has never come to pass, followed by the Malaysian solution.


Let me say of the so-called Malaysian solution that yet again from this government we have had bad policy based on a lie. It is so typical of this government that we have had bad policy based on a lie—whether it is a carbon tax, whether it is boat people— 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  Order! The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw the word 'lie'.




Mr ABBOTT:
  Bad policy based on a deception. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may care to listen to and mark these words of the Prime Minister spoken on 8 July last year, in the middle of the election campaign:


I would rule out anywhere that is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention.


I am not going to call that a lie, Mr Deputy Speaker, but it was certainly a gross deception—yet another gross deception. Now this Prime Minister wants the coalition to connive at a policy based on gross deception. We will not connive at policies based on gross deception.


The Malaysia people swap is a thoroughly bad policy. What sensible government would go to another country and do a five-for-one deal? What decent government would send boat people to a country where they could be exposed to caning? Malaysia is a friend of Australia, but their standards are not our standards, and it is very wrong of Australia to send people who have come into our care, however briefly, to a country whose standards are so different from ours. Most of all, it is a policy that just does not work, has not worked and will not work. Look at the facts: this so-called deterrent has not deterred 1,000 illegal boat people from arriving on our shores since it was first announced. Four hundred have arrived since it was signed. Why should the coalition consider supporting a policy which has so comprehensively failed?


Malaysia is a proven failure. Nauru is a proven success. Let us be crystal clear: this is a Prime Minister who came into this House and did not tell a lie, but did say something that was grievously untrue. She came into this House yesterday and said 90 per cent of those who went to Nauru ended up in Australia. Wrong, wrong, wrong, Prime Minister. If you cannot get your facts right in this House, how can we expect you to get your policy right for the country? Some 1,500 people went to Nauru under the Pacific solution. Fully 30 per cent of them were repatriated to their home countries, 27 per cent went to countries other than Australia and only 43 per cent came to Australia. Some of them came to Australia after a very long wait in Nauru and that is why, in conjunction with other policies, it was such an effective deterrent.


This Prime Minister just cannot help herself. There is almost nothing that this Prime Minister says which is consistent with what she has previously said. She was against offshore processing: it was 'costly, unsustainable and wrong in principle'. Now we must not have offshore processing but offshore dumping, because that is what will happen to the people that she wants to send to Malaysia. Back in 2002 she actually supported turning boats around. She said:


The navy has turned back four boats to Indonesia. They were in sea-worthy shape and arrived in Indonesia. It has made a very big difference …


Last year she said:


… 'turn the boats back'. This needs to be seen for what it is. It's a shallow slogan. It's nonsense.


She supported turning boats around, she opposed turning boats around, but it is okay. Now she supports a virtual turnaround of boats. Just as Al Gore invented the internet: whatever policy she wants, she invented it. 


First of all she supported temporary protection visas. Back in 2002, Labor's policy was that an unauthorised arrival with a genuine refugee claim would in the first instance get a short temporary protection visa. At the beginning of last year she said, 'The Rudd government is proud of its reforms in abolishing temporary protection visas and in closing the so-called Pacific solution,'—which, at least in respect of Mannus, she wants to resurrect. 


The Prime Minister was ferociously against more onshore detention centres during the election campaign. Since the election, in the absence of the BER, the only thing that she wants to build is onshore detention centres. Of course, we were never ever under any circumstances going to send boat people to countries that had not signed the UN refugee convention, but now she cannot wait to get people forced onto planes and off them in Malaysia, a country that has not signed.


This is a floundering, desperate Prime Minister at the head of a divided and directionless government. It is her responsibility to get her legislation through this parliament. She is the government.

That is why, for example, in relation to irregular maritime arrivals, we have interdicted vessels more successfully. There have been far fewer mainland arrivals that went undetected under this government compared with the Howard government. Almost one in 10 irregular maritime arrivals landed on the mainland of this country under the Howard government. They landed in places like Darwin or near Cairns. In fact, even the state of New South Wales received vessels undetected under the Howard government's regime. I have to say, in defence of Customs and Border Protection and those great agencies that do such great work for this country, that they have indeed managed this issue very well.


Of course it is true to say that we are dealing with a significant challenge—a challenge that also confronted the Howard government and the Fraser government. It is a challenge about dealing with the movement of people globally, the displacement of people and their efforts to come to First World nations. Australia is one such nation—a nation which will indeed be a target for people who seek asylum—because we are signatories to the refugee convention. This is a country where people seek to come as they seek to go to Europe, the United States and other such countries. The fact is that we have been dealing with this issue for some time. It is true to say that this has been a very significant challenge for the government. What we are asking the opposition to do now is put the interests of this nation ahead of the interests of the Leader of the Opposition's career. What we are after the opposition to do now is join the government and ensure that the executive government of the day has the capacity to provide the best possible deterrent against allowing people-smuggling to continue in such a manner. That is all we are asking the Leader of the Opposition.


After the decision of the High Court it appeared, at least at that point, that the Leader of the Opposition was showing an uncharacteristic inclination to consider the situation by saying that he believed that the government of the day should be in a position to enact effective border protection policy. Unfortunately, since the time that he uttered those words he seems to have been walking away from his obligations to protect the interests of this nation. And that is a crying shame. We think that on this issue, where the Leader of the Opposition seeks to convince the people of Australia that he cares about border protection, he would join the government to ensure we have the best possible deterrent against the scourge of people smuggling, that we have the best possible deterrent against people being lured onto unseaworthy vessels on perilous journeys, that he would work with the government to ensure that we protected the interests not only of those desperate passengers on those vessels but also the personnel of Customs and Border Protection. That is what we would have expected a responsible and honourable Leader of the Opposition to do, and we still hold out some hope that sanity will prevail within the opposition to ensure that this government has the capacity to put in place the most effective deterrent as advised by experts—the same experts that advised the Howard government when they were dealing with such a challenge.


But to date we unfortunately have not heard that level of consensus. I know that by inclination and reflex the Leader of the Opposition will oppose, but I think he has now an opportunity to show that he does put this country's interests ahead of his own. What worries me most, and what will worry the people of Australia, is that the Leader of the Opposition will not support the government legislation to enact the Malaysian plan not because it will not work, but because he believes it will work. What would worry the Australian people is that this opposition leader would put his interests so far ahead of the national interest that he would prevent a plan that he has been advised would be the greatest deterrent to endangering the lives of desperate people, to allowing the people-smuggling trade to continue and to endangering the lives of Customs and Border Protection personnel.


As minister responsible for those operational agencies I can say that it worries me every day when Customs and Border Protection personnel are on the high seas, interdicting vessels in the dark and in very serious sea states. They are placing their lives in danger. We saw in April 2009, with SIEV36, that an explosion that killed five passengers could well have also killed members of our Customs and Border Protection personnel. Indeed, we saw on 15 December last year that awful tragedy with the foundering of SIEV221, the vessel that was holding people seeking asylum. They foundered on the rocks of Christmas Island, and up to 50 men, women and children perished. That was a very awful tragedy—a tragedy that would have been worse if it were not for the heroic efforts, dedication and professionalism of Customs and naval personnel who went to the aid of those who were still in the water and saved 40 people, plucking them directly from the sea. To do that took great acts of courage, and it worries me still that we will see more deaths if we do not stop these arrivals. I believe that the government—and, indeed, every member of this House who has a capacity to change the arrangements to ensure a greater deterrence—has to take some responsibility if we increase the capacity for vessels to arrive in this manner. It worries me that we have men and women in these vessels surveilling thousands of kilometres of water and indeed dealing with very serious challenges. And I do believe it is incumbent, certainly upon the government but also but upon the opposition, to consider that what we do or do not do has some bearing on the lives of our Customs and Border Protection personnel. I think that to date we have been fortunate that we have not lost a life from one of our agencies at sea.


I arrived on Christmas Island on 15 December to be told of that awful tragedy. And if not before, certainly from that day, I and of course other parliamentary and ministerial colleagues believed we had to put our entire focus on an arrangement that would lead to the greatest deterrent possible in order to prevent more men, women and children dying and that would prevent our Customs and Border Protection personnel from endangering their lives any further.


Indeed, for some considerable months the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in particular, engaged with the government of Malaysia to embark upon what I believe is a very innovative approach to having the strongest possible deterrent and to stopping the people smugglers from being able to lure people on vessels with the promise that they can get to Australia. It is that lure, that enticement, that leads to these tragedies.


If the Leader of the Opposition will not to listen to the advice of the department that says to him that this is the most likely way we will see a decline in, and a cessation of, vessels arriving in this way then it worries me that the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition themselves are putting their base political interests ahead of not only the national interest but, more specifically, the lives of men, women and children, and the personnel of Customs and Border Protection, who are confronted with these situations each and every day.


The Leader of the Opposition can continue to assail the Prime Minister and can continue to argue about what might have happened 10 years ago and five years ago. What we know is that in the last number of weeks—indeed, most recently last week—the Leader of the Opposition has been provided with the best possible advice that the government has received, which says to him that Nauru will not work. Whatever deterrent it may have had in some limited way at some point before the people settled in Australia, that is not an option now. The people smugglers see the Nauru option as the Christmas Island option, just closer to the mainland of Australia. Unfortunately, that cannot work, if it ever did.


I can run through all of the reasons why there were major deficiencies in that option. I can also, of course, point to the fact that there were thousands and thousands of people who arrived on our shores after the introduction of temporary protection visas. Right now, however, the most fundamental issue that the parliament has to consider with respect to border protection is whether we are going to have consensus around whether executive government should have the capacity to put in place the most effective deterrent to prevent the people smugglers continuing their trade.


We have to make sure we come together and put in the most effective approach to reducing the chances of men, women and children perishing at sea and ensuring that the chances of any of our own personnel losing their life at sea are reduced as much as possible. These are the things that now concern me as the minister responsible for the operational side of this public policy area, and I do not believe that it is incumbent upon the Leader of the Opposition to continue to play politics with this issue.


It is now time that the Leader of the Opposition thinks about what he is doing and considers the ramifications of not entering into an agreement to allow the passage of legislation that would give executive government in this country the opportunity to accept the advice of the experts from the departments who have dealt with this issue. That is something that I believe that the opposition leader must turn his mind to. If he is serious about wanting to be perceived in this country as a leader, as a person who puts the interests of the nation first, then he has no alternative, I would argue, than to stop putting his political interests ahead of the national interest.


So I have to disagree with the Leader of the Opposition; I do not believe it is the case that the Nauru option is viable. It did not work effectively, in my view. It also coincided with the greatest repatriation of people because of the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan and indeed the fall of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. It was a combination of factors that led to some of the repatriation that occurred, but the fact is that the people smugglers know that those who were not repatriated were settled either here or in New Zealand. That is not a deterrent. That is not something that is going to deter one person seeking to get on a vessel in Malaysia to come here.


I think, in his heart of hearts, that Tony Abbott knows that. In his heart of hearts the Leader of the Opposition knows that the Malaysian plan is the best possible plan. In knowing that, I think it is reprehensible and unconscionable conduct for the Leader of the Opposition not to allow the government of the day to enact the most effective plan that will protect the interests of this country, protect the efficacy of our borders, protect the interests of those people—




Mr Broadbent:
  It's not going to happen; you're wasting your time!




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  I hear the interjection by someone who supports onshore processing, which I do not think the Leader of the Opposition would be proceeding with. Mr Deputy Speaker, if I could continue without the interjections—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  Order! The honourable member will remain silent.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  This has been an area that has unfortunately ripped through the nation. There has been serious discord in our society for many a year as a result of this issue. It is one that we should never play politics with. The lives of men, women and children, of course, are endangered if we do not find the most effective approach to protect them, and the best way to protect them is to smash the business model—which is, of course, to allow people smugglers to say to them, 'Get on that vessel and you will get to Australia.' If we do not do that, and if the Leader of the Opposition does not support the government in that approach, then Tony Abbott will rue the day if he did not accept the proposition that we have to put the greatest and strongest deterrent in place to smash the people-smuggler model and to protect the interests of men, women and children; protect the interests of the personnel of Customs and Border Protection; and, indeed, protect the interests of this nation.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Before calling the honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I would remind the minister that under the standing orders he is supposed to refer to the Leader of the Opposition and all other members by their title and not by their name.

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2011-09-13,"



Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (16:00):  The debacle that is this government's border protection policy is a sorry tale of gross incompetence with shocking consequences of the type that has come to define this Labor government. The sad truth is that it was all avoidable: the revival of the people-smuggling trade; the overcrowding of the detention centres; the capsized boats; the deaths at sea; and the blow-out in costs as the government lurched from crisis to crisis. This was all of their own making. There was no shortage of advice—expert advice—warning this government that weakening the coalition's strong border protection laws would result in a boost to the people-smuggling trade. The boat arrivals had virtually ceased under the Howard government. The people-smuggling trade had been disrupted. But the government could not leave well enough alone—oh, no. They had to dismantle the Howard government policies that had worked.


Documents released under freedom of information laws to News Limited showed that on 25 February 2008 the government was officially warned by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship about weakening the Howard government's policies. The government was formally, officially warned by its own department that closing the processing centre on Nauru would lead to an increase in people-smuggling, and the government went ahead in any event. We know that the Australian Federal Police warned this government that changing the laws would make Australia a target for the international criminal syndicates behind the people-smuggling trade, but this government dismissed that expert advice. It could not resist the temptation to change the laws, such was its smug confidence that the coalition had got it wrong.


The government so took for granted the fact that the Howard government had stopped the boats and that there were about half a dozen boat arrivals in our detention network at the time the Rudd government took over that the government ridiculed and denigrated the Christmas Island arrangement. The member for Melbourne Ports, in July 2008, visited the Christmas Island detention centre, and this is what the member for Melbourne Ports had to say about the Christmas Island detention centre: he declared it to be akin to a stalag—a German prisoner of war camp—and to be an 'enormous white elephant'. One wonders how the member for Melbourne Ports views the camps in Malaysia to which this Prime Minister intends to send people who are seeking asylum in Australia. How does the member for Melbourne Ports describe the camps in Malaysia if that is how he described Christmas Island? Presumably the member for Melbourne Ports will vote against the Prime Minister's Malaysia five-for-one people swap. How could he—or any member of the government who criticised Christmas Island, Nauru and Manus Island—now support this Prime Minister's desperate and despicable attempts to cling to power by sending asylum seekers to Malaysia?


Within weeks of the visit by the member for Melbourne Ports, the government weakened the laws that had been in place since 2001, which reduced the boats to a trickle—in some years there were no boats. And then what happened upon Labor's dismantling of the coalition policies? The boats started arriving almost immediately, as the government had been warned. The government reacted with assurances that the boat arrivals had nothing to do with the change in laws. Labor ministers argued that it was a coincidence that the changes in the laws occurred at a time when there was an increase in push factors. The driver, they argued, was push factors in other countries—factors beyond the control of the Australian government. But the boats kept coming, and in increasing numbers. Before long the 'enormous white elephant' on Christmas island had to be reopened, and still the boats kept coming. The number of arrivals soon swamped capacity on Christmas Island, and then work began on opening detention centres on the mainland. That was in clear breach of Labor's pre-election promises and commitments. And still the boats kept coming.


The pressure from the people smugglers had grown and grown and grown on this hapless government. The impact of this government's decision to weaken Australia's border protection has started to impact on international relations, and that was an obvious consequence. Australia's relationship with Indonesia was still recovering from this government's arrogant handling of the Oceanic Viking crisis in October and November of 2009 when this Prime Minister announced her ludicrous East Timor solution without informing the government of Indonesia. Given the blundering of her predecessor in this area, one could reasonably have expected the new Prime Minister to tread far more carefully and diplomatically in the regional minefield of people-smuggling and processing of asylum seekers. But not only did she not warn Indonesia of what she planned to do; she did not bother to tell East Timor. The Prime Minister clearly took no expert advice. She certainly did not take any advice from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had warned her on the very day that she took his job that plans to build a new regional processing centre in East Timor for asylum seekers would be very badly received in East Timor. But, with breathtaking ignorance and arrogance, the Prime Minister announced to the Australian media that East Timor would host a regional processing centre. Members will note that she pointedly singled out East Timor because it was a signatory to the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. In her speech, with the original title of 'Moving Australia forward', the Prime Minister spoke of East Timor as the place for a regional processing centre because it was a signatory to the UN convention on refugees. She did make one quick call to President Jose Ramos-Horta but was ignorant of the fact that the president was not the head of the government of East Timor. It might have come as a surprise to some, but the fact that the Prime Minister made only one phone call, and to the wrong person, just brought this government's ineptitude to a new level. It might have made her a laughing stock in East Timor, but at least the Prime Minister of East Timor showed the diplomatic skill that this Prime Minister lacked by quietly distancing his government from this proposal.


Then the Prime Minister revealed her really tricky side after it became clear that the East Timorese were impressed by neither her plan for their country nor the manner of its announcement. She claimed that she had not referred to East Timor as a location for the centre at all. This was too much for most people, even veteran press gallery journalist Laurie Oakes, who said:


Julia Gillard just looks silly and slippery and slimy and shifty in all that and it is a very, very bad start to her prime ministerial career.


It has only gotten worse. The Prime Minister attempted to back down from her back down, insisting that she was in fact in discussion with East Timor but with no other nation. Then the parliament of East Timor passed a unanimous resolution rejecting the Prime Minister's proposal. The East Timorese representatives made repeated statements, using careful diplomacy, that they did not want this regional processing centre foisted upon them, but the Prime Minister refused to acknowledge these concerns. Her behaviour verged on bullying as she maintained for months that negotiations were underway. One commentator dubbed it 'zombie diplomacy', an initiative that is technically dead but which the government is unable to officially kill because of the embarrassment and political fallout. Like Monty Python's parrot, the Prime Minister insisted the East Timor solution was not dead, merely resting.


This government has been caught out doing precisely what the Prime Minister said she would never do. She said that the government would reject any sending of asylum seekers to a country that was not a signatory to the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. In fact, the Prime Minister ruled it out prior to the last election. Now she has announced the Malaysia solution. Malaysia is not a signatory to the UN convention on refugees. This is no solution. It is temporary. It is not legally binding. It is a one-off arrangement. It represents no long-term solution to ending the people-smuggling trade at all. It will be exhausted once 800 people are sent to Malaysia. This is such overwhelming hypocrisy. She ruled out sending any asylum seekers to a country not a signatory to the convention before the election and now she wants to only send asylum seekers to a country that is not a signatory. There are 144 countries that are signatories to the UN convention on refugees and this Prime Minister chooses Malaysia, which is not a signatory.


The Prime Minister once stated a belief in onshore processing, but now she is embracing offshore processing. The Prime Minister ruled out sending asylum seekers to a country that is not a signatory and now that is all she is doing. (Time expired)

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (16:10):  This matter of public importance debate goes to the heart of the power of executive government. It is a debate that has arisen in the context of a decision of the High Court where the High Court has overturned what was believed to be the position of an act that was passed by this parliament. When an act is passed by this parliament—I am not going to lecture people on the separation of powers—the courts will interpret matters in an appropriate way. When this parliament decides on a course of action it has democratic legitimacy.



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  Order! The honourable member for Kooyong does not appear to be in his place.




Mr Brendan O'Connor:
  And he's an idiot!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The parliamentary secretary will resume his seat and I require the Minister for Home Affairs to withdraw that statement. 




Mr Brendan O'Connor:
  I withdraw.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the minister.




Mr BRADBURY:
  When the member for Berowra introduced a bill which was duly passed by this House and which gave the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship certain powers those powers were exercised in good faith in the knowledge that the parliament had supported the position—the course of action that was being taken. That had the democratic legitimacy of any act of parliament that passes through this place and the other. When a court takes a decision to overturn that, particularly on a question that goes to the heart of the ability of executive government to protect our borders, then it raises considerable questions for the executive in the first instance but also particularly for the legislature. The legislature has to come to terms with whether or not it  intends to amend the legislation so that its original intention is to prevail. That is indeed what this government intends to do.


There is a whole range of excuses that are being offered by the opposition—and it has not yet made its decision— as to why it says it may not go down the path of supporting this government in its efforts to ensure that the executive government has the ability to take the necessary action to protect our borders. There are two wings within the opposition on this question: there is the wing of respectability, those that feel the need to make a respectable argument, and then there is that wing led by the Leader of the Opposition that simply says that this is a question of how best to wreck a government and the very institutions of governance, and that is what it is going about doing. The Leader of the Opposition came in here earlier this afternoon and said, 'It is not the responsibility of the opposition to get the government out of trouble.' I tell you it is the responsibility of the opposition and every single member of this parliament to act in the national interest. In the same way as the member for Berowra brought forward that legislation before a previous parliament, members on all sides—and on our side of the chamber back then—joined with the member for Berowra in passing that legislation.



Opposition members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Forde and the member for Forrest are not in their seats.




Mr BRADBURY:
  They did that not because they saw that they were getting the government out of trouble; they did that because they saw, as elected members of parliament for their community, they had an obligation to act in the national interest. That is the challenge that each and every member of this parliament faces on every bill that comes before them. The challenge for the opposition will soon be upon them, and they will have to make the decision as to whether they go down that path.


The Leader of the Opposition came in and said: 'We will wreck. I don't care about what this does for future governments when it comes to the ability of executive government to act, and to act decisively, to secure our borders.' In a desperate pursuit of short-term gain, which must only be about trying to bring this government down short of its term, he said he would do that rather than empower the executive government to do what every Australian would believe to be its first and foremost responsibility—and that is to protect our borders and to manage our migration program. That is what is at stake.


The Leader of the Opposition came in here and said, 'We've got to get the facts straight,' and he pointed out a fact that he believed the Prime Minister had got wrong. Can I point out that the Leader of the Opposition said that 1,500 people were taken to Nauru under the Howard government's Pacific solution. He ought to get his facts straight, because 1,322 people went to Nauru and 315 went to Manus Island. If you cannot get your facts straight, do not come into this place and start accusing others of not getting their facts straight.


I mentioned there are two wings in the coalition. There is the 'let's wreck and bring the House down' wing. And then there is the wing that seek some fig leaf of respectability, and they argue that they cannot support Malaysia because it is not a signatory to the convention. I think the member for Cook likes to consider that he is the leader of that wing within the coalition, and we will hear more from him shortly, but those in that wing come forward and say, 'We cannot allow Malaysia because they're not a signatory to the convention.' I note that when this point was raised in relation to Nauru in the past, the member for Cook said it was a furphy. The Leader of the Opposition used the same word, saying it was a furphy. If that is the standard against which this government and any future government, an executive government, acting to secure the borders of this country, is going to be judged, then you should think very carefully about what that might mean for any future government when they seek to do what governments in the past have always sought to do and what governments in this country will always need to be able to do into the future.


The member for Cook, who likes to talk about how terrible this Malaysian arrangement is because they are not signatory to the convention and who is now holding up whether or not a nation is a signatory to the convention as being the key test—



Mr Morrison interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  The honourable member for Cook will have his opportunity.




Mr BRADBURY:
  is the same person that, back in 2010, actually suggested that there are better solutions. He mentioned Pakistan. I must have missed something, but Pakistan, as far as I am aware, is not a signatory to the convention.



Mr Morrison interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The honourable member for Cook will remain silent for the rest of the parliamentary secretary's contribution. The parliamentary secretary has the call.




Mr BRADBURY:
  His so-called solution was to do what he now calls a 'people swap' with Pakistan or Iran. Pakistan is not a signatory to the convention. Iran might be a signatory to the convention, but the member for Curtin, who just had a bit to say in this debate, said at the beginning of last year:


Iran continues to face domestic turmoil with ongoing security crackdowns on political dissent and reports that thousands of citizens have been detained while the media has been greatly restricted.


So Malaysia is such a terrible place and this arrangement is such an outrageous arrangement that they would be prepared to come into this place and strip the executive government of the power that it needs to act decisively on this matter, but they would be happy to see a similar arrangement entered into with Pakistan or Iran. These are the people who come into this place day after day talking about mandates. Well, an overwhelming majority of the members elected to this place went to the last election wanting to introduce offshore processing. Indeed, each and every one of them not only wanted to introduce offshore processing; they wanted to introduce offshore processing in a country that was not a signatory to the convention. So do not come into this place and lecture us about the human rights side of this debate.


We as a government believe that it is entirely appropriate for executive government to act to try and provide the disincentives that will stop people from hopping on boats and taking that treacherous journey . We think that that is important. We believe that the Malaysian arrangement will work. If those on the other side are serious about their obligations to serve their communities, to serve this country and to serve the national interest, then they should ensure that the legislation is amended to give effect to what they sought to put in place when they were in government, what this government needs to be put in place so that we can achieve the outcomes that we want, and what any future government will need if they are to effectively tackle this question of irregular movements of people in our region.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2011-09-13,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (16:21):  It is my understanding, and I think that of most people around this place, that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, after the recent decision of the High Court, offered his resignation to the Prime Minister. The member for Lindsay—the 'Commander', as he is known—may have just failed his audition to take his place. It is totally understandable that the minister would have offered his resignation, given the bungles and the disasters that have occurred in his portfolio, only equalled by those under his predecessor. However, it is not for his failure to have a crystal ball on the High Court that I believe he should chastise himself; it is for his failure of policy.


It is understandable that the Prime Minister did not accept his resignation because the Prime Minister would have well understood that the minute the minister walked out the door she would have to follow him straight afterwards. She was right not to make the minister for immigration the scapegoat for this government's failed policies, because she was equally culpable as the architect of this government's 'anything but Nauru' strategy that has taken them to this cul-de-sac, this dead end, of policy failure. It really matters little though who the minister is, or even who the Prime Minister is, in this government when it comes to managing this issue of border protection because the result is always the same: it is just one big mess and that mess continues. As people outside of this place speculate about who will be the Prime Minister of this country or who will be the minister for immigration, one thing is certainly true: you can shuffle this Labor deck all you want, every time you will pull out a joker.


The government say they want to break the people smugglers' business model. What they refuse to admit is that since the Rudd-Gillard government abolished the Howard government's border protection regime—against advice that they now come into this place and pretend is sacrosanct—Labor have become the people smugglers' business model in this country for the past three years. If you went to people-smugglers'' boardrooms, you would find the pictures of the former minister and Prime Minister joined more recently by the current Prime Minister and the current minister. They would be the most popular policymakers in the people smugglers' fraternity throughout Indonesia. Where was the apparent respect for this advice, which this government now claims it has, when they were presented with the facts, when they were told, 'If you dismantle this you will encourage the people-smuggling business again'? There were just four people—less than the number of fingers on one hand—in the detention network who had arrived illegally by boat. Under this government it has exceeded 6,500.


Since they abolished the Howard government's regime, 12,262 people have arrived on 241 illegal boats, the most recent of which was the Prime Minister's own personal tonne of policy failure as the hundredth boat on her watch arrived and is now being unloaded at Christmas Island. What we have seen from this government, after it abandoned the processes and the policies that had worked so effectively, has been a procession of policy failures. Firstly, the asylum freeze, which they have gone very quiet about on that side. This was the most discriminatory immigration policy introduced to this parliament since we had the White Australia policy. That is what came from members on that side. That is what this government did. They introduced a policy which said; 'If you're Sri Lankan, if you're an Afghan, we will not process your claims. Your nationality would determine your assessment status before the Australian government.' And they have the hypocrisy to give lectures about non-discriminatory immigration policy! That was a very black day for Australia when the previous minister for immigration and the previous Prime Minister—supported by a cabinet that included the then Deputy Prime Minister and now Prime Minister—implemented that disgraceful policy. That was strike one.


Strike two was the East Timor farce, which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has gone well into in her remarks here this afternoon. That was just simply embarrassing. Regional leaders were forced to endure the polite conversation of failed policy time and time again. Serious issues for our region had to be put on the backburner while this Prime Minister went through this farce, this zombie foreign affairs as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition mentioned in her remarks. The East Timor farce became yet another policy failure.


Then, of course, we have the Malaysian non-solution. This solution, as it was described, has become exactly the opposite. Four hundred people have turned up on an 800 cap since it was signed and almost 1,000 since it was first announced. Why and how this government thought it was a good idea to announce this arrangement before completing any negotiations is beyond this side of the House. It really took the incompetence of negotiating to a whole new level and betrayed their complete incompetence as a government.


These failed policies have led to what we have seen: a detention network which has descended into chaos and riots. More than four critical incidents, which include self-harm, violence and even death, occur in the detention network every single day. We have had budget blow-outs. The government tried to lecture us on budgets on the weekend. This is a government that took a policy that was costing less than $100 million a year and turned it into a policy that is costing $1 billion a year—and they want to lecture this side of the House on how to manage these matters and how to manage costs!


The former minister and the current minister ignored warnings time and time again as the boats arrived. I would really like to know this: after how many boats did it take for this government to finally work out that it had to, as they like to say ad nauseam, break the people-smugglers' business model, which is code for to reverse the pull factor effect, the magnetic effect, of their failed policies. After what boat was that? Was it after boat two? Because after boat two, the Canadian government introduced temporary protection visas. Was it after boat 100? Was it after boat 200? Was it after boat 230? After which boat did they finally work out that their policies were responsible for the mess that has happened on their watch?


They also ignored the warnings in our detention network. Last week I was part of the detention committee inquiry on Christmas Island where we learnt in October the minister, this minister, was on Christmas Island and was warned that the security fence connecting the two major compounds needed to be upgraded and CCTV cameras had to be put in the Aqua/Lilac compounds. That was the advice from Serco, from the Australian Federal Police and from the minister's own department. When riots broke out on 11 March that fence, which Minister Bowen did not fix, was the one they broke through. That fence was the one they fashioned weapons from. In that compound the CCTV cameras did not exist. And this is the minister who likes to lecture those on this side of the House about the need to listen to his department and take its advice. The Malaysian solution is being presented to this place and those opposite are expecting this parliament to overlook the policy failings of this government, the policy failures that are within the construction of this proposal, and simply give them a legislative blank cheque. I would consider that this minister has already abused the discretion he thought he had with these protections. These protections are an important principle within the Migration Act. It did not say that you could just declare a country and send them anywhere you like. It said there had to be protections in place. This is a minister who has sought to come back to this place and say, 'I do not need any more protections'—and in fact he said this in the House yesterday—'The protections are satisfactory.' He is happy with the protections that are in place, which see 94,000 people share one clinic and children who are sent there not going to public schools, and he is happy to see them go to a country where for five years 16 people were caned every single day, on average, for immigration offences. But he is happy with the protections. This is what he wants to put in place.


He came back to their caucus and to this parliament and said, 'I am not going to fix the policy; I am just going to look for a legislative excuse to deal with it.' And the zombies on that side of the House, as they paraded into the caucus the other day, simply rolled over on their Prime Minister and let her do whatever she wanted. We are not going to necessarily give this government a legislative blank cheque on protections. They need to address their policy failures, and they are manifest. (Time expired)

Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (16:31):  I heard the word 'necessarily' from the member for Cook and was quite excited by his slip of the tongue. Yesterday we announced that we would seek to amend the Migration Act to allow for offshore processing. If passed by the parliament, these changes would—to use the rhetoric of the opposition—help to stop the boats. Given their past rhetoric, those opposite should support such legislation. After all, they campaigned for it at the last election. Who can forget the tawdry leaflets with the red arrows coming down, produced by the opposition—'Real Action on Immigration'! It reminds you of something from the 1950s.


Of course there is a place for offshore processing in Australia's migration policy. The former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser had offshore processing in Hong Kong and Indonesia when we had the great surge of Vietnamese boat people. Offshore processing has its place in a comprehensive migration policy. It seems, however, that the opposition leader and his immigration spokesman, the member for Cook, who have huffed and puffed about stopping the boats, now will not support such legislation. Maybe his slip of the tongue in here, with 'necessarily', is an indication that they will.


This is despite the fact that the High Court has made a decision which should lead any cautious person—anyone who had the slightest doubt put into their mind by that decision—to at least change their mind, to think about it, to think that supporting such legislation might be necessary in the interests of the country, including the opposition's long-term interest.


Today the Editor-at-Large of the Australian, Paul Kelly, argued that refusing to support this legislation will mean that offshore processing will be doomed. Mr Kelly argued:


This week's Immigration Department briefings mean the onus falls on Tony Abbott to decide whether his aim is to stop the boats or merely sink the Gillard Government ... What is required now is obvious: Labor and the Coalition need to amend the Migration Act to restore power to the executive government to negotiate offshore processing arrangements in the region. It is an open and shut case—except for the politics.


What we effectively have now is the opposition in alliance with the Greens, saying that they will sink this legislation here or in the Senate.


Mr Kelly was not alone in his assessment. Yesterday, the Foreign Editor of the Australian, Greg Sheridan, wrote:


In rejecting legislative change to allow the Gillard government to revive its Malaysia deal for asylum seekers, Tony Abbott is making the biggest policy mistake of his life ... Abbott is in danger of performing a too-clever-by-half trick on himself, making sure that if he does become prime minister he will not have the legislative and administrative tools to fulfil his pledge to stop the boats.


The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, refuses to accept the proposed changes to the Migration Act, because instead of thinking about the national interest, indeed his own long-term interest, he has only one thing on his mind: short-term politics—'How can I best and most quickly get into the Lodge?'


Just this year the member for Warringah and the member for Cook wanted to play the game of fear rather than actually proposing a policy in the national interest. We heard the comments of the members for Warringah and Cook early this year on those who perished during the Christmas Island incident, with both making inappropriate and insensitive remarks about the funerals of those who died. These are the people who claim to be great humanitarians now, who are outraged about people being sent to Malaysia. What did the Leader of the Opposition say? 'It does seem a bit unusual that the government is flying people to funerals,' he told Melbourne Talk Radio on 15 February.


In an article from the Sydney Morning Herald on 17 February, it was reported that the member for Cook said that the Liberal Party should capitalise on the dislike of some of the boat people that were arriving in Australia. Mr Morrison told the shadow cabinet meeting of 1 December at the Ryde Civic Centre that the coalition should 'ramp up its questioning of ""multiculturalism"" and appeal to deep voter concerns about Muslim immigration and ""inability"" to integrate'. The Liberal Party's faux concerns about human rights and humanitarian conditions explained today are laughable given their history of using fear and their leaflets during the last election—the ones with the red arrows—about those people coming to our shores by boat.


We all remember the opposition's extraordinary ad with red arrows, indicating that hordes of people were coming to our shores from Asia and the Middle East. This was the official Liberal Party ad, 'Real Action'. Remember 'Real Action' from last year's 2010 federal election? I bet you that, if I asked my friend the member for Goldstein if I could table it, he would not let me table it. I seek leave, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, to table the Liberal Party's ad from the last election.


Leave granted. 




Mr DANBY:
  Excellent, thank you. Mr Abbott has claimed that his policies were necessary to prevent a 'peaceful invasion'. That is what he said in the Australian on 16 October 2009. An invasion? This kind of hyperbole is designed to win a few political points. It does not solve the complex national policy issues involved with border security and immigration. Those opposite do not seem to understand the complexity involved in this immigration policy. It is much more nuanced than just stopping the boats. Their solution, as outlined by Mr Morrison, the member for Cook, is to send those who come here to Iran and, as we heard today, Pakistan or to drag the boats back to sea.


Even more laughable is that the member for Warringah claimed during the last election campaign that he would have a 'boat phone' to ring border security as soon as a boat entered Australian waters. But even more astonishing is what the member for Cook said when interviewed by Leigh Sales on 7.30on 28 June this year after he had visited Malaysia. He proceeded to criticise the Malaysian government. Leigh Sales said:


You have just been in Malaysia and sat here and given me your assessment of the conditions there, in effect you are saying the Malaysian Government cannot guarantee the human rights of these people?


Mr Morrison said:


Well this is the practical reality, Leigh … and the Australian Government should not be going down this path when they know that that is the case. Now if they don't know that is the case then they should do what I've just done and I'm happy to share my experiences with them—


He is talking about the government. He continued:


I've been to Nauru and Malaysia and I know which is the more humane, cost effective and I know which is proven.


Unauthorised boat arrivals are an issue, but it is far from the end-of-days issue painted by the opposition.


Now we come to the business end of this issue. Will the opposition act in the national interest or will they pursue narrow, short-term objectives? The question is whether the opposition want to come together with the government. As the Prime Minister said, the executive arm of government has the right to make decisions on immigration and foreign policy. If the Leader of the Opposition does not believe this, he must explain to the Australian people why he is running away from his own announced policy. Why is he putting the immigration policy of Australia into total turmoil?


Our policy is about ensuring that Australia retains its rightful role in welcoming a reasonable number of the world's refugees while maintaining the security of our borders. In fact, we have a wonderful immigration policy under which we admit more than 100,000 people to this country. I strongly believe we are sent here to parliament to legislate not only for today but also with an eye for the future. We have a responsibility to look beyond short-term advantage and beyond the elections.


The opposition roared today with concern when I raised the prospect of the Liberal-Green alliance in the other place sinking this legislation. Plainly hatred of the Labor government outweighs any cool, rational examination of this issue, even from the point of self-interest by the member for Warringah. The member for Curtin was full of invective in her contribution today. The member for Warringah kept citing the following words, 'It's not in the opposition's interest to get the government off the hook.' But it is in Australia's interests, as Mr Kelly and Mr Sheridan pointed out. Neither the member for Cook, the member for Curtin nor the member for Warringah addressed the implications of the High Court decision. What happens if boats leave from Indonesia now without any legislation being in place to deal with the boats sitting in Indonesia about to come to Australia? The media and the people of Australia will judge the Liberal Party on this issue whether they back short-term interests or the national interest. It is a ridiculous situation when they are looking only at their own short-term interest, not at the national interest. (Time expired)

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2011-09-13,"



Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (16:41):  We have heard some grandiose language from those opposite today, from the member for Curtin and the member for Cook. We have heard phrases such as the 'dead end of policy failure', 'gross incompetence' et cetera. We have heard since the High Court decision comments by the self-styled and self-opinionated shadow Attorney-General about Nauru. For all of the opposition's criticisms leading up to the High Court decision, I do not recall the shadow Attorney-General pontificating that it would fail legally. I do not recall them saying that they knew the law, that they had expertise in that area and that it would fail on those grounds.


We did have the member for Cook parading around with a video outside some purported camps in Malaysia. This is the same man who in a Lowy Institute speech on 30 November 2010 put an alternative about Australian immigration. He talked of sending people back to Iran. I am not here today to defend Malaysia. It is, however, a democracy by any standards. It is a multicultural society. It is a former member of the Commonwealth and has some nuances of its court systems. We saw that a former minister who was victimised at least had some legal rights. We see these people parading around saying how dreadful it would be that people go back to Malaysia.


Obviously this government negotiated with Malaysia to ensure some protection for the people who were being sent back, but on 30 November last year the shadow minister for immigration, the member for Cook, said to the Lowy Institute that he would send people back to Iran and Pakistan—that he would have a 'returns policy'. They have the effrontery today to say that Malaysia was the end of Western civilisation. I think the kinds of associations we have with Malaysia, for all its faults, are such that they would lead us to say that it is a preferable policy to that which he put forward. They talk about dead ends of policy, but I wonder where we would be if he had had the chance to operate those kinds of policies back then.


We also had them come in here today with crocodile tears about people drowning at sea, about people who are self-harming and about people who are rioting. Somehow they have forgotten about Cornelia Rau and they have forgotten about Solon; they have forgotten about the millions of dollars the Australian taxpayer has had to fork out for those kinds of failures in detention. They are ignoring, as they well know, the kinds of reforms that were instituted at the beginning of the new government in relation to what happens in detention. The problems we still have in maintaining conditions there because of the numbers arriving are not easy for Labor or Liberal governments, but, as they well know, the kinds of protections that have been brought in since the change of government are very significant. Another point I would turn to is this disgust at the dismantlement of their policies. They think everything has collapsed because we got rid of temporary protection visas and Nauru.




Mr Entsch:
  Yes.




Mr LAURIE FERGUSON:
  I want to cite the member for Murray, a friend of the person interjecting opposite, who was their spokesperson at one stage. On 1 December 2008 she said, and this is a very timely comment I have to agree, 'The closure of Nauru and Manus Island … of course they had basically—what shall we say—outlived their need … I do not think we need to again have Nauru and Manus Island operating, because we've got of course Christmas Island.' Today they are saying that this government must operate Nauru and no other alternative in the whole world. Back then, as I said, on 1 December on 2SM, a reputable station, she made the comment that Nauru had outlived its time.



Mr Entsch interjecting—




Mr LAURIE FERGUSON:
  If the member opposite is not satisfied with that—there might be some mistake in that quote, I do not think there is—she went further on 16 April 2009 in the Australian, a reputable source according to the member opposite. She said about the Pacific solution:


We no longer have that requirement because we've got an alternative place which is in our excised migration zone, Christmas Island.


Today and in the weeks past the opposition will not cooperate with this government to get a policy to have some controls on the entry of boats to this country, because we will not go along with Nauru, and yet in 2008 and 2009 there was no need for this alternative.


They were getting very excited today about whether or not the Prime Minister had said that 90 per cent of the Nauru people came to Australia or whether it was 70 per cent to Australia and 20 per cent to New Zealand. What a minor issue that is in this broad nationally important issue. Quite frankly, as members on this side have said, it was no disincentive to those claimants to be sent to New Zealand. We all know, for instance, that Fijian Indians predominantly went to New Zealand to come to Australia because of New Zealand's more liberal immigration policy on recognising claims from Fiji. We know, despite some toughening up in social security in recent years, that vast numbers of New Zealanders, which they would become, would eventually come to Australia. Even if for a moment we give them some concessions with regard to that statistical irrelevancy then it certainly would mean that most of those people came to Australia. They talk about a blow-out of costs; they talk about deaths at sea. I do not recall any concern by them when many people died under their policies.


The other point is that this government, like any government, needs to have some controls over immigration policy. If we are to have a humanitarian refugee intake which reflects the problems of the time then we, the Australian government, must have some controls about who is coming in in that 13,750 people each year. If we do not, if the opposition does not cooperate with us in getting the government some control in this policy area, again this country cannot respond to the United Nations or even the UNHCR when they come to this government and say to us, 'These Bhutanese have been in camps for 17 years in Nepal. Will you help us take some?' Australia, Canada, America and New Zealand can say: 'Yes, we will help you because we have some control. We will determine some of the people in that intake.' Australia turned around and took 1,000 Bhutanese over a three-year period.


To give credit to those opposite, equally when the UNHCR said: 'Australia has not been interested enough in Africa. We have crises in Congo, Sudan, Liberia, Sierra Leone. We have many widows with large families that have no protection,' the previous Liberal government could turn around and say, 'Yes, we will set aside one-third of Australia's refugee humanitarian intake for Africans.' Similarly, in the last year or so, the current government has reacted to the request, again from the UNHCR, that we should take Burmese. In years past the government of this country, when requested by the UNHCR—by the way, the UNHCR says this country has the best settlement process in the world—could turn around and say that we will take some Burmese Rohingya who have been in camps in Bangladesh for long periods. We cannot do that if the opposition is making sure that we cannot do anything about boat arrivals. If they are digging in in some arrogant attempt at partisan politics to avoid supporting the national interest by giving the government of this country, Labor or Liberal, executive power to determine where we can negotiate agreements to send people offshore, then it is on their head. For all their rhetoric about security and migration policy which has international legitimacy, it is on their head if they do not cooperate with this government in making sure that the executive can indeed have power in this area.


We have seen, as I said, much rhetoric today from them. They talked also about non-discriminatory policy. They complained that for a period of time this government said that we would look at the situation in Afghanistan and in Sri Lanka before we will examine some cases. I know that during the election before last they went around to Middle Eastern Christian communities in the presence of migration department officials and they said to those very biased, very bigoted groups who have had a bad experience in the Middle East, 'If you elect us, not one Muslim will be let in from the Middle East.' They knew that they could not legally do it, but they went around saying that they would determine our immigration policy on a discriminatory basis. They have the hide to come in here today and say that—because there were conflicting views from various NGOs about the situation of human rights in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka and we thought there was a need to slow down processing to see what the state of their internal human rights was—that is discrimination when they went around before that election— (Time expired)

Mr SCHULTZ
 (Hume) (21:30):  The announcement of the allocation of funding under the auspices of the Regional Development Australia fund last week was yet another disgraceful illustration of this government's contempt for regional Australians. The Gillard government promised over $10 billion in funding for regional Australia upon forming minority government last year. Announced nearly two months later than promised, the allocation of funding that has occurred raises serious questions about the application process and the overall design and purpose of the fund itself.


Taking a look through Minister Crean's press release and the accompanying chart of projects that were deemed to be of such significance to rural Australia that they warranted taxpayer investment leaves me terribly vexed. I was reminded of Hanlon's razor, which states, 'Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.' Members of this House and the Australian people at large would be forgiven for holding this sentiment towards nearly every appalling policy this wretched government has dreamt up or failed to deliver. For this government, stupidity is not in short supply, but like all country people I can spot a con when I see one. Even with only one eye, I smell bacon on the government benches.


The Gillard-Greens government has allocated almost two-thirds of the RDA to Labor-held electorates or to electorates which have propped up the minority Labor government. This is despite Labor holding just 23 out of 62 non-metropolitan seats in federal parliament. Labor has left itself open to the charge that it cares more about sandbagging vulnerable Labor-held marginal seats against the torrential voter backlash it is expecting at the next election than according salt-of-the-earth rural communities the respect and investment they deserve.


I personally supported over six separate applications for funding under the RDA, from Boorowa, Goulburn, Mulwaree, Harden, Yass and Cowra shires and councils. These included the $2.2 million bid by Endeavour Industries for a new green recycling centre in Goulburn; the $3.3 million bid by Goulburn Mulwaree council to fund a new outdoor swimming pool—which, might I add, the Liberal Party committed to assist through a fifty-fifty funding arrangement at the last election; $12.5 million to go towards a new university campus in Goulburn; a $2.1 million bid by Boorowa shire to replace the Tarengo Bridge to allow Cunningar Road to be opened up as a B-double route, thus expanding economic opportunity for the shire and improving road safety; funding to upgrade Cowra Showground's facilities; $2.5 million for the Moppity Vineyards wine tourism development project, in partnership with Harden Shire Council; and $10 million towards the $23 million estimated cost to raise the Yass dam wall by three metres to meet the future water requirements of the exponentially growing Yass Valley shire. None were deemed to have met the criteria for funding under the RDA. In fact, several applications, such as Yass Valley shire's, have been rejected for the second time.


Feedback I have received from several shires and project managers is that the RDA application guidelines and funding eligibility requirements are tedious and require an enormous investment in time and energy in and of themselves. I can accept that some projects will inevitably miss out. But the editor of the Goulburn Post, Gerard Walsh, in his editorial which appeared in the Post on Monday, 12 September, made some pretty compelling points relating to the obvious flaws in the RDA process:


It's quite clear that the more detailed an application is, the better its chances of succeeding … Geelong Football Club (which received a $10 million grant for the continued upgrade of Skilled Stadium) would have the resources and corporate wherewithal to ensure a first-class, squeaky-clean application that would have proved irresistible to the independent panel and thus the Minister … So what chance do smaller players like Goulburn Mulwaree Council and Endeavour Industries have?


He goes on:


The RDA provides grants of between $500,000 and $25 million. But nowhere in its guidelines does it incorporate a type of ""means test"" on applicants to enable the panel to better assess bids not on their scale or presentation, but their merit and community benefit.


It's a flawed system if the likes of Geelong Football Club—which will share in the mega $1.25 billion AFL TV deal proceeds—are competing for the same pool of government funds under the same rules with genuine regional minnow entities such as Endeavour Industries—


which, I might add, is an industry which employs people with disabilities. Mr Walsh has hit the nail on the head. It is outrageous that rural communities with worthy projects are being deprived of funding because of a flawed application process which disgracefully favours big corporate entities with popular— (Time expired)
