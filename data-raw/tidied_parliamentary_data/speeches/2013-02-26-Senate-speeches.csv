Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:31): The passage of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012, which has the bipartisan support of the opposition and, I believe, also has the support of the minor parties and the Independents, is an important moment in the history of our nation. It is symbolically important, as the Prime Minister and others have said. More importantly, it is a measure which will have practical consequences. When it comes to Indigenous Australians, we have had, I think, too much symbolism dressed up as if it were practical achievement, too many gestures without outcomes, too many ceremonies in which many fine words have been uttered, all of which have made us feel better about ourselves but which has improved the everyday lives of Indigenous Australians not one iota. So, while not underestimating the power of symbolism in the life of a nation, symbolism without more will never be enough. Indeed, on occasions the obsession of some of the participants in this debate with symbols alone has almost been an excuse to neglect more useful practical measures.


So it is important that this bill does serve a practical purpose by committing both sides of politics to a course of action which, it is envisaged, will result in a successful constitutional referendum sometime during the life of—or perhaps at the conclusion of the next parliament—to give appropriate recognition of Indigenous Australians in our nation's founding document. If that comes about during an Abbott government, as I rather suspect it might, then nothing could be more fitting because there are few politicians in Australia who have shown a more long-lasting devotion and commitment to helping Indigenous Australians than Mr Tony Abbott. His has been a commitment manifested not merely in fine words—although Mr Abbott's speech on this bill in the House of Representatives on 13 February 2013 should live in history as one of the noblest parliamentary speeches ever given in that chamber—but, just as importantly, in practical action manifested by voluntary manual work over many years, unadvertised and in his own private time, in Aboriginal communities in Cape York. Both sides of Australian politics have a genuine commitment to this issue, but I am particularly proud that the leader of my party is a person whose commitment has, for so long, been manifested not merely in words but in the sweat of his brow, the dust in his eyes and the dirt under his fingernails.


I will say a few words about the provisions of this bill in a moment but before I do, I want to put it in its proper historical perspective. No side of Australian politics is without blemish when it comes to the treatment of our Indigenous peoples. For too long, particularly in the first half of the last century, their needs, their aspirations and their basic human rights were neglected or ignored by conservative and Labor governments both state and federal. Nevertheless, wise ministers from both sides of politics became increasingly sensitive to the needs of Indigenous Australians and, with changing attitudes and values, developed policies to redress Indigenous disadvantage and unequal treatment. Although the Labor Party, in the relentless prosecution of its one-sided view of history, claims the credit for these initiatives, the truth is that most of them were in fact pioneered by Liberal governments.


Sir Paul Hasluck, one of our nation's very greatest cabinet ministers, used the 12 years he spent as the Menzies government Minister's for the Territories between 1951 and 1963 to pioneer enlightened policies which, with the passage of time and the demonstrated failure of Whitlam-era welfarism, seem truly farsighted. Hasluck was only the first of a series of distinguished Liberal ministers for Aboriginal affairs, including William Charles Wentworth, Fred Chaney, John Herron and Mal Brough, each of whom achieved great advances for Australia's Indigenous peoples. It was of course the Liberal Party which, 42 years ago, selected, through a regular preselection process, the first Aboriginal Australian to sit in this parliament, a man whom it was my privilege when I was a young man to call a friend, the great Neville Bonner. It was the Liberal Party which, at the last election, again through a regular preselection process, selected the first Aboriginal Australian to sit in the House of Representatives, my colleague Ken Wyatt, appropriately the member for Hasluck.


At the state level, it is often forgotten that it was the Queensland National Party which selected the first Aboriginal Australian, Eric Deeral, to serve in a state parliament as long ago as 1974. Last year, we saw in the Northern Territory Indigenous Australians turn in droves to the conservative side of politics and elect no fewer than three new Indigenous members of parliament to sit with the Country Liberal Party.


The Prime Minister and other Labor politicians and apologists are fond of reciting the various steps to Aboriginal advancement, for which Labor governments claim to have been responsible—although many of those policies, by creating a culture of welfare dependency, in fact destroyed Aboriginal communities and retarded rather than advanced their development. But, curiously, the Prime Minister routinely fails to mention the greatest single step ever taken towards the goal of achieving equal rights and status for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians: the 1967 referendum, an achievement of the government of Harold Holt.


This was the vital moment which gave Aboriginal Australians true constitutional recognition, equal standing in the Constitution and full membership of the Australian body politic. Nothing that has happened before or since was as important as the 1967 referendum, yet Ms Julia Gillard routinely seeks to airbrush it out of history, no doubt because, like so many of the great progressive achievements in the history of Australian nationhood—indeed, like Federation itself—the Australian Labor Party had absolutely nothing to do with it.


This bill will, I hope, set in train a process which will culminate in a constitutional referendum as successful as the 1967 referendum—the most successful referendum in Australian constitutional history, by the way, which recorded a remarkable 'yes' vote of 90.77 per cent. In a sense, the referendum which this bill envisages will be the historical bookend of the 1967 referendum and carry to fulfilment that which the 1967 referendum began. But it will only succeed—and this is acknowledged by all participants—if it has widespread community support; not just bipartisanship—for referendums have sometimes failed despite having bipartisan support—and not just support from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities but support across the whole of the Australian community. Which means that it is just as important that people with conservative views be persuaded as people who consider themselves to be progressives. If that is to happen the proposal must be modest and the tone of the debate must be respectful.


Nothing is surer to defeat the referendum than if the public discussion of the proposal is conducted in a hectoring, angry or righteous manner. Every citizen who participates in the discussion has the same right to be heard because although this proposal has a special significance for Indigenous people, the Constitution belongs to every Australian equally. In particular, people of a conservative frame of mind who are sceptical and suspicious of constitutional change will need to be convinced of the desirability of the measure; and their scepticism is every bit as legitimate as the proponents' enthusiasm.


It is important to stress that the bill before us is neutral on the question of how recognition should be achieved. It does not propose a form of words. It is agnostic on the question of whether the recognition should take place as a preamble, in the substantive provisions of the Constitution, or both. The settlement of those questions and the finalisation of the words of the referendum proposal are matters with which the process set up by this bill will deal. In that regard, I remind the Senate of the wise words of the unanimous report of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. In paragraph 2.39 of its interim report, tabled last month, it said:


…the Committee does not underestimate the difficulty of securing the passage of appropriate amendments to the Constitution recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Only eight out of 44 proposals to amend the Constitution have succeeded. It is 36 years since the last successful referendum. Controversial proposals are invariably foredoomed to failure. For that reason, the committee cautions that if the proposal is the victim of over-reach, it will fail. While the Committee does not seek to limit the scope of public discussion, it nevertheless considers that only a relatively modest proposal is capable of engendering the bipartisan consensus which is a pre-requisite to success.


Our objective, in short, is to recapture the spirit of 1967. To do so, we must build community consensus in a careful, respectful, cautious fashion. If a proposal is put to referendum and the referendum fails, then that will create a legacy of bitterness and division which could last for generations. It would not only defeat our efforts, it would actually erode the important achievement of the 1967 referendum itself. It would be better to have no referendum than one which became a platform for divisiveness and ended in failure.


Our purpose is to ensure that we do not fail; that some time in the life of, or perhaps at the conclusion of, the 44th parliament, we will—as did the 26th parliament in 1967—have achieved a nationwide consensus which will give appropriate recognition to our first peoples and advance in a material way the cause of reconciliation.


In closing, I want to acknowledge the work of the members of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Peoples: in particular, the co-chairs, Mr Mark Leibler AC, and Professor Pat Dodson; my Labor colleague, Senator Trish Crossin, the Chair of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, who, if I may say so, has done more to advance the interests of Aboriginal people, especially in the Northern Territory, than any other Labor politician I can think of and whose premature departure from the chairmanship of the committee at the time of the next election will be a great loss—just as the circumstances which brought it about were a disgrace; and on my side of politics, my friend Senator Nigel Scullion, the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, and the only Indigenous member of the current parliament, Mr Ken Wyatt, the member for Hasluck. All of them are great Australians and all are committed to the same end. I commend the bill to the Senate and look forward to its unanimous passage through this chamber.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2013-02-26,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:45):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate over the bill that we are currently discussing. The Australian Greens have a long history of supporting and campaigning for Aboriginal rights and promoting constitutional recognition and reconciliation. Not only do we believe that we need to recognise Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our constitution; our policy is also to ensure that we have treaties with and recognised sovereignty for Aboriginal and Torres Strait people. We recognise that sovereignty was in fact never ceded by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. However, we do believe that the treaty and the sovereignty issues need to be addressed a bit further down the track. I will come back to those issues later on in my speech.


The Greens have worked tirelessly to progress the issue of constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We believe that not only is this important as a further step in reconciliation but also we need to include substance in those amendments. We have been committed to recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our constitution, as I said, for a significant period of time. In fact, I would go so far as to say that as long as the Greens have existed there has been support for constitutional recognition. It was in our agreement with the Gillard government that there would be a referendum either before or with the next election. We were very disappointed that in fact this could not occur, but we realised that it was not achievable and so acknowledged that we needed to put in place another process.


It is clear to us that there has been significant progress in the national conversation, but we are not there yet. There is still significant work to be undertaken to reach agreement not just on what would be a model that is supportable through a referendum but also to ensure that it is a good model. It cannot be just any model; it must be a good model or a good set of questions and good changes to our constitution. Very importantly, it must have the support of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. That was one of the key things that the expert panel took as one of its guiding principles: any model, or any question, for a referendum had to have the support of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.


I was a member of the expert panel and I would like to acknowledge the work of the expert panel, which I think—I probably need to display a bit of modesty here—presented a very good report to the Prime Minister in January 2012. I would like to acknowledge the people that put a year's worth of their life into this report, both those members of the expert panel and people who were part of the secretariat—some of whom I notice are in the chamber today. I would also like to acknowledge the work that they put in, because I know it was also a year of their lives that they put into this report.


While we are disappointed that we cannot achieve a referendum by the next election, we do acknowledge that this recognition by parliament is an important step along the path to constitutional change. The bill has provided an opportunity for reflection on the purpose of an eventual referendum, has enabled more consultation and has enabled a discussion by the parliament on the importance of constitutional recognition. As we have heard, we hear multiparty support for constitutional recognition and constitutional change. There have been many submitters both to the expert panel and to the select committee's inquiry into the bills. We heard from the National Congress, ANTaR, the Human Rights Commission and a whole range of people who made submissions to the inquiry.


I would like to read out a quote that is from the expert panel's report about constitutional recognition:


Constitutional recognition is an important step that must be taken in order to redress the discrimination and disempowerment Indigenous Australians have suffered since settlement.


There have been repeated comments, both to the inquiry into the bill and to the expert panel, about the need to address constitutional recognition and the discrimination that Australia's first peoples have felt ever since colonisation.


The Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law told the select committee inquiry into the bill that:


Recognition needs to deal with the fact that the Constitution was drafted on a premise of racism, essentially. It was drafted at a time when, in the words of our Prime Minister, Edmund Barton, we needed a power in the Constitution to enable the federal parliament to pass laws against 'the coloured and inferior persons' within the Commonwealth. Those words in the Constitution and that racist power have now been extended to Aboriginal people. Section 25 still recognises the possibility that states might enact laws that disenfranchise people on the basis of their race. Certainly from my dealings across the community, including with very conservative groups, it is that element of racism that most motivates people to think that they need to fix the Constitution to move beyond the values of the time.


ANTaR told the committee that:


… inclusion of language which recognises the need to remove or reform racially discriminatory elements in the Constitution should be added, confirming parliament's support for changes which go beyond the symbolic—again, a key recommendation of the panel. The inclusion of a reference to the need to continue efforts to close the social and economic gap that Australia's first peoples experience should also be a key feature.


The Australian Greens share this view. We believe that the final model that is put to a referendum should address the legacy of racial discrimination and enable the federal government to legally act to meet its often stated commitments under Closing the Gap but also under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which was often quoted to the expert panel. We agree that the joint select committee provides a framework for such triggers and other milestones to be delivered and acted upon. We believe that we need to maintain the momentum for constitutional recognition. The significance of having several of the parliamentarians who were on the expert panel also included in the committee we think is a good move in terms of being able to continue that work, but also in bringing new thoughts into the panel.


It is important to recognise that the bill we are currently debating does not include all the recommendations of the expert panel, but I understand from the select committee's terms of reference that the committee will not be limited in considering the recommendations. The words in the bill that we are considering reflect the carefully chosen words of the expert panel. Every word was carefully considered. I would like to remind people of the recognition outlined in the bill:


The Parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, recognises that the continent and the islands now known as Australia were first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


The Parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, acknowledges the continuing relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their traditional lands and waters.


The Parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, acknowledges and respects the continuing cultures, languages and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


Those are very important statements.


This is the first step to constitutional change and it is not just symbolic. At the moment our Constitution has no reference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, though it did previously. The Constitution used to say that the Commonwealth could make powers for all Australians except Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Fortunately, that was removed after the 1967 referendum. If you look at our Constitution you would never think that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are the oldest living culture on the planet, that they were on this land for generations and generations and that they are and were always the traditional owners of these lands. That needs to be in our Constitution.


Not only does this bill provide recognition; it also commits to placing before the Australian people at a referendum a proposal for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. It also acknowledges and recognises that further engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other Australians is required to refine proposals for a referendum and to build support necessary for constitutional change. Importantly, it commits us to building the national consensus needed for recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. That puts a huge responsibility on this place, on members of parliament, to engage with this debate and to help build consensus. I believe that we need to build that consensus not as a lowest common denominator but as something that Australia can be proud of, so we can stand tall and say that we are prepared to change our Constitution to provide recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and to ensure that the Constitution does not discriminate. It is also about enabling the federal government to continue to address the advancement the expert panel recommended; another word you could look at is 'wellbeing'. It is about enabling the federal government to continue to address issues around Closing the Gap and the historical discrimination of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Those are the concepts that were included in the expert panel's recommendations. They recommended a whole new section, section 51A, that acknowledges the need for recognition, and I have read out the words contained in the bill. I believe we also need to acknowledge the need to secure the advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. In the debate in this place over the next day or so, I do not want it to be forgotten that further recommendations were made.


The Greens will continue to campaign vigorously for constitutional recognition. We will continue to support and participate in the national discussion and the national consultation process, but we believe that the expert panel's recommendations should provide the basis for that. We are not saying they should not change; we are saying, 'We think you did a pretty good job; do not reinvent the wheel.' Let us find out what is capable of being supported. Let us engage in that national discussion. Let us build that consensus around what we do think we can take to the community. As someone said to me the other day, let's be courageous in our recognition. We do not get to change our Constitution very often, as was just highlighted. Out of the 44 attempts to change our Constitution, eight have been successful.


Some of the keys to success are multi-party political support, strong community support, clear questions. It will take leadership from all members of this place to engage in that national discussion. As I articulated in the Greens' additional comments to the select committee report, one of the issues of concern for us was the two-year sunset clause in this bill. The issue as put to us by members of the community, and particularly some members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, was that the sunset clause means that you may not care after two years about recognition. I thought long and hard about that and I have come down on the side of the argument that says we think we should have the sunset clause there because it will make sure it is a decision-making point, that it is not that the parliament does not care—in fact the parliament cares so much about this that we want to make sure that there is a decision-making point. So, we support the sunset clause. In our additional comments we did say that we would think and discuss this further. I have done that and do believe we should be supporting it, because we do need a trigger point to enable further discussion.


One of the other issues, and I feel that we really need to mention this in this place, is that there is a number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who do not want to support this bill. They do not think we should be discussing constitutional recognition without discussing the issues around sovereignty and treaty. I acknowledge their very legitimate concerns and, as I said at the outset, the Greens support the concepts of treaty and sovereignty. I participated in a large number of discussions as part of the expert panel process and I support the recommendations and the feelings of the expert panel—that is, I do believe Australia is not ready to discuss those issues yet. I have also listened to legal advice that says that if we do proceed with constitutional recognition it will not undermine the concepts later on when continuing a national discussion about sovereignty and treaties.


I do not think this bill does so, either. While I think it is very important to acknowledge those very legitimate comments of those who say we should not proceed with this bill and with constitutional recognition, the overwhelming flavour of comments I have had back from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is that they do want constitutional recognition. This is an essential step in the reconciliation of this nation—absolutely essential. That is why we do not believe that it is appropriate to suspend the discussion around constitutional recognition to address those issues, but I do want to acknowledge that those are live and real issues that this country still needs to deal with. A large step will be taken for reconciliation by changing our Constitution to acknowledge that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders were the first occupants of this land and that they have ongoing and unbroken connection and traditional ownership of this country. It is important that they are recognised in our Constitution. It is part of a healing for this country and, as I said, it is a part of reconciling this country, because we still have a significant way to go.


I fully acknowledge that it is not the only thing and that a lot more needs to be done before we address the huge gap in life expectancy and life outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We cannot pretend that this is the only thing that needs to be done. We are still making mistakes in our policies—I will acknowledge that, too. I am often the first in this place to criticise policies that are supposed to be for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and I do not believe that they are of benefit. Constitutional recognition is very important. We need to make sure we have a full discussion in the Australian community and build popular support for constitutional recognition. We politicians have a very important role to play. It is quite obvious from previous referenda that where there has been political disunity, those referenda have failed. We need to demonstrate what we expect the rest of the nation to do and that is having a fully engaged and respectful discussion around constitutional recognition. We will be supporting this bill.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2013-02-26,"



Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (13:05):  Late last year I was given the honour of being asked to chair the new Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and I accepted that challenge as an honour to pay tribute to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country and to finally start to forge some work in this parliament that I think will lead to a great outcome if this country embraces the changes to the Constitution that are needed. I wanted today to congratulate all those who have participated dutifully in the debate on this important piece of legislation, particularly those members of the House of Representatives.


Parliamentarians, community awareness and engagement programs and dedicated Australians should all be commended on this significant step towards improving our nation by finally taking up the challenge of recognising our first Australians within the Constitution. This piece of legislation is just the first stage of the important process in building a reconciled Australia with relationships based on mutual respect and understanding.


On the morning of 13 of February—just a few weeks ago—the House of Representatives passed this act of recognition. This act provides a path on which to build a foundation that precedes our collective objective and that is to acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as Australians in the Constitution.


We are all aware that today marks another major moment in the records of recognition for these people in our history books—the final passage of this bill through the Senate and the Australian parliament. Five years ago, the parliament witnessed former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd deliver his landmark apology to Indigenous Australians. This parliament took another historic step on the anniversary of that day this year, and we can see that the momentum for change, recognition and cross-cultural understanding is growing.


I note the shared commitment that is often lacking in political debate—I have seen that plenty of times in this place. But on this day, in this chamber, in the Australian Senate, and on this most important subject, of inclusion, Australians right around this country will witness once again bipartisanship between the two major political parties. The act of recognition is supremely important. That both sides of politics find a bipartisan resolution on this issue speaks for itself and it should speak to the Australian public.


When the two parties rarely agree on anything, and here we agree on this, it is a unique occasion and it should prick up the ears of people around this country. It should turn the heads of the nation and it should draw much-needed attention to this crucial campaign. When bipartisanship like this exists, when both major parties agree that recognition is long overdue, and when both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition offer such personal and heartfelt language, then we begin to see a positive response from the Australian public. We should capture that today and build on that. I want to commend the parliament for this remarkable effort. With continued leadership across the political spectrum, this campaign will result in the welcome acknowledgement of our history and a referendum that sees the improvements to our Constitution.


Firstly, I want to acknowledge the important work done by the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians, whose detailed and widely researched report—which I read in detail over the Christmas period—put in place the foundations to enable the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples to produce its report and for Australia to eventually progress constitutional recognition. In 2010, the Australian government announced the membership of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians. The panel included Indigenous and community leaders, constitutional experts and parliamentary members. It was co-chaired by Professor Patrick Dodson and Mark Leibler AC. I want to thank them for their dedication to holding a wide-ranging national public consultation and engagement program throughout 2011 in order to bring us to where we are today.


The joint select committee which I have chaired had a meeting with the co-chairs of the expert panel, where we explored their work and the outcomes of their deliberation. The work they have done is incredibly detailed. As I said, they held extensive consultations in towns and cities right across this country. They met with high-level stakeholders and engaged in a formal public submission process. Through these processes, this background work—this homework, I suppose, as a precursor to the work we are about to undertake—we can gauge community support. We can see, through the Newspoll that was commissioned to undertake research into this subject, that there is a groundswell and growing momentum to build on the outstanding work that the expert panel completed under the chairmanship of those two people. All of this work has been done at a resoundingly commendable level.


Then there are organisations like Reconciliation and their groups and campaigns, You Me Unity and Recognise. Their dedication to promoting constitutional recognition in communities across Australia has started, and it will be a great challenge. There is much work to be done, but they have been building awareness campaigns, providing the government and the public with valuable resource materials to help promote awareness for constitutional recognition, from cities to remote communities, from offices to backyard barbecues and in every home across this country.


The joint select committee held its inquiry, which is detailed on the website. We advertised the inquiry in the Australian, the Koori Mail and the National Indigenous Times. We received 24 submissions. I thank each of those who contributed. We held a public hearing in Sydney on 22 January. It is a day I will forever remember. With these contributions and the specialist work of the expert panel, we as a parliament have been able to pass this bill, which has three substantive parts that serve to eliminate discrimination and promote inclusion. Those three parts are: a statement—as Senator Siewert read out—of recognition by the parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; a requirement for the minister with responsibility for Indigenous affairs to commence a review of support for a referendum to amend the Constitution within a particular time frame; and a sunset clause, which provides that the act should expire two years after enactment. That gives us a definitive point in time by which we need to strive to achieve this work.


Along with most Australians, I appreciate the sophistication of this bill. It will change Australia's most important legal document, which is difficult to do. The public, whose vote this needs, deserve time to think about what we are trying to achieve here. As the expert panel has noted, many people still do not know about this important push for a referendum. There are, of course, those who condemn that the act takes too long when it sets out a two-year period to work toward a referendum. The government agrees, though, with the expert panel that it is important for this to be held at a time when it has the most chance of success. If that is going to happen within two years, then I am sure there are many of us here who would be delighted about that. But the public need time to understand the importance of this change, to be made aware of the many other countries, including the USA, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada, who have already made similar efforts to recognise their first peoples. While it is vital that grassroots organisations and advocates across the country get the word out to develop a movement for change, we as a parliament must not falter. We have to stay at the wheel. Now is the time for us to demonstrate continued leadership, to use our energy and passion to take a lead on this issue.


It is our chance, over the next two years, to show more recognition of Indigenous issues at state and federal levels in order to harness the attention of the wider Australian public.


I will take some time to touch on the nature of this symbolic statement. Some people may dismiss the idea that changing the Constitution will change things for Indigenous people in Australia. One only has to look toward the Northern Territory, where a great number of my constituents live with standards of education, jobs, health and life expectancy far below those of non-Indigenous Australians. Some might say that the symbolism of changing the Constitution will not change any of that. But I do not believe that to be the case. Being recognised in Australia's most important document means to be recognised by the people who live on the land on which you were born. For Indigenous Australians, it means to be recognised by the people who arrived on this land on which their forefathers were born, the rectification of the ignorance of the past and an acknowledgement of them as Australia's first peoples in a symbolic gesture. It gives them the credit they, with certainty, deserve.


The journey to recognition gives all Australians a chance to be part of this important improvement in ourselves as a nation. If Australians get the chance to enshrine that recognition, the foundation on which Indigenous disadvantage was born should cease to exist. Without a foundation, the structure crumbles. Sadly, it has been building for years—112 years too long. It is time to knock that structure down, and constitutional recognition will help with this.


As Jason Glanville said during his address to the National Press Club on constitutional recognition, disadvantage is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Social and economic disadvantage has existed for so long in this country that it may seem unlikely that words on a page could change it. But he went on to say that they could—and they will. He noted that, as with the many Indigenous Australians who had claimed improved mental and physical health since the 2007 apology by former Prime Minister Rudd, so too could the changing of our oldest legal document invite real hope and real change for Indigenous Australians again. We need to foster their right to excel, to dream big and to be proud of their heritage through recognition. This would, without doubt, instil a sense of pride. As Glanville said, quite simply, 'It is just the right thing to do.'


This bill reflects an intention to pursue meaningful change to the Constitution which echoes the hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It is not a substitute for constitutional recognition but it is a mechanism for all Australians to become familiar with the possible wording of a constitutional statement to be included in a future referendum. This bill is a part of a conversation that will continue, a conversation that needs to happen, a conversation which will encourage the community to continue discussions, debates and educational seminars in the lead-up to constitutional change.


The report handed down by my committee, all the work required to produce that report, the subsequent legislation and the laying out of the road we have ahead of us are all efforts of which this nation can be proud. Changing the Constitution is a way all Australians can unite to finally acknowledge our history and the great contribution made by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in this country. The Labor government's commitment of $10 million toward this campaign is a financial contribution, but I believe the positive momentum, the bipartisanship we have seen and the will of the people will be the true value we will see shining through at the end of the act's sunset provision.


We know that only eight of the last 44 referendums have succeeded. But there is a powerful precedent for change. We saw the Australian public achieve dignity in 1967 with the most decisive referendum in Australian history. That referendum updated the Constitution to include Aboriginal people in the census and gave the Commonwealth the power to make special laws for people of any race. Now is the time for us to become an even better Australia. I look forward to a future we can all be proud of. I commend this first important step towards a new beginning of unity and recognition and commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (13:19):  I too support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012. I thank the previous speakers and I have to say that this is, without doubt, the first time in my 12-odd years in this place that I have had a genuine sense of bipartisanship. We are excited by the prospects, we are nervous about how we proceed and we are talking genuinely with each other to ensure that our views are not polarised. It gives me a great deal of confidence that we, as representatives of the wider Australian community, can behave in that way. Hopefully that will help engender an appropriate environment for the community discussions to follow on the content of the changes. 


I am also excited by the fact that this bill will be the genesis of a stream of debates which are not only about the changes to the Constitution. This series of debates will engage people who have previously not been engaged. They will make people think about issues and people and circumstances which they have not thought about before. Constitutional change is necessarily a very complex issue and I invariably leave it to those people who are more focused on those matters than I and who are probably better equipped to deal with them. But this bill will be the genesis of a very important change. In the view of many Australians—and certainly people who have been involved in the changes which have already taken place—this is always unfinished business.


I will deal with some reflections on that later on. I suspect that it will always be unfinished business, and I think that necessarily is the case—and it is a good thing.


We have had several steps in this process. The previous Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, made an apology that was symbolic and practical—there was a significant practical element to it. That significant practical element involved Indigenous housing. It is useful to look back at that time to see what changes have taken place. I still think that from that dramatic day there are lessons for us for the way forward not only with this legislation but also beyond this legislation, which will pass today with the concurrence of everyone in this place—and that will be fantastic.


I have a confession to make. I was one of those who did not really think the apology would matter. I come from a background where I see every day that the gap between opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and those for mainstream people is so vast that I could not see the apology helping at all. That was my personal view at the time; I did not share it with anybody. I was cynical about it—all the trumpeting of change was wonderful but in myself I could not see what difference it could make. I guess much of that was because, as I said, my personal experience was that the housing of my mates was still appalling, their educational outcomes were not even comparable, there were relatively few employment opportunities for them in regional and rural Australia and their health outcomes were completely unacceptable. In that context I could never bring myself to be all that supportive. 


On the day of the apology and the days that followed I was able to be amongst my Aboriginal friends, and some of them shared their cynicism with me. How wrong we all were. The changes to the way Aboriginal people as individuals and as communities saw themselves after that apology were extraordinary. Plenty of individuals have explained to me how surprised they were at their own reaction as Aboriginal people. Clearly those who would, as I did in the past, diminish symbolism as something that does not have a role to play in closing the gap are quite wrong. We will go through this series of debates together as a group, and agreement will be the next step. It will be the third step in our becoming a united nation. That is extremely important. It will follow from the 1967 referendum, which was so significant, and the apology, which had complete bipartisan support. Now there will be this important constitutional recognition.


In this place I have beaten up all those who will listen with my views on Indigenous housing. The government would acknowledge that it has not done as well as it could have done, but those failures are characteristic across parliaments, across time. I do not think any of us would beat our chest and say how well we have done. In the shadow of the apology we made some commitments that we should have kept a better eye on, as Australians. It was only part of our discussions—it was over there; we had the economy and all these other things going. We have a great opportunity, as Australians, to make the same commitment to these practical outcomes as we have made to symbolic recognition. There is a practical element to the symbolism not only of today but also of the process as we move forward. Symbolism is a very practical way to send a clear message to those in this nation who I would describe as racist. 


I was lucky—I was brought up in a colourblind house by a wonderful family and I was not exposed to racism very much. As I grew up, every now and again I was exposed a little bit to people with racist views, but after they got tapped on the nose they generally did not share those views with me from then on. I just did not think there was as much racism as there actually was. The signal that as a nation we think this behaviour is unacceptable and that as a racist and somebody who shows intolerance and bigotry you are on your own, mate, is a pretty practical signal to send. Sadly, that signal does need to be sent. I was having a discussion with some people in Central Australia about racism and education. When you are in the desert, if you pick up a rock you will find underneath it all sorts of night creatures and they all look at you and go 'Aaagh!' and scuttle off. Education and debates of this nature will throw light on those scuttling insects, and hopefully we will see far less of them in our community and our children will have to put up with far fewer of them. That would be a fantastic and practical outcome.


I acknowledge the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples—Pat Dodson, Mark Leibler and all the others who were involved. I understand what a difficult subject this was, with the spectrum of views and the opportunities to introduce such a range of initiatives. Senator Siewert touched on issues like the treaty and sovereignty, and the fact that the expert panel individually and collectively have said, 'These are our views; we have come to a consensus view and we are all united behind a set of words and changes to the Constitution that the Australian people will support,' gives me great hope that this legislation today will lead to substantive and real change in our Constitution, which will make a real difference to how Australians feel.


I talked earlier about this being an endless story. There are those who, in frank discussion, have said, 'They'll never be happy, Nigel.' We have those discussions about the Greens as well! 'They're rapacious; they'll just take everything you give them. They will never be satisfied.' These are important debates to be had—and they are not discussions with racists; they are perhaps people who may not have the same exposure in life as others. But they are important discussions to have because I was able to say, 'Well, that's a natural thing; we will have this conversation endlessly.' To those who say, 'I've missed my opportunity for this particular change,' the fact is that the opportunities are endless. There will be endless opportunities for change. This debate itself will be the thing that really changes our Australian psyche. This is an opportunity for Australians to change their views; we can gather and corral those changed views and reflect them in our Constitution. I commend the bill to the House.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (13:31):  It is a real pleasure to stand here among so many people with a single purpose, and that is to continue a journey that has been going on for over 100 years. One thing is sure: from the time the Constitution was first considered to now, it has been a journey. There is a bit of a problem when we think that the Constitution is some dry document that belongs somewhere else and should never be changed. In fact, that is not the purpose of our Constitution. What we have is a living document. Whilst I do acknowledge how difficult it is to make this Constitution come alive through change—and I will, in the little time I have, talk a bit about this—the opportunity is there in the bill before us, which is so exciting.


The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 is exciting because it is doing something that people over many generations have called for: to acknowledge all Australians in our Constitution. The current document does not do that. In fact, when this Constitution was first written by that group of blokes, they left out a number of people. Women were one. Most importantly, the other group that they left out were the First Australians. They were mentioned, but in a derogatory way, in the middle of a Constitution subclause. However, from that time, people have been asking questions about this and saying it is not right. 


Through this process, through the amazing work of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, which has been acknowledged a number of times here already, and through the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples chaired by my friend Trish Crossin, they have been able to share knowledge with many more Australians about the history of this discussion. We found out that consistently in those years people have said there needed to be change. In 2008, when our then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, made his apology to Aboriginal Australians, that was in fact an apology to all Australians, because until we made that acknowledgement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our country we were not all Australians. That process started then—the most modern incarnation of it—and it continues through this discussion today, as it will into the future, because we all know this bill is just one small step. In fact, we have been at pains to say that this bill is but one small step and is not to be taken as some way of avoiding any other action, which would be a really sad thing. But, in the bill, we have given it a time frame, which is most unusual in legislation: there is a sunset clause that clearly states that we have a two-year period to look at what needs to be done and to take further action.


The action is not limited to just an acknowledgement clause. That is clearly set out in the bill before us, but it is much more than that. We can work with this document and use it, with the knowledge and the commitment that we have built up over the years to make the necessary changes—which I think we can do. I think there is a degree of optimism and a real sense of having a chance to make a difference. From looking at the speeches made in the other place on the introduction of the bill, there was agreement that we have the chance now—the same as the people who wrote the original Constitution and the same as the people who drafted successful amendments—at this moment in time, to say, 'We can right this wrong.' We can right this wrong for the whole of our nation.


I want to acknowledge the work has been done to bring this debate to this stage—most importantly, by the people in the wider community who came forward to share their ideas, their frustrations and their anger through the various committees that have been operating. This parliament sets up committees, but we then rely on the community to feed us the information we need to make decisions that represent Australia. I have heard the argument about taking leadership; of course that is important, but one element must be that we can speak on behalf of our nation. In the submissions that came forward to both the joint select committee and the expert panel convened under the wonderful Patrick Dodson to talk with the community, we can read how important this issue is.


And it is symbolic. I am a bit worried that people see symbolism as not having power. Of course it has power. Symbols reflect need. They reflect action. Symbols can cause action and commitment. So this is symbolic. People who gave evidence to those two groups talked about the importance of symbolism and the fact that they felt Aboriginal and Islander people of this country must be acknowledged in our Constitution. There was no real doubt: that must happen. What we have to do is work out how to make it happen.


If we are going to be true to all those people who came forward to talk about why this was important for them, we have got to find a way to put the argument back out to the community so that this will be another successful referendum result, of which there are way too few. 


We know how difficult it is to get a referendum result up in the positive. It has to be across the whole nation. It cannot just be the majority of states. A referendum of this nature must be supported by all states. In fact, we need to reflect on the 1967 referendum, in which we got such an amazing result. We need to be equalling that to be true to ourselves and to be able to make a statement not just for this generation but for those to come that we as a nation believe this is the right thing to do—and this has been said many times. 


Mr Acting Deputy President Furner, you know about the Australian constitutional conventions—the process that encourages young people to come together to look at our Constitution, to become engaged with it and to see what should work with our Constitution. It is an inspiring thing to work with those young people who may never even have thought about reading the Constitution until some teacher dobbed them in. But, when they did get that opportunity, they felt that it was their document. We need the passion of those young people looking at why these changes should be made for them and for future generations. We need not just to look at recognition—certainly the bill concentrates on recognition—but, most importantly, to take the other steps, which I think have been put forward in discussion, to remove any hint of discrimination on race in our Constitution. This document belongs to all Australians.


The bill before us is a step to ensure that all Australians can be part of the discussion. Whilst I know in my heart that not all Australians will take a role in this process, I am hoping that what we do as a parliament and what we do through our community will be to make sure that more people see that this is something that is real and that it actually belongs to them—Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and people who are not fortunate enough to have Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander heritage. We can work together to ensure that we have a change, an agreed change, that will take away the hurt and pain that was in our document from the time that our forefathers signed off on it. 


I know that people have strong views about this process. I know that there are a range of views about what should and should not be in it and how fast we can move forward, but we have an opportunity through the passing of this bill to say that we as a parliament accept that this is our job. It is our job to ensure that within a two-year period we have a question that is effectively framed and can go to the Australian people—all of the Australian people—and that they can own it and can say, 'Yes, we'll be able to acknowledge all Australians in our Constitution.' This is an important element. 


We all have a job to do in this process. It is not good enough just to stand in this place and make a speech. In fact, we have to commit together to take further action. The bill gives us a framework to do that. It actually tells us to get on with the job. I want to acknowledge all the parliamentarians both in this place and in the other who have said that they will be part of the future and not just sit and long for things of bygone days.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-02-26,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:40):  I rise today to support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012. I am very pleased that this has reached the parliament and that it has the support of this parliament. It is incredibly important that the parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, recognises that the continent and islands now known as Australia were first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It is also important for the parliament to acknowledge the continuing relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their traditional land and waters, and also for the parliament, on behalf of the people, to acknowledge and respect the continuing cultures, languages and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Often there is that statement, but then the actions of the parliament are quite different. 


I cite today what is going at James Price Point in Western Australia as a classic case of where there is a failure to acknowledge and respect the continuing cultures, languages and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. I lead into that because it is critical that we do not just have the sentiment expressed in the parliament. We actually need this sentiment to be translated into constitutional change and then into legal frameworks which give it effect and which give it compliance and enforcement capacity in the law down the track. Having said that, I am pleased at least that we have got to the point where the parliament is doing this. I am particularly pleased that we are doing it because it was part of the Greens agreement with the Gillard government. We said in that agreement, when we agreed to give the Prime Minister government, to:



Hold referenda during the 43rd Parliament or at the next election on Indigenous constitutional recognition and recognition of local government in the Constitution.



It was because the Greens put this into that agreement that we then saw the formation of the expert panel, and then we saw the work of the expert panel—and, as my colleague Senator Siewert talked about a little while ago, what a great report has come from that expert panel. She said that we ought to take very seriously the work that has been done by everybody on the panel and the secretariat who supported them and the input from communities around the country. In fact, so much trust and faith has been invested in its document that it would be disrespectful not to work from it as the basis of how we go forward. 


Having said that, I think this parliament is now committed to placing before the Australian people at a referendum a proposal for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This will, of course, require the building of a national consensus in order to achieve that. As we all know, you do not succeed with referenda in Australia unless you build a national consensus and, in fact, that all political parties agree to get behind the proposal and work for it in every capacity. I would argue that every one of us in acknowledging country whenever we go and speak anywhere ought to be not only acknowledging that the land we stand on is the traditional land of the group of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples that we are particularly referring to in terms of that part of country but particularly then going on to say that there is a commitment to move to constitutional recognition.


I think we should all be acknowledging country and building a national consensus. It is disappointing that we were not able to fulfil the agreement, as set out with the Prime Minister, to have a referendum on the Constitution in this 43rd Parliament. But I totally support the decision that has been made not to proceed with it before the next election, because we do not want to see it fail. We must build a consensus so that people get behind the next referendum as they got behind the 1967 referendum. We must be make sure that the next referendum succeeds, and that is a challenge to everyone. I hope that throughout the election campaign candidates and sitting members get out there and start talking up the referendum in the community.


I pay particular respect today to all of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have given so much time to the issue of constitutional recognition and who continue to work in the best way they can to make it happen. I was delighted, on the day that this bill went through the House of Representatives, to meet Shirley Peisley, Lowitja O'Donoghue and Patrick Dodson, who were up here having a small celebration. Shirley was there in 1967 as one of the people campaigning for the referendum, and I was delighted that she was able to come back and see that progress is being made towards another referendum. We are making slow progress, but at least we are on track. It is terrific that Shirley was able to be here and see that this is the case, and it was terrific that respect was paid to Lowitja O'Donoghue and Patrick Dodson and the other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who came along on the day. It was marvellous to see a lot of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people there listening the stories of their elders, participating in the discussion of what had gone before and clearly enthused about taking constitutional recognition to the next stage. The Greens will certainly be there with them to do so.


It is important not only to recognise the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the first occupants of Australia and to acknowledge their relationship with their traditional lands and waters and their language, culture and heritage but also to recognise the ugliness of the Constitution's having been drafted on the premise of race. I remember that it came home to me, when we were debating a bill of rights in Australia, that the reason the Constitution as first drafted did not include a bill of rights is that there was a very deliberate decision taken not to include a bill of rights because it would have had to recognise that everyone is born equal. The Prime Minister at the time, Edmund Barton, said that we needed a power in the Constitution to enable the federal parliament to pass laws against 'the coloured and inferior persons' within the Commonwealth. That is the basis of our Constitution, and Australians must look back and reflect on it with some disgust—I suppose that is the best way to put it—because it was designed to make sure that Australia could discriminate against the Kanaka people, who were here working in the cane fields, and against Chinese people who had come here after the gold rushes—and, of course, over time to discriminate also against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.


Unfortunately, section 25 of the Constitution still gives states the power to enact laws that disenfranchise people on the basis of their race. Under section 51, subsection (xxvi), the Commonwealth still has the ability to make laws based on race, and that clearly has to change; we must change the part of the Constitution that enables the Commonwealth to make laws based on race. We have to face up to this in Australia. We must recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and remove from our Constitution the last vestiges of its possible use to discriminate on the basis of race. We have to be upfront that we are doing it, because doing so will in turn—as my colleague Senator Siewert said—set up a framework to have an ongoing discussion about sovereignty and a treaty and so on down the track. In no way does this bill as proposed detract from the ability of people to talk about such issues as people become more familiar with the context surrounding the issues as well as with their details.


In the mid-1990s in Tasmania, when I was member of a parliament in which the Greens held the balance of power in a Liberal minority government, we had a tripartite agreement to say sorry to the stolen generation. It was one of the most dignified moments in the Tasmanian parliament. People were amazed that the agreement was made under a Liberal minority government working with the Greens. It was extraordinary when we invited Tasmania's Aboriginal people onto the floor of the parliament to respond. It was marvellous to be here in the Senate more than a decade later when the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, came and extended the same apology federally. But Tasmania led the way on an apology to the stolen generation, and I am pleased to have been a parliamentarian on both occasions; I am also very pleased this time around to have made an agreement with the current Prime Minister. I am delighted by the work of my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert. I pay tribute to the work she has done on the expert panel. She has put a huge amount of time, effort, passion, love and heart into this work, which stands up for the rights—as Senator Siewert has always done—of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.


As Senator Siewert rightly points out, there are many occasions on which we have argued that the Commonwealth is making laws that are based on race—in the Northern Territory intervention and the legislation called Stronger Futures, which we believe is actually weaker futures. She has been leading the way on recognising the rights of Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander people and standing up for their wellbeing, for their health, for their education and for their communities. Her work in this period needs to be recognised because it has been a huge investment at a personal level for a community outcome that is working towards the best interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and, of course, working with them to achieve that. It is very much an organic process of consultation and input. It is not about top-down imposition; it is about engagement and discussion. I congratulate her and the panel and, as Senator Siewert did herself, the secretariat, who have all worked on this. I think everyone would acknowledge that the more you get involved in it, the more discussions you have, the more engagement you have, the more it becomes obvious that there is an overwhelming imperative to work to achieve these good outcomes.


The other thing during this period of parliament which the Greens are very proud about is that, following the lead of the Greens representatives on the Darwin City Council, we secured in our negotiations with the Gillard government an acknowledgement of country at the start of every sitting day. It has now become a part of the institutional arrangement of this parliament, and it would not have happened if it had not been for the Greens and, in particular, the Greens lead on the Darwin City Council that translated through to our work here in the Senate. It shows that when you vote for the Greens you get a consistent policy right through the spectrum. I think it is wonderful that we have seen that. We did move to have the acknowledgement of country be the first matter for the Senate each day as it is in the House of Representatives, but unfortunately that was not agreed to by either the coalition or the Labor Party. Nevertheless, we think it should be consistent in both houses and would like to see that occur.


But the main point of today is to say how pleased the Greens are that this has been advanced to the point where it is, to absolutely say up front that we are committed to making sure that we get constitutional recognition of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and that we get a referendum, and we will do everything in our power to build a community consensus for that and to finally remove from the Constitution section 51(xxvi) to take away the Commonwealth's ability to make laws based on race. That will be a major celebration in Australia when it is achieved—and I am not going to say 'if'. We have a two-year time frame to get that in before the sunset clause comes into effect. It is incumbent on all of us to work to achieve that outcome, to make sure that we get the referendum and that as a nation we can celebrate, really stand up and say: finally, Australia has shed that shadow that has been over our Constitution for such a long period of time. Finally, we can say in Australia, as the bill indicates, that we acknowledge on behalf of all of us, no matter where we have come from, and recognise that the continent and the islands now known as Australia were first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We can stand up and acknowledge the continuing relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with their traditional land and waters and acknowledge and respect the continuing cultures, language and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.


Please, I would ask that as members of parliament, when you go out there and talk about this, you give some thought to what it means to you personally, because there will be nothing more offensive to people than to hear you mouth that on the one hand and then agree to the complete compromising of that by ignoring that language, culture and association with country when it comes to a choice between some of the projects that are put up and the rights and recognition of Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander people. That is the moral dilemma that faces many in this parliament, but I can assure you that for the Greens it is straightforward. When we say we acknowledge those points, we mean it. We believe that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people deserve constitutional recognition and have an ongoing connection to their land, their water, their culture, their language and their heritage, and we will do everything in our power to respect it, uphold it and work for the constitutional recognition which will provide the framework for continuing to strengthen it.

 (Queensland) (13:57):  I know that I and, I think, most Australians support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012. Without this bill, I think most Australians including myself recognise that the continent known as Australia was first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I think we all accept the continuing relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with the traditional land and waters, and I am sure that, as well, we all respect the continuing cultures. I want to return to that later in my speech.


But, just at the moment, I want to say that, for all the words I have heard here today, there are Indigenous people dying in Townsville because the federal government will not fund transport to get Indigenous people from their place of residence to dialysis treatment in Townsville Hospital. You can speak all you like about this bill, but I want to see the federal government and the Greens actually do something tangible to assist Indigenous people. I have written to Ms Macklin, Ms Plibersek and Mr Snowdon asking for transport for these Indigenous people to get to dialysis. Have I had any response? None at all. This is an urgent situation, and in Townsville I am aware of one person having died because they could not get transport from their place of residence to a hospital. That is where you should start your care and concern for Indigenous people. In these few seconds I have before the break, I want to emphasise that. If there are ministers here from the government, would you please get on to Ms Macklin, Ms Plibersek or Mr Snowdon and ask them to have a look at my letter to them of 20 February, just a few days ago, and please do something for these Indigenous people who desperately need help.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2013-02-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:31): The passage of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012, which has the bipartisan support of the opposition and, I believe, also has the support of the minor parties and the Independents, is an important moment in the history of our nation. It is symbolically important, as the Prime Minister and others have said. More importantly, it is a measure which will have practical consequences. When it comes to Indigenous Australians, we have had, I think, too much symbolism dressed up as if it were practical achievement, too many gestures without outcomes, too many ceremonies in which many fine words have been uttered, all of which have made us feel better about ourselves but which has improved the everyday lives of Indigenous Australians not one iota. So, while not underestimating the power of symbolism in the life of a nation, symbolism without more will never be enough. Indeed, on occasions the obsession of some of the participants in this debate with symbols alone has almost been an excuse to neglect more useful practical measures.


So it is important that this bill does serve a practical purpose by committing both sides of politics to a course of action which, it is envisaged, will result in a successful constitutional referendum sometime during the life of—or perhaps at the conclusion of the next parliament—to give appropriate recognition of Indigenous Australians in our nation's founding document. If that comes about during an Abbott government, as I rather suspect it might, then nothing could be more fitting because there are few politicians in Australia who have shown a more long-lasting devotion and commitment to helping Indigenous Australians than Mr Tony Abbott. His has been a commitment manifested not merely in fine words—although Mr Abbott's speech on this bill in the House of Representatives on 13 February 2013 should live in history as one of the noblest parliamentary speeches ever given in that chamber—but, just as importantly, in practical action manifested by voluntary manual work over many years, unadvertised and in his own private time, in Aboriginal communities in Cape York. Both sides of Australian politics have a genuine commitment to this issue, but I am particularly proud that the leader of my party is a person whose commitment has, for so long, been manifested not merely in words but in the sweat of his brow, the dust in his eyes and the dirt under his fingernails.


I will say a few words about the provisions of this bill in a moment but before I do, I want to put it in its proper historical perspective. No side of Australian politics is without blemish when it comes to the treatment of our Indigenous peoples. For too long, particularly in the first half of the last century, their needs, their aspirations and their basic human rights were neglected or ignored by conservative and Labor governments both state and federal. Nevertheless, wise ministers from both sides of politics became increasingly sensitive to the needs of Indigenous Australians and, with changing attitudes and values, developed policies to redress Indigenous disadvantage and unequal treatment. Although the Labor Party, in the relentless prosecution of its one-sided view of history, claims the credit for these initiatives, the truth is that most of them were in fact pioneered by Liberal governments.


Sir Paul Hasluck, one of our nation's very greatest cabinet ministers, used the 12 years he spent as the Menzies government Minister's for the Territories between 1951 and 1963 to pioneer enlightened policies which, with the passage of time and the demonstrated failure of Whitlam-era welfarism, seem truly farsighted. Hasluck was only the first of a series of distinguished Liberal ministers for Aboriginal affairs, including William Charles Wentworth, Fred Chaney, John Herron and Mal Brough, each of whom achieved great advances for Australia's Indigenous peoples. It was of course the Liberal Party which, 42 years ago, selected, through a regular preselection process, the first Aboriginal Australian to sit in this parliament, a man whom it was my privilege when I was a young man to call a friend, the great Neville Bonner. It was the Liberal Party which, at the last election, again through a regular preselection process, selected the first Aboriginal Australian to sit in the House of Representatives, my colleague Ken Wyatt, appropriately the member for Hasluck.


At the state level, it is often forgotten that it was the Queensland National Party which selected the first Aboriginal Australian, Eric Deeral, to serve in a state parliament as long ago as 1974. Last year, we saw in the Northern Territory Indigenous Australians turn in droves to the conservative side of politics and elect no fewer than three new Indigenous members of parliament to sit with the Country Liberal Party.


The Prime Minister and other Labor politicians and apologists are fond of reciting the various steps to Aboriginal advancement, for which Labor governments claim to have been responsible—although many of those policies, by creating a culture of welfare dependency, in fact destroyed Aboriginal communities and retarded rather than advanced their development. But, curiously, the Prime Minister routinely fails to mention the greatest single step ever taken towards the goal of achieving equal rights and status for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians: the 1967 referendum, an achievement of the government of Harold Holt.


This was the vital moment which gave Aboriginal Australians true constitutional recognition, equal standing in the Constitution and full membership of the Australian body politic. Nothing that has happened before or since was as important as the 1967 referendum, yet Ms Julia Gillard routinely seeks to airbrush it out of history, no doubt because, like so many of the great progressive achievements in the history of Australian nationhood—indeed, like Federation itself—the Australian Labor Party had absolutely nothing to do with it.


This bill will, I hope, set in train a process which will culminate in a constitutional referendum as successful as the 1967 referendum—the most successful referendum in Australian constitutional history, by the way, which recorded a remarkable 'yes' vote of 90.77 per cent. In a sense, the referendum which this bill envisages will be the historical bookend of the 1967 referendum and carry to fulfilment that which the 1967 referendum began. But it will only succeed—and this is acknowledged by all participants—if it has widespread community support; not just bipartisanship—for referendums have sometimes failed despite having bipartisan support—and not just support from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities but support across the whole of the Australian community. Which means that it is just as important that people with conservative views be persuaded as people who consider themselves to be progressives. If that is to happen the proposal must be modest and the tone of the debate must be respectful.


Nothing is surer to defeat the referendum than if the public discussion of the proposal is conducted in a hectoring, angry or righteous manner. Every citizen who participates in the discussion has the same right to be heard because although this proposal has a special significance for Indigenous people, the Constitution belongs to every Australian equally. In particular, people of a conservative frame of mind who are sceptical and suspicious of constitutional change will need to be convinced of the desirability of the measure; and their scepticism is every bit as legitimate as the proponents' enthusiasm.


It is important to stress that the bill before us is neutral on the question of how recognition should be achieved. It does not propose a form of words. It is agnostic on the question of whether the recognition should take place as a preamble, in the substantive provisions of the Constitution, or both. The settlement of those questions and the finalisation of the words of the referendum proposal are matters with which the process set up by this bill will deal. In that regard, I remind the Senate of the wise words of the unanimous report of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. In paragraph 2.39 of its interim report, tabled last month, it said:


…the Committee does not underestimate the difficulty of securing the passage of appropriate amendments to the Constitution recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Only eight out of 44 proposals to amend the Constitution have succeeded. It is 36 years since the last successful referendum. Controversial proposals are invariably foredoomed to failure. For that reason, the committee cautions that if the proposal is the victim of over-reach, it will fail. While the Committee does not seek to limit the scope of public discussion, it nevertheless considers that only a relatively modest proposal is capable of engendering the bipartisan consensus which is a pre-requisite to success.


Our objective, in short, is to recapture the spirit of 1967. To do so, we must build community consensus in a careful, respectful, cautious fashion. If a proposal is put to referendum and the referendum fails, then that will create a legacy of bitterness and division which could last for generations. It would not only defeat our efforts, it would actually erode the important achievement of the 1967 referendum itself. It would be better to have no referendum than one which became a platform for divisiveness and ended in failure.


Our purpose is to ensure that we do not fail; that some time in the life of, or perhaps at the conclusion of, the 44th parliament, we will—as did the 26th parliament in 1967—have achieved a nationwide consensus which will give appropriate recognition to our first peoples and advance in a material way the cause of reconciliation.


In closing, I want to acknowledge the work of the members of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Peoples: in particular, the co-chairs, Mr Mark Leibler AC, and Professor Pat Dodson; my Labor colleague, Senator Trish Crossin, the Chair of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, who, if I may say so, has done more to advance the interests of Aboriginal people, especially in the Northern Territory, than any other Labor politician I can think of and whose premature departure from the chairmanship of the committee at the time of the next election will be a great loss—just as the circumstances which brought it about were a disgrace; and on my side of politics, my friend Senator Nigel Scullion, the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, and the only Indigenous member of the current parliament, Mr Ken Wyatt, the member for Hasluck. All of them are great Australians and all are committed to the same end. I commend the bill to the Senate and look forward to its unanimous passage through this chamber.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2013-02-26,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:45):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate over the bill that we are currently discussing. The Australian Greens have a long history of supporting and campaigning for Aboriginal rights and promoting constitutional recognition and reconciliation. Not only do we believe that we need to recognise Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our constitution; our policy is also to ensure that we have treaties with and recognised sovereignty for Aboriginal and Torres Strait people. We recognise that sovereignty was in fact never ceded by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. However, we do believe that the treaty and the sovereignty issues need to be addressed a bit further down the track. I will come back to those issues later on in my speech.


The Greens have worked tirelessly to progress the issue of constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We believe that not only is this important as a further step in reconciliation but also we need to include substance in those amendments. We have been committed to recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our constitution, as I said, for a significant period of time. In fact, I would go so far as to say that as long as the Greens have existed there has been support for constitutional recognition. It was in our agreement with the Gillard government that there would be a referendum either before or with the next election. We were very disappointed that in fact this could not occur, but we realised that it was not achievable and so acknowledged that we needed to put in place another process.


It is clear to us that there has been significant progress in the national conversation, but we are not there yet. There is still significant work to be undertaken to reach agreement not just on what would be a model that is supportable through a referendum but also to ensure that it is a good model. It cannot be just any model; it must be a good model or a good set of questions and good changes to our constitution. Very importantly, it must have the support of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. That was one of the key things that the expert panel took as one of its guiding principles: any model, or any question, for a referendum had to have the support of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.


I was a member of the expert panel and I would like to acknowledge the work of the expert panel, which I think—I probably need to display a bit of modesty here—presented a very good report to the Prime Minister in January 2012. I would like to acknowledge the people that put a year's worth of their life into this report, both those members of the expert panel and people who were part of the secretariat—some of whom I notice are in the chamber today. I would also like to acknowledge the work that they put in, because I know it was also a year of their lives that they put into this report.


While we are disappointed that we cannot achieve a referendum by the next election, we do acknowledge that this recognition by parliament is an important step along the path to constitutional change. The bill has provided an opportunity for reflection on the purpose of an eventual referendum, has enabled more consultation and has enabled a discussion by the parliament on the importance of constitutional recognition. As we have heard, we hear multiparty support for constitutional recognition and constitutional change. There have been many submitters both to the expert panel and to the select committee's inquiry into the bills. We heard from the National Congress, ANTaR, the Human Rights Commission and a whole range of people who made submissions to the inquiry.


I would like to read out a quote that is from the expert panel's report about constitutional recognition:


Constitutional recognition is an important step that must be taken in order to redress the discrimination and disempowerment Indigenous Australians have suffered since settlement.


There have been repeated comments, both to the inquiry into the bill and to the expert panel, about the need to address constitutional recognition and the discrimination that Australia's first peoples have felt ever since colonisation.


The Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law told the select committee inquiry into the bill that:


Recognition needs to deal with the fact that the Constitution was drafted on a premise of racism, essentially. It was drafted at a time when, in the words of our Prime Minister, Edmund Barton, we needed a power in the Constitution to enable the federal parliament to pass laws against 'the coloured and inferior persons' within the Commonwealth. Those words in the Constitution and that racist power have now been extended to Aboriginal people. Section 25 still recognises the possibility that states might enact laws that disenfranchise people on the basis of their race. Certainly from my dealings across the community, including with very conservative groups, it is that element of racism that most motivates people to think that they need to fix the Constitution to move beyond the values of the time.


ANTaR told the committee that:


… inclusion of language which recognises the need to remove or reform racially discriminatory elements in the Constitution should be added, confirming parliament's support for changes which go beyond the symbolic—again, a key recommendation of the panel. The inclusion of a reference to the need to continue efforts to close the social and economic gap that Australia's first peoples experience should also be a key feature.


The Australian Greens share this view. We believe that the final model that is put to a referendum should address the legacy of racial discrimination and enable the federal government to legally act to meet its often stated commitments under Closing the Gap but also under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which was often quoted to the expert panel. We agree that the joint select committee provides a framework for such triggers and other milestones to be delivered and acted upon. We believe that we need to maintain the momentum for constitutional recognition. The significance of having several of the parliamentarians who were on the expert panel also included in the committee we think is a good move in terms of being able to continue that work, but also in bringing new thoughts into the panel.


It is important to recognise that the bill we are currently debating does not include all the recommendations of the expert panel, but I understand from the select committee's terms of reference that the committee will not be limited in considering the recommendations. The words in the bill that we are considering reflect the carefully chosen words of the expert panel. Every word was carefully considered. I would like to remind people of the recognition outlined in the bill:


The Parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, recognises that the continent and the islands now known as Australia were first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


The Parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, acknowledges the continuing relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their traditional lands and waters.


The Parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, acknowledges and respects the continuing cultures, languages and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


Those are very important statements.


This is the first step to constitutional change and it is not just symbolic. At the moment our Constitution has no reference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, though it did previously. The Constitution used to say that the Commonwealth could make powers for all Australians except Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Fortunately, that was removed after the 1967 referendum. If you look at our Constitution you would never think that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are the oldest living culture on the planet, that they were on this land for generations and generations and that they are and were always the traditional owners of these lands. That needs to be in our Constitution.


Not only does this bill provide recognition; it also commits to placing before the Australian people at a referendum a proposal for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. It also acknowledges and recognises that further engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other Australians is required to refine proposals for a referendum and to build support necessary for constitutional change. Importantly, it commits us to building the national consensus needed for recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. That puts a huge responsibility on this place, on members of parliament, to engage with this debate and to help build consensus. I believe that we need to build that consensus not as a lowest common denominator but as something that Australia can be proud of, so we can stand tall and say that we are prepared to change our Constitution to provide recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and to ensure that the Constitution does not discriminate. It is also about enabling the federal government to continue to address the advancement the expert panel recommended; another word you could look at is 'wellbeing'. It is about enabling the federal government to continue to address issues around Closing the Gap and the historical discrimination of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Those are the concepts that were included in the expert panel's recommendations. They recommended a whole new section, section 51A, that acknowledges the need for recognition, and I have read out the words contained in the bill. I believe we also need to acknowledge the need to secure the advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. In the debate in this place over the next day or so, I do not want it to be forgotten that further recommendations were made.


The Greens will continue to campaign vigorously for constitutional recognition. We will continue to support and participate in the national discussion and the national consultation process, but we believe that the expert panel's recommendations should provide the basis for that. We are not saying they should not change; we are saying, 'We think you did a pretty good job; do not reinvent the wheel.' Let us find out what is capable of being supported. Let us engage in that national discussion. Let us build that consensus around what we do think we can take to the community. As someone said to me the other day, let's be courageous in our recognition. We do not get to change our Constitution very often, as was just highlighted. Out of the 44 attempts to change our Constitution, eight have been successful.


Some of the keys to success are multi-party political support, strong community support, clear questions. It will take leadership from all members of this place to engage in that national discussion. As I articulated in the Greens' additional comments to the select committee report, one of the issues of concern for us was the two-year sunset clause in this bill. The issue as put to us by members of the community, and particularly some members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, was that the sunset clause means that you may not care after two years about recognition. I thought long and hard about that and I have come down on the side of the argument that says we think we should have the sunset clause there because it will make sure it is a decision-making point, that it is not that the parliament does not care—in fact the parliament cares so much about this that we want to make sure that there is a decision-making point. So, we support the sunset clause. In our additional comments we did say that we would think and discuss this further. I have done that and do believe we should be supporting it, because we do need a trigger point to enable further discussion.


One of the other issues, and I feel that we really need to mention this in this place, is that there is a number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who do not want to support this bill. They do not think we should be discussing constitutional recognition without discussing the issues around sovereignty and treaty. I acknowledge their very legitimate concerns and, as I said at the outset, the Greens support the concepts of treaty and sovereignty. I participated in a large number of discussions as part of the expert panel process and I support the recommendations and the feelings of the expert panel—that is, I do believe Australia is not ready to discuss those issues yet. I have also listened to legal advice that says that if we do proceed with constitutional recognition it will not undermine the concepts later on when continuing a national discussion about sovereignty and treaties.


I do not think this bill does so, either. While I think it is very important to acknowledge those very legitimate comments of those who say we should not proceed with this bill and with constitutional recognition, the overwhelming flavour of comments I have had back from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is that they do want constitutional recognition. This is an essential step in the reconciliation of this nation—absolutely essential. That is why we do not believe that it is appropriate to suspend the discussion around constitutional recognition to address those issues, but I do want to acknowledge that those are live and real issues that this country still needs to deal with. A large step will be taken for reconciliation by changing our Constitution to acknowledge that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders were the first occupants of this land and that they have ongoing and unbroken connection and traditional ownership of this country. It is important that they are recognised in our Constitution. It is part of a healing for this country and, as I said, it is a part of reconciling this country, because we still have a significant way to go.


I fully acknowledge that it is not the only thing and that a lot more needs to be done before we address the huge gap in life expectancy and life outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We cannot pretend that this is the only thing that needs to be done. We are still making mistakes in our policies—I will acknowledge that, too. I am often the first in this place to criticise policies that are supposed to be for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and I do not believe that they are of benefit. Constitutional recognition is very important. We need to make sure we have a full discussion in the Australian community and build popular support for constitutional recognition. We politicians have a very important role to play. It is quite obvious from previous referenda that where there has been political disunity, those referenda have failed. We need to demonstrate what we expect the rest of the nation to do and that is having a fully engaged and respectful discussion around constitutional recognition. We will be supporting this bill.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2013-02-26,"



Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (13:05):  Late last year I was given the honour of being asked to chair the new Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and I accepted that challenge as an honour to pay tribute to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country and to finally start to forge some work in this parliament that I think will lead to a great outcome if this country embraces the changes to the Constitution that are needed. I wanted today to congratulate all those who have participated dutifully in the debate on this important piece of legislation, particularly those members of the House of Representatives.


Parliamentarians, community awareness and engagement programs and dedicated Australians should all be commended on this significant step towards improving our nation by finally taking up the challenge of recognising our first Australians within the Constitution. This piece of legislation is just the first stage of the important process in building a reconciled Australia with relationships based on mutual respect and understanding.


On the morning of 13 of February—just a few weeks ago—the House of Representatives passed this act of recognition. This act provides a path on which to build a foundation that precedes our collective objective and that is to acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as Australians in the Constitution.


We are all aware that today marks another major moment in the records of recognition for these people in our history books—the final passage of this bill through the Senate and the Australian parliament. Five years ago, the parliament witnessed former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd deliver his landmark apology to Indigenous Australians. This parliament took another historic step on the anniversary of that day this year, and we can see that the momentum for change, recognition and cross-cultural understanding is growing.


I note the shared commitment that is often lacking in political debate—I have seen that plenty of times in this place. But on this day, in this chamber, in the Australian Senate, and on this most important subject, of inclusion, Australians right around this country will witness once again bipartisanship between the two major political parties. The act of recognition is supremely important. That both sides of politics find a bipartisan resolution on this issue speaks for itself and it should speak to the Australian public.


When the two parties rarely agree on anything, and here we agree on this, it is a unique occasion and it should prick up the ears of people around this country. It should turn the heads of the nation and it should draw much-needed attention to this crucial campaign. When bipartisanship like this exists, when both major parties agree that recognition is long overdue, and when both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition offer such personal and heartfelt language, then we begin to see a positive response from the Australian public. We should capture that today and build on that. I want to commend the parliament for this remarkable effort. With continued leadership across the political spectrum, this campaign will result in the welcome acknowledgement of our history and a referendum that sees the improvements to our Constitution.


Firstly, I want to acknowledge the important work done by the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians, whose detailed and widely researched report—which I read in detail over the Christmas period—put in place the foundations to enable the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples to produce its report and for Australia to eventually progress constitutional recognition. In 2010, the Australian government announced the membership of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians. The panel included Indigenous and community leaders, constitutional experts and parliamentary members. It was co-chaired by Professor Patrick Dodson and Mark Leibler AC. I want to thank them for their dedication to holding a wide-ranging national public consultation and engagement program throughout 2011 in order to bring us to where we are today.


The joint select committee which I have chaired had a meeting with the co-chairs of the expert panel, where we explored their work and the outcomes of their deliberation. The work they have done is incredibly detailed. As I said, they held extensive consultations in towns and cities right across this country. They met with high-level stakeholders and engaged in a formal public submission process. Through these processes, this background work—this homework, I suppose, as a precursor to the work we are about to undertake—we can gauge community support. We can see, through the Newspoll that was commissioned to undertake research into this subject, that there is a groundswell and growing momentum to build on the outstanding work that the expert panel completed under the chairmanship of those two people. All of this work has been done at a resoundingly commendable level.


Then there are organisations like Reconciliation and their groups and campaigns, You Me Unity and Recognise. Their dedication to promoting constitutional recognition in communities across Australia has started, and it will be a great challenge. There is much work to be done, but they have been building awareness campaigns, providing the government and the public with valuable resource materials to help promote awareness for constitutional recognition, from cities to remote communities, from offices to backyard barbecues and in every home across this country.


The joint select committee held its inquiry, which is detailed on the website. We advertised the inquiry in the Australian, the Koori Mail and the National Indigenous Times. We received 24 submissions. I thank each of those who contributed. We held a public hearing in Sydney on 22 January. It is a day I will forever remember. With these contributions and the specialist work of the expert panel, we as a parliament have been able to pass this bill, which has three substantive parts that serve to eliminate discrimination and promote inclusion. Those three parts are: a statement—as Senator Siewert read out—of recognition by the parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; a requirement for the minister with responsibility for Indigenous affairs to commence a review of support for a referendum to amend the Constitution within a particular time frame; and a sunset clause, which provides that the act should expire two years after enactment. That gives us a definitive point in time by which we need to strive to achieve this work.


Along with most Australians, I appreciate the sophistication of this bill. It will change Australia's most important legal document, which is difficult to do. The public, whose vote this needs, deserve time to think about what we are trying to achieve here. As the expert panel has noted, many people still do not know about this important push for a referendum. There are, of course, those who condemn that the act takes too long when it sets out a two-year period to work toward a referendum. The government agrees, though, with the expert panel that it is important for this to be held at a time when it has the most chance of success. If that is going to happen within two years, then I am sure there are many of us here who would be delighted about that. But the public need time to understand the importance of this change, to be made aware of the many other countries, including the USA, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada, who have already made similar efforts to recognise their first peoples. While it is vital that grassroots organisations and advocates across the country get the word out to develop a movement for change, we as a parliament must not falter. We have to stay at the wheel. Now is the time for us to demonstrate continued leadership, to use our energy and passion to take a lead on this issue.


It is our chance, over the next two years, to show more recognition of Indigenous issues at state and federal levels in order to harness the attention of the wider Australian public.


I will take some time to touch on the nature of this symbolic statement. Some people may dismiss the idea that changing the Constitution will change things for Indigenous people in Australia. One only has to look toward the Northern Territory, where a great number of my constituents live with standards of education, jobs, health and life expectancy far below those of non-Indigenous Australians. Some might say that the symbolism of changing the Constitution will not change any of that. But I do not believe that to be the case. Being recognised in Australia's most important document means to be recognised by the people who live on the land on which you were born. For Indigenous Australians, it means to be recognised by the people who arrived on this land on which their forefathers were born, the rectification of the ignorance of the past and an acknowledgement of them as Australia's first peoples in a symbolic gesture. It gives them the credit they, with certainty, deserve.


The journey to recognition gives all Australians a chance to be part of this important improvement in ourselves as a nation. If Australians get the chance to enshrine that recognition, the foundation on which Indigenous disadvantage was born should cease to exist. Without a foundation, the structure crumbles. Sadly, it has been building for years—112 years too long. It is time to knock that structure down, and constitutional recognition will help with this.


As Jason Glanville said during his address to the National Press Club on constitutional recognition, disadvantage is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Social and economic disadvantage has existed for so long in this country that it may seem unlikely that words on a page could change it. But he went on to say that they could—and they will. He noted that, as with the many Indigenous Australians who had claimed improved mental and physical health since the 2007 apology by former Prime Minister Rudd, so too could the changing of our oldest legal document invite real hope and real change for Indigenous Australians again. We need to foster their right to excel, to dream big and to be proud of their heritage through recognition. This would, without doubt, instil a sense of pride. As Glanville said, quite simply, 'It is just the right thing to do.'


This bill reflects an intention to pursue meaningful change to the Constitution which echoes the hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It is not a substitute for constitutional recognition but it is a mechanism for all Australians to become familiar with the possible wording of a constitutional statement to be included in a future referendum. This bill is a part of a conversation that will continue, a conversation that needs to happen, a conversation which will encourage the community to continue discussions, debates and educational seminars in the lead-up to constitutional change.


The report handed down by my committee, all the work required to produce that report, the subsequent legislation and the laying out of the road we have ahead of us are all efforts of which this nation can be proud. Changing the Constitution is a way all Australians can unite to finally acknowledge our history and the great contribution made by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in this country. The Labor government's commitment of $10 million toward this campaign is a financial contribution, but I believe the positive momentum, the bipartisanship we have seen and the will of the people will be the true value we will see shining through at the end of the act's sunset provision.


We know that only eight of the last 44 referendums have succeeded. But there is a powerful precedent for change. We saw the Australian public achieve dignity in 1967 with the most decisive referendum in Australian history. That referendum updated the Constitution to include Aboriginal people in the census and gave the Commonwealth the power to make special laws for people of any race. Now is the time for us to become an even better Australia. I look forward to a future we can all be proud of. I commend this first important step towards a new beginning of unity and recognition and commend this bill to the Senate.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2013-02-26,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (13:19):  I too support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012. I thank the previous speakers and I have to say that this is, without doubt, the first time in my 12-odd years in this place that I have had a genuine sense of bipartisanship. We are excited by the prospects, we are nervous about how we proceed and we are talking genuinely with each other to ensure that our views are not polarised. It gives me a great deal of confidence that we, as representatives of the wider Australian community, can behave in that way. Hopefully that will help engender an appropriate environment for the community discussions to follow on the content of the changes. 


I am also excited by the fact that this bill will be the genesis of a stream of debates which are not only about the changes to the Constitution. This series of debates will engage people who have previously not been engaged. They will make people think about issues and people and circumstances which they have not thought about before. Constitutional change is necessarily a very complex issue and I invariably leave it to those people who are more focused on those matters than I and who are probably better equipped to deal with them. But this bill will be the genesis of a very important change. In the view of many Australians—and certainly people who have been involved in the changes which have already taken place—this is always unfinished business.


I will deal with some reflections on that later on. I suspect that it will always be unfinished business, and I think that necessarily is the case—and it is a good thing.


We have had several steps in this process. The previous Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, made an apology that was symbolic and practical—there was a significant practical element to it. That significant practical element involved Indigenous housing. It is useful to look back at that time to see what changes have taken place. I still think that from that dramatic day there are lessons for us for the way forward not only with this legislation but also beyond this legislation, which will pass today with the concurrence of everyone in this place—and that will be fantastic.


I have a confession to make. I was one of those who did not really think the apology would matter. I come from a background where I see every day that the gap between opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and those for mainstream people is so vast that I could not see the apology helping at all. That was my personal view at the time; I did not share it with anybody. I was cynical about it—all the trumpeting of change was wonderful but in myself I could not see what difference it could make. I guess much of that was because, as I said, my personal experience was that the housing of my mates was still appalling, their educational outcomes were not even comparable, there were relatively few employment opportunities for them in regional and rural Australia and their health outcomes were completely unacceptable. In that context I could never bring myself to be all that supportive. 


On the day of the apology and the days that followed I was able to be amongst my Aboriginal friends, and some of them shared their cynicism with me. How wrong we all were. The changes to the way Aboriginal people as individuals and as communities saw themselves after that apology were extraordinary. Plenty of individuals have explained to me how surprised they were at their own reaction as Aboriginal people. Clearly those who would, as I did in the past, diminish symbolism as something that does not have a role to play in closing the gap are quite wrong. We will go through this series of debates together as a group, and agreement will be the next step. It will be the third step in our becoming a united nation. That is extremely important. It will follow from the 1967 referendum, which was so significant, and the apology, which had complete bipartisan support. Now there will be this important constitutional recognition.


In this place I have beaten up all those who will listen with my views on Indigenous housing. The government would acknowledge that it has not done as well as it could have done, but those failures are characteristic across parliaments, across time. I do not think any of us would beat our chest and say how well we have done. In the shadow of the apology we made some commitments that we should have kept a better eye on, as Australians. It was only part of our discussions—it was over there; we had the economy and all these other things going. We have a great opportunity, as Australians, to make the same commitment to these practical outcomes as we have made to symbolic recognition. There is a practical element to the symbolism not only of today but also of the process as we move forward. Symbolism is a very practical way to send a clear message to those in this nation who I would describe as racist. 


I was lucky—I was brought up in a colourblind house by a wonderful family and I was not exposed to racism very much. As I grew up, every now and again I was exposed a little bit to people with racist views, but after they got tapped on the nose they generally did not share those views with me from then on. I just did not think there was as much racism as there actually was. The signal that as a nation we think this behaviour is unacceptable and that as a racist and somebody who shows intolerance and bigotry you are on your own, mate, is a pretty practical signal to send. Sadly, that signal does need to be sent. I was having a discussion with some people in Central Australia about racism and education. When you are in the desert, if you pick up a rock you will find underneath it all sorts of night creatures and they all look at you and go 'Aaagh!' and scuttle off. Education and debates of this nature will throw light on those scuttling insects, and hopefully we will see far less of them in our community and our children will have to put up with far fewer of them. That would be a fantastic and practical outcome.


I acknowledge the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples—Pat Dodson, Mark Leibler and all the others who were involved. I understand what a difficult subject this was, with the spectrum of views and the opportunities to introduce such a range of initiatives. Senator Siewert touched on issues like the treaty and sovereignty, and the fact that the expert panel individually and collectively have said, 'These are our views; we have come to a consensus view and we are all united behind a set of words and changes to the Constitution that the Australian people will support,' gives me great hope that this legislation today will lead to substantive and real change in our Constitution, which will make a real difference to how Australians feel.


I talked earlier about this being an endless story. There are those who, in frank discussion, have said, 'They'll never be happy, Nigel.' We have those discussions about the Greens as well! 'They're rapacious; they'll just take everything you give them. They will never be satisfied.' These are important debates to be had—and they are not discussions with racists; they are perhaps people who may not have the same exposure in life as others. But they are important discussions to have because I was able to say, 'Well, that's a natural thing; we will have this conversation endlessly.' To those who say, 'I've missed my opportunity for this particular change,' the fact is that the opportunities are endless. There will be endless opportunities for change. This debate itself will be the thing that really changes our Australian psyche. This is an opportunity for Australians to change their views; we can gather and corral those changed views and reflect them in our Constitution. I commend the bill to the House.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (13:31):  It is a real pleasure to stand here among so many people with a single purpose, and that is to continue a journey that has been going on for over 100 years. One thing is sure: from the time the Constitution was first considered to now, it has been a journey. There is a bit of a problem when we think that the Constitution is some dry document that belongs somewhere else and should never be changed. In fact, that is not the purpose of our Constitution. What we have is a living document. Whilst I do acknowledge how difficult it is to make this Constitution come alive through change—and I will, in the little time I have, talk a bit about this—the opportunity is there in the bill before us, which is so exciting.


The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 is exciting because it is doing something that people over many generations have called for: to acknowledge all Australians in our Constitution. The current document does not do that. In fact, when this Constitution was first written by that group of blokes, they left out a number of people. Women were one. Most importantly, the other group that they left out were the First Australians. They were mentioned, but in a derogatory way, in the middle of a Constitution subclause. However, from that time, people have been asking questions about this and saying it is not right. 


Through this process, through the amazing work of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, which has been acknowledged a number of times here already, and through the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples chaired by my friend Trish Crossin, they have been able to share knowledge with many more Australians about the history of this discussion. We found out that consistently in those years people have said there needed to be change. In 2008, when our then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, made his apology to Aboriginal Australians, that was in fact an apology to all Australians, because until we made that acknowledgement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our country we were not all Australians. That process started then—the most modern incarnation of it—and it continues through this discussion today, as it will into the future, because we all know this bill is just one small step. In fact, we have been at pains to say that this bill is but one small step and is not to be taken as some way of avoiding any other action, which would be a really sad thing. But, in the bill, we have given it a time frame, which is most unusual in legislation: there is a sunset clause that clearly states that we have a two-year period to look at what needs to be done and to take further action.


The action is not limited to just an acknowledgement clause. That is clearly set out in the bill before us, but it is much more than that. We can work with this document and use it, with the knowledge and the commitment that we have built up over the years to make the necessary changes—which I think we can do. I think there is a degree of optimism and a real sense of having a chance to make a difference. From looking at the speeches made in the other place on the introduction of the bill, there was agreement that we have the chance now—the same as the people who wrote the original Constitution and the same as the people who drafted successful amendments—at this moment in time, to say, 'We can right this wrong.' We can right this wrong for the whole of our nation.


I want to acknowledge the work has been done to bring this debate to this stage—most importantly, by the people in the wider community who came forward to share their ideas, their frustrations and their anger through the various committees that have been operating. This parliament sets up committees, but we then rely on the community to feed us the information we need to make decisions that represent Australia. I have heard the argument about taking leadership; of course that is important, but one element must be that we can speak on behalf of our nation. In the submissions that came forward to both the joint select committee and the expert panel convened under the wonderful Patrick Dodson to talk with the community, we can read how important this issue is.


And it is symbolic. I am a bit worried that people see symbolism as not having power. Of course it has power. Symbols reflect need. They reflect action. Symbols can cause action and commitment. So this is symbolic. People who gave evidence to those two groups talked about the importance of symbolism and the fact that they felt Aboriginal and Islander people of this country must be acknowledged in our Constitution. There was no real doubt: that must happen. What we have to do is work out how to make it happen.


If we are going to be true to all those people who came forward to talk about why this was important for them, we have got to find a way to put the argument back out to the community so that this will be another successful referendum result, of which there are way too few. 


We know how difficult it is to get a referendum result up in the positive. It has to be across the whole nation. It cannot just be the majority of states. A referendum of this nature must be supported by all states. In fact, we need to reflect on the 1967 referendum, in which we got such an amazing result. We need to be equalling that to be true to ourselves and to be able to make a statement not just for this generation but for those to come that we as a nation believe this is the right thing to do—and this has been said many times. 


Mr Acting Deputy President Furner, you know about the Australian constitutional conventions—the process that encourages young people to come together to look at our Constitution, to become engaged with it and to see what should work with our Constitution. It is an inspiring thing to work with those young people who may never even have thought about reading the Constitution until some teacher dobbed them in. But, when they did get that opportunity, they felt that it was their document. We need the passion of those young people looking at why these changes should be made for them and for future generations. We need not just to look at recognition—certainly the bill concentrates on recognition—but, most importantly, to take the other steps, which I think have been put forward in discussion, to remove any hint of discrimination on race in our Constitution. This document belongs to all Australians.


The bill before us is a step to ensure that all Australians can be part of the discussion. Whilst I know in my heart that not all Australians will take a role in this process, I am hoping that what we do as a parliament and what we do through our community will be to make sure that more people see that this is something that is real and that it actually belongs to them—Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and people who are not fortunate enough to have Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander heritage. We can work together to ensure that we have a change, an agreed change, that will take away the hurt and pain that was in our document from the time that our forefathers signed off on it. 


I know that people have strong views about this process. I know that there are a range of views about what should and should not be in it and how fast we can move forward, but we have an opportunity through the passing of this bill to say that we as a parliament accept that this is our job. It is our job to ensure that within a two-year period we have a question that is effectively framed and can go to the Australian people—all of the Australian people—and that they can own it and can say, 'Yes, we'll be able to acknowledge all Australians in our Constitution.' This is an important element. 


We all have a job to do in this process. It is not good enough just to stand in this place and make a speech. In fact, we have to commit together to take further action. The bill gives us a framework to do that. It actually tells us to get on with the job. I want to acknowledge all the parliamentarians both in this place and in the other who have said that they will be part of the future and not just sit and long for things of bygone days.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-02-26,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:40):  I rise today to support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012. I am very pleased that this has reached the parliament and that it has the support of this parliament. It is incredibly important that the parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, recognises that the continent and islands now known as Australia were first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It is also important for the parliament to acknowledge the continuing relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their traditional land and waters, and also for the parliament, on behalf of the people, to acknowledge and respect the continuing cultures, languages and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Often there is that statement, but then the actions of the parliament are quite different. 


I cite today what is going at James Price Point in Western Australia as a classic case of where there is a failure to acknowledge and respect the continuing cultures, languages and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. I lead into that because it is critical that we do not just have the sentiment expressed in the parliament. We actually need this sentiment to be translated into constitutional change and then into legal frameworks which give it effect and which give it compliance and enforcement capacity in the law down the track. Having said that, I am pleased at least that we have got to the point where the parliament is doing this. I am particularly pleased that we are doing it because it was part of the Greens agreement with the Gillard government. We said in that agreement, when we agreed to give the Prime Minister government, to:



Hold referenda during the 43rd Parliament or at the next election on Indigenous constitutional recognition and recognition of local government in the Constitution.



It was because the Greens put this into that agreement that we then saw the formation of the expert panel, and then we saw the work of the expert panel—and, as my colleague Senator Siewert talked about a little while ago, what a great report has come from that expert panel. She said that we ought to take very seriously the work that has been done by everybody on the panel and the secretariat who supported them and the input from communities around the country. In fact, so much trust and faith has been invested in its document that it would be disrespectful not to work from it as the basis of how we go forward. 


Having said that, I think this parliament is now committed to placing before the Australian people at a referendum a proposal for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This will, of course, require the building of a national consensus in order to achieve that. As we all know, you do not succeed with referenda in Australia unless you build a national consensus and, in fact, that all political parties agree to get behind the proposal and work for it in every capacity. I would argue that every one of us in acknowledging country whenever we go and speak anywhere ought to be not only acknowledging that the land we stand on is the traditional land of the group of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples that we are particularly referring to in terms of that part of country but particularly then going on to say that there is a commitment to move to constitutional recognition.


I think we should all be acknowledging country and building a national consensus. It is disappointing that we were not able to fulfil the agreement, as set out with the Prime Minister, to have a referendum on the Constitution in this 43rd Parliament. But I totally support the decision that has been made not to proceed with it before the next election, because we do not want to see it fail. We must build a consensus so that people get behind the next referendum as they got behind the 1967 referendum. We must be make sure that the next referendum succeeds, and that is a challenge to everyone. I hope that throughout the election campaign candidates and sitting members get out there and start talking up the referendum in the community.


I pay particular respect today to all of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have given so much time to the issue of constitutional recognition and who continue to work in the best way they can to make it happen. I was delighted, on the day that this bill went through the House of Representatives, to meet Shirley Peisley, Lowitja O'Donoghue and Patrick Dodson, who were up here having a small celebration. Shirley was there in 1967 as one of the people campaigning for the referendum, and I was delighted that she was able to come back and see that progress is being made towards another referendum. We are making slow progress, but at least we are on track. It is terrific that Shirley was able to be here and see that this is the case, and it was terrific that respect was paid to Lowitja O'Donoghue and Patrick Dodson and the other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who came along on the day. It was marvellous to see a lot of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people there listening the stories of their elders, participating in the discussion of what had gone before and clearly enthused about taking constitutional recognition to the next stage. The Greens will certainly be there with them to do so.


It is important not only to recognise the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the first occupants of Australia and to acknowledge their relationship with their traditional lands and waters and their language, culture and heritage but also to recognise the ugliness of the Constitution's having been drafted on the premise of race. I remember that it came home to me, when we were debating a bill of rights in Australia, that the reason the Constitution as first drafted did not include a bill of rights is that there was a very deliberate decision taken not to include a bill of rights because it would have had to recognise that everyone is born equal. The Prime Minister at the time, Edmund Barton, said that we needed a power in the Constitution to enable the federal parliament to pass laws against 'the coloured and inferior persons' within the Commonwealth. That is the basis of our Constitution, and Australians must look back and reflect on it with some disgust—I suppose that is the best way to put it—because it was designed to make sure that Australia could discriminate against the Kanaka people, who were here working in the cane fields, and against Chinese people who had come here after the gold rushes—and, of course, over time to discriminate also against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.


Unfortunately, section 25 of the Constitution still gives states the power to enact laws that disenfranchise people on the basis of their race. Under section 51, subsection (xxvi), the Commonwealth still has the ability to make laws based on race, and that clearly has to change; we must change the part of the Constitution that enables the Commonwealth to make laws based on race. We have to face up to this in Australia. We must recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and remove from our Constitution the last vestiges of its possible use to discriminate on the basis of race. We have to be upfront that we are doing it, because doing so will in turn—as my colleague Senator Siewert said—set up a framework to have an ongoing discussion about sovereignty and a treaty and so on down the track. In no way does this bill as proposed detract from the ability of people to talk about such issues as people become more familiar with the context surrounding the issues as well as with their details.


In the mid-1990s in Tasmania, when I was member of a parliament in which the Greens held the balance of power in a Liberal minority government, we had a tripartite agreement to say sorry to the stolen generation. It was one of the most dignified moments in the Tasmanian parliament. People were amazed that the agreement was made under a Liberal minority government working with the Greens. It was extraordinary when we invited Tasmania's Aboriginal people onto the floor of the parliament to respond. It was marvellous to be here in the Senate more than a decade later when the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, came and extended the same apology federally. But Tasmania led the way on an apology to the stolen generation, and I am pleased to have been a parliamentarian on both occasions; I am also very pleased this time around to have made an agreement with the current Prime Minister. I am delighted by the work of my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert. I pay tribute to the work she has done on the expert panel. She has put a huge amount of time, effort, passion, love and heart into this work, which stands up for the rights—as Senator Siewert has always done—of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.


As Senator Siewert rightly points out, there are many occasions on which we have argued that the Commonwealth is making laws that are based on race—in the Northern Territory intervention and the legislation called Stronger Futures, which we believe is actually weaker futures. She has been leading the way on recognising the rights of Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander people and standing up for their wellbeing, for their health, for their education and for their communities. Her work in this period needs to be recognised because it has been a huge investment at a personal level for a community outcome that is working towards the best interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and, of course, working with them to achieve that. It is very much an organic process of consultation and input. It is not about top-down imposition; it is about engagement and discussion. I congratulate her and the panel and, as Senator Siewert did herself, the secretariat, who have all worked on this. I think everyone would acknowledge that the more you get involved in it, the more discussions you have, the more engagement you have, the more it becomes obvious that there is an overwhelming imperative to work to achieve these good outcomes.


The other thing during this period of parliament which the Greens are very proud about is that, following the lead of the Greens representatives on the Darwin City Council, we secured in our negotiations with the Gillard government an acknowledgement of country at the start of every sitting day. It has now become a part of the institutional arrangement of this parliament, and it would not have happened if it had not been for the Greens and, in particular, the Greens lead on the Darwin City Council that translated through to our work here in the Senate. It shows that when you vote for the Greens you get a consistent policy right through the spectrum. I think it is wonderful that we have seen that. We did move to have the acknowledgement of country be the first matter for the Senate each day as it is in the House of Representatives, but unfortunately that was not agreed to by either the coalition or the Labor Party. Nevertheless, we think it should be consistent in both houses and would like to see that occur.


But the main point of today is to say how pleased the Greens are that this has been advanced to the point where it is, to absolutely say up front that we are committed to making sure that we get constitutional recognition of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and that we get a referendum, and we will do everything in our power to build a community consensus for that and to finally remove from the Constitution section 51(xxvi) to take away the Commonwealth's ability to make laws based on race. That will be a major celebration in Australia when it is achieved—and I am not going to say 'if'. We have a two-year time frame to get that in before the sunset clause comes into effect. It is incumbent on all of us to work to achieve that outcome, to make sure that we get the referendum and that as a nation we can celebrate, really stand up and say: finally, Australia has shed that shadow that has been over our Constitution for such a long period of time. Finally, we can say in Australia, as the bill indicates, that we acknowledge on behalf of all of us, no matter where we have come from, and recognise that the continent and the islands now known as Australia were first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We can stand up and acknowledge the continuing relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with their traditional land and waters and acknowledge and respect the continuing cultures, language and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.


Please, I would ask that as members of parliament, when you go out there and talk about this, you give some thought to what it means to you personally, because there will be nothing more offensive to people than to hear you mouth that on the one hand and then agree to the complete compromising of that by ignoring that language, culture and association with country when it comes to a choice between some of the projects that are put up and the rights and recognition of Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander people. That is the moral dilemma that faces many in this parliament, but I can assure you that for the Greens it is straightforward. When we say we acknowledge those points, we mean it. We believe that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people deserve constitutional recognition and have an ongoing connection to their land, their water, their culture, their language and their heritage, and we will do everything in our power to respect it, uphold it and work for the constitutional recognition which will provide the framework for continuing to strengthen it.

 (Queensland) (13:57):  I know that I and, I think, most Australians support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012. Without this bill, I think most Australians including myself recognise that the continent known as Australia was first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I think we all accept the continuing relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with the traditional land and waters, and I am sure that, as well, we all respect the continuing cultures. I want to return to that later in my speech.


But, just at the moment, I want to say that, for all the words I have heard here today, there are Indigenous people dying in Townsville because the federal government will not fund transport to get Indigenous people from their place of residence to dialysis treatment in Townsville Hospital. You can speak all you like about this bill, but I want to see the federal government and the Greens actually do something tangible to assist Indigenous people. I have written to Ms Macklin, Ms Plibersek and Mr Snowdon asking for transport for these Indigenous people to get to dialysis. Have I had any response? None at all. This is an urgent situation, and in Townsville I am aware of one person having died because they could not get transport from their place of residence to a hospital. That is where you should start your care and concern for Indigenous people. In these few seconds I have before the break, I want to emphasise that. If there are ministers here from the government, would you please get on to Ms Macklin, Ms Plibersek or Mr Snowdon and ask them to have a look at my letter to them of 20 February, just a few days ago, and please do something for these Indigenous people who desperately need help.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the minister's response.


I am willing to accept that they have been tabled—if so, they have been tabled in the last 60 minutes. The question that I asked on 9 August was in relation to industrial disputation during the year 2011-12. I asked: what was the annual cost to the economy and what was the impact on Australia's productivity; and does the Treasurer acknowledge that there has been an increase in industrial action? That question was asked in August 2012. We had all of September, all of October, all of November, all of December, all of January and now nearly all of February for an answer.


Why was the government so reluctant to provide an answer? It is very simple. It is because the Australian Bureau of Statistics is now telling us that, during the year ending June 2012, there were 293,100 working days lost, compared with 159,800 in the previous year. That is a huge surge, a huge increase, in the number of days lost due to industrial disputation. We have also been told that there were 101,700 working days lost due to industrial disputation in the June quarter of 2012 alone—just in that quarter—which is an increase from 35,800 in the March quarter of 2012. That means this is the highest level of working days lost since the June quarter of 2004. No wonder Labor did not want to talk about days lost due to industrial disputation.


Australians have recently seen the ugly face of union militancy and industrial disputation, like those ugly scenes we all saw on our TV screens at the Myer Emporium, where thugs were hitting and beating police horses and policemen; and where members of a trade union had to plead with their trade union bosses to stop the intimidation and thuggish behaviour—by placing an advertisement in the newspaper asking them to desist!—because they had no beef with their employer and they wanted to go to work. They had no problem with their employer. But, in those circumstances, there were still illegal pickets being put in place. That was in Melbourne. In Brisbane, there was the situation with Abigroup and the Queensland Children's Hospital—similarly, an illegal picket, and industrial disputation that went on for eight weeks. We then have the Little Creatures dispute and the City West Water dispute.


In the light of all this, the government cannot come up with an answer as to the number of days lost. But guess what? The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, chances are, has just completed a speech to the Western Australian Branch of the Maritime Union of Australia state conference, which has as its theme 'Celebrating 140 years'—celebrating 140 years of union militancy. The minister for workplace relations is there to open a conference celebrating union militancy. No wonder the government did not want to go anywhere near this answer until it is dragged out of them. The minister should not have opened or attended a conference which deals with and celebrates union militancy.


Unionism in 2013 should be about negotiation. It should be about reasonable discussion, not about thuggish behaviour, such as scaring workers from going to their own workplaces, or attacking police horses. But that is the face of unionism that Mr Shorten is celebrating over in Western Australia today. No wonder the government would not answer this question on notice. They are rightly ashamed of the figures, which highlight the point that we as the coalition have been making—that is, there is a union militancy problem in our country. I thank the minister and I look forward to reading the answer.


Question agreed to.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (15:07):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to a question without notice asked by Senator Back today relating to Western Australia and the Prime Minister.


It is one thing for an opposition to criticise the current Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, for her grotesque failure of policy in this country, but I have to say that it takes it to a whole new level when an entire state division of the Australian Labor Party—and, of course, I mean the great state of Western Australia's division—issues an edict stating that the Prime Minister of Australia and her federal colleagues are not to cross the border and are not to come anywhere near Western Australia in the lead-up to the state election. 


I take you to the report in the Australian on 23 February by Samantha Maiden headed 'Gillard told ""keep out of WA""'. On reading this report, I almost feel personally embarrassed for the Prime Minister. Samantha Maiden's report states: 


We rang everyone in December and said, 'Please, don't come'—


to Western Australia. That is a Labor strategist speaking. Can you just imagine them sitting in their offices and picking up the phone to the Prime Minister and picking up the phone to Labor ministers and saying, 'Oh please, please, if you do anything, don't come near Western Australia because we are so on the nose in Western Australia that, if you do cross that border, if you are seen standing next to us, it is going to be a bad election result for Labor in any event but this will make it a total disaster'? Let's read it again because it is just so embarrassing: 'We rang everyone in December and said, ""Please don't come""' to WA.


But what does Labor frontbencher Bill Shorten do? He flies into Western Australia regardless, because he could not care less what Labor strategists say. He could not care less what the Prime Minister says. Let us face it: we all know where he wants to be, and that is in the Prime Minister's position. So what have they said about good old Mr Shorten, who flew into Western Australia on a 'fly-in fly-out visit', as they have termed it? It has prompted much mirth amongst Labor MPs, who have suggested that he must have received special air clearance to actually undertake that visit. You have to wonder who gave him that special air clearance. 




Senator Abetz:
  The MUA. 




Senator CASH:
  Exactly. The MUA—good old Labor union mates. Seriously, Mr Deputy President, you can actually see Mr McGowan, can't you, sitting in his office and thinking, 'I've got this great thing happening'? It is almost like: 'It is my party, Ms Gillard. I will invite who I want to, and I can tell you: you ain't on my list of people who will be coming over.' 


As most senators and members would know, we spend hours going through the invitations that come to our office and working out: 'Can we? Can't we? Should I make it a priority? Should I juggle my diary to ensure that I can get to a certain event?' The good news for the Prime Minister is that she can do a lot of juggling, because she is not allowed to get on that plane to make the almost five-hour journey west and go anywhere near Western Australia. Her staff are probably in her office on a daily basis thinking, 'Please, please, something from WA.' But the edict is very, very clear. The Labor Party in Western Australia have spoken. Federal Labor should not and will not come anywhere near our great state. Why is that? Mark McGowan, the leader of state Labor, has made it very clear. He has totally ditched Labor's carbon tax. Why has he ditched it? Because he knows it is an impost on business. It is an impost on families. He knows that federal Labor should ditch that policy. He also knows that Labor's mining resource rent tax is an anti-WA tax, and this is, of course, despite the federal member for Brand, Gary Gray, proudly standing in the parliament in its last sitting and stating:


The mining tax is an outstanding tax, works effectively and has many, many benefits.


The people of Brand should be very, very worried when their own federal representative supports a tax that is vehemently anti-Western Australia and is the one tax that the Labor Party introduced which raises next to no money. And then, Mr Deputy President—and do not start me on it—there is the Western Australian position on Australia's borders. They were behind John Howard every single step of the way. 


The question that the Labor Party at a federal level need to ask themselves is: 'If state Labor have worked out that those three policies are not in the interests of Western Australia, when is the federal government going to work that out?' (Time expired)

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:13):  I am absolutely amazed at the fascination that people on the other side have with the Prime Minister's diary. If you are keen to find out what is in the diary of the Prime Minister or those of the members of the cabinet, the other members and all of us—we have diaries as well—we are more than happy to give you a look at them. It is really an easy thing to do to just share that. To have the whole of this period focused on what is happening with whose diary and when seems to me to be an interesting policy process. We have seen the attempt to link the diary to policy—and I admire that. To link the diary to policy is a good effort. However, what we all know in this place and what those of us who have been working in this area for a long time know is that consistently over many years in state politics and in federal politics people have an ongoing discussion about the way to determine a strategy and a campaign. There has been this process to work this out, and that has always been—certainly from the Queensland perspective—to look at what the issues are in a state election and then focus in on them. I have looked at what has been going on—even though I do not have an intimate knowledge, as I know my colleague Senator Sterle has—and I have seen what issues have been raised in the state election in WA. People are looking at their own issues. They are looking at the budget. They are looking at job cuts. They are looking at transport. These are all things that are effective and needed in the state arena. The state strategy campaigner said: 'We are wanting to make it clear to the people of Western Australia that we are running in a state election. We are putting up our candidates. We are putting up our people. And we are focusing in on the state election in WA.' It is a process that happens all the time.


It is a noble attempt by the people on the other side to link the WA election to the diaries of our cabinet ministers—for example, the fact that Minister Shorten, at the invitation of the WA union, went into WA in a fly-in fly-out visit. It is unheard of for a minister to go to a meeting and then fly out to another meeting! It is newsworthy, and I hope that the media will look at how many times in the final period before a state election—when was the last election?—people flew into a meeting, attended the meeting and then flew away! That is a big story; we must have some kind of review to see how often it happens!


I always acknowledge the extraordinary amount of travel time that members from Western Australia have to put in just to do their job; I know that one of the major issues our members from Western Australian have is the amount of time they have to spend on planes. All too often, because of the demands on their time, they have to fly in and out on what we lovingly call in Queensland 'the red-eye'. I often see people staggering off the plane having just completed the long journey from WA.


Those opposite are fascinated with diaries and checking out where cabinet members are going to be next. In question time we had a question focusing on—and concerned about—why the Prime Minister had been in a New South Wales venue. Are we now going to say that the New South Wales people have a special double interest in whether they invite members of cabinet to their areas? The people on the other side are attempting purely to make a political point that they believe is going to help in some way their side in the WA election.


It always interests me that, every time there is a state election, you find LNP senators making speeches in the adjournment debate and saying a range of things about the evils of the Labor people in their state. It seems that they think that doing so will have an impact on the result of the election; I do not believe that it will. A media statement came out, purporting to be from the leader of the Labor Party in WA, in which a decision is made on the way that things are operating in the WA state election. Those opposite should focus on the state and on the state election. They are the important issues.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2013-02-26,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (15:17):  No matter how hard Senator Moore tries—and it was a good effort, I must say—to camouflage and throw up detractors, she does not deal with the issue of why the ALP state leader, Mark McGowan, has banned Prime Minister Gillard from Western Australia for the duration of the Western Australian state election campaign. This is an incredible state of affairs. It is unprecedented for a Prime Minister to be seen as such a political liability by a state division of a party—in this case the Labor Party—that the Prime Minister is banned from coming to the state—in this case Western Australia, which is driving the Australian economy. You would think that, if the Australian Prime Minister wanted to go anywhere, it would be to the state which is earning all the export income and generating all the money for Australia's development. But the fact is that the Prime Minister has been asked to stay away from Western Australia because she is such bad news there.


Senator Moore made a great effort in talking about Shorten coming to Western Australia. But isn't it interesting that he just flew in and out and did not stay there as you would expect any senior minister to do? You would expect a whole range of branches to have functions for him to come to, but he sneaked in and out as quickly as possible so he was not seen in Perth or anywhere else around Western Australia. It tells you that the Western Australian state Labor organisation knows how badly this federal government is on the nose in Western Australia.


It is not hard to understand why the ALP in WA does not want the senior federal ministers in Western Australia. It comes back to the fact that Western Australia is driving the Australian economy and to the fact that our economy is based on international investment in the resources and mining sectors. Over the years Western Australia has received huge investments, running into hundreds of millions of dollars, because WA governments from the time of Sir Charles Court—who founded the Pilbara iron ore industry and the North West Shelf oil and gas industry—have made investors welcome in Western Australia and because the state has had a low sovereign risk profile. But the federal Labor government has destroyed Australia's reputation for low sovereign risk, and it has done so in part through the very taxes which Senator Moore referred to: the minerals resource rent tax and the super profits tax, which Prime Minister Rudd sought to introduce. These taxes have scared the international mining industry. They know that Western Australia, though it was once a very friendly place to miners, is no longer so because of the overriding power and influence of the present federal government over taxation. So the international mining industries have walked. There is no doubt that they are investing very heavily in other parts of the world, such as West Africa. It is said that most of the Australian and international companies who have invested in West Africa have their head offices in West Perth. That tells a story all by itself—even Australian money is leaving Western Australia because of the sovereign risk represented by the Rudd and Gillard governments.


This government is anti-investment and antimining, and in due course we will see the consequences of that.


Another reason which cannot be overlooked is that Julia Gillard tried to use Western Australia's GST—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Prime Minister Gillard, Senator Eggleston, thank you.




Senator EGGLESTON:
  Prime Minister Gillard—to take over the Western Australian hospital system, which Western Australia's Premier, Colin Barnett, defeated. That is another reason why she is not welcome in WA. (Time expired)

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2013-02-26,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:22):  Before I make my contribution, can I just make it clear that I have the greatest of respect for Senator Eggleston. I sincerely mean that. I know that the fine work that he did through the Pilbara region of Western Australia in his past life will never be forgotten. Senator Eggleston, we are going to miss you because you are one of the gentlemen. But to say that the minerals resource rent tax has frightened the miners off! Let us just get one thing very clear: it is a profit based tax. I do not know how many times—through you, Mr Deputy President—I have stood here and defended a profit based tax on our miners, on our commodities, on our resources, and I say sincerely that it is a far better designed tax than the royalty nonsense that we have now. But, Senator Eggleston, to say that we have frightened off all these miners!


I must be mistaken, but I have just seen record profits with Rio Tinto and with BHP on their iron ore—thank goodness we have got that in Western Australia. But, if you are not making a superprofit of, what, $75 million—I am confused now because of the nonsense coming from that side—you do not pay the tax. Let me think. If you are a miner, or let us just say you are a businessperson of any industry, if you make a profit of $75 million and you are going to pay a tax, would that stop you investing in your business? Come on, Senator Eggleston! I was having a giggle. I had to hide, I actually had to duck down behind the seat, because I was trying not to giggle. I wear glasses, but I could see on your face that you did not even believe what you were saying.


But let us talk about this nonsense of Minister Shorten going across to the MUA state conference in Perth. Are you ready for this, everyone? This is breaking news for the media. Damn, I was invited too, and—do you know what?—I really wanted to go, but I contacted Chris Cain, the secretary of the MUA and a good friend of mine. I knew Chris long before he was the secretary of the MUA. I actually organised with his brother John Cain at the TWU—a damn good Labor family. I apologised, 'Sorry, Chris, I couldn't be there,' and I spoke to Minister Shorten last week because he was going across. I said: 'Great. Please pass on my best to the MUA.'


In Senator Abetz's terrible description of working-class people and representatives of organised labour as 'thugs', Chris Cain must be a real thug, because when he took over the MUA he had a membership of some 600; he now has 4½ thousand members. What does that tell me? In Western Australia there must be a heck of a lot of seamen and a heck of a lot of waterside workers who want the MUA to represent them in their negotiations.


I stood shoulder to shoulder with Chris Cain on the picket lines in 1998 when a former Liberal industrial relations minister, Peter Reith, decided with his good mate Chris Corrigan, with the full support of no less than John Howard, that it was a fantastic idea that we should replace Australian waterside workers with fly-in labour or labour that was trained in Dubai. I saw that there were Alsatian dogs on the gates with thugs—I will use that word 'thugs'—in balaclavas. In all my years of organised labour and being around organised labour and working-class men and women, representing them in the workforce as a truck driver and as a union organiser, I never, ever, ever remember pulling on a balaclava. I never remember anyone from the MUA pulling on a balaclava to go and talk to working men and women about their rights and occupational health and safety on their worksite. But it was all very well for the other side of the chamber to stand there as they did, shoulder to shoulder, one on one, absolutely congratulating Peter Reith at the time, and Chris Corrigan, that it was all right to have thugs in balaclavas with Alsatian dogs. Come on! Thank goodness, Australian people are not that dumb. Thank goodness, Australian people can see through the rhetoric and the rubbish coming from that side of the chamber.


I do not have the time to say this, but I must say quite clearly that $3.7 billion in infrastructure spending has been committed to Western Australia. This is under the Gillard government. In all those years of the Howard government, we were left behind in Western Australia. It was all very well for the Liberal feds to stick their hand up to take the money that they could take from Western Australia, but did they return it in infrastructure? Did they what! Absolutely not. I have a list of things that I would love to go through with you, Mr Deputy President, to see the look on the faces of that side of the chamber: a list of the infrastructure projects that have been committed to and are underway and will be finished in the next year or so— (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2013-02-26,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:27):  I picked up the West Australian newspaper this morning to read the headline 'Gillard goes west in bid to lift ALP vote', and I thought that, as a result of the latest Newspolls, there are at least two or three people in Western Australia still voting for the Prime Minister, and I am sure their hearts were gladdened.




Senator Sterle:
  I am!




Senator BACK:
  You are here, Senator Sterle, but in fact, when we say that she was going west, she was not going west to Western Australia; she was going to Western Sydney. Western Sydney is as far west as we can expect the Prime Minister to get. But why is she not going to Western Australia? Why is it that state Labor leader Mark McGowan has banned the Prime Minister from going anywhere near WA? The reason, of course, is that he knows of her poor judgement. He knows of her poor judgement with carbon tax, with mining tax, in fact with practically every single solitary thing that she picks up.


Let me tell you here on the east coast that the Labor brand is so toxic in Western Australia that candidates are not using the name Labor. They are not using the Labor logo, and they are not using the Labor red colours. If that does not tell you something about the shame of their party in my home state then I am sure I have to go a long way further.


Let me give you an indication of where the Prime Minister's poor judgement has reflected in my state. I go no further than an article this morning in which the Catholic schools slammed the Prime Minister and Gonski reform. I will quote the Catholic schools. Incidentally, there are 1,700 schools, three-quarters of a million students and 83,000 staff. Forty per cent of students in my state are educated in Catholic schools. They said:


… Julia Gillard's school reforms lack detail, use ill-defined terms … and risk burdening principals with more red tape …


They go on to say:


… the … funding reforms had scant substance or detail about who would pay for the billions of dollars required.


You could extend that comment well beyond Gonski and school funding. You could apply it basically to everything which, under the poor judgement and leadership of this Prime Minister, is affecting Australia generally but particularly affecting my own home state of Western Australia.


When Prime Minister Gillard took over from then Prime Minister Rudd, she said that she would fix the boats. We know the results with the boats. And Senator Cash, coming back from the wheat belt the other day, I went past the enormous facility at Northam. Having just been in towns like Southern Cross, Merredin and York, and other places where there are no or very few medical and nursing facilities, very few dental facilities, we know that in Northam at the asylum seekers camp they are absolutely overflowing with those very facilities and resources that are being denied the people of Western Australia. Had the Prime Minister gone to Western Australia, had she overruled Mark McGowan, she may have learnt something of the anger of Western Australians with respect to her inability to stop the boats.


I turn to the second of her enormous promises—that was to fix the mining resource rent tax. Well, wasn't she done over? Wasn't she done slowly, she and Treasurer Swan? I remind people on the other side that under our Constitution it is the right of the states to impose royalties on minerals. As Senator Eggleston says, royalties are a price on the mineral. I heard yesterday in this chamber Labor senators talking about the funds being available for citizens of Australia. Well, hello! Are citizens of Western Australia no longer citizens of Australia? All of us who are students of the Constitution know very well that fiscal equalisation is the mechanism by which Australians generally share the benefits.


We have heard Senator Sterle going on about the big miners. The biggest taxpayer in this country is Rio Tinto. The best way of getting more income for a government is to create conditions that will allow more investment and greater profitability. In my meetings with mining industry people this week I learnt that geologists, mining engineers and mining construction workers are now on unemployment lists in ever-greater numbers. So I warn the south-east coast of Australia that the penny section is coming to a halt. There are many reasons why the Prime Minister should be in Western Australia, but the statement of the state Labor leader that he wants her to stay away from that state is a damning indictment.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (15:38):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 23 February 2013, of the Honorable Joan Child, AO, former Speaker of the House of Representatives and member for Henty, and places on record its appreciation of her long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to her family in their bereavement.


Joan Child was the first Labor woman to be elected to the House of Representatives in 1974. In a lifetime of achievements, she recorded another historic first when she was elected as the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1986. Joan held this position for three-and-a-half years until she resigned in 1989 after a period of illness.


A significant change to the parliament during Joan's period as Speaker included the transition from the provisional Parliament House to the new Parliament House. The presiding officers had oversight of both the construction of the new building and the successful move into it. The logistics of this exercise were considerable. Parliament House is, after all, the size of a country town. Obviously, the key to this building is a symbolic and legislative role of the chambers, but this is underpinned by a huge range of infrastructure and services supporting the community's elected representatives, media and staff. Twenty-five years later, the occupants of this building are still benefiting from the care, thought and attention to detail of those who planned and delivered the facilities we now take for granted. Joan's role as Speaker was considerable in drawing together and managing the many levels this task involved.


Joan was tremendously proud of the new Parliament House and the collective achievement of all involved who delivered this building. She was also tremendously fond of the old building. One of her last acts as Speaker in the old House of Representatives chamber was leading members of that place as they sat in session for the last time and sang Auld Lang Syne.


Joan was born in Melbourne on 3 August 1921. Joan was widowed early in life. With a strong resolve and courage, she raised five boys on her own. She worked on a process line and as a cleaner to supplement the meagre widow's pension available in the 1960s. Joan's personal experiences informed her politics. She said politics was about people and that she wanted to help people. A supporter and member activist in the ALP for many years, Joan entered politics later in life. She was elected to the south-east Melbourne seat of Henty in 1974 but was defeated the following year. Re-elected in 1980, she successfully held Henty for the next three elections. Between the years 1984 and 1986, Joan became Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker. With the abolition of her seat prior to the 1990 election, Joan chose not to seek re-election in another seat.


Joan served on several parliamentary committees, particularly on those relating to the parliament, including the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Parliamentary Library and the Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House.


As Speaker, Joan spurned traditional robes. Always practical, she said that a wig would only flatten her hair. She also more than met the challenge of the robust debate that is characteristic of the other chamber. Thirty years later, recollections become coloured by nostalgia. At the time, however, it is always a different matter. This was a time when Paul Keating's incisive parliamentary contributions skewered the opposition, when Kim Beazley and Ian Sinclair were dogged combatants and when 'Iron Bar' Tuckey tested the boundaries of parliamentary procedure. Joan was a woman managing the chamber when the House and wider Australian society was not accustomed to seeing women controlling and directing institutions. She exercised her role as Speaker with the patience and directness that was also her approach to life.


Joan was a role model then and remains a role model now to many who knew her and worked with her. I am immensely proud to say that I also worked with Joan. Joan remained active in Labor Party affairs in her retirement. She was also a member of the Patrons Council of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria. Her hobbies included gardening, reading detective fiction and listening to Elvis Presley. Joan was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in June 1990.


Joan's influence on other ALP members was considerable. She was an energetic and positive woman of immense resilience, honesty and good humour. She was respected and well loved by those who knew her.


I have many fond memories of talking with Joan and admiring the electoral machine that was the electorate in which she lived. She had mastered the art of local campaigning. I have, to this day, never seen someone who could command such knowledge as she did of the electorate she lived in, the voters, the people that she worked closely with and the people that she fought on behalf of. She was an extraordinary politician. She was an extraordinarily fine woman. She was tough. I often remember having discussions with her about a variety of issues. She was tough, but the kindness and the gentleness always shone through that. Despite her groundbreaking achievements in the parliament, Joan remained involved with her community. She was well loved and will be missed. On behalf the government, I offer condolences to her family.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2013-02-26,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:45):  The coalition joins with the government in supporting this motion of condolence. Joan Child was a trailblazer in the Labor Party who never lost her humility. Joan Child was born in 1921, a date to which I will return. Her father was a postmaster of Beechworth. She later attended Camberwell Church of England Girls Grammar School.


I am obliged to point out that Mrs Child lived in Launceston in Tasmania for some years. Her husband, who was a business manager there, regrettably died there in 1963, leaving Joan a widow with five sons between the ages of seven and 18 to support. She worked on an assembly line in a knitting factory, as a sales assistant, as a cook in a geriatric hospital and as a house cleaner to provide for her family. She then worked as an electorate officer and research officer for several Labor MPs, including—no descriptor necessary—Jim Cairns. How that worked, given her right-wing affiliation, I am not sure. But I am sure they somehow managed.


In 1974, Joan Child won the Victorian seat of Henty on her second attempt. In her early 50s, she became the Labor Party's first woman in the House of Representatives—71 years after women were first able to stand for election. She was the fourth woman so elected. Of course, this side of politics takes great pride in a fellow Tasmanian, Dame Enid Lyons, who won a seat in the House of Representatives in 1943, some 31 years earlier. Joan Child was defeated in the 1970 landslide but came back in 1980 having spent at least 10 hours a week doorknocking.


In February 1981, she asked Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and Speaker Sir Billy Sneddon to cease referring to MPs as 'honourable gentlemen'. This was not because the gentlemen were not honourable but because she wanted them to refer to 'honourable members'. Sir Billy replied:


The point is well made. I apologise deeply and profusely.


But he slipped up again shortly afterwards. On the qualities needed to enter parliament, she said:


I think you need to be very decisive. You must have the ability to say, ‘The buck stops with me’. I am a pretty bossy woman.


Clearly, she had some authority because she was Deputy Chairman of Committees and Chairman of Committees. She was then Speaker of the House from 1986 to 1989. She was the first woman Speaker of the House of Representatives.


I noticed that various media reports state that Joan Child was 48 when she first won the seat of Henty. By my calculation, on the basis of being born in 1921, she must have actually been 53. In fact, I noticed similar anomalies in every report of her trailblazing career. But that is an aside; it does not take away from what was a fantastic career. She was able to hide that part of her life exceptionally well and undoubtedly that is what made her so well suited to the intricacies of Labor Party politics. In relation to her age, she said on becoming Speaker:


I don’t discuss it. If you want to discuss it I’m in my late fifties. I just will not be pinpointed on exactly how old I am.


By my calculation, her late-50s was actually 64 at the time. She seems to have got away with it her whole career and good on her. Clearly, being in her mid-60s only enhanced Joan Child's abilities and authority, given her life experience.


Although she found the position of Speaker to be an often lonely one, her decisiveness stood her in good stead. Her first review as Speaker said she came down so hard on everyone that they were reeling in shock. She was even compared to one of my heroes, Margaret Thatcher. The comment was that after her 'iron-fisted' performance members of both sides would have to restrain themselves to avoid a verbal lashing. Leaders were not immune either: Mr Peacock was ordered to stop talking out of turn and Mr Hawke was told, 'Okay, get going,' once she had obtained silence. Coalition members adapted well to calling the Speaker 'Madame Speaker', but Prime Minister Bob Hawke did on occasion stumble, addressing her as, 'Mr—er—Madame Speaker'. Joan Child eschewed the Speaker's ceremonial robes, saying:


… when I put my clothes on in the morning, I don't put on my dignity with them. I always have it with me.


And she did. Whilst I personally do not mind the robes and traditions, I will observe that in recent times we have seen that the more the robes and regalia the less the dignity.


I refer to a media report of March 1988, headed: 'MPs binge: Speaker offers to reimburse $1,000.' It is a story about the Speaker, Mrs Child, offering to:


… pay more than $1,000 of her own money to meet the expenses incurred last Thursday, when hundreds of people went on a binge through the bars and dining rooms of Parliament House and consumed $10,000 worth of free food and drink. Mrs Child said last night that the joint House department, which is in charge of parliament's catering service, would advise her of the final net loss and she would personally reimburse parliament for the outstanding amount.


Mrs Child said she accepted responsibility for the huge loss incurred because it was she who authorised the cafeteria and bars to remain open in spite of the work ban.


So a bit of industrial disputation undoubtedly was in play at the time.


But her plea—


and this is the interesting part; it is a pity the gallery is so empty—


that everyone involved should pay back the money they owed has fallen on many deaf ears. MPs and senators have agreed to pay up. The press gallery, however, has laid low. ""Sales from the non-members bar were significantly higher than a normal trading night,"" she said. This bar, which is frequented by journalists, suffered the biggest loss of all—$2,830, of which only $114 has been returned. Interestingly, Mrs Child sent a letter last night to the president of the press gallery—


guess who that was at the time: Paul Kelly—


asking him to urge his members to reimburse parliament and, of course, taxpayers.


I am just wondering if it is too late to have a Senate estimates committee and call Paul Kelly before it to inquire as to whether full payment was made!


During her time as Speaker, Joan Child had to deal with some particularly torrid exchanges. She had to face an opposition censure motion when the government stonewalled on questions and Treasurer Keating disagreed with Mrs Child and Mrs Child would not make the Treasurer withdraw a reflection against her. She certainly had dignity and grace. She made it a point not to criticise individuals within the parliament. After 3½ years in the speakership, she retired. The smile never left her face.


Amongst her outside interests, besides being an Elvis Presley devotee and an avid gardener, she was a Hawthorn supporter. She must have had some prescience about what agreements were going to be reached between the city she used to live in, namely Launceston, and the Hawthorn Football Club.


It was rumoured that she could become Australia's first female Governor-General, a job she later said she would not mind taking on. Regrettably, she never achieved that role. But deservedly, in 1990, she was awarded an AO in recognition of her service to the Australian parliament. The coalition salutes her service to our nation and extends condolences to her sons, Peter, Andrew, Geoffrey, Gary and Roger and the extended family.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:55):  I rise today to pay tribute to Joan Child and of course extend the condolences of the Greens to her family. I think it is worth reflecting on what a trailblazer she was for women in Australian politics. When Joan Child became Speaker of the House of Representatives in February 1986, there had never been a female Speaker, a female Governor-General, nor a woman as a Governor in any state. There had never been a woman to sit on the High Court bench, no woman as the leader of a state or territory government, no female leader of a political party and, naturally following from that, never a woman as Prime Minister of Australia.


The Senate today really can praise Joan Child because she did smash the glass ceiling in Australia's institutions of government. Other women quickly followed her through that gap, in state parliaments first, then in federal politics, past the debris and in through the gap she had broken. She really did lead the way for Australian women. Within the next five years, Justice Mary Gaudron was appointed to the High Court, Rosemary Follett had become the first leader of a government in the ACT, Dame Roma Mitchell was to be Governor of South Australia and Carmen Lawrence was to be Australia's first Premier. It was an important half-decade for women in public life and Joan Child was at the vanguard.


In other firsts, Joan Child was the first Speaker in this building, the first Speaker to receive flowers upon taking the chair and the first Speaker of Australia's parliament to introduce a bill, which has become a very important act, particularly for the Senate—the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. She was closely involved with the bill's formation, drawing in the views and opinions of all members of the House. As a result she helped to protect the witnesses and participants of our Senate committees to ensure their statements could not be used to establish a motive or intention for acts done outside parliament to be used in judicial proceedings. The Senate, as a house of inquiry, requires members and witnesses to know without doubt that they can speak their mind without fear of retribution. So we are grateful for Joan Child's contribution to their protection.


She also oversaw the creation of the Department of Parliamentary Services, again introducing the enabling legislation which saw the presiding officers take an administrative responsibility over the day-to-day functioning of the new parliament. The Library staff, gardeners, information technology, catering and the services of the clerks, Black Rod and Serjeant-at-Arms—all the wonderful services we enjoy—were brought together under her guidance and we thank her for her commitment to the effective and independent running of the parliament.


Joan Child knew that the importance of a Speaker lay in the position's duty to the parliament, not to her political party first—a truth that has sometimes been forgotten. However, the legacy she has left to both houses of the parliament and to her country will not be forgotten.


I regard one of the characteristics of leadership in women in public life that they not only be role models for other women but that they make changes to enable and empower the women who come after them to do more and go further than they had been able to themselves. I regard Joan Child not only as one of those women who was a role model for girls and women around the country in what could be achieved in political life; she did make institutional changes that made the parliament a better institution and that empowered other women to take on roles that they may previously have thought were out of their reach or domain. I pay tribute to her as a leading Australian woman and as a trailblazer.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (15:59):  Joan Child truly was a fabulous, dignified lady from an era, Senator Abetz, when one did not discuss a lady's age. She, like many of us today, obviously felt a greater weight of public scrutiny than many of her peers would have at that time. Joan Child provided great inspiration for women in the Labor Party, and she was known for her strong commitment to social justice. As Senator Conroy pointed out, she had a strong belief in helping people and working with people.


I would like to concentrate on how Joan never lost her interest in Labor politics. Joan was one of those people who felt that you should always do those things you might ask others to do. She was active and involved in all levels of the Labor Party. During this debate we have focused on Joan's period as Speaker and some of the other work she did in the parliament, but I would like to look at the time and the contribution that Joan made since leaving this parliament.


I first met Joan in the 1990 election when I was a member of her local Labor Party branch. This was shortly after she finished her period as the member for Henty in 1989. Joan was still there with her sleeves rolled up, active and involved with every ounce of her commitment and energy in that election campaign and that never changed. I moved on from that particular branch of the Labor Party, but my sister is currently a member and would still see Joan participating at the age of 91.


Eighteen months ago we celebrated 25 years since Joan Child became the first female Speaker. We had a morning tea with Harry Jenkins as Speaker, and it truly was a great experience to see Joan return to this parliament so many years after her period as Speaker and to have her reflect on the changes she saw as having transpired. When I first met Joan in 1990 I would not have imagined that I would be in this place, let alone talk to her 18 months ago about how she saw it. It was truly enlightening. Joan would have received great pleasure to see Anna Burke as another female Speaker of the parliament.


I must conclude my brief remarks by saying that she is one of those people who truly deserves the state funeral that will occur at Monash Religious Centre on Tuesday. I unfortunately will be in Darwin, far away from home, but I would like to give my condolences to her family and her many friends in the Victorian Labor Party.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:03):  I rise to add my condolences on the passing of the Hon. Joan Child AO. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to meet Joan Child, albeit very briefly, in the late 1980s. Joan was the first female ALP member of the House of Representatives. Reflecting on this in her first speech, Joan said that she felt 'deeply honoured at being the first woman elected to this House as an endorsed Labor Party candidate'. Joan's election, unfortunately, did come some 30 years after Senator Dorothy Tangney was elected to the Senate in 1943. Joan won the seat of Henty in 1974, being defeated in 1975, before serving as a member from 1980 until she retired from federal politics in 1990. Joan was appointed Australia's first female Speaker in February 1986, holding the position until 1989—a groundbreaking achievement. Joan could only be described as an ALP true believer. We have heard here today about Joan's commitment to the party prior to standing for the Labor Party, and her continuing commitment and passion for the party, and the work and policies that the Labor Party believes in, long, long after she left federal politics.


Joan was strongly committed to those in our community who were less fortunate. In particular I note from her first speech her commitment to and argument for appropriate support for people living with a disability and her hope that any legislation concerning people with a disability should pass easily, with compassion and understanding; that it would be accepted by states and would not be faced with a states-rights wrangle. I think she would certainly be very proud of the current Labor government's commitment to the NDIS and, indeed, the cross-party support for the NDIS.


Joan came from a true working-class background, having worked at a number of jobs including as a sales assistant, a cook, a cleaner and on an assembly line before entering politics. Joan will be fondly remembered as a passionate advocate for women's rights and for those in our community who are doing it tough. Joan believed that as a rich nation our wealth cannot be measured in building roads, airports and swimming pools. A nation's wealth is measured by the care and compassion it is prepared to extend to the old and lonely, the dependent, the disabled and the young who are at school. She also had a strong commitment to improving the lives of women, and this was evident right from the moment she was elected to parliament. On her election she refused to be photographed in her house as a housewife, saying: 'I am not standing as a housewife. I am a member of the ALP. As for the housework at home, my boys and I do it between us.'


As the first female Speaker things were very different for Joan. Reflecting on her time as Speaker, the current Speaker Anna Burke said when Joan was first elected Speaker, no-one knew what to call her. 'It started off as Mrs Speaker, but when it was later changed to Madam Speaker, Joan wryly observed she was not in charge of a brothel.' It is anecdotes such as these that highlight Joan's good sense of humour. She was blessed with humility and never forgot who put her into politics or why. For women in the ALP, Joan's election was a milestone, an indication that the battles waged to have women's voices heard in parliament had worked. Women were inspired and encouraged to face the challenges to continue our campaign for equal representation with determination. Joan's commitment to remembering where she came from also shone through in her first speech and it is an important message for all of us to remember. She said: 


The basis of election to a seat in Parliament is service to people. We are really public servants. The people made our election possible. They made it possible for us to take our seats in this House. That should be remembered, but it is all too often forgotten.


Joan will indeed be missed by her Labor family. I extend my sympathies to Joan's children and their families.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2013-02-26,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (16:07):  I join with colleagues in supporting this motion of condolence on the death of Joan Child. When I became a senator, Joan's time in caucus was drawing to a close. She, of course, was Speaker of the House of Representatives. I was the most junior member of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. Nevertheless, I remember how welcoming she was. Joan Child had an impressive record of achievement, both in the Labor Party and in the parliament. When I arrived in Canberra, no-one doubted that Joan Child was a formidable politician.


Joan Child joined the Australian Labor Party in 1968. By the time of the 1969 federal election, Joan's campaign expertise was very well recognised. She was campaign director in two federal seats, Lalor and Higgins. Albeit unusual, it was an early recognition of her capacity. Joan was Labor's candidate for Henty in the 1972 federal election. She ran a tremendous grassroots campaign, achieving a 9.1 per cent swing—although a 9.2 per cent swing was required. She lost by just 308 votes. By 1974, her hard work had paid off. Joan Child, as we have heard, was elected as the first Labor woman to the House of Representatives. Her term was to be all too brief, as she was swept away in the landslide of 1975. But Joan had built a great campaign team in Henty in the seventies, which was very widely recognised in the Labor Party as the best in the business. But in the 1977 federal election it was to be to no avail. Joan was defeated again.


After the disappointments of 1975 and 1977, Joan made the tough decision to run again in 1980. It paid off. She won, and in the following decade her very strong grassroots campaigning, the wide respect she had in the community and her understanding and empathy for the concerns of her constituents turned the seat of Henty into a Labor stronghold. I think that those years out of parliament after Joan's defeat in 1975 meant pursuing ministerial office would be difficult. I am sure she recognised that. But not all the options were to be closed off. In 1984, she became Chairman of Committees, or Deputy Speaker, after a tight caucus ballot which she won 50 votes to 49 votes, with two deliberate informals. Following the retirement of Dr Harry Jenkins Sr, in 1986, she became Speaker, as we have heard, this time unopposed in the caucus.


Upon taking the chair in the House, the new Speaker said that she expected to be less formal than her predecessor. She also made the point that she did not support the old Westminster tradition of speakers resigning from political parties. She said:


Just because I'm Speaker doesn't mean I'm not a member of the party or interested in its policies. I don't see any conflict of interest.


It was under her stewardship that the role of television in the parliament was greatly expanded. Joan Child was a strong advocate for bringing the parliament into the living rooms of Australia. She told the Age: 


Who knows, it might make us all spruce ourselves up a bit, behave better. You never know what might happen—cameras have a remarkable effect on politicians.


Joan Child acquitted herself very well as Speaker, but she never lost her common touch. Many here in Parliament House benefited from her wise counsel and personal support at tough times.


Joan retired in the 1990 federal election a highly respected parliamentarian, many would say a trailblazer. After her retirement, she remained active in the party but, as we have heard, had more time for gardening, always a passion, and to dip into yet another crime novel from her extensive library and, no doubt, to look after the cats—she was a cat lover as well. But she was also a sports lover—test cricket, tennis, the Hawthorn Football Club, not to mention her love of the punt. Robert Ray, himself a veteran of that Henty Labor machine, told me yesterday that Joan still had an active TAB account at 91 years of age. She loved the track.


Labor has lost one of its best, and my sincere sympathy also goes to Joan's family and friends.


Question agreed to, honourable senators standing in their places.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (16:15):  I give notice that on the next day of sitting I shall move:


That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Amendment Bill 2013, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.


I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The statement read as follows— 





STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2013 AUTUMN SITTINGS





MARINE SAFETY (DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL VESSEL) NATIONAL LAW AMENDMENT BILL





Purpose of the Bill 



The bill amends the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012 (the Act) to ensure that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), as the National Marine Safety Regulator (the National Regulator), is able to reimburse to the states and Northern Territory jurisdictions revenue collected from infringement notices issued by marine safety inspectors. 




Reasons for Urgency



The Act's original policy intention was that AMSA would remit to the states and Northern Territory revenue collected as a result of payment of infringement notices. Section 10 of the Act enables the National Regulator to pay amounts collected from infringement notice payments to the states or Northern Territory. However, sections 138 and 162 of schedule 1 to the Act refer to paying 'a penalty to the Commonwealth' rather than the National Regulator.


The legal and operational effect of sections 138 and 162 is that the Commonwealth, rather than AMSA, will be required to receive the revenue from the infringement notices. The Act does not contain an appropriations power, and the Commonwealth therefore does not have the power to reimburse the amounts to the states or Northern Territory. This will impact on jurisdictional revenues.


The Act implements the Council of Australian Governments' Intergovernmental Agreement on Commercial Vessel Safety Reform (the IGA). The Standing Council on Transport and Infrastructure (SCOTI) agreed on 9 November 2012 that the Act will commence in March 2013. SCOTI also agreed, as required under paragraph 20(a) of the IGA, for the Act to be amended to ensure the original policy intention is achieved.

(i) on 25 February 2013, 38 retired generals and admirals from the United States of America (US), and prominent national security experts, presented a letter calling on US policymakers to recognise the security effects of climate change and the undeniable consequences and costs of inaction in addressing climate change for vulnerable nations,


(ii) the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in 2007 called on the 2009 Defence White Paper to examine the full implication of climate change for the Australian Defence Force, and


(iii) the brief acknowledgement in the 2009 Defence White Paper that climate change has the potential to be a destabilising global force erroneously concludes that the strategic consequences of climate change will not be felt before 2030; and


(b) calls on the Government to:


(i) recognise the undeniable security implications of climate change, the costs and consequences of inaction, and


(ii) ensure that the Defence White Paper, due to be released in May 2013, addresses the fact that climate change is shaping the contemporary security climate, is a driver of conflict and should guide procurement and deployment in Australia’s national security.

That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Amendment Bill 2013, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.

Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I table an explanatory memorandum and I seek leave to have my second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The 
speech
 read as follows—



I wish there wasn't a reason for this bill to exist.


But, tragically, there is. Her name is Carly.


When Carly was fourteen, she started chatting online to a 20 year old man named Brandon Kane. He was her ideal boyfriend, and she fell in love with him as their online relationship grew closer.


But what Carly didn't know, what she couldn't have known, was that 'Brandon' was actually a 47 year old predator, Gary Francis Newman, who had over 200 fake identities.


When Carly turned 15, she invited Brandon to her birthday party. He told her he would be overseas and that he couldn't make it, so his adopted father Shane would go in his place. Carly had already been chatting to Shane online, and she convinced her mother that it would be okay for him to come along to her party.


Newman, in his role as Shane, turned up. Carly's mother, horrified that her daughter had become close to a stranger so much older than she was, warned him to stay away from her daughter.


But Newman convinced Carly she would get to meet her beloved Brandon in person. He eventually lured her into a meeting, on 19 February 2007 at Horseshoe Bay in South Australia. There, he brutally assaulted her and left her to die.


It took police eleven days to track Newman down. When they found him, he was logged on to his computer as Brandon Kane, chatting to a fourteen year old girl in Western Australia. Police also found a stash of child pornography on his computer, and discovered he had already pursued many other young girls overseas.


Newman was found guilty of Carly's murder, and is now serving a life sentence, with 29 years non-parole.


The aim of this bill is to make it an offence for a person over 18 years of age to lie about their age in online communications to a person under 18 for the purposes of facilitating a physical meeting.


This bill also makes it an offence for an adult to misrepresent their age in online communications with a minor with the intent of committing another offence.


These two items close an important loophole in the law. There is no reason for an adult to knowingly misrepresent their age to someone they believe is under eighteen, particularly if they believe doing so will make it easier to meet or commit another offence.


The bill also contains specific provisions to clarify how this offence can be prosecuted and defended.


I previously attempted to address this serious issue in 2010 with the earlier version of this bill. I acknowledge the concerns raised in relation to that bill, and I have modified this version to ensure there are no unintended consequences of enforcing this law. Instead, this bill creates offences specifically aimed at the circumstances—an adult lying to a minor about their age to facilitate a meeting or to make themselves seem 'more approachable'—that need to be addressed.


The internet is impossible to pin down, constantly evolving and growing. The pace of technological growth means children are almost always much more comfortable with online communication than their parents: what we still see as new and different is as essential to them as breathing.


New forms of communication mean we need new laws to protect our children. In cyberspace, we can't stand by their side as they explore the world. We can't always set rules and curfews, because our kids can be sitting safe in their rooms even while they're in danger.


This bill is an attempt to address some of the techniques used by online predators, so that we can put an additional safeguard in place for our children.


Sonya Ryan, Carly's mother, has been pushing for these changes in the law since her daughter's death. Sonya, who was nominated as South Australia's Australian of the Year this year, has dedicated her life to raising awareness of online dangers among young people.


If her actions stop just one young person from becoming a victim, then it's worth it.


And that is something we should take to heart when considering this bill.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2013-02-26,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:22):  I rise to make some remarks in relation to today's matter of public importance: the Gillard government's relentless negativity and failure to develop real solutions for all Australians. Isn't it extraordinary, colleagues, that we on this side of the chamber continually get charged with being negative and that it is the coalition that is negative? At the outset I will say that, if this were not such a bad government—if this were not such an appalling government giving us such atrocious policy—then those of us in the coalition sitting on this side of the chamber would not have to be so negative. Every time that the Prime Minister complains that the Leader of the Opposition is being negative, she should realise that it is simply because this is quite possibly the worst Labor government that this nation has ever seen.


It is also interesting, colleagues, that the Prime Minister is very quick to cry foul when anybody criticises her performances. If we criticise her performance, or indeed anybody from out there in the community does, we are supposedly being negative. No. We are doing so because the Prime Minister is doing an extremely bad job of running the country. That is the reason that we are being negative. But we are told that we are picking on the Prime Minister because she is a woman. The negativity towards the Prime Minister has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that she is a woman. We are negative towards her because she is doing such a bad job running this country.


This is a government that has absolutely no solutions, particularly for regional Australia. This government has consistently been negative towards regional Australia, turning their back particularly in the areas of education and agriculture. People out there in the regions have simply had enough of this appalling Labor government. Isn't it extraordinary that here we are discussing the fact that this government has no real solutions for all Australians, regardless of whether they are in regional Australia or anywhere else, when they have had years and years to prove to the Australian people that they have a plan and have some solutions. But they do not.


The very first area that I will be discussing today is access to education by students from regional Australia and how the this government has no solutions to this. Equity of access for regional students should be a priority. This government should find some solutions and give those regional students equity of access to education. At the ALP campaign launch on 16 August back in 2010, Prime Minister Gillard said: 'I believe we can build a nation where every child from every family, no matter where they are born in this country, no matter the circumstances of their birth, can get a great education and the opportunity to have their life transformed by it.' The Prime Minister should put her money where her mouth is because that statement has not resulted in any way, shape or forth to this government providing solutions to regional students when it comes to equity of access to education.


What this government has never got its head around—what this government has never understood—is that regional students face costs that city students simply do not face. Many of our regional students simply have no choice but to relocate to attend university or further education. They are at a huge disadvantage financially because it costs around $20,000 a year—and, indeed, the recent figures indicate that it is even more than that—for a regional family to send a student off to further their tertiary education. That is simply not good enough.


Independent youth allowance is the only measure that a lot of regional students have had over the years through which they could get any sort of financial assistance to help them go on to tertiary education. But this government made it harder for regional students in 2010. It took the coalition and, I have to say, particularly my regional colleagues, who understood this issue extremely well, 18 months of belting the government over the head—figuratively—to get them to change their minds and realise that they were treating regional students unfairly. That is simply not good enough. There are no solutions from this government. And it is not just that: the government make things worse, particularly for regional students.


Regarding independent youth allowance, the government has put in place a $150,000 parental income test cap for students who want to access it. That is simply illogical, wrong and stupid. Bear in mind that that is before income tax for both parents. We could effectively be talking about a police officer and a school teacher. Their children would be precluded from accessing independent youth allowance simply because their parents earn that amount. They would not be able to get any financial assistance. It is my view and National Party policy that we should have some assistance in place for regional students that would recognise the fact that there are huge relocation costs, without the requirement that they do a gap year. I will continue to push this. I know that my regional Liberal colleagues understand this issue very well. This is an issue of equity of access for regional students. It will help them get that education and put them on an equal level with their city cousins. That is only fair, right and proper. This government has no idea how to find any kind of solution to this problem and give those regional students some equity.


Indeed, this is the case even when we look at the bigger picture. In last year's MYEFO, the government cut $3.9 billion out of education. As I said, it is not only that this government has no real solutions; the government is effectively making things worse for this nation.


We only have to look at the debt and the economic mismanagement from this government to know that every single day this government is making it worse for people right across the country. When it comes to agriculture this government, again, has no real solutions and indeed is making it worse. Just recently the Prime Minister made some comments about dairy—that under the carbon tax the dairy industry not only would survive but would thrive. How ridiculous is that?



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator NASH:
  I will take that interjection, Senator Williams—that very interesting laugh. There is no understanding from this Prime Minister whatsoever about rural Australia. If the Prime Minister seriously thinks putting a carbon tax onto input costs right across the board for farmers—whether it be on electricity, fuel, transport or fertilisers—when the farmer is at the bottom of the food chain and has absolutely nowhere to pass that on, and if she seriously thinks that is going to result in a dairy industry that will thrive, then she simply does not have a clue.


It is no wonder this government cannot find any solutions, particularly for regional Australia, when every single one of the 21 around the cabinet table is from a city. The Prime Minister has not bothered to put one person from a region at her cabinet table. That is absolutely appalling. To someone from a regional area—I am a farmer from the central west of New South Wales—for the Prime Minister to continually be so dismissive of regional Australia is absolutely breathtaking. And we saw no more breathtaking action from the Prime Minister than the banning of the live export trade.


Rather than find a solution the Prime Minister bowed to what was seen to be pressure from the cities, coming through the emails from people who had no understanding of the industry. Yet what did the Prime Minister say? She said there had to be some 'short-term disruption'. The Prime Minister turned people's lives upside down in the northern part of this country and she calls it short-term disruption. That is appalling, and the Prime Minister should be embarrassed that she thinks that way about turning the lives of all those hardworking Australians upside down, many of them without an income and many of them having absolutely no idea—as I know my good colleague Senator Scullion understands probably better than anybody else. And the Prime Minister calls it short-term disruption. That is absolutely appalling.


This is a government with absolutely no solutions for the future of this country. And it is not just us on this side saying it; this Labor government has a proven track record of having no solutions. It does not matter where we turn, whether it be education, agriculture or right across the board. Particularly in regional Australia, where I am from, people have absolutely had enough. They want a government that is going to lead this nation properly, that is going to provide those solutions, and it is the coalition that will do that for them.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2013-02-26,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (16:32):  I rise today to contribute to the debate on this MPI motion. I really find it quite stark in hypocrisy that those opposite can accuse this government of relentless negativity and of not developing real solutions. We need only look at our track record, at what we have achieved since we came into government; it is an excellent record. I know Senator Williams will join me in commending us on our record! If he gets an opportunity he might make a contribution about how good our policies are, as well as many aspects of what we have done while we have been in government.


But what we get from the other side, particularly from Tony Abbott, is the position of 'no'. You wonder whether he has any other words to add to his vocabulary. It is just 'no'. It is very limited. I know he does not read a lot. I know he has not read his climate change policy. He fails to read things and then comes along with these statements and makes all these trip-ups along the way when he is travelling around the countryside. Maybe that has something to do with this literacy standard; I do not know. But when he comes up with a policy of just saying no all the time, it is no wonder that the people in our communities are wondering where he is coming from.


So, that is where we sit—that is the difference between the government and the opposition. I am pleased Senator Nash spoke about climate change, and I want to talk about that for a moment. We put a price on carbon, and we saw the need to make a difference to reduce our emissions so that our future generations—like my granddaughter Xavia—can enjoy the environment of clean air and clean water that we enjoy today. That is what we have done for our future. The coalition said no. In fact, their leader said climate change was 'absolute crap'. That is on record; we know the opposition leader has indicated that. So, when it comes to their direct action policy, we understand without a doubt what it stands for as well.


Just recently we had Mr Hockey admitting that the repeal would trigger compensation claims from companies that have made investments and business decisions based on a price on carbon. I wonder what compensation costs would be added to the $48 billion to $100 billion that independent experts have estimated that direct action will cost, further increasing the coalition's budget black hole. Just today we had one of the Liberal candidates—the candidate for the seat of Hume, Angus Taylor—describing the key element of the direct action policy as 'bizarre'. He is describing the LNP's policy on direct action as bizarre. No wonder people out there are really wondering what they stand for.


Then we have the likes of Senator Joyce, one of my fellow colleagues from Queensland, claiming that a roast will cost you $100. Where do they get these statements from? A roast costing you $100: it must be an awfully big roast.



Senator Scullion interjecting—




Senator FURNER:
  I agree, Senator Scullion. It must be like some of those buffaloes you have up in the Territory, to cost $100. But, in general, if you go to the supermarket and you go to the meat section you will find a roast costing, on average, what it has cost you for quite a number of years. The price has not increased as a result of the carbon price.


In the Canberra Times Senator Joyce claimed the carbon price would increase abattoir costs leading to an increase on the cost of meat. He inferred there would be a time where:


… abattoirs would have to pay $575,000 for a single beast. So it is costing you vastly more than a $100 roast, that one.


I do not see that in the supermarkets I do my shopping at.


Minister Greg Combet actually hit back at this ludicrous claim, indicating:


Abattoirs emit methane, one of the most harmful of the greenhouse gases, from biological waste. Where they emit more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases a year they will be liable for the carbon price.


Treasury modelling shows the impact of this liability on meat prices is just 0.4 per cent, which has been factored into the government's household assistance. Furthermore, abattoirs can reduce emissions and carbon price liability through measures such as covering their waste settlement ponds and flaring the methane or using it to generate electricity. In these cases the liability may be reduced to zero, meaning the carbon price is doing exactly what it was intended to do.


One thing I never hear from the opposition is the success with which we handled the global financial crisis. I know that a couple of the senators on the other side attend the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, of which I am a member. They know that over the last several years we have been fortunate enough to have a number of ambassadors from a variety of different areas—the US, Europe and other location around the globe—commending what our government did during the global financial crisis.


I know that you, Acting Deputy President Marshall, as chair of the education committee you sit on, were privileged to hear a lot of evidence about what we did in our schools and what we did for schools right across the nation to give them, overwhelmingly, funding that they have never seen in their lifetime. The funding provided things like halls, science centres and libraries. I think I went to in excess of 140 openings over that short period of time. I was overwhelmed by the number of principals, student body members and parents of children coming up to me and saying, 'Thank you for the Gillard government. Thank you to the federal Labor government for providing this funding to build these beautiful halls that we would normally never see in our lifetime.'


It is unfortunate that those opposite criticise those sorts of outcomes and those entitlements that we have been able to provide. They try to break down the situation to show it as being unsuccessful, but that is not the case. It has been a marvellous success. You need to get out there and talk to the people in the schools. I know some opposite do, those who may be a little naive or fresh or want the photo opportunity. They come along and you see them up there on the stage smiling and grinning away. Then, all of a sudden, they are standing next to you. These are the people who opposed the response to the global financial crisis and opposed the Building the Education Revolution funding. Yet here they are just about putting their arms around you wanting to get into a photo opportunity to get onto the front page of the paper regarding the opening of a hall, a science centre or a library. How hypocritical some of those people in the LNP are. They say one thing, they talk the talk, but then when it comes to getting it out into the communities they are doing something other than that. It shows how hypocritical they are.


The other thing we need to remember is that when we came into government we put that sort of investment not only into the BER but into building our communities and our infrastructure programs, and that of course has generated over 840,000 jobs in our community. You never hear the opposition saying how successful that has been, because we know they do not stand for jobs in our community. They know that the Labor Party stands for jobs, employment and assisting people in times of need. There is the example of unemployment, which is around 5.4 per cent. Compare that with a rate of 7.9 per cent in the United States. That is another example of how we have delivered to make sure that our unemployment rate is so low.


We have always been the party that represents people. We believe in fairness and equity and that is why currently our taxes are at 22.2 per cent of GDP, compared with 24.2 per cent in 2004-05 and 2005-06. The Howard government was the highest taxing government ever in history. That demonstrates how we have been able to make sure that people in our communities are taken care of.


Look at the low interest rates of today—currently on three per cent—compared to 6.75 per cent when we came into office. That is helping people by making sure their mortgages are met and their needs are accommodated for.



I am so proud of the fact the government has been able to introduce policies like the Schoolkids Bonus, making sure that kids can go to school with all their needs, whether it be pencils, bags or payments for excursions. This is what a forward-thinking Labor government does and that is why we will not stand here and listen to this MPI based on— (Time expired)



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Furner, your time has well and truly expired. Sorry, I was somewhat distracted and I apologise to the Senate. I call Senator Sinodinos.

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Government Policy</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,12,1
"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2013-02-26,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (16:43):  Beware of Greeks bearing gifts! That is what I say. May I begin my remarks by saying that the reason we today are debating the issue of the relentless negativity by the Gillard government is that it is a government of knockers. They knock any positive policy proposal put up by the opposition. In recent times when we released—admittedly by a circuitous route—our Northern Australia policy, our draft discussion paper on Northern Australia, what did we get from the government?




Senator Ludlam:
  What did you do?




Senator SINODINOS:
  I am not sure what the Greens thought, although Senator Ludlam seems to suggest he did not think much of it. The government knocked it instead of engaging in a positive debate about the future of Australia, something that the public out there want us politicians to do, as a class. It is the one thing they really want from us. This was where the Prime Minister began the year. By nominating the election date the Prime Minister was saying, 'Let's have a debate about policies and positive matters and we can have the politicking towards the end of that time, in the run up to 14 September.' So we get this relentless knocking of our views for developing Northern Australia.


What is wrong with having a vision about how we develop this country, particularly those parts of this country which are relatively less populous and have a potential to be developed? Admittedly, elements of the environment there are fragile, but that is why you get the best brains in the country thinking about how we develop regions like that. Also, following the northern Australia policy, we had the dams and water policy, again released as a draft discussion paper, which went to our policy around water and water storage across the country. All these are very positive ideas that Mr Robb in the other House and others have been formulating for some time, but what did we hear from the government? Relentless negativity. Whenever an idea comes from another side of politics, they just knock it. They do not want to have a fair dinkum policy debate.


It goes to the heart of how this government sees itself. This government puts its faith in government. Kevin Rudd talks about putting government at the centre of the economy—it was in his maiden speech. At the height of the global financial crisis, which Senator Furner talked about, to Kevin Rudd that was an opportunity to put government at the centre of the economy. The coalition puts workers, entrepreneurs and investors at the centre of the economy. They are the ones who take the risks and do the work and they should be incentivised to work, to save and to invest. That is a very positive outlook. That is positive faith in your fellow man—that, given responsibility and given incentivisation, individuals, communities and businesses will thrive. No-one is truly free unless they are able to exercise choice and personal responsibility. That is a positive vision. The idea that you have to have government looking over your shoulder the whole time, telling you what to do, is the nanny state—that is paternalism; that is a relentlessly negative view of human nature. You have to be optimistic about the human condition and the capacity of people to do the right thing if you put your faith in them. I see Senator Ludlam nodding at that.




Senator Ludlam:
  Marriage equality, for example. Let's start with that one.




Senator SINODINOS:
  We can get to that in a minute, if you like, Senator Ludlam, but the faith we put in our fellow man is to be optimistic. This coalition is optimistic about the human condition and puts its faith in people.


We see the government's relentless negativity in its focus on class warfare, pitting one Australian against another. In his maiden speech—maiden speeches are always very interesting—Wayne Swan talked about the bosses and workers, and recently the Treasurer, Mr Swan, returned to the theme of class warfare, pitting one Australian against another. He talks almost as if the economy is a zero-sum game, where my gain is at your expense. No, you put your faith in individuals, they grow the pie and we are all better off. That is not trickle-down economics; that is fundamental market based economics.


This class warfare focuses on promoting a now mythical working class—I say 'mythical' because most working Australians today are aspirational, and the Labor Party has left them behind. That is what has happened. The former Leader of the Australian Labor Party, Paul Keating, laments to this day the way in which the Labor Party has failed to embrace the aspirational classes that he claims were to some extent created by the Hawke-Keating economic reforms, carried on by the Howard-Costello government. He is right. Too often Labor speaks in class terms and not in aspirational terms. It does not seek to embrace those who are trying to do better.


You see this in the budget policies, which try and knock the tall poppies off. Labor tries to introduce more and more means testing into the system, and often these means tests are not at really high levels. We are talking about means tests which are now cutting in at increasingly lower levels. That stops people from working more hours. It disincentivises people. That is relentlessly negative. We talk about the need to raise revenue in this country. The government talks about tax as the solution—we need to tax more. That is relentlessly negative, because more tax means more disincentives. That is why we need to look at reducing spending and reducing the obligations that future generations inherit on our behalf.


We talk about a future economic growth scenario for the country. I contrast Australia with the United States, where, by hook or by crook, perhaps through a mixture of good luck and good management, they have developed a more competitive economic structure off the back of recent discoveries of oil, gas, shale and all the rest of it. I mention that not to particularly praise one energy source but to make the point that they are finding new drivers of competitiveness. We are going in the opposite direction. Our costs are going up relative to the rest of the world. It is not just the high dollar; our costs are going up across the board. The United States are finding ways to reduce their costs and are now driving manufacturing onshore when it used to be offshore. Parts of the United States are actually getting manufacturing back, and they do not need an industry plan from Washington to do that; it is happening because the market is dictating through these competitiveness changes that more manufacturing comes back onshore. And, of course, the American market is famously very flexible, including the labour market.


But where is the competitiveness agenda here, in this country, under this government? The manufacturing and innovation statement released the other day was a relentlessly negative document for two reasons. First of all, a so-called $1 billion spend is a net spend of possibly $600 million or less. In other words, about half of it appears to be spending which will not actually happen but will be diverted to funding other budget measures. In other words, the net new spending is $600 million or thereabouts; the $1 billion package as such does not exist. The main savings proposal is to reduce the access of large Australian companies and multinationals to the R&D tax incentive. It applies to companies above a certain threshold. According to advice that has been tendered in the newspapers, the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research and, I think, the tax office have warned that these large companies may rearrange their operations in order to fall below the threshold and, therefore, retain their eligibility for the R&D tax incentive. That means that saving may not be there. How relentlessly negative is that? The $1 billion spend is not what they said it would be and the main savings measure may not make the savings that are being claimed. Why is that relentlessly negative? Again, here is another set of policy proposals which will actually increase the call on public resources and on borrowings.


We have already seen it with the mining resource rent tax—$126 million raised this year. There is one more instalment to go. It will get nowhere near the two or three billion dollars it was meant to raise. We have seen the carbon tax which, if Labor is re-elected, will leave a black hole of potentially $4 billion by 2015—because when we link with the European market there is no way the Europeans will inflict a $29 a tonne carbon price on themselves by 2015 in order to please the Australian Treasury.


If only we had that power in the world, so that we could say to the Europeans, 'Fix the carbon price at $29 a tonne in 2015.' We could say to the United States, 'Do this or that for us.' We could say to the Middle East, 'Peace is around the corner. We ordain peace.' We cannot do any of that. We cannot rely on the Europeans to provide us with a carbon price which protects the revenue built into the budget. It will be a very interesting budget in May, where the government will have to front up about the potential revenue from a carbon tax in 2015-16. So, again, both the mining tax and the carbon tax are spending linked, and that spending will have to be paid for by borrowings.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2013-02-26,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (16:53):  I am delighted to be able to debate this motion this afternoon and indeed to highlight the government's commitment to governing in the best interests of all Australians. The failure of those opposite to sustain significant policy debate, I think, is doing this nation a great disservice. But I am somewhat heartened by Senator Sinodinos's contribution this afternoon because you can see within that the true ideological divide in the very policy measures that we are talking about. The motion itself says absolutely nothing. It is a debate about a motion about negative politics, creating yet another run of negative politics driven by the opposition. I am quite happy to debate members in this chamber about the policy issues that are critical to the direction of this nation. But what we need to do is to get on with governing and governing in the best interests of all Australians.


There is nothing wrong with means testing. We are not a country of tall-poppy activists in this country. It is simply good public policy to make those who can afford it pay and to make those who cannot afford it pay less. These are the underpinnings of a stronger, fairer, smarter, modern Australia. It means we need to be committed to the right policies that are targeted to the needs of Australians and setting out their details and costings, and making sure they are fully funded. These are the things to which the Labor government is committed.


What we get from those opposite are slogans, sound bites and uncosted policies, tailored to suit whatever audience of the day they are trying to reach. The motion that we are debating today is just another sound bite—no policy critique; no vision of their own. Certainly no policies targeted at the best interests of all Australians are coming from the coalition. You can see this very starkly in the agenda in political debate that has emerged in just the last fortnight.


I give my wholehearted support to Labor's Aussie job $1 billion plan for manufacturing. From a Western Australian point of view, whether you are wearing a state hat or a federal hat, when you look at the Labor Party's policies compared to the National-Liberal Party's policies you will see there are clear ideological divides—clear divides in the way we would like to plan to give industry a leg-up and a boost in this country. It is Labor's plan that I think best serves this country in terms of jobs, growth and future opportunities.


We know that Western Australia has had a massive boom in mining investment. The effects of this have been felt right around the country and in Western Australia. But it has not been good news for everyone. Surely every person in this place can accede to that. For some it has actually made life much more difficult—the high dollar and intense competition. It has hit manufacturing, it has hit tourism, it has hit agriculture and it has hit other sectors of the economy. But what we have is a plan that federal Labor has put forward, and it is remarkably similar to one put forward by state Labor, which represents a shift in industry policy. They are plans which put the needs of workers first and are focused on converting the massive pipeline of investment into jobs. We have got, still, a $268 billion pipeline of investment in this country, and we need to make sure that we maximise the dividend from that investment into Australian jobs.


We have been focused on working with business, industry, unions, government, researchers, and the education and training sector so that we can have a plan for what to do. We have a significant plan, the first principle of which is to back local industry to win more of this work. What we are asking—in fact, requiring—of our big corporations and our big projects, whether they be government projects or industry projects, is to map out plans for local industry participation. We are doing that through our Australian Industry Participation Authority and the proposed Australian Jobs Act. We will also be focused on local industry precincts, and you can see this through Labor's commitment to establishing some innovation and industry precincts.


In contrast, how are those opposite responding to this situation? They do not have a plan. They voted against Labor's Skilled Jobs (Benefits from the Boom) Bill in the state parliament in WA. And Sophie Mirabella has committed the opposition to opposing our jobs plan. You can see the ideological divide here. Labor wants to make sure that Australians and local companies doing local work here in Australia have the opportunity to tap into this massive pipeline of investment. Those opposite want a far more laissez faire approach to this where corporations can just contract out at any cost to businesses overseas, and you can drive a truck through the industry participation plans as they currently exist.


So where is the coalition in standing up for ordinary Australians? Where is the coalition when it comes to standing up for Aussie jobs? I know that the resources we are digging out of the ground are finite. They can only be used once. What we need in this country is a plan to develop a skilled workforce that can create new industries and new jobs for the future. This has to be achieved long, long after the construction and mining boom has gone.


We need a government that is prepared to stand up for all ordinary Australians, just as the Gillard Labor government is committed to doing.


What else are we doing to govern in the broad interest of all Australians? There are important things like making sure that families can make ends meet. We have our Schoolkids Bonus. We are preparing Australia for the future and delivering on Labor values that are inclusive of the needs of all Australians such as reforming aged care, introducing the National Disability Insurance Scheme, committing to changing education funding in this country through Gonski, planning for dental care, planning for skills training, and planning for infrastructure. As the government we know that we are going to have to make some difficult and tough economic choices in order to deliver these priorities. When you talk about needing to govern for all Australians—and you cast out those who do not get the care and support that they need when they are in aged care, who do not get the care and support they need when they have a disability, who were in impoverished schools that are not getting the targeted funding they need, who are locked out of education skills and training, who are living in communities without adequate community infrastructure—you know that these are all national priorities that we will not solve overnight. You can only solve them with a plan. You can only solve them with a commitment. You can only solve them as part of a national agenda where you are prepared to work with the states and, at times, be tough with them.


If, as a country, we are going to solve these significant problems we cannot just leave the states to figure it all out for themselves. These are national problems and require national support to help resolve them. I have respect for the role of the states. I am a former state MP and I have been involved in state politics. We are a country that desperately needs to tackle some of these issues at a national level such as things like disability funding, the inequities in our education system, the fact that dental care has been missing from the health system as if it does not exist, and the need for a national infrastructure plan. We know that we will need to make tough choices to deliver on policies that truly deliver to all Australians. We will need to understand the people's priorities, the nation's priorities, to deliver on things like Gonski and the NDIS, and to deliver on job creation.


From those opposite we have relentless negativity that is aggressive and destructive. I would like to stand up an optimistic Australia— (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2013-02-26,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (17:03):  On behalf of the coalition, it is a pleasure to stand here and counter some of the claims made by Senator Pratt. It is extraordinary that Senator Pratt must take the Australian electorate for granted. She must think that the people listening to this have the attention span of goldfish and that they are, somehow, going to forget about all the negativity and all the failures of the last five years in the hope that they are going to paint some promises for the next five years should they be re-elected. Let me concede, Senator Pratt, that there is an ideological divide between us. There is a gulf that is so big and so stark to the Australian people. It is a gulf between competence on this side of the chamber and incompetence on your side of the chamber. It is a gulf between honesty on this side of the chamber and blatant dishonesty on your side of the chamber. It is about accountability and history in government that is over here versus excuses—and pathetic excuses at that—over the other side. It is about solutions to the problems that you have created on your side of the chamber. They are your problems that the Australian people are desperate to have solved, Senator Pratt. How can you come in here and be proud of your record? It says something about the very low bar that you set for yourself and for your colleagues. It is about hope on this side of the chamber versus hopeless over there. It is a sweeping generalisation about hopelessness. It is about stability here.



Government senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Just one moment, Senator Bernardi.




Senator BERNARDI:
  I am just getting started.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I know, and I hate to interrupt you in midstream like that, but the chamber is getting too rowdy. I would ask for order. Order! Senator Polley. Senator Bernardi, you have the call.




Senator BERNARDI:
  It is, as I said, a difference between hope for the Australian people from a coalition government versus hopeless on that side of the chamber. It is about the stability of a sensible government run by adults rather than the childish recklessness by those of the Labor Party. It is about the strength of our nation versus the weakness that Labor has plunged us into.



Senator Pratt interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  Yes, indeed, Senator Pratt, there is an ideological divide.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Bernardi, just pause there for a minute. Senators, this has been a little bit of a rowdy debate through the course of this whole discussion. However, enough is enough, and people need to tone it down considerably. Senator Bernardi.




Senator BERNARDI:
  Thank you again, Mr Acting Deputy President. It may illustrate my point that there is a stark gulf between us about the courtesy in which we have observed and heard the others in silence versus the wilful interruption and the disrespect that is shown from the other side. That only pales into insignificance with the disrespect that they have shown to the Australian people. This government has not demonstrated a positive vision for the future of this country.


All that the faceless men and their acolytes are consumed with is clinging to power. So they scramble and they struggle. They introduce these ad hoc policies, which, as we know, have more and more spin attached to them, just to keep their heads above water. But they are drowning and the Australian people are drowning with them. And, contrary to what those on that side of the chamber might say, it is not due to climate change and rising sea levels. It is due to your incompetence. You are unable to swim in the big ocean that requires navigating as this government.


Labor cannot competently run the country and that is why their greatest skill, their only skill, is to take anything positive, any ounce of initiative—the spirit, the kernel of entrepreneurship that has governed this country, run it and seen strength and positiveness build up in it—and stifle it by running their bludgeon hands and their big government poetry over it. They will always attack those with hope and optimism for the future. And they do that because their leader, the Prime Minister, has demonstrated many, many times that negativity is their modus operandi. She is more concerned about calling the opposition leader names than coming out with practical solutions to improve our nation. You know instinctively and the Australian people know that there is something desperately wrong with that approach from a national leader.


Ask yourself: what is this Prime Minister most famous for? It is hard to make a choice, but she gave this famous speech in which she labelled the Leader of the Opposition a misogynist, simply because he happened to disagree with her policy approach to things which have demonstrably failed in so many areas. She is of course famous for promising the Australian people that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads. We now have the world's biggest carbon tax. It is an extraordinary admission of failure, to make that promise at an election, to then inflict it upon the Australian people and to then have the puppet masters behind the Prime Minister, people such as Paul Howes from the AWU—who hangs out with billionaires in his private time—saying on the public record that there is no carbon tax in this country. You cannot believe the sense of delusion and detachment from the reality that is confronting the Australian people more so than that from Mr Paul Howes and his union comrades.


But the Prime Minister is also famous for stabbing her colleague, the former, duly-elected Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, in the back and taking over the leadership of the Labor Party at the command of the faceless men. None of these are good stories. We know that; they are part of history. But the problem is that Labor have been so consumed with their guilt and how to atone for their sins over the last five years that they have no vision for the future. The only thing they can say to the Australian people is: 'Please, forget about the past; we've got these great plans that we are going to instigate in the future when the budget returns to surplus.'


Let me draw upon the words of my colleague Senator Brandis yesterday: 'This government will go down as the first government in nigh on 100 years never to have delivered a budget surplus,' because Mr Swan and Ms Gillard, who promised repeatedly that there would be a budget surplus because it would be in the interests of the country, have not been competent in managing Australian taxpayers' dollars.


Senator Furner earlier in his contribution talked about low government expenditure as a proportion of GDP. What Labor conveniently ignore is the $50 billion, or thereabouts, every single year—that is, almost $1 billion a week—that they borrow from overseas to prop up their extravagant and wasteful spending. It beggars belief that Senator Furner can talk about how proud he is of these beautiful school halls that only cost twice as much as they would have under any competent building program. It is extraordinary that they wasted $8 billion. He must be equally proud of the pink batts in all the houses, which cost another $1 billion to remove because they resulted in deaths and houses being burnt down. He must be equally proud of the taxes that are going up and up and up and are making it very tough for the Australian people to make ends meet. What is Labor's answer to that? 'We'll just hand out some more borrowed money to you.' It is not sustainable and the Australian people understand that.


The Australian people are looking for optimism and a vision for the future. That is why the Australian people welcome plans that come out about expanding our use of dams for perhaps generating power or storage of water or about tax reform and abolishing some of the pernicious taxes that have been inflicted upon the Australian people. They want more flexibility in their workplace relations laws so that they can employ more people and small business can get on with doing what it does best: generating wealth for the owners, the workers and the community. They want the government to get out of their lives. They do not want the heavy fist of this Labor socialist Greens alliance that is just creeping into every aspect of day-to-day life. This is the negativity that has been sown over five years in this country. I would ask the Australian people to cast their mind back to that bountiful and golden time of the Howard years, even as recently as 2007, when people thought running the economy was easy, that anyone could do it—'We'll even give Kevin Rudd a go.' That was when, apparently, Kevin Rudd was a conservative.


The result is stark. Unless you are committed to a true course of action that is consistent and ideologically sound, rather than adopting this haphazard approach of throwing up policies, cooking them up in a plane on the back of an envelope, like the NBN and other fiascos—unless you are diligent, committed and understand where you want to go in government, as in life, you will end up somewhere other than where you want to be. Even the Labor Party, even their fiercest acolytes, have to acknowledge that not one person in the government wants to see us in the position that we are in today, compared to where we were six years ago.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2013-02-26,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (17:14):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. This afternoon the Senate is witnessing the political theatre of the absurd, exemplified by that contribution—and I am being generous—by Senator Bernardi. The opposition, the most negative in Australian political history, has itself initiated a debate on negativity.


That same opposition, incredibly, accuses the government of negativity. Does the opposition have any capacity at all for self-assessment? Does the opposition have any understanding at all of its own shortcomings? Does it have no insight, no shame to initiate such a debate? 


This is the pot calling the kettle black, Senate style. I am reminded of a poem from Maxwell's Elementary Grammar—William Henry Maxwell's indispensable guide to English grammar published early last century. We always hear from Senator Brandis how erudite he is—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator FAULKNER:
  We do, and of course you are. So I thought I would share this poem with Senator Brandis and the Senate. It goes like this:


'Oho!' said the pot to the kettle;


'You are dirty and ugly and black!


Sure no one would think you were metal,


Except when you're given a crack.' 


'Not so! not so!' kettle said to the pot;


'Tis your own dirty image you see;


For I am so clean—without blemish or blot—


That your blackness is mirrored in me.'


Of course, all the hard-bitten people around this building would say that there is no purity in politics. But there are no political points to be gained for hypocrisy either, and this MPI absolutely takes the cake for political hypocrisy, because we have seen an orgy of negativity from those opposite. The Liberal Party, led by Mr Abbott, have turned negativity into an art form. It is so mindless, so knee-jerk, so Pavlovian.


We all remember that the opposition said no to economic stimulus and safeguarding Australian jobs during the darkest days of the global financial crisis. We all know that the opposition says no to taxing big miners and no to an increase in superannuation contributions for Australian workers. The opposition says no to making big polluters pay for carbon emissions, no to a cleaner and healthier environment for future generations of Australians, no to the National Broadband Network and no to giving Australians faster and more efficient access to the worldwide web and the digital economy. The opposition says no to health reform, no to the Schoolkids Bonus, no to increased family payments, no to increased payments for pensioners and no to increased payments for students. But of course they do not stop there. The modern Liberal Party—Senator Brandis's lot—also say no to putting out any policies before the election. They say no to publishing any costings and no to telling us where their $70 billion in cuts over four years will come from to fill their infamous budget black hole. So yes, there is a pattern here: mindless, carping negativity about the government. But about their own intentions we have nothing but deliberate obfuscation and deception.


Simply put, the allegation in this matter of public importance, of government negativity, is preposterous. It just does not stand up. On the other hand, the government does have a positive agenda. The government continues to do what is necessary to keep Australia's economy strong, to look to the future, to provide opportunity to all, to have the determination to do what is right—even at the cost of short-term popularity. Our economy is healthy, strong and growing. Our books are the envy of the world's advanced economies. We avoided recession and not only saved hundreds of thousands of jobs but created jobs. Our economy is nearly 13 per cent bigger than when Labor came to office in 2007. Australia is now the 12th largest economy in the world. Since Labor came to office we have moved up three places in the rankings—passing South Korea, Mexico and Spain. For the first time in our history, Australia has a AAA credit rating from all three ratings agencies.


This was never achieved during the Howard years, and we are currently one of only seven—




Senator Brandis:
  Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. As Senator Faulkner surely knows, during the Howard government Australia had a AAA credit rating from all international ratings agencies.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  That is a debating point, Senator Brandis. Resume your seat. There is no point of order.




Senator FAULKNER:
  Not only is Senator Brandis overwhelmingly negative, he does not know the standing orders of the Senate. I suggest he goes and learns them. It will do him good for the future as those long years in opposition roll on.


We now have a low unemployment rate, too—just 5.2 per cent, compared to 11.7 per cent in Europe. Over 840,000 jobs have been created since Labor came to office in 2007. Inflation is contained within the RBA's target band, giving the RBA the flexibility it needs to keep interest rates low, taking the pressure off mortgagees. Interest rates are currently lower than they were at any point during the period of the last Liberal government. And we have low net debt: as a percentage of GDP it is around one-tenth of the rate across major advanced economies.


It was the American writer Mark Twain—I believe previously quoted by some opposition senators—who said in his 1889 novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court:


… one mustn't criticise other people on grounds where he can't stand perpendicular himself.


Mr Abbott and his Liberal liegemen in the Senate here could well take account of Mark Twain's advice.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:26):  Before this debate was interrupted by question time, I was indicating to the Senate that I, like my colleagues, will be supporting the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012.


I mention, for those listening to this debate, that speakers get a maximum of 20 minutes to contribute on the bill. Just before two o'clock, when I started my contribution, I indicated my support for the bill. I also took the opportunity at that time, when all of the government ministers were in here preparing for question time, to describe a situation in Townsville. We hear many fine words about recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people—and I agree with the need for recognition and I agree with the contents of this bill. There is a situation in Townsville at this very moment that involves Indigenous people, many of whom do not come from Townsville but come from outlying areas up in the gulf and Cape York, some 300 or 400 kilometres from their home base, and do not have big support networks in Townsville.


Until recently those people were able to get a state government sponsored taxi fare to the hospital for renal dialysis. For whatever reason, the state government suspended that program. I do not want to get into the blame game, but this has resulted in a terrible situation for those Indigenous people requiring renal dialysis. There was a community group that had started to transport them—a group of volunteers who convey people around Townsville. Without going into detail, for a number of reasons it became impossible for that not-for-profit community group to continue doing that at no charge. One of these Indigenous people in Townsville has already died, and I am told that four have died since this transport service was stopped.


I took that opportunity just before question time, while ministers were in the chamber, to say: please can you do something about this? If you are really interested in Indigenous people, do something positive that will help bridge the gap that you speak so much about. I asked ministers: please refer the three ministers I wrote to to my letter of 20 February. Have a look at it; please do something urgently.


I thought everyone in this chamber would agree with me. Some of my Labor colleagues shouted at me. I think it was Senator Sterle—if it was not him, I will apologise later; if it was not him, it was one of his colleagues—who said, 'You wouldn't even know what an Aborigine looked like.'


'How dare you raise this in this debate!' I heard another of the Labor senators say. I find that appalling and offensive. It is not offensive to me but to the people that I am trying to help in this chamber.


Why did I raise it here? I raised it because it is now six days ago that I wrote the ministers an urgent plea—not a political plea—to help these people. Why? I had been asked by Indigenous people to help them. I had appeared on the Indigenous radio station 4K1G in Townsville, and I have had two discussions with the presenter about this very issue.


I have had no response from the ministers' offices. Admittedly it is only six days, but this is a matter of life and death. So I take the opportunity to alert the ministers to this critical situation—to say, 'Please do something about it'—and all that happens to me is that I get shouted at by Labor members of parliament. These are the same members who will get up and give very impassioned speeches about Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander people, and yet when there is an opportunity to do something to help Indigenous and Islander people all I get is abuse.


Just for the Labor senator who interjected and said, 'You wouldn't know what an Aborigine looked like,' may I say that, unlike most Labor senators, who live in the cities—in the flash houses or apartments—and many of whom went to the flash private schools, I went to a state school. And I grew up with both Aboriginal and Islander kids. I have to confess that I had some problem with Aboriginal and Islander kids because they were always the ones who tackled me hardest at Rugby League. They were the ones who were game winners in basketball, because they were very talented people. They were the ones who would attend parties at my house and win some of the young females that I was trying to deal with. So I find it very offensive that Labor senators suggest that I would not know what an Aborigine looks like. 


I only raise these things to say that I have lived and worked with Indigenous people. And I know that the issues that are of interest to Aboriginal and Islander people are not so much the flowery words of apology—although they do play a part—but the need their people suffer as a result of being treated as being different. It started with Whitlam saying, 'Look, we owe you a living. We've wronged you. So don't bother to do anything; we will feed you and clothe you and you won't have to work.' Indigenous leaders now understand—Noel Pearson is one—that the welfare society imposed upon Indigenous people by the Whitlam government and subsequent 'socially conscious' people from the other side of the chamber, is the worst thing that has ever happened to Indigenous people. And their leaders now understand this.


So why couldn't some of the time and money that we have spent on this particular bill, which I think everyone agrees with—everything spent on all the committees, inquiries and other costs—be put into transport for Indigenous people requiring renal dialysis in Townsville? And I am sure the same thing happens everywhere else.


I return to the bill before us. As I said earlier, this bill says: 


(1)  The Parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, recognises that the continent and the islands now known as Australia were first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


Whilst I am supporting the bill for its symbolism, I have to say that I think most Australians actually understand that Australia was first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. 


The bill goes on to record:


(2)  The Parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, acknowledges the continuing relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their traditional lands and waters.


I think there would be few, if any, Australians who need an act of parliament to inform them of that. And I think most Indigenous people accept that every other Australian accepts those two things. 


And, of course, the bill goes on to say: 


(3) The Parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, acknowledges and respects the continuing cultures, languages and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


Again, I think most Australians, without this bill, would have accepted, acknowledged and respected those cultures, languages and the heritage. And I think most Indigenous and Islander people also accept that other Australians accept that. 


So, whilst this is symbolism—whilst it is, I guess, a step in the right direction—I do not think it is the most important issue that confronts our country as it deals with Indigenous people. The Labor Party talks a lot about closing the gap, but it never seems to happen. Even last week a woman—she was half Aboriginal and half Islander; she proudly told me her family history—came into my office and said, 'Please, Senator, can you help me. We've always voted Labor because the Labor Party come and promise us everything. They've been doing it for 20 years. They keep giving us the same promise every year and we keep voting for them, but nothing ever happens. Can you please make sure something happens.' She was speaking in relation to the protection of children in trouble. 


I do not want to be political about this, but if you look at the results in the Queensland election you will see that places like Palm Island—an Indigenous community off Townsville—for the first time ever, had a majority vote for the LNP.


We usually used to get five or 10 per cent of the vote on Palm Island. This year on first preference we got 48 per cent, from memory, and on two-party preferred an enormous vote. Have a look at what happened in the Northern Territory election. Indigenous people understand that the Labor Party is all talk and very little action.


The coalition and the Liberal Party, of which I am a member, are very proud of our involvement with Indigenous people, particularly with Indigenous people in parliament. We do not need 'captain's picks' to get Indigenous people to parliament. We have had Indigenous people approach us, become part of the party and stand for preselection against all other comers.


Eric Deeral, I remember, was the first Indigenous member in a state parliament. He came from the electorate of Cook, which includes Cape York and the Torres Strait Islands. I think Eric was a Cooktown person. I did know him. He was a member of the National Party in the Queensland parliament. Of course, my friend and colleague Neville Bonner was the first Indigenous person to ever set foot in this parliament of Australia. Again, he was a guy who got here on his own merits, not by a 'captain's pick'. He was selected by members of the Liberal Party as the best person for that position. I often recount and well recall how Nev Bonner stayed at my flat one time before I was married. I warned him that it was a flat that did not have all that good a reputation for parties and those sorts of things, but he was happy to spend the night in my flat and I was honoured that he did. He was a very fine man. Ken Wyatt is another Indigenous person who is currently a member of the House of Representatives and who is a very significant person. Whether he is Indigenous or anything else, he is a real achiever and a real leader. I am delighted that he is a member of our party. I remember even the Democrats had an Indigenous senator at some time.


The Labor Party have never had it in their souls to select an Indigenous person, so the Prime Minister has had to have a so-called 'captain's pick'—overturning one of the Labor senators who, I have to say, has done more for the Indigenous communities than any other Labor politician I can remember. She has been thrown over so that the Prime Minister's Indigenous 'pick' could take her place in the Senate. As with all of these things, actions speak louder than words. I am, as I say, delighted that I have known Indigenous people who have represented all Australians in state and federal parliaments of this country.


This bill does hopefully take reconciliation further, but I keep saying the best form of reconciliation is to give Indigenous people the same opportunities that every other Australian has: a good education; a good opportunity to get a job and become a member of our community—not someone different, not someone who needs special attention, but someone who has the same opportunities as every other Australian. That is the important challenge. Sure, apologies take the fancy of the media but they do not, in effect, do a hell of a lot for a very disadvantaged group of people in a country as lucky as Australia. I look forward to the day when an Abbott government—should we be elected at the next election—can continue the process of real advancement for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this lucky country and land of plenty.

Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (17:42):  I welcome, the DLP welcomes and I am sure the majority of Australians welcome the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012. I think it is important that we as a nation take the opportunity to listen to Aboriginal Australians and Indigenous Australians to determine the sort—if any—of constitutional recognition necessary and that they be fully involved in this process. I am hopeful that the government will allow for a more transparent and inclusive procedure to determine the course of this process to referendum than was afforded to the communities in the Northern Territory through the Stronger Futures legislation.


In the 1967 referendum, the majority of Australians voted to give Indigenous Australians the right to vote, which they did deserve, do deserve and should have always had. Let us all focus on the future and not on the past. Hopefully, we can not politicise this debate, can stop attributing blame to one another and can just get on with it. We need genuinely inclusive and thoughtful discussion. Actions speak louder than words. We need tangible actions in Indigenous health, education, self-empowerment and employment. I look forward to this legislation and will be providing my contribution in due course on what I believe the final outcome of this process should be. Ultimately, it should be for the good of all Indigenous Australians.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:46):  It is a real honour to be able to speak this afternoon on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012, which brings our nation a step closer to the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as our nation's first peoples. There is no doubt about the need to fix the historical exclusion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from Australia's Constitution, and I am very pleased that there is bipartisan support for this recognition—recognition that I think will enhance our national character, reflect us for who we truly are as a nation and reflect the fact that this nation's relationship with Indigenous people is one of its greatest national assets but that we will not maximise this asset unless we recognise it. Therefore, it is a relationship that should be reflected in our Constitution, and I am glad that this bill brings us a step closer to that recognition.


We also need to remove the remaining discrimination from our Constitution—the part of the Constitution that says people can be banned from voting based on race. Our Constitution is more than a century old. It has some wonderful attributes. It has in many ways served our nation well, but its exclusionary nature—the fact that for many years it disenfranchised people—has also been a blight on us. So as a document—as a set of guiding principles to underpin the functioning of our nation—it cannot truly serve the nation well unless it serves all its people. I know that even conservatives accede to this point.


We need a Constitution that recognises the first chapter of our national history. I believe in this not as an act of reconciliation but as an act of the fundamentals of the fabric of our country. It is about the foundation of this nation and who was here when our national story began to develop. We need a Constitution that recognises the simple fact that Indigenous people have lived in this land for some 40,000 years, keeping alive the world's oldest continuous cultures. So it is remarkable to me that our Constitution should pretend really just to be a reflection of the last couple of hundred years of our history. We need a Constitution that reflects our true national character.


It was a blight on our nation that the document that serves as the foundation for our democracy in government as a nation mentioned Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people only to discriminate, only to exclude.


I would like to use this debate this afternoon as an opportunity to reflect on what I think is an important element in addressing social disadvantage. As a nation we really need to be focused on the participation of Indigenous people in decision making. I ask senators in this place, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President: would the women in this nation have made the gains that we have without being at the table, without being in parliament? I think not. Without having gained the right to vote some 100 years ago? Again I think not.


I truly believe that, until Indigenous people in this country are in the room making decisions for Indigenous people, Indigenous communities and Indigenous people will not experience the kinds of gains that non-Indigenous women by comparison have made. It is little wonder that we have high rates of poverty, high rates of social exclusion and high rates of incarceration for Indigenous people in our nation. It is no wonder when, for six decades of the history of our democracy, Indigenous Australians could not vote and were excluded as citizens. Fortunately, today, Australia prides itself on being a place of fairness—but still our Constitution does not recognise the first Australians and lets states ban people from voting based on their race.


I truly believe that Australia is ready for a new, stronger and deeper relationship with its first people—a relationship that is not based even on reconciliation but is based on recognition, as the recognition campaign clearly illustrates, of the fact that Australia's first peoples are at the very heart of our nation and that they deserve that celebration and recognition. This is about so much more than bringing our country together after chapters apart. It is about recognition. Like native title, it is about respect and recognition of the Aboriginal people's relationship with country. The relationship of Indigenous people to country is a great national asset. It is celebrated in the best art in the country, in dance, in culture, in language and, today, in the very fabric of what it means to be Australian.


For me, it is a principle that brings me closer to my own attachment to the land of our great country. It is not just about lines on a map. It is not just about property rights—although that is important, especially for native title holders. It is about our social relationships with each other and our relationship with the land. Recognition of Indigenous peoples in our Constitution puts these very, very Australian values at the very, very heart of our Constitution, our most important national document.


To give promise to these kinds of values, to hold true to the promise of this bill—the promise we are making in this bill as we pass it through this place—we will need to continue the work required to ensure that Indigenous people have a place in all levels of decision making in this nation, especially in decisions that affect their communities and decisions that are made as this bill is implemented. I am really privileged to see on a daily basis Indigenous communities around the state of Western Australia, and I see the best possible outcomes for communities emerging when they are empowered and in control. So, once this bill passes, the real work will continue to ensure that a future referendum on the question of recognition is successful.


We all know that the history of constitutional change in this country has not been an easy one—few of them get up—but, if I could wave a magic wand and change the Constitution tomorrow, I would not. We need this nation to vote, to understand in their hearts and minds what this means, for Australians to vote to say we are a confident and united country that wants to recognise our first peoples. The act of constitutional recognition of Australia's first peoples will be an expression of who we are as a nation and who we want to be in the future. It is not just about reconciliation; it is about recognition. It is a great opportunity for all Australians to be able to participate in saying something important about our national identity and our national wellbeing. This is not just a few lines in our Constitution; it is a statement about the importance of Indigenous Australians and Indigenous culture to the fabric of our nation.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2013-02-26,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (17:56):  I want to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 tonight but not for the full allocated time. In particular, I want to associate myself with the speech given by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, on this bill, in which he said:


I believe that we are equal to this task of completing our Constitution rather than changing it.


Along with the rest of the coalition, I welcome this bill, which is an important step towards constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians. Mr Abbott said:


… our challenge is to do now in these times what should have been done 200 or 100 years ago to acknowledge Aboriginal people in our country's foundation document. In short, we need to atone for the omissions and for the hardness of heart of our forebears to enable us all to embrace the future as a united people.


This bill provides a mechanism for the continued work of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, whose formation was originally announced in December 2010. The preamble to this bill affirms this whole parliament's commitment to building the consensus necessary to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution through a referendum. The preamble recognises that 'the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were the first inhabitants of Australia; that the parliament is committed to placing before the Australian people at a referendum a proposal for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; and that the parliament is committed to building the national consensus needed for the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution'. I think the key words in there are 'building the national consensus needed for such recognition'.


The bill recognises the hard work of the expert panel but also recognises that much more consultation and consensus is necessary to enable a referendum to be successful. The coalition is very thankful for the work completed so far by the panel, which is co-chaired by Professor Patrick Dodson and Mark Leibler AC and includes my colleague in the other place the member for Hasluck, Ken Wyatt, who is the first Indigenous Australian to be elected to the other place. This bill provides for an act of recognition by the parliament of the unique role of Indigenous Australians as the first inhabitants of this nation. This is in response to recommendation 3 of the expert panel's report. The bill aims to promote awareness and support in the community towards a successful referendum, which the coalition and Tony Abbott support and, indeed, have pushed for.


In relation to the coalition and Indigenous affairs, I think it is important to place on the record our proud history when it comes to advocating for Indigenous Australians—indeed, ever since the Liberal Party was established, in the 1940s.


Firstly, the coalition introduced the 1967 referendum which proudly gave constitutional recognition to Indigenous Australians and removed racially discriminatory provisions from the Constitution. This referendum, of course, was sponsored by both Harold Holt and Gough Whitlam. It was the coalition government under Malcolm Fraser that passed the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act in the mid-1970s. Indeed, during the 1998 election campaign, former Prime Minister John Howard also promoted a constitutional amendment to recognise the prior occupation of Australia by Indigenous Australians, as well as their contribution and place in Australian society, as part of the 1999 republic referendum. The coalition then committed to hold the referendum that this bill aspires to achieve at the 2007 election, which Labor did not match until 2010. We have indeed, therefore, maintained our commitment to this cause.


The coalition supports the bipartisan nature of this bill and wants to see this referendum succeed. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, in taking a bipartisan approach recognised the work also completed by the Australian Labor Party in Indigenous affairs, recognising 'the stain on our soul that Prime Minister Keating so movingly evoked at Redfern 21 years ago', as well as the national apology jointly made by the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and the former Leader of the Opposition Brendan Nelson.


Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that little progress is being made by the current government to build the community consensus needed for this referendum to succeed given that we are so close to the next election. It is necessary that much more work be done. It is proper for this referendum to be put only when wide community support and consensus has been achieved, given the difficulty in achieving successful referenda in Australia's history—noting that only eight out of 44 proposals to amend the Constitution have been successful. That is why much more work needs to be completed now in order to achieve this consensus as soon as possible.


Accordingly, we must build a national consensus on this issue to achieve a successful consultation, a successful referendum and appropriate words recognising Indigenous Australians in the Constitution. This will obviously involve extensive consultation with Indigenous Australians and also with Australians across the board, as we want to see that the words in the Constitution recognising the First Australians are such that we can all be proud of them. What we want to see is not something that is divisive but something that unites all Indigenous Australians, and Australians as a whole, in working towards a common future and common goals in a united Australia. As the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, said:


It will … be a challenge to find a form of recognition which satisfies reasonable people as being fair to all. It will not necessarily be straightforward to acknowledge the First Australians without creating new categories of discrimination, which we must avoid because no Australians should feel like strangers in their own country.


The Leader of the Opposition is committed to achieving this recognition in the Constitution, saying:


The next parliament will, I trust, finish the work that this one has begun.


As I come towards the end of my contribution, I want to quote the words of my friend and colleague in the other place Ken Wyatt, who proclaimed:


Because a time has come, well and truly come, for all peoples of our great country, for all citizens of our great Commonwealth, for all Australians—those who are Indigenous and those who are not—to come together to reconcile and together build a new future for our nation.


I think it is fair to say that recognition in the Constitution is no substitute for addressing Indigenous disadvantage, and I note with some interest that there are those who walk the walk in relation to this matter and there are those who talk the talk. I think it is very important to put on the public record the engagement of Mr Abbott in Aboriginal communities since 2008. Indeed, that has culminated in Mr Abbott making it quite clear that if he is given the enormous honour of being elected as Prime Minister of this country then he will take a contingent of about six public servants engaged in Indigenous policy, including the head of the Indigenous affairs department and senior Treasury and Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet officials, to work with him for at least a week a year in Aboriginal communities.


Those who are aware of the work that Mr Abbott has done will be acutely aware that he does not arrive in those communities in a suit and is not a visitor for a day from Canberra but gets down and get his hands dirty. He works with the men and women and children in those communities and makes a real contribution. I think that is the sort of leadership that we need. Indeed, looking at some of the comments of Mr Abbott in some of his Press Club speeches, in his 2013 Press Club speech he said in talking about this issue:


That’s why I’ve tried to spend serious time in Aboriginal communities rather than rely on flying visits.


It’s why I’ve tried to be useful in remote communities as a teacher’s aide and builder’s assistant rather than just a glorified tourist from Canberra.


He went on to say: 


This won't stop should the Coalition win the election. 


I have already indicated the comments about where Mr Abbott will be.


I will finish on that note and I will say again that mere words are not going to achieve the recognition that both this place and the other place, through their bipartisan support for this bill, desperately want to achieve. It will not be achieved unless we take all Australian people with us. The only way that can be achieved is with a lot of hard work from everyone in this place and the other place. It is going to require leadership and it is going to require political leadership. It is going to require Indigenous leadership. It is going to require people like Mr Wyatt from the other place to take a lead role in relation to this. No-one should underestimate the challenge of this task, and if we do underestimate it we are doomed to failure. So the important thing for us in this place and the other place is to appreciate the magnitude of the challenge and to set ourselves the challenge of bringing the rest of the Australian community with us. I have no doubt that the majority of Australians want to achieve this goal. In the words that we ultimately choose we must provide them with a level of comfort so that they will come with us. As I said before, there is no point talking the talk in relation to these matters; we have got to walk the walk. I very much support this bill and particularly reinforce associating myself with the comments of the Leader of the Opposition.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2013-02-26,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (18:08):  I am proud to support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012, an important step towards constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. Like Senator Bob Carr, I was born and bred in Maroubra. I have lived there my entire life. I have a connection with that community. I have surfed at that beach all of my life and if you get stuck in a rip at Maroubra I can generally show you the way to get out of it, because I grew up surfing there. I have got a connection with that environment and with those waters. My father has lived in that area all of his life and his father, my grandfather, also lived in that area for most of his life.


That is three generations of Australians that have a connection with that community that I love so much.


I have friends in the Indigenous community around La Perouse and Maroubra whose connection with that area goes back 7,500 years. That is 7,500 years of nurturing and caring for that environment, of managing relations between people who have lived in that area and of developing customs and laws to care for that particular part of our wonderful country.


In modern Australia, the Commonwealth parliament makes laws which dictate how we live on this wonderful land, how we co-exist, how we relate with each other. The power to make those laws is derived from this document, our nation’s Constitution. It is this document which dictates the principles and values for how we live as a people in this wide brown land we call Australia. Yet this principal document, this embodiment of who we are as a nation, says nothing—not a thing—about the people who have inhabited and cared for this country that we all love for the last 60,000 years. In fact, up until 40-odd years ago, our Constitution specifically excluded Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from recognition and actively discriminated against them. Thankfully, since 1967, as a nation we have made progress. We have removed those discriminatory provisions in the Constitution that excluded recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. We have made policies of self-determination. We have recognised land rights and native title. And only a couple of weeks ago we celebrated the fifth anniversary of the apology to the stolen generations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.


Despite this document embodying our values, it does not recognise and reflect the progress we have made as a nation and it does not reflect who we are as a people in modern Australia and, importantly, how we want the world to view us and how we want to view ourselves. That is why, in 2010, the Gillard government established a process of working towards amending our Constitution to remove racist provisions and to fully recognise and acknowledge our relationship and the relationship that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians have with this nation, with this land and with its customs and values. To do that we established an expert panel. It was made up of politicians representative of all the parties in the federal parliament. It was made up of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. It was made up of community leaders. They consulted widely throughout our country about this question of how we recognise Australia’s first peoples in our principal and pinnacle document that sets the tone for law-making in this country. They consulted widely, not only with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community but with non-Aboriginal and non-Torres-Strait-Islander Australians.


The report of the panel is extensive. I encourage members of the public to read, in particular, page 18 of that report, the executive summary, which contains the crux of the work of the panel. There are five recommendations and processes to remove racist provisions in our Constitution, notably in section 25 and section 51(xxvi) of our Constitution and, importantly, a process for recognising the contribution, the values, the traditions and the connection that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have with our land and our nation. This is a step towards a referendum, and referendums in Australia are not easy. The framers of our Constitution made it deliberately hard for referendums to be successful. Only eight of 44 have succeeded, so 82 per cent of the time we fail as a nation to get a referendum up.


In 1999 we tried to insert a preamble which recognised the contribution of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to our nation, and it failed. It failed in every single state in this country. Quite simply, we cannot afford as a nation to fail again. We simply cannot fail again. That is why the Gillard government takes this issue so seriously. That is why we established the expert panel and that is why we have moved this bill in this parliament—to ensure that we do not fail again; to ensure that there is genuine multiparty support for this issue; to ensure that there is genuine unity not only at a national level but also, importantly, with the state and territory governments throughout the country to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.


I do not believe that we are at a point yet where we can go to our nation and put a question associated with recognition as it is contained in the recommendations. We do need to work with the states, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and with the wider Australian public to explain why this amendment to our Constitution is so important and to build momentum for change and to build momentum for recognition.


Some months ago the Gillard government determined that, as a process of building that momentum and explaining that change to the Australian people, we would introduce the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 into this parliament. It has passed the House of Representatives and we are debating it here this evening. I believe that the crucial provision in this bill is these words:


The Parliament is committed to building the national consensus needed for the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution.


That is the crux of the aim behind this bill. It is to build that critical momentum, that critical unity, that critical agreement at all levels of government and with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the wider Australian community for this very important constitutional change.


It is with that in mind that the government has established a joint parliamentary committee, which I am very proud to be a member of, working with representatives of all parties in this parliament and with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and the wider Australian public to achieve a successful referendum. That is why the government is investing $10 million in this campaign to promote public awareness about this issue. I encourage all Australians to visit RECOGNISE.org.au, the website of Reconciliation Australia that has been established to promote and campaign for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander recognition in our Constitution. Visit the website, sign up to the newsletter and, most importantly, discuss this issue in your workplaces, at your family gatherings and in your wider communities. This is such an important issue for the future of our nation. It is too important for us to fail. We need to recognise, finally, the contribution that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have made to our nation's development, to our democracy and, most importantly, to the nurturing and caring of this wonderful land that we call Australia.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2013-02-26,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (18:18):  The coalition is committed to full and complete recognition of our Aboriginal people in our society. We do acknowledge that prior to white settlement—now more than 200 years ago—the land we now call Australia was inhabited by Indigenous people. It was thought that these people most likely came from Indonesia—after all, there was a land bridge to Indonesia many thousands of years ago—and even possibly from India, because I gather there are some similarities in blood groups and so on between the Aboriginal people and the Indians. Interestingly, in trying to understand where the Aborigines came from, there are very old cave paintings in the Kimberley called the Bradshaws which, according to some people, resemble African paintings and raise the interesting possibility that in the long-distant past people of African origin could have come to the north-west of Australia.


Of course, it was the landing of the First Fleet in 1788 which brought the first wave of European culture to Australia on the east coast and the first settlements. However, it is interesting that in the Gascoyne district in the mid-west of Western Australia, where Carnarvon is now located, many of the Aboriginal languages include Dutch words, and the numbers of red-headed Aboriginals in the area rather suggest that they may have been descended from Dutch sailors wrecked on the cliffs around Carnarvon. The Dutch ships came around the Cape of Good Hope and sailed east towards the Australian coast before turning north to go to Batavia, which is now Jakarta, in the Dutch East Indies, which are now Indonesia. There was quite a lot of significant contact between the Aboriginals of the mid-west coast of Western Australia and the Dutch and perhaps the Portuguese as well.


European culture, with its formal settlements and farms and keeping of crops and herds, was certainly at odds with the Indigenous way of life. Most Indigenous people were hunters and gatherers who wandered from place to place without set villages, and they did not keep herds or crops. They have been a part of Australian society, mostly on the periphery of Australian society, since the times of early settlement and well on into the 20th century. It has only been in the latter half of the 20th century that there has been any movement to have constitutional recognition of Indigenous people as part of the Australian society. In 1967 it became the route of the reconciliation process when there was a referendum to grant Aborigines the right to vote, to enfranchise Aborigines and to have this written into our Constitution. It was a Liberal Prime Minister, Harold Holt, who first paved the way to reconciliation with that historic move to enfranchise Aborigines. 


When I was a medical student I was a member of the University of Western Australia Liberal Club. Interestingly, the president then was someone who subsequently became a senator and, in fact, the Leader of the Liberal Party in this chamber—and that was Fred Chaney. I was the freshman committee member back in 1960, and at our first committee meeting he suggested that, rather than the Liberal club putting up all sorts of clever motions about great public issues, the Liberal club should perhaps choose a project and seek to achieve a specific outcome for that project as its activity for the year. Fred Chaney suggested that the university Liberal club look into what could be done to improve the status of Aborigines in our community. So we used to go out to a place near Midland, near the airport in Perth, called Allawah Grove—not very far out of Perth—where there was an Aboriginal community and discuss issues with the Aboriginal leaders there. I found it quite confronting—having come from a fairly ordinary middle-Australian family—to see drunken Aborigines, fights with broken bottles, people sometimes being very aggressive to women and so on and so forth, but that was what the Aboriginal community at Allawah Grove embodied.


Every year from 1960 to 1962 the UWA Liberal Club held a seminar about what could be done to improve the lot of Aborigines in Western Australian society. In the end, Fred Chaney again gave leadership in suggesting that the only way to make Aborigines matter to politicians in government was to give them the vote: to enfranchise them. At the 1962 seminar, held by the Western Australian University Liberal Club, the Minister for Native Affairs, as he was called—a Country Party minister—announced that the Western Australia government would give Aborigines the option to enrol to vote in state elections. That happened in 1962, five years before the federal referendum, and it was therefore an important step in the process of reconciliation with Aborigines and accepting them as members of our society.


Harold Holt instituted the referendum on Aborigines being enrolled to vote in 1967, and another Liberal Prime Minister—John Howard, in 1999—continued down the pathway of recognition of the role of Aborigines in our society when he attempted to introduce an important preamble to the Constitution to recognise Indigenous Australians. As we all know, the referendum on that preamble failed; we also know that, if we are to continue the process of reconciliation with our Indigenous people, we need to build a real consensus in the community.


My first real contact with the Aboriginal community occurred when I went to the Pilbara in 1974. I used to see Aboriginal patients at the Port Hedland Hospital outpatient department while I worked there. I always treated the Aborigines with great respect, and they responded with respect to me. Perhaps because of this mutual respect, in 1975 I was invited to an Aboriginal bush meeting on the banks of the Coongan River near Marble Bar. These bush meetings were held every quarter. Aborigines came to them from all over the Pilbara—including from the Western Desert and as far west as Onslow and the area around it—and the meetings were almost always held on the banks of a river. About 100 people were gathered, cooking under the trees on open fires, at the meeting I went to in Marble Bar, and to me it was a very eye-opening experience.


The meeting was chaired by a man whom I cannot name because he is since deceased. He was the chief Aborigine of the Pilbara. He sat at a table in the middle of a clearing with tables on either side of him, at which sat his white advisers from Perth and Canberra, including lawyers and people who knew about the social security system, housing, education and so on. This chief Aborigine was a very impressive person: he had a great mane of white hair and a stetson on his head, and he controlled the meeting very skilfully. Not everybody had the ability to present a case very clearly, and he was very gentle in drawing out the points the people wanted to make—everybody had the right to raise any issue they wanted to—and in arranging for translators for the desert Aborigines who attended the meeting. By the end of the day, my perception of Aboriginal people in the Pilbara had changed completely. Whereas before I had seen them as people who did not really understand our society, I realised that these people well and truly understood our society and how our system of government worked.


I have met many other Aboriginal leaders, such as Peter Yu in the Kimberley, who was the head of the Kimberley Land Council; and people like Joe Ross in Fitzroy Crossing, who is the leader of the 300, I think, Aboriginal communities in the Fitzroy River Valley—and they are very impressive people. These are, of course, Aboriginal people in the north, close to their origins. But I understand that these days around 85 per cent of Aboriginals live in big cities and towns—Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and the big towns of Queensland, New South Wales, WA and South Australia. Many of them have jobs, many of them are educated—increasingly, there are large numbers of Aboriginal graduates—and they simply fit into our society as members of our society.


I think it is now very appropriate that we do recognise that the Indigenous people were here first and that that fact is acknowledged in our Constitution. It does not necessarily mean that it carries any particular implications in terms of additional rights and benefits above those which any other Australians have, but I think it is appropriate that that kind of recognition be given.


This bill is not a token gesture. It is an important building block of unity and of recognition of the long history of Aboriginal people in Australia and will carry a message of all of our community, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, migrants from all over the world as well as those Australians whose history goes back 40,000 years, that we are moving forward as one people in one country. I support this bill.

Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (18:31):  I thank Senator Eggleston for that very interesting history lesson. There are fascinating perspectives that we all have about what we are debating here today—a really important issue, in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012.


Just a few weeks ago, coinciding with the fifth anniversary of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's apology to the Stolen Generations, this bill was presented, debated and passed in the House of Representatives, recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as the first inhabitants of Australia. I am very proud to speak as part of the group of speakers contributing to this debate in the Senate. So often a debate can happen in the House of Representatives, where all the publicity and discussion is reported upon; but, of course, we know the legislation then comes here—so it is timely that this is a week when the House of Representatives is not sitting, and perhaps the contributions to the debate in this chamber will actually get some coverage in the media as well and continue the message of the importance of the legislation that is in front of us.


I want to congratulate people who have contributed to the debate, because we have heard the passion that has been brought to the debate by all sides of politics and all sides of the parliament. People bring their own perspectives and their own experiences about how they have interacted with Indigenous peoples. If you ask someone like those of us who have actually lived in and worked with Aboriginal communities, you will know that there is so much that remains to be done in terms of addressing Aboriginal disadvantage; but you will also know the importance of the bill that is before us today.


Constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples generally does have support and is seen by many as an important further step that should now be taken towards full recognition of the unique place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in 21st century Australian society. It is really interesting that we are having a conversation now that is so different from the conversation that was held in 1999. Senator Thistlethwaite remarked on the failure of the referendum in 1999 and the fact that we cannot afford to fail again to have this constitutional recognition agreed upon.


Prime Minister Gillard has called the legislation before us an 'act of preparation and anticipation', because it is an important step on the way towards a referendum for constitutional change; it seeks to foster the momentum for a referendum—so many of us here have talked about the importance of building the consensus, of building the momentum. It is one thing to have politicians and parliamentarians supporting this constitutional reform; it is a very big thing for us to take the Australian people down this path with us.


I said before that in 1999 the conversation and the debate were very different. When I talk to young people about the importance of this piece of legislation, they just cannot fathom why this could be the situation now. They cannot believe that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are not recognised in the Constitution, so we actually have a huge job to educate voters across Australia about the importance, the significance, of the change that we are trying to engender.


The bill before us today is essentially a parliamentary statement that recognises some facts of our history that have never been formally acknowledged before—the fact that Australia was first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; the fact that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a continuing relationship with their traditional land and waters; and the fact that their continuing cultures, languages and heritages are worthy of respect. When the Prime Minister spoke of this bill as a gesture, and a sign of good faith, she too was acknowledging that there is still a long way to go.


I was pleased that Senator Siewert, who is here in the chamber, talked about the importance of the sunset clause that is in this bill. That is what gives us the time frame in which this work should be carried out; it gives us a sense of urgency. This not something that is on the never-never. There is a definite time frame, one that sets us a very ambitious goal but a goal that we know that we can achieve. The expert panel that was appointed to investigate the issue highlighted the importance of this. It recommended a series of constitutional changes and made it very clear that bipartisan agreement would be necessary before those recommendations could be put to a referendum for exactly the reason that Senator Thistlethwaite raised: referendums in Australia do not have a very strong history of success. Constitutional change is quite difficult here in Australia. It can only be done if we have a majority of votes in every state and territory. The work that needs to be done across state and territory governments and in the community is really very critical.


What we need—the point of contention—is a non-discrimination provision in the Constitution. At the moment, that is the problem. The opposition regards a non-discrimination provision as akin to a bill of rights and will not agree to move in that direction. But that does not mean that the cause is lost. There is so much goodwill on all sides. We are all charged with the responsibility to represent the people of Australia and we should not expect that to be easy in this case. The challenge facing all of us—and the next parliament as well—is to find a form of words that is going to satisfy all sides of politics and to make this constitutional reform something that we can all be very proud of.


Today, I read a post on Eureka Street by Father Frank Brennan about this bill congratulating both government and opposition members for their contributions to the debate in the House of Representatives. He made a really important point. He said that a new generation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders were gathered in the public gallery for the passage of the legislation, with many of the leaders from earlier campaigns over the Northern Territory land rights legislation, Mabo, Wik, native title and reconciliation. There was a group of young people ready to take up the challenge and become the leaders most actively engaged in the discussions that we are going to be part of.


They all then went to the National Press Club where two of those young people, two emerging leaders, spoke. They were fantastic. Those young people were Tanya Hosch and Jason Glanville. Each spoke very proudly of their diverse heritage. I would like to read a little of what Tanya had to say, because it puts this into context. She said:


I was blessed to be raised in a family that is a model for the kind of nation I want Australia to be. A family where race isn't a divide, but an enricher ... that is proud of the many strands of its heritage, and particularly of our Indigenous heritage ... that integrates the best of all of our traditions and cultures, and which has nurtured me to play a part in bringing about this big moment in the life of our nation.


Her speech was very powerful. I recommend it to you all.


Then Jason Glanville went on to tell the story of how his great-grandmother left the mission with her two-year-old child to go to Cootamundra and build a home. This is what he said:


In the Cootamundra Town Hall, where once my great grandmother was barred from being able to vote, a stained glass window now hangs. It's a picture story. In it, she is telling bedtime stories to her grandchildren in the language of their ancestors. The town that once excluded this amazing Aboriginal woman has now immortalised her remarkable story. At long last, it has recognised her, and regards her story as a source of pride. It's time our Constitution did too.


That generational change is important in the debate that is ahead of us all. Father Brennan made the point, as many speakers have, that there is much work to be done if the referendum is to get up in the next parliamentary term and that we have a responsibility as elected members of parliament to engage Australians in understanding what constitutional recognition means, not just for Indigenous Australians but for all of us. In the wake of the national apology, there is a new generation of Indigenous Australians able to show us the way, and I very much look forward to working with them.


I want to congratulate everyone who has got us to this position. It is an issue whose time has come. This is political work at its best. It is the work that we all enjoy the most: the people's representatives putting their minds and experience to work to together create the Australia that people want to live in. I have no doubt that we will reach a satisfactory form of words. We will debate the matter robustly, I am sure. We will hold a referendum. That is the right thing to do. It will be a milestone along the route I want this country to take in the interests of human rights and of the dignity of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2013-02-26,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales) (18:43):  I acknowledge the words of many of the previous speakers in the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 in this chamber. In many cases, they have made compelling and salient points about the importance of this piece of legislation. I want to say from the outset from a personal perspective that I very strongly support the bill and support the constitutional recognition for our first peoples that this bill will, with the passage of time and much more debate in this nation, hopefully bring about. I am confident that with cross-parliamentary agreement and with cross-political support, we can realise this objective to give our first peoples recognition that they absolutely deserve.


Just briefly, the coalition has a long and proud history of advocating for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal Australians.


With other senators from this chamber who have both spoken in this debate—Senator Siewert and Senator Thistlethwaite—I attended a recent Recognise event here in Canberra just two weeks ago, held in conjunction with GHD and Carey engineering, at which these issues were much discussed. I want to commend the work of Recognise—the organisation that was formerly known as You Me Unity. The work they are doing now and the work they will do for some years into the future in relation to the question of constitutional recognition is very important. It is important that it is community based, it is important that it is community networked and it is important that it is recognised as such.


Recognise itself is part of Reconciliation Australia. As was recommended by the expert panel report, it was given the very fundamental task of raising awareness amongst community members and building community support for the constitutional recognition of Australia's first peoples. To date they have worked extremely diligently to promote the cause to Australians. Their activities include but are by no means limited to recruiting over 125,000 Australians who are supporting this recognition, holding street stalls in every major capital city, spreading the message to thousands of Australians in that way, and funding over 100 community groups to run public awareness campaigns of their own. They have generated media coverage across print, radio, television and online platforms, and they have developed a schools kit that was distributed to every high school in the country.


I think the work of Recognise matches well with the longstanding commitment of the coalition to bring this issue to a referendum and to gain the necessary support to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution. As other speakers have indicated and as the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, did in his contribution to the second reading debate earlier today, it was the coalition government that was responsible for the historic 1967 referendum, with a result of just over 90 per cent in that case. That was a watershed achievement in this country. It received support from all sectors of the community and political parties of all colours. As I mentioned at the Recognise event the other week, who could forget the black and white photographic images of young campaigners like Shirley Peisley pinning their 'vote yes for Aborigines' badge onto the suit jacket of Senator Reg Bishop on that referendum day? I suspect there will be many more similar photographs—but in colour—across social media of all forms and in traditional forms of media to mark the progress of this bill and ultimately a referendum as well.


They have a huge impact. To actually meet Shirley Peisley, as we did on that occasion at AIATSIS recently, and to compare her smiling face with that seen in the photograph from 1967, and to think that she and members of her generation are in a position of still waiting for this next step, is actually quite confronting—for me personally, at least. As I think Senator Stephens alluded to, when you discuss it with young Australians—and, as desperate as I might be to include myself in that group, I am not completely delusional!—and they say, 'How is it possible that we are at this point and this next step has not been taken?' and then to be able to see that photograph from 1967, to meet Shirley Peisley today and to know that with the will of an Australian community united together on this issue she will be able to see that next step is a particularly important thought that I hold as we continue these discussions.


As I said, on that day just over 90 per cent of Australian citizens voted yes in the referendum. I want to see that extraordinarily positive result repeated, preferably exceeded. But we must work together to get this particular process right, to get the question right and to ensure that, above everything else that we put before us, we ensure that it is indeed a unifying moment for the nation. This is not something with which to take political risks. It is not something with which to play political games. It is in fact a very serious engagement by the Australian people as the referendum process, which is outlined in part in this bill, continues.


The current proposal for Aboriginal reconciliation came initially from the coalition, who first raised it in 1999, when the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, penned and advanced the preamble, which was considered at the 1999 referendum.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-02-26,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:26):  Before this debate was interrupted by question time, I was indicating to the Senate that I, like my colleagues, will be supporting the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012.


I mention, for those listening to this debate, that speakers get a maximum of 20 minutes to contribute on the bill. Just before two o'clock, when I started my contribution, I indicated my support for the bill. I also took the opportunity at that time, when all of the government ministers were in here preparing for question time, to describe a situation in Townsville. We hear many fine words about recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people—and I agree with the need for recognition and I agree with the contents of this bill. There is a situation in Townsville at this very moment that involves Indigenous people, many of whom do not come from Townsville but come from outlying areas up in the gulf and Cape York, some 300 or 400 kilometres from their home base, and do not have big support networks in Townsville.


Until recently those people were able to get a state government sponsored taxi fare to the hospital for renal dialysis. For whatever reason, the state government suspended that program. I do not want to get into the blame game, but this has resulted in a terrible situation for those Indigenous people requiring renal dialysis. There was a community group that had started to transport them—a group of volunteers who convey people around Townsville. Without going into detail, for a number of reasons it became impossible for that not-for-profit community group to continue doing that at no charge. One of these Indigenous people in Townsville has already died, and I am told that four have died since this transport service was stopped.


I took that opportunity just before question time, while ministers were in the chamber, to say: please can you do something about this? If you are really interested in Indigenous people, do something positive that will help bridge the gap that you speak so much about. I asked ministers: please refer the three ministers I wrote to to my letter of 20 February. Have a look at it; please do something urgently.


I thought everyone in this chamber would agree with me. Some of my Labor colleagues shouted at me. I think it was Senator Sterle—if it was not him, I will apologise later; if it was not him, it was one of his colleagues—who said, 'You wouldn't even know what an Aborigine looked like.'


'How dare you raise this in this debate!' I heard another of the Labor senators say. I find that appalling and offensive. It is not offensive to me but to the people that I am trying to help in this chamber.


Why did I raise it here? I raised it because it is now six days ago that I wrote the ministers an urgent plea—not a political plea—to help these people. Why? I had been asked by Indigenous people to help them. I had appeared on the Indigenous radio station 4K1G in Townsville, and I have had two discussions with the presenter about this very issue.


I have had no response from the ministers' offices. Admittedly it is only six days, but this is a matter of life and death. So I take the opportunity to alert the ministers to this critical situation—to say, 'Please do something about it'—and all that happens to me is that I get shouted at by Labor members of parliament. These are the same members who will get up and give very impassioned speeches about Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander people, and yet when there is an opportunity to do something to help Indigenous and Islander people all I get is abuse.


Just for the Labor senator who interjected and said, 'You wouldn't know what an Aborigine looked like,' may I say that, unlike most Labor senators, who live in the cities—in the flash houses or apartments—and many of whom went to the flash private schools, I went to a state school. And I grew up with both Aboriginal and Islander kids. I have to confess that I had some problem with Aboriginal and Islander kids because they were always the ones who tackled me hardest at Rugby League. They were the ones who were game winners in basketball, because they were very talented people. They were the ones who would attend parties at my house and win some of the young females that I was trying to deal with. So I find it very offensive that Labor senators suggest that I would not know what an Aborigine looks like. 


I only raise these things to say that I have lived and worked with Indigenous people. And I know that the issues that are of interest to Aboriginal and Islander people are not so much the flowery words of apology—although they do play a part—but the need their people suffer as a result of being treated as being different. It started with Whitlam saying, 'Look, we owe you a living. We've wronged you. So don't bother to do anything; we will feed you and clothe you and you won't have to work.' Indigenous leaders now understand—Noel Pearson is one—that the welfare society imposed upon Indigenous people by the Whitlam government and subsequent 'socially conscious' people from the other side of the chamber, is the worst thing that has ever happened to Indigenous people. And their leaders now understand this.


So why couldn't some of the time and money that we have spent on this particular bill, which I think everyone agrees with—everything spent on all the committees, inquiries and other costs—be put into transport for Indigenous people requiring renal dialysis in Townsville? And I am sure the same thing happens everywhere else.


I return to the bill before us. As I said earlier, this bill says: 


(1)  The Parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, recognises that the continent and the islands now known as Australia were first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


Whilst I am supporting the bill for its symbolism, I have to say that I think most Australians actually understand that Australia was first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. 


The bill goes on to record:


(2)  The Parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, acknowledges the continuing relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their traditional lands and waters.


I think there would be few, if any, Australians who need an act of parliament to inform them of that. And I think most Indigenous people accept that every other Australian accepts those two things. 


And, of course, the bill goes on to say: 


(3) The Parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, acknowledges and respects the continuing cultures, languages and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


Again, I think most Australians, without this bill, would have accepted, acknowledged and respected those cultures, languages and the heritage. And I think most Indigenous and Islander people also accept that other Australians accept that. 


So, whilst this is symbolism—whilst it is, I guess, a step in the right direction—I do not think it is the most important issue that confronts our country as it deals with Indigenous people. The Labor Party talks a lot about closing the gap, but it never seems to happen. Even last week a woman—she was half Aboriginal and half Islander; she proudly told me her family history—came into my office and said, 'Please, Senator, can you help me. We've always voted Labor because the Labor Party come and promise us everything. They've been doing it for 20 years. They keep giving us the same promise every year and we keep voting for them, but nothing ever happens. Can you please make sure something happens.' She was speaking in relation to the protection of children in trouble. 


I do not want to be political about this, but if you look at the results in the Queensland election you will see that places like Palm Island—an Indigenous community off Townsville—for the first time ever, had a majority vote for the LNP.


We usually used to get five or 10 per cent of the vote on Palm Island. This year on first preference we got 48 per cent, from memory, and on two-party preferred an enormous vote. Have a look at what happened in the Northern Territory election. Indigenous people understand that the Labor Party is all talk and very little action.


The coalition and the Liberal Party, of which I am a member, are very proud of our involvement with Indigenous people, particularly with Indigenous people in parliament. We do not need 'captain's picks' to get Indigenous people to parliament. We have had Indigenous people approach us, become part of the party and stand for preselection against all other comers.


Eric Deeral, I remember, was the first Indigenous member in a state parliament. He came from the electorate of Cook, which includes Cape York and the Torres Strait Islands. I think Eric was a Cooktown person. I did know him. He was a member of the National Party in the Queensland parliament. Of course, my friend and colleague Neville Bonner was the first Indigenous person to ever set foot in this parliament of Australia. Again, he was a guy who got here on his own merits, not by a 'captain's pick'. He was selected by members of the Liberal Party as the best person for that position. I often recount and well recall how Nev Bonner stayed at my flat one time before I was married. I warned him that it was a flat that did not have all that good a reputation for parties and those sorts of things, but he was happy to spend the night in my flat and I was honoured that he did. He was a very fine man. Ken Wyatt is another Indigenous person who is currently a member of the House of Representatives and who is a very significant person. Whether he is Indigenous or anything else, he is a real achiever and a real leader. I am delighted that he is a member of our party. I remember even the Democrats had an Indigenous senator at some time.


The Labor Party have never had it in their souls to select an Indigenous person, so the Prime Minister has had to have a so-called 'captain's pick'—overturning one of the Labor senators who, I have to say, has done more for the Indigenous communities than any other Labor politician I can remember. She has been thrown over so that the Prime Minister's Indigenous 'pick' could take her place in the Senate. As with all of these things, actions speak louder than words. I am, as I say, delighted that I have known Indigenous people who have represented all Australians in state and federal parliaments of this country.


This bill does hopefully take reconciliation further, but I keep saying the best form of reconciliation is to give Indigenous people the same opportunities that every other Australian has: a good education; a good opportunity to get a job and become a member of our community—not someone different, not someone who needs special attention, but someone who has the same opportunities as every other Australian. That is the important challenge. Sure, apologies take the fancy of the media but they do not, in effect, do a hell of a lot for a very disadvantaged group of people in a country as lucky as Australia. I look forward to the day when an Abbott government—should we be elected at the next election—can continue the process of real advancement for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this lucky country and land of plenty.

Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (17:42):  I welcome, the DLP welcomes and I am sure the majority of Australians welcome the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012. I think it is important that we as a nation take the opportunity to listen to Aboriginal Australians and Indigenous Australians to determine the sort—if any—of constitutional recognition necessary and that they be fully involved in this process. I am hopeful that the government will allow for a more transparent and inclusive procedure to determine the course of this process to referendum than was afforded to the communities in the Northern Territory through the Stronger Futures legislation.


In the 1967 referendum, the majority of Australians voted to give Indigenous Australians the right to vote, which they did deserve, do deserve and should have always had. Let us all focus on the future and not on the past. Hopefully, we can not politicise this debate, can stop attributing blame to one another and can just get on with it. We need genuinely inclusive and thoughtful discussion. Actions speak louder than words. We need tangible actions in Indigenous health, education, self-empowerment and employment. I look forward to this legislation and will be providing my contribution in due course on what I believe the final outcome of this process should be. Ultimately, it should be for the good of all Indigenous Australians.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2013-02-26,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:46):  It is a real honour to be able to speak this afternoon on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012, which brings our nation a step closer to the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as our nation's first peoples. There is no doubt about the need to fix the historical exclusion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from Australia's Constitution, and I am very pleased that there is bipartisan support for this recognition—recognition that I think will enhance our national character, reflect us for who we truly are as a nation and reflect the fact that this nation's relationship with Indigenous people is one of its greatest national assets but that we will not maximise this asset unless we recognise it. Therefore, it is a relationship that should be reflected in our Constitution, and I am glad that this bill brings us a step closer to that recognition.


We also need to remove the remaining discrimination from our Constitution—the part of the Constitution that says people can be banned from voting based on race. Our Constitution is more than a century old. It has some wonderful attributes. It has in many ways served our nation well, but its exclusionary nature—the fact that for many years it disenfranchised people—has also been a blight on us. So as a document—as a set of guiding principles to underpin the functioning of our nation—it cannot truly serve the nation well unless it serves all its people. I know that even conservatives accede to this point.


We need a Constitution that recognises the first chapter of our national history. I believe in this not as an act of reconciliation but as an act of the fundamentals of the fabric of our country. It is about the foundation of this nation and who was here when our national story began to develop. We need a Constitution that recognises the simple fact that Indigenous people have lived in this land for some 40,000 years, keeping alive the world's oldest continuous cultures. So it is remarkable to me that our Constitution should pretend really just to be a reflection of the last couple of hundred years of our history. We need a Constitution that reflects our true national character.


It was a blight on our nation that the document that serves as the foundation for our democracy in government as a nation mentioned Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people only to discriminate, only to exclude.


I would like to use this debate this afternoon as an opportunity to reflect on what I think is an important element in addressing social disadvantage. As a nation we really need to be focused on the participation of Indigenous people in decision making. I ask senators in this place, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President: would the women in this nation have made the gains that we have without being at the table, without being in parliament? I think not. Without having gained the right to vote some 100 years ago? Again I think not.


I truly believe that, until Indigenous people in this country are in the room making decisions for Indigenous people, Indigenous communities and Indigenous people will not experience the kinds of gains that non-Indigenous women by comparison have made. It is little wonder that we have high rates of poverty, high rates of social exclusion and high rates of incarceration for Indigenous people in our nation. It is no wonder when, for six decades of the history of our democracy, Indigenous Australians could not vote and were excluded as citizens. Fortunately, today, Australia prides itself on being a place of fairness—but still our Constitution does not recognise the first Australians and lets states ban people from voting based on their race.


I truly believe that Australia is ready for a new, stronger and deeper relationship with its first people—a relationship that is not based even on reconciliation but is based on recognition, as the recognition campaign clearly illustrates, of the fact that Australia's first peoples are at the very heart of our nation and that they deserve that celebration and recognition. This is about so much more than bringing our country together after chapters apart. It is about recognition. Like native title, it is about respect and recognition of the Aboriginal people's relationship with country. The relationship of Indigenous people to country is a great national asset. It is celebrated in the best art in the country, in dance, in culture, in language and, today, in the very fabric of what it means to be Australian.


For me, it is a principle that brings me closer to my own attachment to the land of our great country. It is not just about lines on a map. It is not just about property rights—although that is important, especially for native title holders. It is about our social relationships with each other and our relationship with the land. Recognition of Indigenous peoples in our Constitution puts these very, very Australian values at the very, very heart of our Constitution, our most important national document.


To give promise to these kinds of values, to hold true to the promise of this bill—the promise we are making in this bill as we pass it through this place—we will need to continue the work required to ensure that Indigenous people have a place in all levels of decision making in this nation, especially in decisions that affect their communities and decisions that are made as this bill is implemented. I am really privileged to see on a daily basis Indigenous communities around the state of Western Australia, and I see the best possible outcomes for communities emerging when they are empowered and in control. So, once this bill passes, the real work will continue to ensure that a future referendum on the question of recognition is successful.


We all know that the history of constitutional change in this country has not been an easy one—few of them get up—but, if I could wave a magic wand and change the Constitution tomorrow, I would not. We need this nation to vote, to understand in their hearts and minds what this means, for Australians to vote to say we are a confident and united country that wants to recognise our first peoples. The act of constitutional recognition of Australia's first peoples will be an expression of who we are as a nation and who we want to be in the future. It is not just about reconciliation; it is about recognition. It is a great opportunity for all Australians to be able to participate in saying something important about our national identity and our national wellbeing. This is not just a few lines in our Constitution; it is a statement about the importance of Indigenous Australians and Indigenous culture to the fabric of our nation.

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (17:56):  I want to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 tonight but not for the full allocated time. In particular, I want to associate myself with the speech given by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, on this bill, in which he said:


I believe that we are equal to this task of completing our Constitution rather than changing it.


Along with the rest of the coalition, I welcome this bill, which is an important step towards constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians. Mr Abbott said:


… our challenge is to do now in these times what should have been done 200 or 100 years ago to acknowledge Aboriginal people in our country's foundation document. In short, we need to atone for the omissions and for the hardness of heart of our forebears to enable us all to embrace the future as a united people.


This bill provides a mechanism for the continued work of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, whose formation was originally announced in December 2010. The preamble to this bill affirms this whole parliament's commitment to building the consensus necessary to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution through a referendum. The preamble recognises that 'the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were the first inhabitants of Australia; that the parliament is committed to placing before the Australian people at a referendum a proposal for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; and that the parliament is committed to building the national consensus needed for the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution'. I think the key words in there are 'building the national consensus needed for such recognition'.


The bill recognises the hard work of the expert panel but also recognises that much more consultation and consensus is necessary to enable a referendum to be successful. The coalition is very thankful for the work completed so far by the panel, which is co-chaired by Professor Patrick Dodson and Mark Leibler AC and includes my colleague in the other place the member for Hasluck, Ken Wyatt, who is the first Indigenous Australian to be elected to the other place. This bill provides for an act of recognition by the parliament of the unique role of Indigenous Australians as the first inhabitants of this nation. This is in response to recommendation 3 of the expert panel's report. The bill aims to promote awareness and support in the community towards a successful referendum, which the coalition and Tony Abbott support and, indeed, have pushed for.


In relation to the coalition and Indigenous affairs, I think it is important to place on the record our proud history when it comes to advocating for Indigenous Australians—indeed, ever since the Liberal Party was established, in the 1940s.


Firstly, the coalition introduced the 1967 referendum which proudly gave constitutional recognition to Indigenous Australians and removed racially discriminatory provisions from the Constitution. This referendum, of course, was sponsored by both Harold Holt and Gough Whitlam. It was the coalition government under Malcolm Fraser that passed the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act in the mid-1970s. Indeed, during the 1998 election campaign, former Prime Minister John Howard also promoted a constitutional amendment to recognise the prior occupation of Australia by Indigenous Australians, as well as their contribution and place in Australian society, as part of the 1999 republic referendum. The coalition then committed to hold the referendum that this bill aspires to achieve at the 2007 election, which Labor did not match until 2010. We have indeed, therefore, maintained our commitment to this cause.


The coalition supports the bipartisan nature of this bill and wants to see this referendum succeed. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, in taking a bipartisan approach recognised the work also completed by the Australian Labor Party in Indigenous affairs, recognising 'the stain on our soul that Prime Minister Keating so movingly evoked at Redfern 21 years ago', as well as the national apology jointly made by the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and the former Leader of the Opposition Brendan Nelson.


Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that little progress is being made by the current government to build the community consensus needed for this referendum to succeed given that we are so close to the next election. It is necessary that much more work be done. It is proper for this referendum to be put only when wide community support and consensus has been achieved, given the difficulty in achieving successful referenda in Australia's history—noting that only eight out of 44 proposals to amend the Constitution have been successful. That is why much more work needs to be completed now in order to achieve this consensus as soon as possible.


Accordingly, we must build a national consensus on this issue to achieve a successful consultation, a successful referendum and appropriate words recognising Indigenous Australians in the Constitution. This will obviously involve extensive consultation with Indigenous Australians and also with Australians across the board, as we want to see that the words in the Constitution recognising the First Australians are such that we can all be proud of them. What we want to see is not something that is divisive but something that unites all Indigenous Australians, and Australians as a whole, in working towards a common future and common goals in a united Australia. As the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, said:


It will … be a challenge to find a form of recognition which satisfies reasonable people as being fair to all. It will not necessarily be straightforward to acknowledge the First Australians without creating new categories of discrimination, which we must avoid because no Australians should feel like strangers in their own country.


The Leader of the Opposition is committed to achieving this recognition in the Constitution, saying:


The next parliament will, I trust, finish the work that this one has begun.


As I come towards the end of my contribution, I want to quote the words of my friend and colleague in the other place Ken Wyatt, who proclaimed:


Because a time has come, well and truly come, for all peoples of our great country, for all citizens of our great Commonwealth, for all Australians—those who are Indigenous and those who are not—to come together to reconcile and together build a new future for our nation.


I think it is fair to say that recognition in the Constitution is no substitute for addressing Indigenous disadvantage, and I note with some interest that there are those who walk the walk in relation to this matter and there are those who talk the talk. I think it is very important to put on the public record the engagement of Mr Abbott in Aboriginal communities since 2008. Indeed, that has culminated in Mr Abbott making it quite clear that if he is given the enormous honour of being elected as Prime Minister of this country then he will take a contingent of about six public servants engaged in Indigenous policy, including the head of the Indigenous affairs department and senior Treasury and Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet officials, to work with him for at least a week a year in Aboriginal communities.


Those who are aware of the work that Mr Abbott has done will be acutely aware that he does not arrive in those communities in a suit and is not a visitor for a day from Canberra but gets down and get his hands dirty. He works with the men and women and children in those communities and makes a real contribution. I think that is the sort of leadership that we need. Indeed, looking at some of the comments of Mr Abbott in some of his Press Club speeches, in his 2013 Press Club speech he said in talking about this issue:


That’s why I’ve tried to spend serious time in Aboriginal communities rather than rely on flying visits.


It’s why I’ve tried to be useful in remote communities as a teacher’s aide and builder’s assistant rather than just a glorified tourist from Canberra.


He went on to say: 


This won't stop should the Coalition win the election. 


I have already indicated the comments about where Mr Abbott will be.


I will finish on that note and I will say again that mere words are not going to achieve the recognition that both this place and the other place, through their bipartisan support for this bill, desperately want to achieve. It will not be achieved unless we take all Australian people with us. The only way that can be achieved is with a lot of hard work from everyone in this place and the other place. It is going to require leadership and it is going to require political leadership. It is going to require Indigenous leadership. It is going to require people like Mr Wyatt from the other place to take a lead role in relation to this. No-one should underestimate the challenge of this task, and if we do underestimate it we are doomed to failure. So the important thing for us in this place and the other place is to appreciate the magnitude of the challenge and to set ourselves the challenge of bringing the rest of the Australian community with us. I have no doubt that the majority of Australians want to achieve this goal. In the words that we ultimately choose we must provide them with a level of comfort so that they will come with us. As I said before, there is no point talking the talk in relation to these matters; we have got to walk the walk. I very much support this bill and particularly reinforce associating myself with the comments of the Leader of the Opposition.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2013-02-26,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (18:08):  I am proud to support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012, an important step towards constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. Like Senator Bob Carr, I was born and bred in Maroubra. I have lived there my entire life. I have a connection with that community. I have surfed at that beach all of my life and if you get stuck in a rip at Maroubra I can generally show you the way to get out of it, because I grew up surfing there. I have got a connection with that environment and with those waters. My father has lived in that area all of his life and his father, my grandfather, also lived in that area for most of his life.


That is three generations of Australians that have a connection with that community that I love so much.


I have friends in the Indigenous community around La Perouse and Maroubra whose connection with that area goes back 7,500 years. That is 7,500 years of nurturing and caring for that environment, of managing relations between people who have lived in that area and of developing customs and laws to care for that particular part of our wonderful country.


In modern Australia, the Commonwealth parliament makes laws which dictate how we live on this wonderful land, how we co-exist, how we relate with each other. The power to make those laws is derived from this document, our nation’s Constitution. It is this document which dictates the principles and values for how we live as a people in this wide brown land we call Australia. Yet this principal document, this embodiment of who we are as a nation, says nothing—not a thing—about the people who have inhabited and cared for this country that we all love for the last 60,000 years. In fact, up until 40-odd years ago, our Constitution specifically excluded Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from recognition and actively discriminated against them. Thankfully, since 1967, as a nation we have made progress. We have removed those discriminatory provisions in the Constitution that excluded recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. We have made policies of self-determination. We have recognised land rights and native title. And only a couple of weeks ago we celebrated the fifth anniversary of the apology to the stolen generations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.


Despite this document embodying our values, it does not recognise and reflect the progress we have made as a nation and it does not reflect who we are as a people in modern Australia and, importantly, how we want the world to view us and how we want to view ourselves. That is why, in 2010, the Gillard government established a process of working towards amending our Constitution to remove racist provisions and to fully recognise and acknowledge our relationship and the relationship that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians have with this nation, with this land and with its customs and values. To do that we established an expert panel. It was made up of politicians representative of all the parties in the federal parliament. It was made up of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. It was made up of community leaders. They consulted widely throughout our country about this question of how we recognise Australia’s first peoples in our principal and pinnacle document that sets the tone for law-making in this country. They consulted widely, not only with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community but with non-Aboriginal and non-Torres-Strait-Islander Australians.


The report of the panel is extensive. I encourage members of the public to read, in particular, page 18 of that report, the executive summary, which contains the crux of the work of the panel. There are five recommendations and processes to remove racist provisions in our Constitution, notably in section 25 and section 51(xxvi) of our Constitution and, importantly, a process for recognising the contribution, the values, the traditions and the connection that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have with our land and our nation. This is a step towards a referendum, and referendums in Australia are not easy. The framers of our Constitution made it deliberately hard for referendums to be successful. Only eight of 44 have succeeded, so 82 per cent of the time we fail as a nation to get a referendum up.


In 1999 we tried to insert a preamble which recognised the contribution of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to our nation, and it failed. It failed in every single state in this country. Quite simply, we cannot afford as a nation to fail again. We simply cannot fail again. That is why the Gillard government takes this issue so seriously. That is why we established the expert panel and that is why we have moved this bill in this parliament—to ensure that we do not fail again; to ensure that there is genuine multiparty support for this issue; to ensure that there is genuine unity not only at a national level but also, importantly, with the state and territory governments throughout the country to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.


I do not believe that we are at a point yet where we can go to our nation and put a question associated with recognition as it is contained in the recommendations. We do need to work with the states, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and with the wider Australian public to explain why this amendment to our Constitution is so important and to build momentum for change and to build momentum for recognition.


Some months ago the Gillard government determined that, as a process of building that momentum and explaining that change to the Australian people, we would introduce the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 into this parliament. It has passed the House of Representatives and we are debating it here this evening. I believe that the crucial provision in this bill is these words:


The Parliament is committed to building the national consensus needed for the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution.


That is the crux of the aim behind this bill. It is to build that critical momentum, that critical unity, that critical agreement at all levels of government and with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the wider Australian community for this very important constitutional change.


It is with that in mind that the government has established a joint parliamentary committee, which I am very proud to be a member of, working with representatives of all parties in this parliament and with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and the wider Australian public to achieve a successful referendum. That is why the government is investing $10 million in this campaign to promote public awareness about this issue. I encourage all Australians to visit RECOGNISE.org.au, the website of Reconciliation Australia that has been established to promote and campaign for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander recognition in our Constitution. Visit the website, sign up to the newsletter and, most importantly, discuss this issue in your workplaces, at your family gatherings and in your wider communities. This is such an important issue for the future of our nation. It is too important for us to fail. We need to recognise, finally, the contribution that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have made to our nation's development, to our democracy and, most importantly, to the nurturing and caring of this wonderful land that we call Australia.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2013-02-26,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (18:18):  The coalition is committed to full and complete recognition of our Aboriginal people in our society. We do acknowledge that prior to white settlement—now more than 200 years ago—the land we now call Australia was inhabited by Indigenous people. It was thought that these people most likely came from Indonesia—after all, there was a land bridge to Indonesia many thousands of years ago—and even possibly from India, because I gather there are some similarities in blood groups and so on between the Aboriginal people and the Indians. Interestingly, in trying to understand where the Aborigines came from, there are very old cave paintings in the Kimberley called the Bradshaws which, according to some people, resemble African paintings and raise the interesting possibility that in the long-distant past people of African origin could have come to the north-west of Australia.


Of course, it was the landing of the First Fleet in 1788 which brought the first wave of European culture to Australia on the east coast and the first settlements. However, it is interesting that in the Gascoyne district in the mid-west of Western Australia, where Carnarvon is now located, many of the Aboriginal languages include Dutch words, and the numbers of red-headed Aboriginals in the area rather suggest that they may have been descended from Dutch sailors wrecked on the cliffs around Carnarvon. The Dutch ships came around the Cape of Good Hope and sailed east towards the Australian coast before turning north to go to Batavia, which is now Jakarta, in the Dutch East Indies, which are now Indonesia. There was quite a lot of significant contact between the Aboriginals of the mid-west coast of Western Australia and the Dutch and perhaps the Portuguese as well.


European culture, with its formal settlements and farms and keeping of crops and herds, was certainly at odds with the Indigenous way of life. Most Indigenous people were hunters and gatherers who wandered from place to place without set villages, and they did not keep herds or crops. They have been a part of Australian society, mostly on the periphery of Australian society, since the times of early settlement and well on into the 20th century. It has only been in the latter half of the 20th century that there has been any movement to have constitutional recognition of Indigenous people as part of the Australian society. In 1967 it became the route of the reconciliation process when there was a referendum to grant Aborigines the right to vote, to enfranchise Aborigines and to have this written into our Constitution. It was a Liberal Prime Minister, Harold Holt, who first paved the way to reconciliation with that historic move to enfranchise Aborigines. 


When I was a medical student I was a member of the University of Western Australia Liberal Club. Interestingly, the president then was someone who subsequently became a senator and, in fact, the Leader of the Liberal Party in this chamber—and that was Fred Chaney. I was the freshman committee member back in 1960, and at our first committee meeting he suggested that, rather than the Liberal club putting up all sorts of clever motions about great public issues, the Liberal club should perhaps choose a project and seek to achieve a specific outcome for that project as its activity for the year. Fred Chaney suggested that the university Liberal club look into what could be done to improve the status of Aborigines in our community. So we used to go out to a place near Midland, near the airport in Perth, called Allawah Grove—not very far out of Perth—where there was an Aboriginal community and discuss issues with the Aboriginal leaders there. I found it quite confronting—having come from a fairly ordinary middle-Australian family—to see drunken Aborigines, fights with broken bottles, people sometimes being very aggressive to women and so on and so forth, but that was what the Aboriginal community at Allawah Grove embodied.


Every year from 1960 to 1962 the UWA Liberal Club held a seminar about what could be done to improve the lot of Aborigines in Western Australian society. In the end, Fred Chaney again gave leadership in suggesting that the only way to make Aborigines matter to politicians in government was to give them the vote: to enfranchise them. At the 1962 seminar, held by the Western Australian University Liberal Club, the Minister for Native Affairs, as he was called—a Country Party minister—announced that the Western Australia government would give Aborigines the option to enrol to vote in state elections. That happened in 1962, five years before the federal referendum, and it was therefore an important step in the process of reconciliation with Aborigines and accepting them as members of our society.


Harold Holt instituted the referendum on Aborigines being enrolled to vote in 1967, and another Liberal Prime Minister—John Howard, in 1999—continued down the pathway of recognition of the role of Aborigines in our society when he attempted to introduce an important preamble to the Constitution to recognise Indigenous Australians. As we all know, the referendum on that preamble failed; we also know that, if we are to continue the process of reconciliation with our Indigenous people, we need to build a real consensus in the community.


My first real contact with the Aboriginal community occurred when I went to the Pilbara in 1974. I used to see Aboriginal patients at the Port Hedland Hospital outpatient department while I worked there. I always treated the Aborigines with great respect, and they responded with respect to me. Perhaps because of this mutual respect, in 1975 I was invited to an Aboriginal bush meeting on the banks of the Coongan River near Marble Bar. These bush meetings were held every quarter. Aborigines came to them from all over the Pilbara—including from the Western Desert and as far west as Onslow and the area around it—and the meetings were almost always held on the banks of a river. About 100 people were gathered, cooking under the trees on open fires, at the meeting I went to in Marble Bar, and to me it was a very eye-opening experience.


The meeting was chaired by a man whom I cannot name because he is since deceased. He was the chief Aborigine of the Pilbara. He sat at a table in the middle of a clearing with tables on either side of him, at which sat his white advisers from Perth and Canberra, including lawyers and people who knew about the social security system, housing, education and so on. This chief Aborigine was a very impressive person: he had a great mane of white hair and a stetson on his head, and he controlled the meeting very skilfully. Not everybody had the ability to present a case very clearly, and he was very gentle in drawing out the points the people wanted to make—everybody had the right to raise any issue they wanted to—and in arranging for translators for the desert Aborigines who attended the meeting. By the end of the day, my perception of Aboriginal people in the Pilbara had changed completely. Whereas before I had seen them as people who did not really understand our society, I realised that these people well and truly understood our society and how our system of government worked.


I have met many other Aboriginal leaders, such as Peter Yu in the Kimberley, who was the head of the Kimberley Land Council; and people like Joe Ross in Fitzroy Crossing, who is the leader of the 300, I think, Aboriginal communities in the Fitzroy River Valley—and they are very impressive people. These are, of course, Aboriginal people in the north, close to their origins. But I understand that these days around 85 per cent of Aboriginals live in big cities and towns—Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and the big towns of Queensland, New South Wales, WA and South Australia. Many of them have jobs, many of them are educated—increasingly, there are large numbers of Aboriginal graduates—and they simply fit into our society as members of our society.


I think it is now very appropriate that we do recognise that the Indigenous people were here first and that that fact is acknowledged in our Constitution. It does not necessarily mean that it carries any particular implications in terms of additional rights and benefits above those which any other Australians have, but I think it is appropriate that that kind of recognition be given.


This bill is not a token gesture. It is an important building block of unity and of recognition of the long history of Aboriginal people in Australia and will carry a message of all of our community, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, migrants from all over the world as well as those Australians whose history goes back 40,000 years, that we are moving forward as one people in one country. I support this bill.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2013-02-26,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (18:31):  I thank Senator Eggleston for that very interesting history lesson. There are fascinating perspectives that we all have about what we are debating here today—a really important issue, in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012.


Just a few weeks ago, coinciding with the fifth anniversary of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's apology to the Stolen Generations, this bill was presented, debated and passed in the House of Representatives, recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as the first inhabitants of Australia. I am very proud to speak as part of the group of speakers contributing to this debate in the Senate. So often a debate can happen in the House of Representatives, where all the publicity and discussion is reported upon; but, of course, we know the legislation then comes here—so it is timely that this is a week when the House of Representatives is not sitting, and perhaps the contributions to the debate in this chamber will actually get some coverage in the media as well and continue the message of the importance of the legislation that is in front of us.


I want to congratulate people who have contributed to the debate, because we have heard the passion that has been brought to the debate by all sides of politics and all sides of the parliament. People bring their own perspectives and their own experiences about how they have interacted with Indigenous peoples. If you ask someone like those of us who have actually lived in and worked with Aboriginal communities, you will know that there is so much that remains to be done in terms of addressing Aboriginal disadvantage; but you will also know the importance of the bill that is before us today.


Constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples generally does have support and is seen by many as an important further step that should now be taken towards full recognition of the unique place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in 21st century Australian society. It is really interesting that we are having a conversation now that is so different from the conversation that was held in 1999. Senator Thistlethwaite remarked on the failure of the referendum in 1999 and the fact that we cannot afford to fail again to have this constitutional recognition agreed upon.


Prime Minister Gillard has called the legislation before us an 'act of preparation and anticipation', because it is an important step on the way towards a referendum for constitutional change; it seeks to foster the momentum for a referendum—so many of us here have talked about the importance of building the consensus, of building the momentum. It is one thing to have politicians and parliamentarians supporting this constitutional reform; it is a very big thing for us to take the Australian people down this path with us.


I said before that in 1999 the conversation and the debate were very different. When I talk to young people about the importance of this piece of legislation, they just cannot fathom why this could be the situation now. They cannot believe that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are not recognised in the Constitution, so we actually have a huge job to educate voters across Australia about the importance, the significance, of the change that we are trying to engender.


The bill before us today is essentially a parliamentary statement that recognises some facts of our history that have never been formally acknowledged before—the fact that Australia was first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; the fact that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a continuing relationship with their traditional land and waters; and the fact that their continuing cultures, languages and heritages are worthy of respect. When the Prime Minister spoke of this bill as a gesture, and a sign of good faith, she too was acknowledging that there is still a long way to go.


I was pleased that Senator Siewert, who is here in the chamber, talked about the importance of the sunset clause that is in this bill. That is what gives us the time frame in which this work should be carried out; it gives us a sense of urgency. This not something that is on the never-never. There is a definite time frame, one that sets us a very ambitious goal but a goal that we know that we can achieve. The expert panel that was appointed to investigate the issue highlighted the importance of this. It recommended a series of constitutional changes and made it very clear that bipartisan agreement would be necessary before those recommendations could be put to a referendum for exactly the reason that Senator Thistlethwaite raised: referendums in Australia do not have a very strong history of success. Constitutional change is quite difficult here in Australia. It can only be done if we have a majority of votes in every state and territory. The work that needs to be done across state and territory governments and in the community is really very critical.


What we need—the point of contention—is a non-discrimination provision in the Constitution. At the moment, that is the problem. The opposition regards a non-discrimination provision as akin to a bill of rights and will not agree to move in that direction. But that does not mean that the cause is lost. There is so much goodwill on all sides. We are all charged with the responsibility to represent the people of Australia and we should not expect that to be easy in this case. The challenge facing all of us—and the next parliament as well—is to find a form of words that is going to satisfy all sides of politics and to make this constitutional reform something that we can all be very proud of.


Today, I read a post on Eureka Street by Father Frank Brennan about this bill congratulating both government and opposition members for their contributions to the debate in the House of Representatives. He made a really important point. He said that a new generation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders were gathered in the public gallery for the passage of the legislation, with many of the leaders from earlier campaigns over the Northern Territory land rights legislation, Mabo, Wik, native title and reconciliation. There was a group of young people ready to take up the challenge and become the leaders most actively engaged in the discussions that we are going to be part of.


They all then went to the National Press Club where two of those young people, two emerging leaders, spoke. They were fantastic. Those young people were Tanya Hosch and Jason Glanville. Each spoke very proudly of their diverse heritage. I would like to read a little of what Tanya had to say, because it puts this into context. She said:


I was blessed to be raised in a family that is a model for the kind of nation I want Australia to be. A family where race isn't a divide, but an enricher ... that is proud of the many strands of its heritage, and particularly of our Indigenous heritage ... that integrates the best of all of our traditions and cultures, and which has nurtured me to play a part in bringing about this big moment in the life of our nation.


Her speech was very powerful. I recommend it to you all.


Then Jason Glanville went on to tell the story of how his great-grandmother left the mission with her two-year-old child to go to Cootamundra and build a home. This is what he said:


In the Cootamundra Town Hall, where once my great grandmother was barred from being able to vote, a stained glass window now hangs. It's a picture story. In it, she is telling bedtime stories to her grandchildren in the language of their ancestors. The town that once excluded this amazing Aboriginal woman has now immortalised her remarkable story. At long last, it has recognised her, and regards her story as a source of pride. It's time our Constitution did too.


That generational change is important in the debate that is ahead of us all. Father Brennan made the point, as many speakers have, that there is much work to be done if the referendum is to get up in the next parliamentary term and that we have a responsibility as elected members of parliament to engage Australians in understanding what constitutional recognition means, not just for Indigenous Australians but for all of us. In the wake of the national apology, there is a new generation of Indigenous Australians able to show us the way, and I very much look forward to working with them.


I want to congratulate everyone who has got us to this position. It is an issue whose time has come. This is political work at its best. It is the work that we all enjoy the most: the people's representatives putting their minds and experience to work to together create the Australia that people want to live in. I have no doubt that we will reach a satisfactory form of words. We will debate the matter robustly, I am sure. We will hold a referendum. That is the right thing to do. It will be a milestone along the route I want this country to take in the interests of human rights and of the dignity of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2013-02-26,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales) (18:43):  I acknowledge the words of many of the previous speakers in the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 in this chamber. In many cases, they have made compelling and salient points about the importance of this piece of legislation. I want to say from the outset from a personal perspective that I very strongly support the bill and support the constitutional recognition for our first peoples that this bill will, with the passage of time and much more debate in this nation, hopefully bring about. I am confident that with cross-parliamentary agreement and with cross-political support, we can realise this objective to give our first peoples recognition that they absolutely deserve.


Just briefly, the coalition has a long and proud history of advocating for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal Australians.


With other senators from this chamber who have both spoken in this debate—Senator Siewert and Senator Thistlethwaite—I attended a recent Recognise event here in Canberra just two weeks ago, held in conjunction with GHD and Carey engineering, at which these issues were much discussed. I want to commend the work of Recognise—the organisation that was formerly known as You Me Unity. The work they are doing now and the work they will do for some years into the future in relation to the question of constitutional recognition is very important. It is important that it is community based, it is important that it is community networked and it is important that it is recognised as such.


Recognise itself is part of Reconciliation Australia. As was recommended by the expert panel report, it was given the very fundamental task of raising awareness amongst community members and building community support for the constitutional recognition of Australia's first peoples. To date they have worked extremely diligently to promote the cause to Australians. Their activities include but are by no means limited to recruiting over 125,000 Australians who are supporting this recognition, holding street stalls in every major capital city, spreading the message to thousands of Australians in that way, and funding over 100 community groups to run public awareness campaigns of their own. They have generated media coverage across print, radio, television and online platforms, and they have developed a schools kit that was distributed to every high school in the country.


I think the work of Recognise matches well with the longstanding commitment of the coalition to bring this issue to a referendum and to gain the necessary support to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution. As other speakers have indicated and as the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, did in his contribution to the second reading debate earlier today, it was the coalition government that was responsible for the historic 1967 referendum, with a result of just over 90 per cent in that case. That was a watershed achievement in this country. It received support from all sectors of the community and political parties of all colours. As I mentioned at the Recognise event the other week, who could forget the black and white photographic images of young campaigners like Shirley Peisley pinning their 'vote yes for Aborigines' badge onto the suit jacket of Senator Reg Bishop on that referendum day? I suspect there will be many more similar photographs—but in colour—across social media of all forms and in traditional forms of media to mark the progress of this bill and ultimately a referendum as well.


They have a huge impact. To actually meet Shirley Peisley, as we did on that occasion at AIATSIS recently, and to compare her smiling face with that seen in the photograph from 1967, and to think that she and members of her generation are in a position of still waiting for this next step, is actually quite confronting—for me personally, at least. As I think Senator Stephens alluded to, when you discuss it with young Australians—and, as desperate as I might be to include myself in that group, I am not completely delusional!—and they say, 'How is it possible that we are at this point and this next step has not been taken?' and then to be able to see that photograph from 1967, to meet Shirley Peisley today and to know that with the will of an Australian community united together on this issue she will be able to see that next step is a particularly important thought that I hold as we continue these discussions.


As I said, on that day just over 90 per cent of Australian citizens voted yes in the referendum. I want to see that extraordinarily positive result repeated, preferably exceeded. But we must work together to get this particular process right, to get the question right and to ensure that, above everything else that we put before us, we ensure that it is indeed a unifying moment for the nation. This is not something with which to take political risks. It is not something with which to play political games. It is in fact a very serious engagement by the Australian people as the referendum process, which is outlined in part in this bill, continues.


The current proposal for Aboriginal reconciliation came initially from the coalition, who first raised it in 1999, when the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, penned and advanced the preamble, which was considered at the 1999 referendum.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (18:51):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


This is the Fair Work Australia general manager's report into the extent to which individual flexibility arrangements are agreed to and the content of those arrangements. The coalition welcomes this report. The coalition has been supportive of the concept of individual flexibility agreements.


It will be recalled that the Labor government developed a policy called Forward with Fairness in which they initially simply ruled out Australian workplace agreements. Because of the reaction from the community the Labor Party at that time came back with a remodelled and refocused Forward with Fairness document promising individual flexibility agreements.


We believe that is a very important part of the makeup of any modern workplace relations system: that there be the opportunity for workers and their employers to get together and work out relevant individual flexibility arrangements that suit both their needs. It is common sense and it is indicative of the different nature of family responsibilities these days and also the needs of various workplaces.


It would be fair to say that the government has not necessarily been as embracing of individual flexibility arrangements as they should be. They did not include it in their first version of Forward with Fairness and they reluctantly put it into their second version and then designed a system that we believe was basically designed to fail.


In relation to individual flexibility agreements it will be recalled that they can be unilaterally terminated on either party giving 28 days notice. So, if a female employee, for example, seeks to have a flexibility arrangement to cater for her child-care needs, the boss, with 28 days notice, can simply cancel the agreement. Good luck to the lady employee seeking to get alternative child care arrangements in place within 28 days. Indeed, the example given in the explanatory memorandum to the bill was that of Josh, a gym instructor, who might want to coach his son's soccer team. Well, the soccer season goes for longer than 28 days. Therefore, if Josh did want to coach his son's soccer team and get involved in an individual flexibility agreement, there would be no guarantee for Josh that he could see out the soccer season. As a result, he could not make that commitment.


The highly skewed terms of reference and the mates who were appointed to the review of the Fair Work Act were mugged by the reality that this 28-day period of notice for unilateral termination was inappropriate, and they recommended a 90-day period. Mr Shorten has that report; the government has that report. They have already introduced the first tranche of amendments to the Fair Work Act pursuant to the review. The simplest amendment they could make is to delete 28 and insert 90 to require an employer or employee to give 90 days notice, thus providing greater certainty. But Mr Shorten is unwilling to make that amendment and one has to ask why. The reason is that they were never committed to individual flexibility agreements in the first place. They wanted them to fail. They basically have failed. They have not been taken up as they should have been, and the reason is that the termination period, especially, is so short and limited that it does not make it worthwhile.


Further, the individual flexibility arrangements are not well known. Indeed, most workers find out through their boss or they hey find out through the public. But, regrettably, they have not known about it through their union bosses, which is something I would encourage union bosses to do in the future. (Time expired)

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2013-02-26,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:56):  I would like to speak on this document. I heard Senator Abetz waxing lyrical about individual flexibility agreements, and I could not help myself but come and present some balance to the argument that the coalition put every time they talk about flexibility.


Workers around the country know that when the coalition talk about flexibility they mean giving more power to the employer. They mean taking rights away from ordinary workers and providing the boss with even more control over the lives of ordinary workers. That cannot be denied, because the coalition are not only on the record on this issue but also have actually practised their ideology on workers. Their ideology is to say to a worker, 'You will go to work, you will be scared of your employer, you will do what your employer tells you to do, and if the employer wants flexibility that is what you will give them.' That is what Work Choices was all about. Whenever you hear Senator Abetz talking about flexibility, don't listen to the code; listen to exactly what it means. It actually means that they want to go back to what their DNA is all about, and that is ripping away at the rights of workers in this country.


There is no doubt that flexibility is the thin end of the wedge for Senator Abetz and his team to move back to Work Choices. Let's make no bones about it. Work Choices is what Senator Abetz is about when he talks about flexibility. I happened to have been a union official during the Work Choices era and I know what Work Choices was about. I know what individual flexibility was about. It was pitting an individual worker against an employer. Some employers were small and some were big, but it does not matter to an individual worker, because whether you work for a small employer or a big employer the power relationship lies clearly with the employer.


When you talk about a worker having the right to give 28 days notice to get out of some kind of flexibility agreement, that takes a great deal of courage if the employer says, 'I don't want you out of that flexibility agreement; come into my office and sit down with me and we'll talk about it.' This could be a migrant female worker having to sit down with a tertiary educated employer to try and negotiate a flexibility agreement. You know what that means. The power relationship between that migrant female worker and the tertiary educated employer results in that worker getting the rough end of the pineapple. They get the problems to deal with.


It is absolutely clear that the coalition are on the move again to run up Work Choices. They will change the name; they will try and say it is fairer; they will tell us they have learnt their lessons; they will tell us it is dead and buried—but it is only the name that is dead and buried. Work Choices underpins exactly what the coalition want to do. If they ever get the opportunity again to have control of the Senate, that is what we will have. All the denials in the world will mean nothing. They will rip away at workers' penalty rates; they will rip away at shift allowances; they will rip away at leave entitlements—and it will all be under the guise of flexibility. So don't come here and parade your flexibility promises, because flexibility is bad news for workers in the context of coalition policies.


We are about building a smart industry, not an industry where, in the guise of flexibility, workers are under the thumb of the boss. Flexibility is simply shorthand for Work Choices and ripping rights away from workers.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-02-26,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (19:02):  I have been waiting for the opportunity to follow ex-union boss Senator Doug Cameron in a debate such as this. I want to refer to an article in the Australian Financial Review of 16 November 2012. I notice Senator Cameron is leaving the chamber. I say to Senator Cameron in his absence: it is probably appropriate that you do leave, because you would not like what Grace Collier, the chief executive of Australian Dismissal Services, said in this article in the Australian Financial Review that I refer to tonight. She said:


After … 20 years' experience working in unions and as an industrial relations consultant, I feel well placed to make observations about the union movement.


Being employed in the union movement isn’t like working in a company. It can be a bit like working for a cult. All unions are different, but union officials … see themselves as soldiers in the war of labour versus capital, and to fight a war you need resources. In this environment, the group think is this: anything improper can be justified as proper when it is for ""the good"". Union troops know that breaking the law is sometimes required because when a law is ""unjust"" you have a ""duty"" to ignore it. Civil disobedience is okay if the end justifies the means.


I do not have a great deal of time today, and I do want to hear my leader speak on other matters related to this very important topic, but this is a great article. It goes through some of the ways the union movement operates. I do not want to involve you in this, Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, but I see in the newspaper that you are running afoul of the union movement at the present time. Senator Kim Carr, who is in the chamber, well knows about this, because there is a man embedded in the union. You only have to look at Mr Craig Thomson to understand what unionists think: if you have to break the law, it is all good for the ultimate goal. If you look at what Mr Thomson did in relation to—or, sorry, is alleged to have done, I should say—




Senator Abetz:
  No, they were findings by Fair Work Australia.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Senator Abetz: they were findings by Fair Work Australia—and who could argue with that august body! They found that Mr Thomson grossly misused union funds. I say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I am absolutely certain that Mr Craig Thomson was not the only union leader ever involved in that sort of activity.


This article from Grace Collier makes very good reading, from what I would call an insider in the union movement. She went on to say:


In the 1990s, the aura around Bruce Wilson of the Australian Workers Union was such that he was touted as a future prime minister.


You will remember that Mr Bruce Wilson, whom I am talking about, is the guy involved in the slush fund affair which has engulfed Ms Gillard. The article continued:


Our Prime Minister made a decision to begin a relationship with him. Partners of law firms don't recommend having relationships with people who work in their clients' businesses. It is not considered appropriate to put yourself in a potentially compromising position. The worst can happen, and for our Prime Minister it did. Now we find ourselves in the position we are in today.


This was at the height of the Gillard-Wilson scandal over Slater and Gordon and the slush fund. Ms Collier went on to say:


Over the past 11 years, I have been called upon to investigate many people for workplace misconduct. The hardest people to investigate are high-achieving, high-profile women executives. Their starting position is always a haughty refusal to answer questions or participate in investigations they consider beneath them.


I might say that I am quoting from a woman journalist who is an insider in the union movement. She continued:


Next they attempt to retain control by trying to impose their conditions and time frames on the investigation. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2013-02-26,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:07):  I cannot allow the comments of Senator Cameron in this place this evening to go unchallenged. It is disappointing that a person who comes into this place and represents the people of Australia has got such a jaundiced and narrow view of the relationships between employers and employees.



Senator Carol Brown interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  Acting Deputy President Bishop, I have been an employer for 35 years or so in both the private and the public sectors, and I can assure you—and I can assure Senator Brown through you—that very rarely are the interests of the employee and the interests of the employer not closely aligned, because if they are not closely aligned it comes at the demise of everybody in the organisation.


I would say with some pride that I have been successfully negotiating agreements in both public and private sector organisations. In the case of the public sector, the emergency services organisation of which I was the CEO and had great pride in administering was an organisation of great complexity, an organisation involving staff at very different levels in the city, in the regions and in different sectors of the emergency services. As a result of good negotiation, as a result of consultation, as the result of mature communication, we were successful in arranging that agreement. It stood for some years and it stood very successfully. I will not sit here and listen to Senator Cameron going on in this jaundiced way as if every relationship between every employer and every employee in some way or other reflects his view of the world.


The second case that I wish to refer to was when I had the pleasure of operating a fuel distributorship in the state of Tasmania. I was successful, after some period of time, in negotiating an agreement with all of my fuel drivers. I believe that at that time it was the first agreement of its type that was actually negotiated in Australia. It ended up tremendously to the benefit of those drivers. It also, incidentally, ended up tremendously beneficial to my company, and we had to fight the TWU right through to the Industrial Relations Court in Hobart before common sense prevailed, because the alternative, unfortunately, was not a good option for either me, my company or indeed the drivers themselves. It led to tremendous flexibility for the drivers. It led to me investing several million dollars in a new trucking fleet. It led to a revolution in not only the way in which fuel was distributed in Tasmania but also the safety of the vehicles and of course, therefore, the safety of the wider community.


I do not intend to go on much longer. I was not intending to speak. But this is the Senate of Australia. This is the place in which we have robust debate, and this should be the place in which we have reasoned discussion in which we can share views and come to some commonality. While Senator Cameron comes into this place again and again and preaches the bile that he does, we are never going to receive that particular unanimity.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2013-02-26,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (19:10):  On the same matter, I am very disappointed that Senator Back seems to think that a senator who has a long history of working and protecting workers' rights somehow has a view that is jaundiced. The opposition completely miss the mark when it comes to workplace relations. They do so because they themselves come from a position that is jaundiced—that is, first of all, they forget that Work Choices was voted out. There was a reason for that. That reason was that it was demonstrably unfair to workers. It shifted the balance in the workplace. There was no balance. It all went to employers.


Nobody in this chamber would suggest that all employers would be doing the wrong thing. Nobody would suggest that. Senator Cameron was merely pointing out—and it is of course a fact that he has a long history of protecting workers and looking after and advocating for workers' rights and conditions—the unfair relationship between an employer and an employee. I heard what Senator Back had to say. He was himself an employer, and I am sure he was a very fair one. He believes that to be so and I will take him on that. But he is not the only one who has an intimate knowledge about employers. I myself come from a position where I have an intimate knowledge of the employment relationship.


There is no way in most cases that there is a balanced relationship between employers and employees, and Work Choices shifted that relationship. The Australian public did not agree with the coalition on Work Choices. It stripped away wages, it stripped away entitlements, it stripped away conditions of ordinary working Australians, and it was voted out. The coalition was voted out. There was an overwhelming mandate for the Australian Labor Party to abolish Work Choices. This is what we are talking about here. This is what Senator Back was talking about.


So I suggest that when people want to come in here and talk about their position and debate in an argument, that is fine. But one of the things that you should not do is something Senator Macdonald is a master at. He is always playing the person, playing the senator, and it is always some personal diatribe that comes out against people. But it should be about the debate and it should be about the facts that we put forward here. I was a bit taken aback because Senator Back does not normally come out and try to strip pieces off individual senator; he does not normally play that game. But Senator Cameron and many other senators in this place have long and proud histories of working for unions and they have worked to protect workers, and they are proud of it. I am very proud of the strong trade union movement that we have here in Australia.


I am a member of the union. I have never been a union official, but I am a member of the union, and I am very proud of it. I was very supportive of the Work Choices campaign that was undertaken to see the defeat of the coalition and the abolition of Work Choices. That is what the Australian public wanted, that is what they voted for, and that is what the Labor government gave them. In finishing up, I would just suggest that when we do have these debates we try to keep to the facts of the matter, and the facts are that Work Choices was comprehensively voted out. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2013-02-26,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (19:20):  Tonight I want to speak about the recent devastating bushfires that hit Tasmania, and southern Tasmania in particular, which is where I have spent the most time recently. There was a fire on the Tasman Peninsula which destroyed 203 dwellings and 212 other structures. It left 100 businesses directly impacted and 150 indirectly impacted. Overall it burnt out a combined area of over 40,000 hectares which were devastated. The fire on the Tasman Peninsula was in the areas around Dunalley, Murdunna, the Arthur Highway, Boomer Bay and Connelly's Marsh, and Dunalley Primary School was also destroyed. It not only left many people's houses destroyed but also left 1,000 residents stranded.


This fire was followed shortly after by a fire south of Bicheno on the east coast which forced some residents to shelter in the Bicheno Community Hall. The bushfire season has continued throughout February with fires at Molesworth and Gretna. Some fires are still burning but, I understand, as of today they are under control, so that is some good news. While the Molesworth fire burnt 19,000 hectares and distributed a pall of smoke over Hobart for several days, it is a miracle that no houses were destroyed there.


I live some 15 to 20 minutes drive south of Hobart, which is at least 45 to 55 minutes drive south of the area, and ash was over my outdoor setting. There was a lot of ash and smoke in the air for a number of days.


But tonight I want to put on record my thanks to some of the very many volunteers in a range of areas who came to people's assistance and who still continue to support the people of Tasmania who have suffered in whatever way from these bushfires. It is a great credit to our emergency service agencies—Tasmania Police, the SES and the Tasmanian Fire Service—that despite the scale of the disaster not a single life has been lost as a direct result of the fires.


Regrettably, there was one indirect casualty. Peter Cramer, one of 65 Victorian firefighters who came to Tasmania to assist our fire services, suffered a fatal heart attack while walking through the bush to identify possible containment lines. I would like to pass on my condolences and also those of Senator Brown, who is in the chamber at the moment, to his family. It was great that firefighters throughout Australia and even from New Zealand could come to our aid.


While any death is tragic, it is a credit to firefighters such as Mr Cramer that the outcome was not much worse. The Australian and Tasmanian governments have been working hard together to provide support for people affected by these fires. Immediately after the disaster we enacted the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. These included providing financial assistance to people affected through Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments and deploying Centrelink staff to recovery centres to assist with the claims process.


The Tasmanian government has committed to rebuilding Dunalley Primary School and has acted quickly to establish a temporary school, made up of demountable classrooms, in time for students to commence school at the beginning of the first term. The news items around those young children at Dunalley Primary School were quite heart-warming for people to see. They were so keen and excited to have a school there. A great deal of credit should go to the Dunalley Primary School Association, particularly their chair, Elizabeth Knox, not only for working hard to secure the commitment to get the school up and running but for the well-organised appeal to secure the materials they need, such as books and stationery, to make sure the school is operating at full capacity, as it was from the beginning of this school year.


Tonight, as I said, I would like to pay tribute to some of the very many volunteers who have so generously given their time to the bushfire response and to the very many generous donors who have contributed to the relief effort.


Obviously, some of our most dedicated volunteers during a fire emergency are the volunteer firefighters. To give you a brief picture of how heavily the Tasmania Fire Service relies on its volunteer brigades, there are about 400 professional firefighters employed by the service and about 4,000 volunteers. During major incidents, volunteer firefighters spend hours away from their friends and family, often performing difficult and dangerous work. They do this in their own time and the only reward they receive for their efforts is the pleasure of having served the community.


Similar praise should also go to our volunteers from the State Emergency Service. Many volunteers were really integral to the relief effort, such as those who worked long shifts at the Hobart Showground. They packed and sorted donated goods for St Vincent de Paul to go to people in fire-affected areas.


As the Tasman Highway was closed for many days, volunteers were also relied on to ferry food and goods to stranded Tasman Peninsula residents by boat. Nothing could get through via the roads at all and so people with small craft were volunteering, taking food, basic necessities and goods across.


Dunalley Neighbourhood House worked hard to provide much-needed services to affected residents, such as hot showers and internet access. I would like to pay credit to the Coordinator of the Dunalley Neighbourhood House, Yve Earnshaw. They were able to respond really promptly to the needs of the community.


Regular meals were served to hundreds of residents sheltering at the Port Arthur Historic Site, thanks to the efforts of staff and volunteers. Organisations such as the RSPCA, the Dogs' Homes of Tasmania and Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary provided food, shelter and other assistance to domestic animals and wildlife.


I am also aware of lawyers who have provided pro bono legal assistance to people affected by the fires. Scouts Tasmania collected, and is still collecting, fencing materials for the charity BlazeAid, which recruits volunteers to mend fences of fire-damaged rural properties.


I have spoken previously in this place about the generous volunteers I have met from Rotary and Timber Communities Australia. Some of them previously travelled to Victoria to rebuild fences following the 2009 fires, and some of those volunteers will be travelling to Tasmania to repay that favour.


One volunteer I would particularly like to recognise is Melanie Irons, who set up and maintained the Facebook page 'Tassie Fires—We Can Help' as a central information repository for people offering or seeking assistance. The page now has over 20,000 followers. 


Of course, the bushfire relief effort would not exist without a generous financial contribution from the community. Red Cross, the Salvos, Rotary and Lions have all established bushfire appeal funds. A separate fund has been established by the Tasmanian Department of Education for donations to Dunalley Primary School. As a Rotarian, I am pleased to announce that Rotary International has raised $131,000 for the relief effort.


With the help of my parliamentary colleagues—and two of them are here at the moment—Senator Brown and Senator Thorp, along with the member for Franklin, Julie Collins, I was really pleased to assist the Snug District Disaster Appeal Committee. This committee held a community event to raise funds for the Tasmanian Bushfire Appeal. The small town of Snug is very dear to me. I grew up in the little town next door to Snug and, in the 1967 bushfires, both Margate—where I was born and bred and where I spent the early years of my life—and Snug were just about decimated.


Coming out of this, the local Snug community set up a disaster appeal committee. They do not run all the time but they reinvigorate the committee whenever there is a disaster that they can help out with. That is the community's way of helping pay back the rest of Tasmania for the effort that they put in way back in 1967. They had a gala day, with a cricket match, a silent auction, a raffle, a barbecue, some live music and various other activities including car boot sales and face painting. I had a great day. I was not going to stay for the whole day but I did and I had a great time. They raised over $7,000, which I think, for a small community, was a great effort.


Trivia nights also appear to be a popular way to raise funds, and I am going to run out of time to mention everything that has happened. There have been hundreds of fundraising appeals, but one special one was held just a couple of weeks ago and it was attended by celebrities such as MasterChef contestant Ben Milbourne, cricketer Ed Cowan and members of the Hawthorn Football Club. I would like to thank the organisers—Kirilly Crawford, Carla Johnson and Olivia Shekleton—for raising $11,000. All of that money has been donated to the Dunalley Primary School. (Time expired)
