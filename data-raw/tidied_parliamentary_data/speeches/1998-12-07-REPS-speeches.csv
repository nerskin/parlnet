"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the Republic of Korea and Malaysia, 4 July to 19 July 1998, and seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report.
Leave granted.
—The delegation came at a time of some turmoil in the Asian region. It came at a time when there was uncertainty about an election date here in Australia. If I could just dwell on that in the first instance, the delegation had a slightly chequered preparation because of changes to the membership of the delegation, but it was not until we arrived in the two host countries that we understood the degree of uncertainty there had been about the delegation even occurring. Can I say that it is the delegation's earnest desire that in future all arrangements should continue in the belief that a delegation will in fact occur.
As I said, in both the Republic of Korea and Malaysia the effect of the Asian economic downturn has been felt most severely. In the Republic of Korea, through the international financial institutions, a degree of certainty has been returning to the economy. But, as noted in the delegation's report, in the nearly five months now since the delegation, much has happened.
I believe that when Australian parliamentary delegations visit countries they should endeavour to meet with the widest range of people from the host nation. Therefore, especially from where I come in the political spectrum, I have always felt that amongst those we should meet are members of trade unions. In the case of Korea, the public images that come across in the media are of great industrial disruption occurring from time to time. But we must, importantly, put that in 
 context, because even I have to admit that the coverage of organised labour organisations in Korea is only of a minority of workers—but they hold coverage in key areas. I believe it was important that we met not only with people from the business sector but also with elected officials and people from organised labour.
Importantly, the Republic of Korea set up a tripartite commission to see its way through its economic difficulties. We were confronted with headlines such as `Hyundai Motors to lay off 4,830 workers', `Hyundai workers protest lay-offs' and `R&D expenditure to drop 10 per cent this year'. They are examples of some of the headlines we saw in Korean papers, so you can understand the types of decisions and discussions that were needed.
Another aspect of our visit to the Republic of Korea that we did not appreciate fully until we arrived was the fact that the National Assembly was having a dispute over the election of its speaker and vice-speaker. Their appointment was required under the constitution but had yet to occur. There had been the election and the installation in January of this year of President Kim Dae-Jung, but the Koreans had been going through a degree of political uncertainty since then. I would have to say that the former vice-speaker who hosted us, and members of the National Assembly, did so with great grace. They were able to give us an understanding of the difficulties confronting our fellow members of parliament in the Republic of Korea.
Since our return, we have seen in the Australian media the occupation, for a couple of weeks, of a Hyundai Motor assembly plant by protesting unionists. Through our visit to the plant, we gained an appreciation of the background leading to such events. Whilst we will never fully understand from such a short visit to a country, it is important that Australian parliamentarians be given the opportunity to get the type of background we were able to gain to ensure that in some way we are able to interpret events that occur.
When we moved on to Malaysia, we found that Malaysia was going through the same economic uncertainty but that it was handling 
 it in, perhaps, a different manner. But we could not have imagined the type of political uncertainty there at that time which has been exemplified by the events that have unfolded since we left.
We had the opportunity to visit the Commonwealth Games site. There were some 55 days to go before the games commenced. I think the delegation was quietly pleased that work obviously continued for those 55 days at a pace. I think the Commonwealth Games were a showcase for what Malaysia can achieve.
At the time we were there, the then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Anwar Ibrahim, spoke on the first day of the parliamentary sittings. In fact, he gave revised forecasts for the economy. Of course, over the last few months his fortunes have definitely changed, first with his dismissal as Deputy Prime Minister and then with the charges that he now confronts. We hope that the type of unrest that this has caused will lead to some positive outcomes. We hope that through the processes of the Malaysian judicial system he gets a fair and proper hearing because we believe it is important that Malaysia comes out of its present difficulties with the greatest degree of strength and stability possible.
The background that we have with both nations is very strong but it comes from a different base. Presently we are strong trading partners with Korea. We have historic links through Australia's involvement with United Nations forces. The demilitarised zone is one of those last bastions of a divide between a nation. We hope that the difficulties that South Korea and North Korea have faced for some 40 or 50 years can proceed to a conclusion. Whilst there is no great sign that that is just over the horizon, we understand that the Republic of Korea desires to see that and we hope it can be completed.
In the case of Malaysia, our background—through Australia and Malaysia being Commonwealth nations, our involvement as colleagues in defence forces and our important involvement as trading partners—gives us hope that the types of traditions we share will enable Malaysia to come out of its difficulties in the best possible way.
As has often been said, whilst we gather intelligence through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade—it can give good advice to government—there is great importance in parliamentarians being able not only to gather information but to make lasting contacts. This delegation had within it various degrees of experience with the two countries and we would have to acknowledge that that experience can only be enhanced by the continual contact, friendships and networking which are made possible by such visits. That is able to make us, as Australian parliamentarians, better equipped to be able to interpret events and ensure that where possible Australia can not only benefit from its relationships with countries but also assist without being seen to be assisting in a patronising way.
I would like to thank the members of the delegation for their assistance. One of the things that is perhaps not a criterion for putting together delegations is any sort of compatibility, and this was quite a diverse delegation. I acknowledge the honourable member for Aston, the honourable member for Bonython and Senator McKiernan from Western Australia, all members of the delegation. Three members of the delegation are no longer members of parliament—two voluntary and one involuntary—and I acknowledge the former member for Bendigo, Bruce Reid; the former member for Moore, Paul Filing; and the former member for Parkes, Michael Cobb. Each of those members I have mentioned made a valuable contribution on the basis of their experience and interest. I would especially like to thank Mr Reid, the deputy leader, who gave me a great deal of support.
Mr Speaker, you would realise that a successful delegation also relies on a very diligent and hardworking secretary. I would like to thank Gillian Gould not only for her efforts whilst we were away but for her efforts in the preparation for the delegation and for her great efforts in putting together the report of the delegation. We also thank those in the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Relations Office for their assistance. We thank the Department of Foreign Affairs, not only here but at the two missions. From time to time, the performance 
 of those people who assist us is patchy, but we acknowledge that we have had the ability to comment about those things and are satisfied that they are aware of our desires in that regard. We would, in the majority, thank them for their assistance. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Korea and Malaysia, July 1998</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1,speech
"Nugent, Peter, MP",LP,1998-12-07,"—I agree with the comments by the honourable gentleman from Scullin. Particularly, I add my thanks to the Parliamentary Relations Office, DFAT, the library and to the delegation secretary who indeed worked very hard. Often people do not understand how hard delegation secretaries have to work both pre and post and also during the visit. It is probably the most difficult job on the whole delegation, and Gillian Gould is to be commended.
I would also like to thank our hosts in both countries. Clearly, we arrived at a time when things were not easy for either of the parliaments. In Korea, as we have heard, they were still trying to elect a speaker, and in Malaysia attention was focused on matters other than visiting delegations. Nevertheless, we were made very welcome and, particularly in Korea, we had a wide-ranging and interesting set of appointments. I would like to thank the Korean Ambassador, his wife and all their staff and the high commission staff in Malaysia, who have a lot to do with making such visits successful.
I  was fortunate that I had had a visit on a delegation to Korea about six years prior to this visit and therefore I was able to make some comparisons over that period of time. I suppose the most striking thing to me was that when I went there six years ago it was at a time when many of those Asian economies, including Korea, were really revving up, and there was a feeling of confidence and pretty near full employment. They were really on the go. If you questioned or perhaps doubted some of the things that might have been going on you got a polite hearing but not a lot of response because they knew how it was all done and they were very successful; and who were we to question them, as that little country—quite important as we might have been to them, and little in the sense of population—stuck down in the bottom of the 
 Pacific? We could get on with our business, but they knew what they were doing.
It was very interesting on this occasion to find that both Korea and Malaysia were very much in the grip of the Asian economic crisis and confidence was largely gone in many of the people we met. The fact that we had been able to assist in a whole variety of ways—in Korea we had been one of the countries that had contributed to the IMF bailout—meant that we were much better received. We were acknowledged as having our economy in good order and as being able to provide not only money but expertise in a whole range of areas that would enable both Korea and Malaysia to get out of some of those difficulties.
It seemed to me in Korea, as we talked to ministers and various others, that they really were in some shell shock and were not equipped, because of lack of experience, to deal with some of the difficulties they were in in an economic sense. I remember specifically the Minister for Labour talking about their unemployment rate having gone from about two per cent to about seven per cent in fairly short order. He thought that in another six or nine months it would be back down to about two per cent. Of course, from everything we saw, that was unlikely to happen, and subsequent events have proved that it is going to get a lot worse for a lot longer before it actually gets better.
I think we have things to do in terms of not only providing some financial assistance but also providing some expertise. When we were there, I know there were some officials from our social security department helping them to actually put in place some procedures to help measure the rate of unemployment and to look at how they might be able to create some basic social security mechanisms. Large numbers of people had become unemployed in short order and there really is not the social security backup. The economy and the reaction to the economy obviously were major issues. A lot of our conversations were dominated by talk about the chaebols, the five large industrial conglomerates that had ruled the roost economically in Korea for so many years, which were finding that they were 
 having to adjust how they went about things somewhat.
We had a very interesting visit to the demilitarised zone, the border between North and South Korea. I had been there before, but I noticed that there were now a lot more physical and electronic devices in place than the previous time I had been there. Generally, the tensions on the border were perhaps not quite as great. As ever, the United States people and the Koreans there were in a very high state of readiness, but there were the first indications that maybe things were changing. As we know, the economy in North Korea is in a terrible state. There had been an instance where a donation of, I think, 500 cattle had gone into the North just a few weeks before. I understand a similar thing is to happen again. There was talk about a very attractive tourist area in the North being opened up for visitors or tourists from the South to go and have a look. So there were just the first cracks showing some rapprochement between the two sides.
We had a visit, as the previous speaker mentioned, to Hyundai in the south. I think it is important during these delegation visits that we get out of the capitals and do not just meet the officials but try and see some of the country, because I think you learn a lot more about the culture, attitudes and motivations of countries in that way. What has happened in Korea has had a negative impact on us, because it is one of our very largest export destinations, particularly for raw materials, and that is going to impact on us for some time to come.
I add in passing that in transit from Korea to Malaysia we stopped over very briefly in Hong Kong, purely as a logistical exercise. We flew into Hong Kong airport one week after it was opened and suffered the inevitable delays. We flew on to KL airport over the same weekend. That airport had been open for two weeks and we suffered its inevitable delays. But I have to say that, apart from those teething troubles, Hong Kong's new airport is just vast and the infrastructure is very impressive. KL's airport is also very impressive, and I would have to say that architecturally it is probably somewhat more 
 pleasing. It was interesting that in Hong Kong, which I had also previously visited, the economy clearly was in dire straits.
I have had a number of visits over the years to Malaysia and I have to say that, in comparison with a previous delegation I was on, I was disappointed at the level of access. We did not get access to as many ministers and senior ministers as in my previous experience, and I think that was a pity. As I say, it was probably that they were distracted doing other things. There are major problems in Malaysia with the economy, as we have heard regularly in our news. Most of the banks appear to be just about bankrupt, and they are putting in place a debt management structure for a central agency to take half the bad debts from the banks to try and manage their way out of it for many years to come. That is going to be a very difficult exercise.
Unemployment has become a major problem. Again, the mechanisms for measuring the impact of unemployment and the impact on social welfare are not strong and therefore they are difficult to measure, particularly as many of those who are unemployed are either official or unofficial migrant workers. We have read many stories about migrant workers being forcibly required to go back to the countries from which they came. That has become a major problem. We had a 24-hour visit to Penang and visited a number of industries there. Most of those industries, particularly the high-tech industries, were feeling the impact of the general recession.
We had briefly the opportunity to call on some Australian Defence Force personnel who are posted to Butterworth, and that was a very worthwhile exchange. I think it is important that parliamentary delegations overseas go out of their way to make sure that, if they are in an area where there are Australian Defence Force personnel, they make that contact. I know it helps the morale there, and I think it is important for us to get those briefings.
As has already been mentioned by the previous speaker, a lot has happened in the human rights area in Malaysia since we were there, particularly with the arrest and trial of Anwar Ibrahim—but more of that on another day. The problems in both Korea and Malay 
 sia are impacting on us. The Malaysian case is impacting on ASEAN and both cases are impacting on APEC. There is no question in my mind that such visits are very valuable because we learn a great deal—we make contacts and we get a lot more knowledge; such contacts and networks are very important. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Korea and Malaysia, July 1998</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1,speech
"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—by leave—I acknowledge the generosity of the Selection Committee in terms of the amount of time it gave to discussion of this delegation report. I also indicate that, as the honourable member for Aston and the delegation secretary would know, sometimes time management is not my greatest forte: hence I ran out of time and did not make a couple of the comments I wished to make. Firstly, I would like to thank the two spouses who accompanied the delegation—Mrs Carol Nugent and Ms Jackie McKiernan. They helped make sure that the delegation was as good-humoured as possible, despite the trials and tribulations that we had to confront. I hate, by admission, to indicate that I was against spouses travelling on delegations, but they did make a valuable contribution.
Finally, the delegation was unusual in that it was led by a member of the House of Representatives from the opposition party. I put on the record my thanks to former Speaker Halverson, who made the offer of that appointment in the first instance, and to former Speaker Sinclair for confirming the appointment. It was an attempt, in their eyes, to emphasise that these are parliamentary delegations and that, by virtue of my position as the second deputy speaker, I should be leader of the delegation. It might be seen as self-interest if I were to say positive things about that arrangement. Suffice it to say, I believe that, in the context of some countries, it is an appropriate gesture.
—Hear, hear!
—As I said, despite the diversity of the views contained in the wide-ranging backgrounds of the members of the delegation, I believe the delegation operated in Australia's national interest at all times. I believe the delegation shares my desire that both Korea and Malaysia come out of their 
 present domestic challenges strongly and positively, and that their relations with Australia endure and strengthen.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Korea and Malaysia, July 1998</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1,speech
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—I am pleased to rise today to introduce the Superannuation (Entitlements of Same Sex Couples) Bill 1998 into the House. Members of the 38th Parliament may recall that I first introduced this private members bill into the House in June of this year.
Both the ALP and the coalition in government have endeavoured to ensure that all individual workers and employers now contribute to superannuation schemes. Superannuation is becoming an increasingly important part of many employees' salary packages. Not only is this good retirement incomes policy but it is good policy for Australia's national savings as well.
Currently, however, gay and lesbian workers and their families are not receiving the same benefits from their superannuation contributions as other workers. Couples of the same sex in a relationship—and one that would be considered a de facto relationship if the partners were of opposite sexes—currently do not enjoy the same superannuation benefits as heterosexual couples, while making identical superannuation contributions.
The discrimination against these couples occurs in the following areas:
.	 on retirement of the contributor, refusal to pay a joint pension for the contributor and his or her same sex partner;
.	 on retirement of the contributor, refusal to pay a lump sum benefit in respect of a same sex partner;
.	 on the death of the contributor, refusal to pay death benefits to a same sex partner, either by reversionary pension or lump sum benefit;
.	 on the death of the contributor, failure to investigate or acknowledge the claim to dependency of a child of a same sex couple 
 when the contributor is not the biological parent of the child; and
.	 on the death of the contributor, payment of death benefits to the estate of the contributor rather than to the same sex partner as a dependant.
This discrimination is inconsistent with other Commonwealth and state legislation and international undertakings, and needs to be addressed as an issue of equity for Australian workers.
Allow me to put a human face to this problem. While in Melbourne meeting with the Victorian gay and lesbian rights lobby recently, I spoke with a gentleman by the name of Greg Brown. Greg and his partner, Robert Corva, had been in a relationship for over 10 years when Robert died in 1993. At that time, Robert had been employed by the Department of Defence for 17 years and was a contributor to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme.
After Robert's death, Greg was unable to gain access to his partner's superannuation entitlements. The case went to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in 1995, which found that although amendments to the Superannuation Act in 1992 had removed discrimination on the grounds of marital status, this did not apply to same sex couples.
Greg pursued the case to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which last month handed down its decision. The commissioner, Chris Sidoti, in declining Greg's complaint found that, while Greg had been treated unequally, the discrimination was legal under current legislation.
However, to his credit, Commissioner Sidoti has undertaken to examine the Superannuation Act in relation to its effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity in employment or occupation. I look forward to such an inquiry being carried out and urge HREOC to undertake it as soon as practicable.
Unfortunately, any inquiry will come too late for Mr Brown who has now pursued action as far as he is able to under the current law. It is tragic that people still grieving for their loved ones are having to take on battles 
 such as this in order just to achieve equal treatment.
I originally introduced this legislation after two years of unsuccessfully lobbying the government to introduce amendments to the act. On 25 May 1998, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Chris Miles—the former member for Braddon—wrote to me and stated that the government is not inclined to amend the superannuation legislation at this time. The former member for Braddon has gone but the discrimination stays. This case once again highlights the urgent need for reform and why the government must take action.
In closing, I would like to emphasise to members that this is not an issue about special rights for any particular group of workers; it is about equal rights for all. I am pleased that it will be seconded by the member for Melbourne Ports, who is committed to achieving results on this issue.
I urge all members of this House to support this bill in the strongest possible terms because it is about equity and justice for all, and the current discrimination should not be tolerated in Australian society in 1998. I seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum.
Leave granted.

"Nehl, Garry, MP",NP,1998-12-07,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 regrets that the action of the NSW Government in progressing the regional forest agreements for north-east and lower north-east New South Wales has forced the Commonwealth Government to withdraw funding of $40 million; and
(2)	 calls on the NSW Government to act with responsibility to protect the future of the forest industry.  

The forest industry of Australia in general, and New South Wales in particular, is very important. There has been a great number of problems over the last three years with the way the New South Wales government has proceeded with the handling and management of forestry and the other areas that are part of that. One area that has received no justice at all in what the New South Wales government has done is the group of people who have grazing interests in some limited areas of state forests. The apiarists who depend on putting their bees into state forests are now in trouble as well.
Unfortunately, in revoking this very large area of country, which is currently going to be taken out of the forest industry—and it has been recently announced that there may be another 380,000 hectares—the impact on many grazing families was totally ignored. Those who have no concern for the impact on those people say that they are only OPs—occupational permits—or permissive occupancies or annual leases and it is not recognised that many of the leases were purchased as special leases with a term attached. The grazier had the right to assume that, when that term expired—and a term could have been up to 20 or 40 years—if conditions had not been breached the lease would be renewed. That has always been the case. That was the expectation. As evidence of that, some leases have been in the one family for three or four generations and they form an important part of property management.
Even though the legislation has passed through the New South Wales parliament, clear mapping is still not available to identify all the affected leases in any accurate manner. This is just one example of how the New South Wales government has rushed ahead to try to lock up the forests to placate the Green environmentalists in advance of the election on 27 March next year. This is totally inexcusable and demonstrates a very clear contempt towards rural communities by the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government has proceeded unilaterally, knowing that the scientific data was not complete. That is absolutely inexcusable. Ground verification of area of mapping has not occur 
 red effectively to substantiate the accuracy of interpretation.
One of the major problems in this whole process, which has been going on now, as I said, for about three years, is that the socioeconomic data has not been completed and is only in draft form. How can you go ahead and make decisions without considering all of the impacts on people and communities? To do that you have to have all the socioeconomic data available in a form that is effective. At this point, the New South Wales government will probably not cooperate with the FRAMES data. It will be impossible to produce an impact statement on the effect on rural communities of people reliant on forest industries—beekeepers, graziers and so on.
The New South Wales government has been determined to lock up vast areas. And it is recorded that they will proceed with or without the Commonwealth. This is a typical display of the way rural New South Wales is treated arrogantly by the Carr Labor government. It has nothing to do with forests or the environment. It is a purely political decision made in an attempt to fulfil Bob Carr's dream of being re-elected in March.
Since 1996, 850,000 hectares have been locked away in wilderness in national parks—not based on any scientific assessment. As a result of the last round in 1996, graziers and farmers who had leases on forest areas actually lost paddocks which were used for growing turnips and potatoes. It is hardly as though those areas were forest areas.
It is widely believed that the remaining timber yield has been grossly overestimated. Meeting existing agreements will be impossible. This is where, of course, the $40 million that the Commonwealth has had to withdraw will be missed. Our remaining forest areas will be logged and flogged. Evidence of overcutting is already very clear in the area. This will give the Green movement every opportunity to once again attack the industry and sustainability. And that is the key word—we need to have sustainability in our forest areas. Australia is a very large land mass. It is a very large country. We have a situation where, instead of expanding our forestry and putting more and more land 
 under forests and making them available in the future for logging and sustainable and viable forest industries, we are just reducing our forestry. I find it very difficult to understand that attitude of mind and philosophy. Unlike iron ore, aluminium or coal, finite products which will eventually run out, forestry is the resource which is renewable. Forestry is the resource which you can farm and get your crop year after year after year.
The Department of Primary Industries and Energy contracted a consultancy group from Sydney called Rush, whose independent study found that 58 per cent of those who lost their jobs as a result of the forest decisions made by the New South Wales government have not found further employment. Thousands of workers have been put out of work by the New South Wales government's decisions. Rush also determined that only $4,000 on average was paid in redundancy payments—not the $20,000 average as continually suggested by the New South Wales government. The Commonwealth was left with little or no choice other than to withdraw the remainder of the FISAP funding. The Commonwealth contributed more than $19 million to ensure the outcome of the regional forests agreements was scientifically based and that the socioeconomic side was given fair weight in the decision making process.
But of course that has not happened. The New South Wales government has proceeded on its merry way, without consultation, and has decided to go ahead and reduce the quotas. I have two tables, one of which shows the current land tenures in forestry in the upper north-east region, the lower north-east region and the Eden region. I see the member for Eden-Monaro, who will be interested to see these tables. The other table shows the changes in wood supply.
I make the point that, in the upper north-east region, out of a total area of forested land of 3,910,000 hectares, 160,000 hectares of leasehold forested land are going to be wiped and those people will not be allowed to continue with the practices of grazing or beekeeping which they have carried out for generations. In the lower north-east region there are 5,790,000 hectares of forested area and the leased forested land is only 150,000 hectares. Out of all of those tenures, there would not be a great deal that the New South Wales government would lose from forestry if they allowed those who had the leases to continue with what they were doing. I seek leave to have the two tables incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.

—It is worth while noting that the New South Wales government and the Commonwealth government signed a scoping agreement to undertake the regional forest area process back in January 1996. An interim forest assessment process was concluded and announced in September of that year. Immediately on that announcement, the New South Wales government unilaterally reduced the level of timber quotas in that state by 35 to 40 per cent and declared extensive new national parks and wilderness areas. New South Wales also committed itself to future extensive areas of reserves in the RFA forest. I told the House, in a speech on 18 November 1996, that the New South Wales government had unilaterally declared 12 new wilderness areas then, totalling 153,430 hectares, and 10 new national parks, totalling 168,078 hectares. They also reserved an additional 671,000 hectares—(Time expired)

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—If anything is `purely political' it is this resolution. This latest series of antics by the federal government is not the first time they have attempted to impede the processes in New South Wales and Queensland. If we go back to early September, there was a bit of exhibitionism from the then minister, John Anderson, in a press release entitled `Federal coalition does not support Beattie government's bid to close down native forest industry in south-east Queensland' and in another entitled `Anderson says Carr government should be fair dinkum on regional forest agreements in northern New South Wales'. 
 These press releases continued ad nauseam. So we have seen, over a period of time, an attempt for purely political purposes to essentially undermine and politicise this process.
It was interesting that the previous speaker spent very little time on the employment aspects, something those opposite tend to focus on. The Australian people would not have too much time for the rhetoric of those opposite, who have sat there like stunned mullets over the last three years while tens of thousands of Australian people have been thrown out of the Commonwealth Public Service.
In a reasonable, objective, middle-ground comment on the performance of this government, Mr Dorber from the NSW Forest Products Association said of that first attempt to scuttle the process:
Given the resources (both financial and human) possessed by the Federal Government, we cannot accept the explanations now being offered for this serious failure to provide useable data within the negotiation process.
The person who represents the vast majority of the sawmillers and the industry—regardless of how often people shake their heads over there on the other side—is on the public record essentially saying that the attempts to scuttle this process in New South Wales and the lack of data which is now complained about has come from those opposite.
One would think, from the contributions today, that nothing has been done by the state government with regard to the question of the long-term viability of the industry. For some reason, they do not talk about the $10 million under the Forest Industry Structural Adjustment Program to upgrade operations at four North Coast timber firms: Kempsey Timbers, 
 Hurford Hardwood, J. Notaras & Sons and Machin's. They do not talk about the $18 million over the next five years for the purchase of timber from private property to maintain adequate supply during the transition stage of the agreement. They do not speak of the 61 new jobs in the thinning of hardwood plantations and regrowth forests. There is no comment on the 25 new jobs to expand eucalypt plantations in the region by 2,000 hectares a year. There is no discussion of the 10 new jobs to undertake detailed timber resource inventory operations. No-one speaks of the $2 million to develop a biomass energy plant at Walcha based on pine plantation thinnings and timber waste.
What we are seeing over here is essentially a politically orchestrated campaign to make sure this issue hangs around until the next state election. If the broad mass of reasonable people in this country—the people who want a sensible outcome in forestry policy—were hearing the rhetoric of both sides of this debate, and if they wanted any confirmation that this is a reasonable outcome, they would be interested in the comments here today about how dreadful this is for the forestry industry and how dreadful this is for the sawmillers.
It is interesting to note what those on the other side of the debate are saying about this supposedly dreadful outcome for the North Coast sawmillers. A newspaper that is very dear to a few North Coast members, the Northern Daily Leader, on 14 November carried a headline entitled `Greens claim 20-year plan ignores science'. In that, the North East Forest Alliance attacks the New South Wales state government, saying it:
. . . did another dirty deal with timber industry groups to sell out oldgrowth forest, wilderness and numerous endangered species.
That is what the Greens and the environment movement are saying about the outcome. Yet here today we have people on the other side saying how lamentably pro-conservationist and how green this outcome is.
Similarly with the Australian of 13 November: `Greens declare war on Carr'. A few moments ago we had a speaker alleging that this process was designed to buy off the green 
 movement—that it is part of a nefarious plot designed to get green preferences at the next state election. It does not seem to be working too well, does it? I quote from the article:
. . . conservationists claim the Government abandoned plans to lock up hundreds more hectares following pressure from unionists and timber groups.
So they do not seem to have got the message too clearly that this is all for them. I refer again to the Forest Products Association's comment about the federal minister's performance:
Wilson Tuckey Playing Political Football
While it is heart-breaking for workers who go through the process, at least the state government is offering a support base, unlike the federal government, which appears to be trying to score political points.
We are seeing these political points here today. The association also noted:
The federal government has not helped by walking away from the negotiation process. Minister Tuckey has also conveniently forgotten that he was the one to unilaterally suspend business exit assistance—
which, as we all know, is essentially hitting the employers, the owners and the industry. The Mayor of Walcha, Len Woods, in the same edition of the Northern Daily Leader  of 14 November, said about one aspect of this outcome, this RFA:
It's great news for jobs in Walcha.
. . .              . . .             . . .
This decision will help bring some certainty back into people's lives.
The second way in which the package protects the future of the forest industry is that it provides them with resource security for a period of 20 years. This is a key outcome made possible only by compromises on all sides of the debate. In return, the New South Wales government is guaranteeing the industry a minimum of 269,000 cubic metres of high quality, large sawlogs a year—140,000 from the lower north-east and 129,000 from the upper north-east. As well, timber volumes will not begin to reduce to these agreed levels until January 2000, and then in two stages. The motion we are debating also claims that the New South Wales government's actions have `forced the Commonwealth Government 
 to withdraw funding of $40 million'. This is a ridiculous claim.
The federal minister, Mr Tuckey, has suspended, not withdrawn, structural adjustment funding to New South Wales as a negotiating tactic with the Carr government, and nothing else. This action exposes the contradiction of the minister's position in this sensitive and complex debate. He claims to be about protecting the timber industry, virtually to the exclusion of all other legitimate considerations, yet he capriciously suspends Commonwealth funding that goes to that very same industry. No wonder the Forest Products Association is starting to mutter `with friends like these' about Minister Tuckey and those opposite who support him.
All the ministerial press releases, dorothy dixers in question time and private members' motions in the world will not alter the fact that the Commonwealth has to negotiate a series of regional forest agreements with the New South Wales government. Negotiations with New South Wales were well under way in the lead-up to the federal election when Commonwealth officials were ordered to halt discussions with their New South Wales counterparts.
As shadow minister, I have been trying to make some sense of the federal minister's conduct. I readily confess to being completely baffled by his performance. He claims, when he first comes in, that his door is always open to everyone, but he tells Commonwealth officials not to talk to their New South Wales counterparts. He is given the title of Minister for Forestry and Conservation, but he acts as if conservation and heritage values are anathema to him and expresses total opposition to further world heritage listings.
He pledges his commitment to the Commonwealth-state regional forest agreements process and then suggests he might develop a strange, unexplained backdoor agreement process. Through the media he calls on the New South Wales coalition to vote against the Carr government's forestry legislation, only to see them help secure the passage of the legislation through the state's upper house.
He professes to be acting within the framework of the national forest policy statement agreed with the states and the territories, and then tells the Sydney Morning Herald he supports a move towards a `whole-of-forest' approach to logging. Whilst this term is as imprecise as his other outbursts, it clearly implies that he wants to reduce the size of national parks in New South Wales and that he wants to allow logging to occur in national parks. Even the New South Wales coalition's spokesperson on forestry, National Party MP Don Page, has ruled out logging in national parks, so the minister is clearly out on a limb on this.
He has been out on a limb for quite a while. We have heard in here of the attempt to persuade the New South Wales opposition to get on its high horse about this legislation. The fact of life is that the New South Wales opposition has seen what most people in this country understand. That is, whilst we have a few National Party MPs and Liberals in here today criticising this initiative and criticising these agreements, the fact of life is that the broad middle-ground of Australia in this debate understands that, when the green movement is so critical of this process, when it is so unhappy with the outcome—and these people today are unhappy with the outcome—then quite frankly it is a sensible outcome.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Regional Forest Agreements</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,1998-12-07,"—I have listened with some interest to the member for Reid trying to justify the indefensible in the forestry decision. The member for Reid has been with me in politics for quite a long time. He knows that I do not worry about elections on this particular issue, that I have been fighting the cause for forestry for 15 years.
I have to say that we have continued to get decisions such as this, which are purely political decisions and not based on the science of forestry. They are designed entirely for votes—it has nothing to do with anything else—in the cities, Sydney and Melbourne, where 60 per cent of Australia lives, and `Damn the people who live in the country; we couldn't care less about them'.
These particular decisions are even more serious when you consider some statements that were made by Bob Carr when he was the 
 minister for planning and national parks in 1987. I remember very clearly sitting in the New South Wales house one night after he had given a national park to the green movement and, like they do today, they had gone out and condemned him high and low about the fact that he had not given them more.
I remember clearly his statement when he came down to the house and said, `These people are like a pack of timber wolves. You throw them a national park and they gulp it down and look up with languid eyes and ask for more.' That is exactly right. It is a pity he did not remember what he said. That is exactly what he said, and there is no doubt in my mind that this decision will not satisfy them either, because they want the lot.
The New South Wales government—particularly the minister for decentralisation, or regional development, in New South Wales—has sold out the timber industry on the North Coast because they did not stand up. The government looks at the ambit claims put forward by the green movement—and this time it was a million hectares—and they say to the timber industry, `Think yourself lucky because we have only given them about 300-odd thousand hectares.' This continues to go on and on.
I am interested that the member for Paterson is going to speak in this debate. I will be listening very carefully to see how he is going to protect the forest industries in his electorate, because obviously some of their representatives have been fairly outspoken in recent times about this decision.
Look very closely at the decision. The honourable member for Reid quoted the FPA and Mr Col Dorber, but Mr Dorber does not represent the majority of the timber industry. Boral alone have 60 per cent of the sawn logging quota in New South Wales. He tries to manipulate these figures, just like a lot of politicians. He tries to bring Daishowa into it to say, `Yes, we represent the majority of the timber industry.' There is a big difference between the chip industry and the logging industry.
Col Dorber's history probably explains a lot about this debate. After the 1993 election, when the coalition lost government, he was 
 locked out of negotiations with the government of the day—for at least three or four months. It was a typical union tactic. They locked him out until he had to find his way back through the door again. The only way he found his way back was to get an agreement with the government that he would not criticise them and he would not campaign against them again. So any statements he makes in this debate have no credibility at all.
The electorates of Clarence and Page are based not just on the big mills but also on a lot of small mills, and they are being ignored in this process. They are not members of—they do not belong to—any organisation. They certainly do not belong to the FPA. They have to represent themselves, and I go into bat for them because they employ more people than the big mills in the electorate.
You talk about this money that has been set aside to buy private resources, but private resources do not want to sell it to the government. This is another method of this New South Wales government—confiscating property. They have done that with the graziers—graziers who had long-term leases. When the leases came up for renewal, the graziers were given an occupational permit, which is at minister's will. Their property has been confiscated by the government. That in itself is having a big effect around Grafton in my electorate, where the grazing industry depends on the high country in the winter time to carry their stock, because if they do not do that they cannot continue to carry the numbers of stock in that North Coast area.
So this decision has been an absolute disaster. Do not talk to me about this plantation policy. That is another pie in the sky thing that has been put forward by the Labor Party to try to induce the city into believing that we can somehow grow the timber that is necessary to supply this industry. It cannot be done. Anyone who wants to go up in an aeroplane will see that.

"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—Firstly, let me say how disappointed I am that an important segment of parliamentary business such as private member's business has given over to what I see as a very party political argument. That is what this is. This 
 decision was made in a state parliament with the support of your coalition colleagues, and you brought it into this chamber to debate it on party political lines at a time when we get so little time to debate issues with bipartisan participation. But I will be very interested to see what the member for Page has to say later today when the taxation bill comes before this House for debate, because you will not have to go back to 1987 to find a leader who said, `Never, ever'; you only have to go back a couple of years. I wonder whether you would support him today and point out that he has changed his stance.
But let us get on to forestry and find out why the decisions in New South Wales have been made. For in excess of three years the Carr government has been working with this federal government to come to a decision. But what do we find? We find that only in the last couple of months the goalposts have been changed. The federal minister, who has also been changed, said, `We don't agree with the reserve process that you have put aside. We don't agree with the time frame.' Obviously it was important for the state government, with the agreement of the federal government, to bring the matter to completion by the end of 1998. But suddenly, as we approached that date, all the red herrings were drawn out and there was disagreement.
I would think that the coalition would realise that there are a number of major issues here. The member for Page, who claims to represent major sawmilling interests in his electorate, knows that one of the important factors that make a sawmill economically viable or not is woodchip. Whether you like it or not, we do. I know that you guys changed it from 500,000 tonnes to one million tonnes but the point is that still only 300,000-odd tonnes go out from northern New South Wales. It makes a difference as to whether those sawmills run at a profit or loss. And I support them for doing what they do.
The interesting thing is that if you do not support the RFA process and New South Wales does not have an agreement with the federal government, then the export licences for woodchip in New South Wales will run out at the end of next year. That will be your 
 concern, because you will be entirely responsible as a party for not issuing new export licences. And that will be the single most telling factor as to whether those small sawmills that you claim to support so vigorously run at a profit. They will go under purely because of that decision. If RFAs are not agreed to in New South Wales and that process is not determined by the end of next year, then the woodchip from New South Wales will have no place on the export market, and in the coming 12 months you will start to see a movement against New South Wales woodchip by buyers from offshore, because they know that until that agreement is in place they will not have a guarantee of supply. When I was here between 1993 and 1996 we saw exactly the effect that that had on the sawmilling industry in New South Wales. There is not as much chip going out from Newcastle now as there was between 1993 and 1996. Even though you have increased the quota to one million tonnes, the point is that the market is not there.
The other important thing is the FISAP process. That is something that you completely ignore. The $40 million that has been withdrawn is vitally important for the timber industry in New South Wales at this time. The FISAP process is now starting to take effect. In my electorate alone, one sawmiller in one country town is prepared to invest $1.4 million with the associated grant. That is the sort of thing that you people are placing in jeopardy, and that is the sort of action that I abhor. For the first time the forestry industry in New South Wales has certainty and, by the actions of the coalition in this House, you are denying that. It will be remembered.

"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,1998-12-07,"—Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I am very pleased to support this motion as I sympathise greatly with you, as the honourable member for Cowper, the honourable member for Page and other members in the north- east of New South Wales. I sympathise because exactly the same thing happened in my electorate of Eden-Monaro with the Eden management area.
The member for Paterson over there, with a lot of huff and puff, talked about RFA processes. It is the Carr government which walked away from the RFA process in the first place. If we go back to the interim assessment process, he walked away from the RFA process when they automatically cut the wood supply to half. In fact, in my electorate of Eden-Monaro, they cut it to less than half. They went out and unilaterally declared national parks all over the place in direct opposition to the RFA process.
I said to Rex Bowen, who was running the process for the New South Wales government, at the time, `How can you declare a national park when you have not even got back any sorts of studies from the socioeconomic surveys that were being done well before the environmental studies were completed?' Before those reports were even finished they declared the national parks. I said to him, `What happens when you get to the end of this RFA process and you find you've made a mistake and that you've declared far more national park than you should have?' He looked at me and said, `Well, I guess we'll have to undeclare some of those parks.' I said, `Oh, look, there are pigs flying.' Pigs might fly! That is exactly what occurred.
There is an area of national park down in my electorate. If you talk to the Greens, if you talk to the environment people at the federal level and if you talk to the New South Wales people privately, every single one of them will admit that the national park was placed over the wrong piece of land. Nobody has got the guts to turn around and change it. I sympathise very much because exactly the same thing has occurred as is now happening in the north-east.
We have seen a total unilateral agreement. To this day I cannot work out who the agreement is with. An RFA process is an agreement between the New South Wales government and the federal government. But it seems to be an agreement between a couple of ministers in New South Wales who sat around the faction table and said, `Well, we need some extra votes here and there. Okay, let's come up with this wonderful agreement.' Then they went ahead and started producing 
 ads. You saw the ads in the papers, Mr Deputy Speaker, saying: `It's all warm and fuzzy. We'll protect the owls and we'll protect the potoroos.' But they did not protect the timber workers.
We have lost more than 200 jobs in the last few years through this process. We have ended up with a wood supply agreement well below 50 per cent. The New South Wales government promised the people in my area that they would `never go below 50 per cent' of what they were getting at the time. That would have given them 29,500 cubic metres. They are now throwing us 23,000. It would have taken so little to get to 26,000, which would have maintained the jobs. What is it with Carr? So little extra and we could have had 26,000 cubic metres and not one job would have been lost.
I was in Eden on Saturday night for the South-East Timber Association Christmas party. They were trying to make the best of it because they went through the lottery last week that I spoke about in the House. I challenge the shadow minister for forestry and conservation: come down and talk to Marie and Bob Slater who went into the hat with two contracts. Their numbers came out first and second—all finished. Come down and front them and have a discussion, and then you might learn something about the RFA process and the despicable process that Carr went through. No science at all; all politics—a totally political process. Absolutely no science whatsoever.
I would be happy to see the member for Reid, who comes from the nice leafy suburbs of Western Sydney, visit my electorate. I am sure they have grown a few trees there in somebody's backyard occasionally. Come down and see the real world and see what has happened to the people in those communities who were first affected by the cancellation of the woodchip licences by the former Labor government and are now affected by this process which has locked them out. It would have taken so little and they all could have had a job.

"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—It simply does not make sense for this House to `regret' the Carr government's regional forest 
 agreements for the north-eastern parts of New South Wales. To demand that the Carr government act responsibly on the forestry issue is a bit like telling a timber worker to be careful on the job. It is fitting, though, that the National Party should express its regret. After all, it has been noticeably absent from any policy debate on this complex issue.
Our generation holds in trust our nation's valuable timber resources. While we wish to make use of this resource, we also wish future generations to be able to use it, and we might expect those future generations to hold that same trust for those generations which will succeed them. We need to find a way in which we can ensure that these objectives can be met and secured. How much of our timber resources can we use? How much should we hold in trust? What is the balance between pilfering the future of our timber resources and securing their long-term viability? But this debate is not about those issues; this debate is about the New South Wales election and it is about the seat of Clarence.
Let us be clear about one thing. The Carr government is not withholding funds for restructuring the timber industry. It is the Commonwealth government which is withholding funds: funds which might be used to assist the timber industry in north-east New South Wales. This government is trying to blackmail the people of New South Wales for blatant political purposes.
The Carr government has done its job. Faced with a difficult decision, it has made a sensible compromise. It is now up to this government to stop playing petty politics and get on with the job of ensuring the future of the timber industry in New South Wales. The Carr government's responsible approach to establishing common ground is in stark contrast to the irresponsible attitude of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation in this government.
In the Sydney Morning Herald of 13 November, the minister was reported to have threatened to cancel woodchip export licences if there was no federal and state consensus by the end of 1999. That is the attitude of the minister: `Turn on a blue! Who cares about the long term future of the industry!' The 
 minister obviously follows the National Party creed: if it moves, shoot it; if it doesn't, cut it down. That is hardly responsible, especially after the Carr government has sat down with all the stakeholders and drawn up a compromise agreement on the best use of timber resources in north-east New South Wales.
The Premier has `progressed' the agreements, as the member for Cowper observes. That is, after all, what the people of New South Wales expect their Premier to do. A clear statement—an agreement—is what the industry expects as well, if they are to make informed decisions about long-term investment in the industry, decisions that affect people's livelihoods. The Sydney Morning Herald of 13 November says the Carr government's plan:
. . . represents an intelligent compromise which makes sense of the concerns of all the competing interest groups. The amount of forest left aside for present and future logging ensures a viable industry can be maintained in an area where jobs are scarce.
The member for Cowper should be more concerned with his minister, who seems incapable of compromise, rather than regretting the positive and effective actions of the New South Wales government. You cannot progress anything in public policy without a bit of reconciling and you certainly do not progress the interests of a sustainable forest industry by withdrawing from negotiations.
The processing of similar agreements has been going on in other states and the government has not remarked on them at all. It certainly has not done the classic dummy spit we have seen from the minister in this case.
Jobs and conservation are two conflicting demands that are never easy to reconcile. For the Carr government to have produced a compromise agreement and have it passed into law with the support of all major parties is an achievement worthy of the commendation of this House rather than regret. Regret is when you cannot attend. So it is fitting for the National Party to be proposing regret. It has been conspicuously absent from any policy contribution to the question of sustaining employment in this critical natural resource industry.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Regional Forest Agreements</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Bailey, Fran, MP",LP,1998-12-07,"—I am very pleased to be associated with the motion by the member for Cowper. I support him in trying to achieve a balance between the needs of the timber industry on one hand and our very precious natural environment on the other. This debate and the RFA process is all about achieving that balance based on scientific grounds, not on emotional or political grounds as the Carr government is doing. The whole process of the RFA is to conduct wide consultation with industry and environment groups and, most importantly, to examine the social and economic impact on regional communities. Exactly that process has been conducted in both Tasmania and in my own state of Victoria. Far from the cries of members opposite today, I can tell them that in the central highlands within my own electorate we have a balanced RFA that has been based on scientific evidence after consultation with all those groups I mentioned.
This debate is really about the Premier of New South Wales and his political decision that he can win more votes in his vulnerable metropolitan areas by pre-empting the scientifically based RFA process, by making decisions in an emotive manner, to lock native forest areas into expanded national parks designed to pander to the ill-informed residents of Sydney, decisions that are not based on any accurate or scientific information.
To give just one example, on 15 July the member for Cowper gave details in this place of an area in the Murwillumbah district which was claimed to be rainforest but in fact was an area of eucalypt trees. This type of decision making follows an established pattern by the Carr government. In fact, it would be fair to say that during the past two years when other state governments have been following the RFA process by assiduously abiding by the criteria of scientific assessment, together with those consultation processes as I described, the Carr government has obviously made the decision that they will not abide by the rules. They will do whatever they think is politically expedient.
It must be emphasised that the New South Wales Premier only sees the RFA process as 
 a way of adding more native forest to national parks—increasing the size of national parks come what may. National parks are very important to our nation but they should not be determined by arbitrary decisions, decisions that do not take effective management of those parks into consideration, decisions that do not take into consideration the Australian timber industry and those people who work in it, decisions that do not take into account that we import $2½ billion worth of timber and timber products and decisions that do not take into consideration rural communities who rely on the timber industry to maintain those communities.
It is not just the families who have members in the harvesting, transport and milling of timber industries. It is all those other people—all those small business people in those small rural towns who depend on the timber industry. I want to know why the shadow minister at the table, and indeed the shadow minister for regional services, is not in here standing up for all those small business people in those rural towns who depend on people like the Premier of New South Wales to stick by the RFA process and use that process—(Time expired)

"Sidebottom, Peter, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—Yesterday the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin, announced a $40 million federal government incentive package for the Visy pulp mill in Tumut in southern New South Wales. Whilst I congratulate this community on securing the project, I am disappointed for my own electorate of Braddon, not because a pulp mill was or is to go ahead in preference to Burnie on the north-west coast of Tasmania—or anywhere else in Tasmania—but because it was this very same Howard government that did nothing to assist the workers of the Burnie pulp mill to rescue 
 their jobs and the pulping operations at Australian Paper's Burnie site.
No incentive package accompanied the combined union and local community plan to keep the pulp mill operational. Instead, Amcor went about its business of closing the mill, sacking 200 workers, converting the plant to process imported pulp and importing this pulp. The so-called package Burnie received from the Howard government has failed to materialise in any coherent or organised form, and my community is frustrated by this tardiness and lack of direct federal government response.
Likewise, Tasmania is in the process of securing a billion dollar magnesite production and processing plant, which we were promised by the former member for Braddon would be monitored by the Prime Minister's department and the government's major projects facilitator, Bob Mansfield. It seems, however, that no-one is in fact aware of the project. It is not listed amongst the government's five major projects and appears to have been ignored.

I am aware of certain statements by the Australian Private Hospitals Association which have been made in recent times. I can indicate very clearly this government is committed to having a dual system in health which allows a viable health system, that is, supported by both the private health funds and the public system. The government made a decision on that and put it to the Australian people. We were given the right to implement that by virtue of the decision on 3 October.
The government will continue to press for that legislation and implement it, and it will be on Labor's head if they refuse to look after those people, many of whom of course have very little in the way of funds themselves and who are very careful in how they spend their money. If they choose to have private health cover, this government believes they should have that right in an affordable manner, and that is the reason behind the policy.

 inform the House that, consistent with normal practice, the portrait has been completed and accepted by the Historic Memorials Committee. Acceptance of the portrait entails a number of steps in an established procedure, including seeking the recommendation of the Visual Arts/Craft Board of the Australia Council and the views of all members of the Historic Memorials Committee. This process takes time to complete. Some additional delay has occurred in the public exhibition of this portrait because the artist and Mr Keating requested that it be submitted to the Archibald Prize competition at the Art Gallery of New South Wales earlier this year.

"Sercombe, Bob,MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—I move:
That this House notes:
(1)	 the special relationship between Australia and Turkey, which developed out of mutual respect engendered by the horrific experiences of the First World War;
(2)	 that Turkey is a modern, secular state with which Australia should further enhance relations;
(3)	 the importance of Turkey as a trade and investment partner in its own right and as a base for Australian trade efforts in the Middle East and Central Asia;
(4)	 the significant contribution of Turkish migration to Australia's economic, social and cultural development; and
(5)	 that Turkish speaking residents of Australia have contributed significantly to the Australian community by their approach to potentially 
 divisive issues that could undermine harmony in our multicultural society.
It is appropriate, for a number of reasons, for a motion such as this to come before the House at this stage. One of the most important reasons is that this year is the 30th anniversary of the arrival of the first Turkish migrants to Australia following on from the signing of the bilateral immigration arrangement between Australia and Turkey in 1967.
Relations between our two countries could not be said to have got off to a promising start earlier this century. According to census material at the turn of the century, there were only 20 Turkish born residents in Australia at that stage. Earlier this century, the first substantial contact between Australia and Turkey occurred during the horrific experiences of the First World War. I think all Australians understand the importance of the Gallipoli campaign in the formation of our national sense of identity but, in addition to that campaign, there were prolonged periods of conflict involving Turkish and Australian forces in opposition to each other in Palestine and Syria. That, of course, meant that the commencement of our relationship was scarcely promising.
Somewhat surprisingly, given the horror, the Gallipoli conflict produced a high degree of mutual respect between the two peoples. That mutual respect is most movingly reflected in the words of the commander of the Turkish forces at Gallipoli, one Mustafa Kemal, who went on to become Ataturk, the father of modern Turkey. Those words are reflected in the commemorative stone in the Ataturk Memorial Garden near the Australian War Memorial in the following terms:
Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives . . . you are now lying in the soil of a friendly country. Therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side here in this country of ours . . . You the mothers, who sent their sons from far away countries, wipe away your tears: your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace. After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well.
Those are moving words indeed. The same Ataturk went on to become the father of modern secular Turkey. The concept of 
 Turkey as a secular nation needs to be underlined. While in excess of 90 per cent of the community there are Muslims, the secular institutions of Turkey are fundamental. Ataturk's judicial and cultural reforms, including the introduction of Roman script, very much underpin the modern Turkish state.
Turkey is a nation of some 65 million inhabitants with a GDP of $US167 billion. A country of that size obviously promises great opportunities for a trading nation such as Australia and, whilst there has been some growth in recent times, there is certainly quite a way to go. In 1997 Australia sold $514 million worth of products to Turkey, compared with imports of only $98 million. The great bulk of that trade from Australia was in commodities—coal, iron ore, wheat, skins and hides. There are some interesting new developments, including the awarding of a $120 million contract to an Australian company to supply two, 86-metre, high speed, aluminium, vehicle-passenger ferries to Turkey. That is also indicative of the capacity for growing and more diverse trade. It is pleasing to see that Australian craft will be plying the Bosporus at the end of the 20th century, but fortunately not as they were plying it earlier this century!
Turkey is important not only in its own right but also because of its strategic position for trade and investment activities. Its position not only in relation to the Balkans and the Middle East is worth commenting on; it is also very much closely linked to the Caspian Sea base and to the rapidly emerging Central Asian republics with very strong language and cultural ties to Turkey. Those are very substantial reasons for Australia to be paying particularly close attention to the opportunities that arise there.
In international forums we find a great deal in common as well. In the context of United Nations peacekeeping, for example, Australia and Turkey have both been traditionally strong supporters of and suppliers of forces for those purposes. I understand that the most recent occasion where our forces cooperated was in Somalia.
As I commented at the start of this speech, in 1967 Australia and Turkey entered into a 
 bilateral arrangement in respect of immigration. By the 1996 census some 28,800 Turkish residents of Australia were recorded, with more than 46,000 people speaking Turkish at home. These people have made a very substantial economic, social and cultural contribution to our society.
One of the areas that is well worth commenting on, in terms of that contribution, concerns the matters referred to in clause 5 of the motion; that is, the contribution to the Australian community by the approach that Turkish speaking residents have taken `to potentially divisive issues that could undermine harmony' in our multicultural community. Australia has drawn immense strength over the past 50 years from its immigration program and that program's diversity.
One of the very great achievements of our nation involves the great steps we have taken to build a tolerant, multicultural community where people can contribute towards, have respect for, and continue to enjoy pride in, the cultural heritage of their former homeland. They also have the opportunity to present the heritage of their former homeland to, and share that heritage with, the rest of the Australian community.
But the rights and sensitivities of other Australian citizens of other backgrounds need to be recognised. Whilst one group of Australians can always promote a view strongly and vigorously, that should never be done in a way that stigmatises or seeks to isolate other groups of Australians. I believe that Turkish Australians have generally distinguished themselves by the way they have reacted to debate.
While they could be divisive and could undermine harmony in our multicultural community, Turks have generally acted with great maturity and understanding of the rights of all Australians when issues that they often feel deeply about have been aired in Australia. They have not sought to stigmatise or isolate those who wish the right to present their point of view. Turks have presented their views whilst respecting the rights of other Australians to present theirs. This is as it should be, and we ought to be encouraging the development of a tolerant, cohesive 
 Australian multicultural society. I commend the motion to the House.

"Lieberman, Lou, MP",LP,1998-12-07,"—It is a pleasure to be able to offer a few words in respect of the motion put forward by the member for Maribyrnong and to pay tribute to the contribution which citizens of Turkish origin have made and are making to Australia. The basis of this very substantial community in Australia with origins from Turkey stems from the agreement on residence and employment signed with Turkey some 30 years ago in 1967. It has provided a sound foundation for Australian people of Turkish origin to build harmonious relations and to continue to develop those relations together as part of Australia and, of course, with their original homeland, Turkey.
In fact, I understand there are some 100,000 people in Australia who came originally from Turkey or were born of parents of Turkish origin in the last 30 years. They have contributed to creating our harmonious and multicultural society and they cover a wide aspect of society, from academics to entrepreneurs, to artists and to hard-working artisans and tradespeople. Together they provide a very real human bond with Australians of other nationalities and of other origins, Australian born people, and with those in their home country of Turkey.
We do know that there have been some very difficult problems within Turkey. We condemn acts of terrorism against Turkish people, Turkish citizens and people of Kurd origin as well. Australia condemns terrorist activity, whoever is responsible for it. We offer our hand in friendship to Turkey. Without in any way attempting to dictate to them how they should handle affairs within their country, we do as a friend offer our support to combat terrorism and to ensure that humanitarian approaches are always maintained in respect of those sorts of problems.
As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, our strong links with Turkey arose because of 
 our shared experience in Gallipoli. This was, I suppose, the origin of the Australian-Turkish relationship, because there was not much before Gallipoli. This incredible experience between our two countries created bonds of respect unique amongst former enemies. These bonds are built on today and are mentioned constantly at modern ceremonies celebrating Anzac Day in Australia. I was very moved, as I am sure most Australians have been, by the words of the former Turkish commander Ataturk in 1934 when he was writing to an Australian mother about the experience. I will quote some of his words, because I think they can be recorded today in the Hansard appropriately. He wrote:
Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives . . . you are now lying in the soil of a friendly country. Therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side here in this country of ours . . . You the mothers, who sent their sons from far away countries, wipe away your tears: your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace. After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well.
That is an incredible set of words and a tribute that lives on. It is good to see how our relationship with Turkey in respect of trade is growing dramatically; it was commented on by the member for Maribyrnong. Australian exports to Turkey in 1997-98 were $636 million, which is an increase of 66 per cent when compared with the previous decade. Imports from Turkey were $112 million, so we have a trade advantage with Turkey. The trade from Turkey to Australia has in fact increased by 51 per cent in that same period of time.
Turkey is now our 25th largest export market. They are good trading partners, and we enjoy harmonious relations in the business sector with Turkish people. Very often within Turkey we form joint ventures with Turkish citizens and businesses. Our exports are greater to Turkey than to other countries in the surrounding region, and in fact greater than to many European and Asian countries. Our exports have also diversified each year as we find new markets and opportunities, mainly commodity based. Our most exciting recent export is the sale to Istanbul of fast 
 ferries by a company in Western Australia. We wish all of those people every success in that exciting trade agreement involving Australian technology. No doubt other countries will see our products and wish to buy. There is no question about that; there is great scope for further expansion of our trade.
It is good to see that Turkey is also becoming a country where the very large number of poor people are able to improve their lot each year. Turkey has a rapidly growing middle class, as it is described, due to that enterprise. In fact, Turkey's GNP growth in 1997 was 8.3 per cent. Unfortunately, they have very high inflation. I understand it is in excess of 50 per cent, but they have brought it down from 80 per cent and are working hard on it. We wish them well in the struggle to manage their economy efficiently and to fight the scourge of inflation.
In summary, Turkey is a modern, dynamic and secular state. We are pleased to see the emerging strengthening of their democratic parliament. Although they have had many difficulties over the years, we see that they are struggling with, and making good progress, ensuring that on the domestic front the people of Turkey of all backgrounds are being given an increasing role in the every day life of that democratic place. It is with pleasure that we also acknowledge at this time, as I said at the beginning of my contribution, the continuing contribution of people of Turkish origin in Australia.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Australia-Turkey Relations</title>,Private Members' Business,7,1,speech
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—The motion and the earlier speakers have noted that the initiation of the contact between Turkey and Australia was not all that auspicious—many of us have family members who fought the Turks in the First World War not only at Gallipoli, where most of this is focused, but also in the wider Middle East.
Symptomatic of that tie today is one of the schools in my own electorate, Granville Boys High School, which has a very significant Turkish population. Every year their ceremonies of remembrance for Gallipoli entail a number of Turkish aspects: the Turkish band in the school, the recitation of their poem Cannakale, speeches that stress the mutual loss and, as other speakers alluded to, 
 Ataturk's comments in regard to Australian troops who died at Gallipoli having another home there. From that, very strong relationships have grown. They have been shown in our mutual UN activity in conflicts such as Korea, our trade connections and our various cultural exchanges—most recently in Sydney at the Turkish Film Festival.
I think many people have an interest in Turkey because it is a secular state in its region. This year the Turkish community in Australia, and those within Turkey, have been celebrating the 75th anniversary of the declaration of the republic. The declaration of the republic involved a number of political trends that are of some importance even today: the abolition of the caliphate in 1924; Ataturk's pressure for Westernisation of dress; most emphatically, the declaration that Turkey would be a secular state; the introduction of the Latin alphabet; and the abolition of polygamy. All of those are aspects of Turkish society which most of us in Australia would overwhelmingly support and endorse. It is important in 1998 that we do stand with the Turkish government in attempting to ensure the preservation of those aspects.
The motion also deals with Turkish migration to this country. As has been noted, that has been in practice for about 30 years. Remittances are actually very important to the Turkish economy. In 1997, $4,229 million went from Turkish overseas workers and residents back to the Turkish economy. It is an economy that has been growing fairly strongly for most of the last 10 to 15 years, but it has, unfortunately, been characterised by heavy inflation and a relatively high government debt.
Turkish migration in this country was not assisted because it actually was fairly simultaneous with the onset of the boat people. A number of government analyses of migration assistance and settlement help in this country have put forward the proposition that the Turks were to some degree disadvantaged in comparison with a number of other recent arrival groups because our focus in that period of their ascendant migration was perhaps not as strongly helped because of our emphasis on the boat people. Yet, despite that, the Turks 
 in Australia have a real presence increasingly in the professions, in more recent years not only through greater migration by people with those skills but also through second generation Turks going through our university system. I see in my own electorate the increasing number of Turkish lawyers, doctors, pharmacists, psychiatrists, et cetera. That is another part of the motion that is very accurate.
Finally, the motion notes the way in which the Turkish community has played a very constructive role in a number of controversial matters. Although not specifically mentioned, one of those was the decision by the two major parties in the New South Wales parliament to erect a monument there commemorating the Armenian massacres of the postwar period. The question is not the argument over what occurred then but whether we should single out one nationality for a monument for this type of thing and basically increase ethnic tensions in this country. I think it was a very unfortunate decision and I again urge the state government of New South Wales and the opposition to look at the constructive way in which the Turkish community has dealt with this very controversial decision.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Australia-Turkey Relations</title>,Private Members' Business,7,1,speech
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,1998-12-07,"—I am pleased to support this motion about a nation friend on the world stage—a nation which is an ancient land, just like Australia, but a nation which has enjoyed the concept of civilisation, as we know it these days, for a great deal of time. Indeed, it is an area which encompasses the cradle of civilisation, an area I was able to visit about 14½ years ago as a journalist with Channel 7. I was totally impressed by the way in which the Turkish people rightly hold their history—very proudly.
In fact, Turkey struck me as a nation of great contrast and conflict. One of the great ironies for Turkey is that, when God created earth, it was made to straddle two of the great tectonic plates on this planet—where Europe meets Asia in both the physical, ground sense and in a cultural sense. So that in itself really personifies what Turkey, the nation we know today, has been like throughout the ages.
These days, as has been noted, it is a secular state where different cultures and beliefs are living side by side; where modern buildings along the beachfronts are the places where German, French and European tourists go—to Kusadasi, a modern port town, near the ancient city of Ephesus, which is just a few miles up the road. It is a place that I believe all Australians aspire to visit because of the conflict at Gallipoli in the early part of this century. That names such as Suleiman the magnificent, the Ottoman Empire and Ataturk sit very strongly in Australia's collective memory really does say something about Turkey the modern nation and its role in the modern world. The city of Istanbul—once known as Constantinople, once known as Byzantium, once known as the new Rome—throughout the ages has produced great civilisations and great centres of activity and commerce, and these days it is a city where Byzantine mosques are amazing remnants of the past. Some started as Christian cathedrals built during the great crusades.
Australia and Turkey enjoy a very special relationship, which I guess is at the heart of why I am happy to support this motion today recognising the importance of that relationship so far as our trade relationship with Turkey is concerned these days. I know in lots of ways it is a very Australian and also a very Turkish relationship that two nations who were on either side of horrendous warfare in the early part of the century should complete this century as very close friends. It is a relationship built on a great deal of respect that the leader of modern Turkey, General Ataturk, encapsulated in his comments, paraphrased by those opposite: `A message to Australian mothers: that you, the mothers who sent their sons from far away countries, wipe away your tears. Your sons are now lying in our bosoms and are in peace. Having lost their lives on this land they become our sons as well.' Those words did a lot to unify the great tensions that once existed between Australia and Johnny Turk.
The landings at Gallipoli hold a special place in the hearts and minds of all people in Australia. I have only to look at the street to the north and the street to the south of my 
 electorate office in Ipswich Road, Moorooka to see Gaba Tepe Street to the north and Helles Street to the south and to know that in so many ways places in Turkey—and those two streets are named after key locations; in fact, the location of the second landing in the case of Gaba Tepe at Anzac Cove—link two very important parts of Australian history and our conflict in Turkey. Australians rightly pride themselves on building a strong friendship with Turkey, and I believe the Turks rightly pride themselves on building a strong friendship with Australia.
When I was in Turkey in 1984 the people there were talking about the television program East of Eden and were amazed to find out that crocodiles were not taking Australians on a constant and regular basis. They are seeing a little bit of Australian culture just as Australians are being blessed to see Turkish culture. This is a nation that beat us in war, yet a nation that has extended us great courtesy and respect. Likewise, we hold a great deal of respect for the fighting spirit of the Turks. That landing at Gallipoli has forged a strong friendship between our two countries and this motion today, I think, emphasises the importance of building on that relationship now and into the future.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—My grievance relates to the failure of the Howard government to recognise that Australian working people expect their government to see job creation as a priority. I contend that the Howard government has avoided its key responsibility to create new jobs and to defend existing jobs. Senator Nick Minchin has only been in his new industry portfolio for a couple of weeks, yet he has quickly dropped an old Howard government promise. It was a very important promise: to create 200,000 additional jobs in the manufacturing industry by the year 2000.
I, like many in the Australian community, was amazed at the arrogant and dismissive manner in which he walked away from the government's commitment to create additional manufacturing jobs in an interview on the Channel 9 Sunday program yesterday. In response to a question relating to that target of 200,000 jobs in manufacturing by 2000, he said, in a very dismissive way:
Yeah, well, that's not a target we're pursuing in this term. 

What confidence can we have in this government's commitment to job creation with comments such as that, when such a key ally of the Prime Minister is prepared to drop a core Howard government promise? That is what it was; it was one of the real commitments to a target on the issue of jobs at the commencement of the Howard government's reign in March 1996.
I also refer to Senator Minchin's fellow minister, the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, who knows that he has failed to produce the goods with regard to job creation. He promised Australians wonderful new jobs once his first workplace relations laws came into operation in December 1996. Now Minister Reith hopes to create jobs by further slashing away at the basic job rights and job security of working Australians.
This government has given up on creating better jobs by building on a good, decent employment system. They want to create jobs by destroying our employment system and by cutting into basic rights. They want to further undermine the security of those already in work by amending further workplace laws to cut unfair dismissal rights and to cut the pay and conditions of our young people.
A government with vision about jobs would be looking at what has happened in regional Australia. Jobs are gone thanks to their anti Public Service and anti community sector policies, as well as populations in decline. On that note, I need only refer to the level of unemployment in some of those regional seats. Let us take Hinkler, in regional Queensland, where there is currently a level of unemployment of 13.2 per cent. Richmond, in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, which is again a seat held by the National Party, has a level of unemployment of 14.8 per cent. Adelaide, in South Australia, a seat held by the Liberal Party, has an unemployment level of 10.3 per cent. There are many other seats but I will finish with Longman, in Queensland, where unemployment as of June 1998 has stood at 11.8 per cent.
Clearly, unemployment is of crisis proportions in Australia, especially in regional 
 Australia. That is borne out by further reports in the media today, which show a concentration of job growth in metropolitan Australia in areas such as Sydney and Melbourne, while regional Australia not only continues to lose out but also represents areas of huge job losses over recent years.
I suggest to the House that a decent government which understands it has a role in creating jobs, especially in regional Australia, would, firstly, put more resources into infrastructure development; secondly, provide support for government services to regional Australia so that they were available equally to all Australians; thirdly, support local export driven job initiatives with innovative programs backed by government resources; and, fourthly, provide incentives for migrants to settle in regional Australia rather than metropolitan Australia, especially those migrants who can help kick-start the local economy. I think that view is reinforced by a report in the Age today entitled `It's the city or bust for jobs'.
The suggestions I put forward today are about rebuilding regional Australia. They are about effectively saying that this government has the responsibility to not only ensure additional jobs are created in suburban areas in cities like Melbourne and Sydney but also to ensure support in areas such as Mackay, in Queensland, or Gippsland, in Victoria, aimed at trying to create jobs in regional Australia. That is especially important because, in a lot of those areas, restructuring has wiped out thousands of jobs in industries that were previously exceptionally important to the creation of jobs as well as for the training of our future skills base. They were areas of employment that encouraged apprenticeship training.
I refer, for example, to industries such as electricity generation and steel—industries which the member for Paterson, who is in the House, understands the importance of for the Hunter region—and commercial and government services which are, unfortunately, becoming more and more concentrated in the cities to the detriment of regional Australia. If there are any doubts about that, I will refer to what has occurred in Gippsland in Victoria 
 in recent times. I note from the figures that in Gippsland alone we have seen 18,900 jobs lost since 1995, or 20 per cent of its employment. Other regions of Australia have also suffered huge job losses along the lines of those which occurred in the Gippsland area.
To return to the failure of the government to actually honour its commitment to do something about the issue of manufacturing jobs and its target of 200,000 additional jobs by the year 2000, the minister himself dismissed this with a rather arrogant statement on the Channel 9 Sunday program yesterday. He was asked a fairly relevant question about the need for additional job growth in Australia, especially in industries aimed at maintaining Australia's importance in manufacturing industry. All the minister could say in response was:
Yeah, well, that's not a target we're pursuing in this term.
It seems to me that the new minister for industry—someone who is supposed to be about broadening Australia's manufacturing base, supporting innovation and seeking to attract investment in manufacturing industry in Australia—has merely admitted failure and given up the fight before even trying to do something about manufacturing jobs—especially in regional Australia. I would have thought that a new minister for industry policy would have been about decisive statements that he was going to fight for additional manufacturing jobs in Australia rather than admitting at the outset of his term of office as minister for industry that he is not prepared to stand up for manufacturing industry and that, if anything, he is going to admit failure on the jobs front.
I suppose that represents a continuing trend when it comes to the performance of ministers for industry since the Howard government was elected in March 1996. For example, I refer to the performance of the previous minister for industry, the member for Ryan, Mr Moore. The fall in the figures for manufacturing job growth in the quarter of May, on a seasonally adjusted basis, was 2,300 manufacturing jobs. It worries me even more that in the last year 32,900 manufacturing jobs 
 have been lost, with falls in each of the last three quarters.
If the government actually had a heart and a determination to do something about committing itself to achieving job growth in manufacturing industry, then, after 32 or 33 months in government, we could have expected some job growth in manufacturing industry. If the figures as of June this year were on course, the Prime Minister's government should have created an additional 112,500 new manufacturing jobs by now.
These current figures represent the fact that this government, which has just got back by the skin of its teeth, cannot demonstrate any type of vision for creating jobs for all Australians—especially in manufacturing industry and especially in regional Australia. Instead the key minister, Senator Minchin, who could actually do something about jobs,  went on television yesterday and said that they have given up on the promise to create jobs.
All I can say is: what a shameful admission. At a time when it is going to get more competitive and more difficult, the new minister for industry has basically thrown in the towel and said that he is not prepared to commit himself to doing something about this government's promise, prior to the 1996 election, that it was going to achieve 200,000 additional manufacturing jobs by the turn of the century. That is its gift to the nation: yet another failure. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Employment Policy</title>,Grievance Debate,8,1,speech
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to make a comment briefly on that before we proceed to the cognate debate.
—Indulgence extended.
—Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The government and the opposition are still in, shall we say, strenuous negotiations about the arrangements to debate A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Bill 1998  and the related bills. One of the matters under discussion is this cognate debate arrangement. It is obviously appropriate that backbench members who speak before this matter is resolved are allowed to participate in a cognate debate because they will not get two chances.
The member for Hotham will be opening on behalf of the opposition in this debate. He will be speaking in this instance just about the GST bill. So we will not be regarding his contribution as part of the cognate debate. But, of course, we have no objection to subsequent backbench and other speakers being given licence to range over a cognate 
 debate because that will facilitate their opportunity to contribute to the debate.
—For the purposes of the debate, the chair needs to determine whether or not there is an objection to the cognate debate. Bearing in mind the comments of the member for Fraser, I rule that there is no objection. The chair will allow the course of a cognate debate to be followed.
I should indicate to the House that the member for Hotham has circulated a lengthy amendment that he proposes to move to the legislation. I have determined that it is reasonable for this amendment to be moved. It does not create a precedent in that there have been similar lengthy amendments in the past. It is what I would regard as an action that is not welcomed by the chair but, recognising that there are 16 bills to be dealt with, the chair will allow the amendment circulated by the member for Hotham to be moved. Also, I would want the reading of the amendment, in spite of its length, to be incorporated in the normal time frame allowed for the speech.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech

I have not had the courtesy of a response from him, but the Manager of Opposition Business in the House has had negotiations with the Leader of the House. We are placed in a very difficult position because we have had to truncate what should have been an opportunity to address every bill.

—The reason I indicated this course of action to the member for Hotham was that, far from being obstructive, as I think he will agree, the chair has endeavoured to accommodate a lengthy amendment and felt that the three minutes or so needed to read that amendment would be a reasonable compromise in terms of the total length of the debate, that it would not be unreasonable for him to read that amendment as part of the total length of the debate.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—I thank you, Mr Speaker, and the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation. The simple impact of A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Imposition—General) Bill 1998  and the related bills that are being debated before this House is that they introduce a new 10 per cent tax on almost everything everyone buys. From children's clothes to the books we read, to the wedding ceremony, to the pain-killers, to the holidays, to the food we eat and to the 
 house that remains the Australian dream—a new 10 per cent tax on all of it.
Every minute of every day for the rest of their lives, Peter Costello will have his hand in the pocket of every Australian. If this legislation is rejected by the parliament, the GST will truly become never ever for Australia. But, if we pass it, make no mistake: Australia is stuck with the GST for ever; it will never ever go away. And every time Australians find that hand in their pocket they will know whose it is. Every time small businessmen and women—1.4 million of them—work late at night as government tax collectors, they will know who is keeping them from their families. This will always be Peter Costello's GST. If this bill is passed, the GST will hang around his neck like an albatross every minute of every day for the rest of his political career. No wonder Peter Reith is laughing.
The government has no mandate for this GST. It has a mandate to form a government and to present its program to the parliament for debate and decision. That is all. I have a mandate, as does every Labor member in this House and the other chamber, to do everything in my power to stop the GST. That was my promise to the voters of Hotham, and I have no intention of letting them down.
The Prime Minister demands a larger mandate. He demands that the Senate has no right to reject the program, even though more than half of all Australians voted against the GST. That was not always his view. In the parliament on 15 September 1987 he spoke of:
. . . the simple proposition that when people vote at an election they do not vote on only one issue. The mandate theory of politics from the point of view of proper analysis has always been absolutely phoney.
But the role of the Senate was most cogently set out and defended by the member for Flinders on 17 May 1988, when he told the parliament:
The fact is that the system of rotation for terms of members of the upper House is a good idea. The mandate is the same but is given at a different point in time . . . This is a fundamental aspect of our system, and it is a sensible system. It has worked well. 

If senators are bound by any mandate, it is the mandate on which they were elected. In the current Senate that means that 56 of the 76 senators were elected on a mandate to oppose the GST. Twenty-eight ALP senators, seven Democrats, two Greens, Senator Colston and 18 coalition senators were elected in 1996 on John Howard's `never ever' promise. Seventeen of the remaining coalition senators were elected in 1993 to support a GST, but not on food. If the Prime Minister insists on claiming a mandate, he should insist that all senators vote according to theirs.
The Senate is an important house of review and the inquiry that the government was forced to accept is the clearest demonstration of that. But we will not be using the inquiry simply to attack the GST; we want to look at the alternatives. The government says a GST is necessary to take the economy forward. We want to show that you can have tax reform without a GST, because Labor supports tax reform. An effective tax system is one which is constantly under review and reform.
Labor, in government, has a strong record on both economic management and tax reform. The total composition of Labor governments of 1983 to 1996 could walk onto any international stage and take a collective bow for reconstructing the Australian economy and making it the strongest in the world. Labor, through the accords, cooperatively and comprehensively produced the wage restraint and the sustained lift in productivity that laid the basis for the low inflation underpinning the falling interest rates. It was Labor that broke the back of inflation. When we came to power we inherited a 10.5 per cent underlying rate of inflation, and it was Labor that set the Reserve Bank target to get it down into the two to three per cent range. It was Labor that got the underlying inflation rate within that range in the March quarter of 1992 and kept it there for most of the next four years.
Labor produced the huge fiscal consolidation in this nation in the 1980s, and Labor developed a competitive and outward looking economy. We floated the dollar, and that is what has buttressed the economy this time around. We created two million jobs. In short, we left the coalition an economy that even 
 they could not mess up in hurry. And now they want to claim all the credit for interest rates, inflation and economic growth.
The recent IMF report that the Treasurer was crowing about dealt with Australia's record over the last seven years. Labor was in government for two-thirds of that time, and our tax system underpinned the totality of it. Labor also, when in office, did restructure the tax system in the mid-1980s—and we did it without a GST. We eschewed a broad based consumption tax but broadened the direct tax base. We also received a mandate from the tax summit of the time, in 1985, to increase the wholesale sales tax, but not on the necessities of life—on food, on clothing or on shelter.
The simple truth is that the tax system that we now have is not broken. Revenue is actually increasing, not leaking. In the first four months of this year, revenue was $5.2 billion higher than for the same period last year. This is on a system that is supposed to be broken.
As shadow Treasurer I have inherited the tradition of the great economic reforms and sound economic management of the Labor government of 1983 to 1996. It is a tradition that I am proud to continue and one that I will not step back from. I repeat that Labor supports tax reform. We must be constantly reforming, but we have to identify the purpose of that reform. We must identify the constraints to our growth and the market failures. There is no point pretending that market forces work in cases where they do not. We need a tax system that encourages innovation; and that encourages investment in infrastructure, in venture capital and in skills formation. That is where the job opportunities are and where competitive advantage lies. But the tax package of this government does not address any of those. The tax package that Labor took to the last election did.
We need a tax system that complements policies and creates jobs. We need a system that encourages welfare to work, building on the tax credits proposals that Labor went to the last election with. We want a fair system and one that discourages tax avoidance. That is what we will be looking to develop in the 
 course of the coming months. The GST is not a fair tax. Try as you might, you cannot make it fair. We found that when we looked at it in 1985. The more you subject this tax package to scrutiny, the more it unravels. That is why the government has not allowed for the proper debate that is necessary in this chamber.
We will oppose the GST, but we will use the Senate inquiry and other opportunities to develop and promote alternative tax reform—reform without a GST. Just as Labor got it right in the mid-1980s, so we will lay down the basis for the next round of serious tax reform. We will be looking at issues such as those raised by the five economists. They recognised the importance of tax credits, and I believe they underestimate the flexibility in the existing wage structures for new starters—flexibility through the training wage introduced by Labor, through wage subsidies that Labor was prepared to promote and this government cut, and through the fact that there are significant regional differentials around the award rates that are struck.
I have welcomed the five economists' intervention because I think that looking at tax credits to compensate low income earners makes sense. We need to reward people for work—that makes sense, too. That is why we will be continuing to pursue that dimension of our policy. If we can find the means through tax credits to lift real disposable income for low income earners and take pressure off money wage increases, that too is worth investigating.
These bills, apart from imposing a 10 per cent tax on almost anything, do not constitute serious tax reform. The GST is inherently unfair. That is why we are committed to totally opposing it. It is a regressive tax. The GST means a massive shift in the tax burden from business to the individual and from the rich to the poor. It is unfair because it disproportionately hurts low and middle income households, especially those with children. These households spend a higher proportion of their income on items that are currently untaxed. These items are not luxuries; they are not discretionary expenditures that families may choose to discontinue if a new tax is put on them. They are the necessities of life. 
 They are the basic services that people need for a decent standard of living.
According to the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, less well-off people spend more of their income on housing. Consequently, if housing costs are subject to a new tax, this will impact the most on lower and middle income families. Rent is currently tax free under the wholesale sales tax system; so are basic building materials—bricks, concrete, stone, timber and roofing; and so are basic housing services costs such as electrical services, plumbing services, and home handyman and gardening services. There is a similar pattern of expenditure on the other necessities of life. Fuel and power account for 5½ per cent of the expenditure of the bottom 20 per cent of income earners but only 1.6 per cent of the top 20 per cent. Food takes up 24.6 per cent of the lowest income families' budgets but only 12½ per cent of the best-off families' spending.
The Prime Minister does not believe it, though. He told Neil Mitchell on 1 October that `it is the wealthy who buy food'. How out of touch is this man? But not only is the compensation inadequate; there is no guarantee that once this tax is in place, it will stay in place. It did not in New Zealand. The fact is that there will be losers out of this tax package. The compensation package put in is not guaranteed to stay and, as I will point out later, neither is the rate of tax itself. As we saw in New Zealand, it was the compensation package that went quickly out the back door. There will be losers under this tax package. David Vos, tasked by the government to assess it, admitted that `this will be a winners and losers issue'.
But the tax is also bad for the economy and jobs. It will slow economic growth and cause job losses. Tony Abbott admitted that the GST is not about generating new jobs. The VECCI chief—the employers' chief—David Edwards, was quoted in the Australian as saying that the GST will not create jobs. A number of economists have cast real doubt as to the job impacts of the GST. Transitional arrangements will cause real problems for the building and motor vehicle industries. Accord 
 ing to one of the studies by a modeller whom the Prime Minister is fond of quoting:
Housing investment is likely to be higher initially and then sharply lower. Further out, . . . housing investment will be 2% lower than it would otherwise be for the indefinite future.
Motor vehicle industry leaders, too, have predicted a plunge of up to 10 per cent in the level of vehicle sales in the first half of the year 2000.
The next point is this: no-one believes the GST rate will not rise. They do not believe it because that is what has happened all round the world. As consumers in countries with a GST know, the rate invariably goes up. In the OECD, 21 out of 23 countries have increased the general rate of their GST, and Switzerland is reportedly about to become the 22nd. Mr Howard pretends that setting the rate at 10 per cent will mean that the rate will not rise. On the contrary, just three examples of other OECD countries show that this proposition is absurd: the United Kingdom introduced their GST at 10 per cent; it is now 17½ per cent. Denmark introduced its GST at 10 per cent; it is now 25 per cent. New Zealand introduced its GST at 10 per cent; it is now 12½ per cent.
Even John Hewson does not believe the rate will not rise. He told Glen Milne that it was impossible to give that guarantee. The GST, if passed, will be a Commonwealth tax imposed by ordinary legislation of the Commonwealth parliament. This legislation will be amendable by any future Commonwealth parliament, just like any other piece of legislation. There is only one way to stop the GST rising—stop the GST itself; don't vote it in now.
On the question of the 1.9 per cent inflation rate and the compensation package that flows from it, and the assertion of this government that there will be a 100 per cent pass-on of the taxes that are being abolished, the integrity of the entire package depends on 100 per cent of business savings being passed on to consumers, otherwise the 1.9 per cent inflation rate simply does not hold up and the compensation cost will blow out. But no-one believes that the 100 per cent will be passed on. The truth is that it is a fantasy. I offer 
 three simple examples. Mr Sturrock from the car manufacturers said:
With all factors equal, a motor vehicle now carrying a recommended retail price of $30,000 will fall to $28,200 with the new tax system.
That is a six per cent fall. But the Treasury figures and the government's package are predicated on an 8.3 per cent fall. If they can be so far out in cars, how far out are they in the other aspects of the package? Mark Vaile, another of the government ministers, on fuel tax reductions stated simply that `the majority of savings will be passed on to consumers'. He is not guaranteeing the full 100 per cent pass on. And just last week the banks did not pass on last week's cut in official interest rates immediately and completely. It was a similar circumstance but there was nothing like a 100 per cent pass through.
There is further evidence that the 1.9 per cent inflation figure is ridiculously low. For example, the recent GST Premiers Conference agreed that the states will not abolish the stamp duty on some business conveyances for some years to cover the billion dollar-plus blow-out—the mistake that Mr Costello made in estimating the tax package impact on the state budgets. If they underestimated with the states to that extent, what have they underestimated in terms of other aspects of the package? The retention of a state tax will increase the estimated inflation impact.
In addition, the effect of the substantial tobacco tax rises in their own package had been deliberately excluded from the figuring by the government. It is as if it has been wished away. This will add around 0.2 per cent to 0.3 per cent to the inflation rate, with prices estimated to rise by over 13 per cent across the industry, according to page 170 of the government's own tax package.
The government has fiddled the inflation figures and it has underestimated completely the compensation necessary. In addition to this, consumers are already starting to pay for the GST, even before the GST legislation is passed. The most important example there is car lease costs and the advertisements in newspapers already saying that the prices are going up.
One of the most hypocritical aspects of this debate is the transparency of our indirect tax system. The coalition and business community both ran campaigns about the unfairness of hidden taxes but, according to the Treasurer on radio station 6PR, his GST will be `embedded in the price . . . just as goods tax is embedded in the price'. So a $15 billion sales tax is unfair because it is said to be hidden, but a $30 billion GST that is hidden is fair. What hypocrisy by the government! The double standard is obvious and it is unacceptable. But it is much worse because, unlike the wholesale sales tax, it is very simple for the GST to be separately itemised in prices and checkout documents.
The Treasurer has taken a policy decision to keep his GST hidden from consumers. This is consistent with his behaviour all along in the tax debate: disclose nothing, hide everything. He would rather retailers cop the blame. At the appropriate time we will be moving an amendment to require on all receipts full disclosure of the GST impact.
In ridiculing the wholesale sales tax for its anomalies, as the Treasurer and others do from time to time, they have led us to believe that we were getting an anomaly-free tax package. But we have been producing a litany of examples over the last two weeks demonstrating just where the anomalies are. For example, a pack of 48 Panadeine capsules sold in a pharmacy will be GST free, but a pack of 24 Panadeine capsules sold in the same shop will attract a GST. And that is not an anomaly? I would like to hear what is an anomaly, if that is not supposed to be one. How does this result in a simpler tax system?
The government wants us to follow what everyone else is doing on tax, but how are they performing? I quote the Treasurer:
In a region where practically every country is in recession. Go through them:
Remember this day?
Japan, Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand.
`They are all in recession' he said. But go through them again, Treasurer. Japan—GST; Korea—GST; Thailand—GST; Indonesia—GST; Hong Kong—GST; Singapore—GST; New Zealand—GST. All of them are in 
 recession and all of them have a GST. So who in the region is doing well? To quote Mr Costello again:
We would still be . . . outside of China anyway, the strongest growing economy in Asia.
Together with the US, the best performing countries in APEC are Australia and China. And they do not have a GST. So where is your argument? Why do it?
And what of the other countries the Treasurer seeks to sneer at? Botswana was growing at 4.9 per cent last year. Ghana and Swaziland had growth of three per cent last year. And Pakistan's growth was 1.3 per cent last year, coming off 5.2 per cent in the year before. To be fair to the Treasurer, Ghana did try to introduce a GST in 1995 but, after prices doubled, fierce popular resistance forced the resignation of the finance minister and they gave it away.
Now they are actually trying to introduce it again,  urged on by the IMF. But, according to the business briefing of the Financial Times, economists fear it will lead to `lower revenues for the state and a one-off inflationary shock'. This is the brave new world of this government—the great new direction into tax reform.
The legislation, if you believe the Prime Minister, is the greatest piece of tax reform this century. Yet, for a great piece of reform, its introduction has been marked by secrecy, lies and deception. First, the promise `never ever' from the Prime Minister, and `snake oil' from the Treasurer—their quotes. Then there was the announcement 18 months ago of a great tax adventure, but never any detail—and, by the way, we could not mention the GST in all of that time.
Only two weeks before the election, in an announcement timed to avoid parliamentary scrutiny, backed by the lie that everyone would be better off and a refusal to make public the modelling, did we see it. Backed by a massive advertising campaign, funded first by the business community and then by the public, Australians paid millions of dollars for what the Prime Minister described as a referendum on the GST. But it was a referendum without a no case because taxpayers were only allowed to fund one side of the 
 argument. Even then, more than half the population voted no.
Even now the government is refusing to release all of the information—the information necessary to make an informed judgment on this package. They were dragged kicking and screaming to a Senate inquiry. We said we needed one committee; the government said none, and now, with their miraculous negotiating, have ended up with four. The Treasurer falsely claims that Labor chairs all four of these committees. We do not. In any event, the chairs of the committees were negotiated by the coalition when in opposition. They were forced to release some of their modelling, but only some. Only last week, the government refused to release the material despite initially losing the vote in the Senate on a return to order.
If this is such a good package, why are they trying to hide it and what more have they got to hide? We will demonstrate that through the processes of the Senate because we are being allowed scant time in this place: something less than 18 hours of debate to debate what they have taken 18 months to compile and then only released before the election. If it takes 18 months to compose it, why shouldn't there be more debate allowed in this chamber, particularly when the Senate cannot even consider the legislation—by their own agreement with the government—until 19 April? Why the rush to get this through the House? We see them avoiding the questions in question time and now we see them avoiding the scrutiny of the bills. They want to group them together as a totality in a cognate debate, they want to limit the time on the detail and they want to restrict the opportunity for the opposition to expose this tax for the unfairness that it is.
And that is not all: the truth is they said they were going to release the totality of their tax package, but there are huge items missing from what they went to the last election promising to do. We cannot find the detail for the proposition that locks the rate in at 10 per cent. When they are questioned on that, they say, `Oh, that'll be in the next piece of legislation.' Why not now? That is what has got to be scrutinised in the Senate. The more you 
 try and delay this, the more we will squeeze it out of you. We will persist in this regard because the public has a right to know. Where is the detail on the ACCC amendment giving it greater price monitoring powers?
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—Oh, that is coming too—so is Christmas, my friend. It is just not appropriate for you to laugh this away when you said that the full details would be before us.
Where is the repeal of the provisional tax which they made a great hoo-ha about? Where is the crackdown on trusts? Where are the excise cuts for petrol and diesel? None of this appears, and they are just a few of the examples. The amendment that I will move identifies the totality of those things that we say are missing from this tax package and for which we are calling on the government to produce legislation. Labor will move a series of second reading amendments to the bills in this package and, at the end of my allocated time, I will read in the full amendment I am moving. We will also be taking the opportunity to move a number of detailed amendments to bills in the consideration in detail stage of the bill.
The process of debate in this chamber by this government on this package of legislation is totally unsatisfactory. They are doing everything to avoid scrutiny of their legislation, and we will use every opportunity to ensure they get that scrutiny. We will ensure that the processes of the Senate and this House are used to the fullest to ensure that they fess up and to ensure that they demonstrate the full impact of their tax package and the flawed basis upon which it is constructed. (Extension of time granted) This is a very open-ended invitation, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but I will not abuse the process. I move:

—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,1998-12-07,"—The 16 goods and services tax bills we are debating today will usher in a new tax system for Australia, a tax system which is well and truly overdue, a tax system for the new century. Australia's current tax system is complex, confusing, inefficient, inconsistent and unfair. It is in need of fundamental reform. This government is committed to bringing about such reform.
The problems of Australia's tax system are multiple and well known. Average income 
 earners face high marginal tax rates, with a person on average weekly earnings paying 43 cents tax on every additional dollar they earn. The interaction of the tax and social security systems creates unfair anomalies and disincentives to work. Indirect taxes are complex, hidden and counterproductive. Business taxation arrangements are overly complex and also give rise to avoidance opportunities.
Before the last election, the government announced a detailed and comprehensive plan to address these problems and shortcomings. The government took its plan to the electorate and won a majority of seats in this House. The government's plan, which is embodied in these bills, touches most parts of the tax system. It involves income tax cuts, better integration between income tax and social security, business tax reform, changes in tax administration and an overhaul of Commonwealth-state financial relations.
Unsurprisingly, however, given the history of tax reform in Australia and the position of the Australian Labor Party, considerable attention has been given to the reform of indirect taxes. The rationale behind the reform of Australia's indirect tax system—if indeed it is possible to classify the maze of Commonwealth and state indirect taxes as a system at all—is a substantial one. The current system involves multiple indirect taxes, many of which are themselves levied at multiple rates creating unnecessary complexity and distorting economic activity. The existing indirect tax base is limited and diminishing as a portion of overall economic activity, placing increasing pressure on government revenues and other revenue sources.
Various indirect taxes levied by the states and territories are not only inefficient, but in many cases are also regressive. Reform in these areas is vital. There are of course other important advantages of indirect tax reform. Today I want to touch briefly on the importance of indirect tax reform for Australia's balance of trade and its current account.
Under Australia's existing arrangements, indirect taxes—wholesale sales tax, fuel excises, taxes on financial transactions and various state stamp duties—impact on the cost 
 of production for Australian industries. While it is generally the case that exporters do not directly charge WST on their sales and can get limited exemptions from WST on their immediate business inputs, some part of Australia's indirect tax burden inevitably creeps into their production costs. This occurs through the application of wholesale sales tax to indirect business inputs—for example, office furniture and transportation costs—through the so-called `cascading' of WST down the supply chain, and through the incidence of other indirect taxes.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants has estimated that the export price of Australian made goods is prejudiced by as much as nine per cent, with an average in the area of five per cent, because of indirect taxes imposed on business costs. The Commonwealth Treasury has estimated that the indirect tax changes outlined in the government's tax reform plan will reduce costs on Australia's exporters by $4.5 billion, or by about 3.5 per cent. This change will make a positive contribution to the position of Australian exporters in highly competitive international markets. In simple terms, Australian products will become cheaper and, as a result, we will be able to sell more of them.
But it is not only our exporters who are disadvantaged by Australia's indirect tax regime. Our import competing industries are also affected. Most of Australia's trading partners opted long ago to ditch their wholesale sales tax systems and now operate some version of a goods and services or value added tax. In most cases, these regimes allow for the rebating of all sales taxes levied on business inputs and do not levy tax on exports. Such foreign goods compete in Australia against goods which not infrequently carry a substantial hidden sales tax burden.
The net effect of these rather perverse tax arrangements is to reduce the competitiveness of Australian exports and increase the competitiveness of foreign exports into Australia. These arrangements work as a kind of `negative tariff' on both imports and exports. The government's plan addresses this competitive barrier facing Australian industry.
Under the plan, GST levied on the cost of business inputs  will be fully rebateable. No GST will be levied on exports.    GST will be charged at 10 per cent on imports to Australia, the same rate of tax as will apply to domestically produced goods. This will put Australia's exporters and import competing industries on a level footing with their international competitors and make a positive contribution to the balance of trade and the current account.
It is sometimes argued by economists that such improvements in international competitiveness and the balance of trade will be short lived and that the improvement in our trade position will lead to an appreciation in the currency which will offset improvements in our competitiveness in export markets.
I was very interested to read such an argument  recently, on an Internet site prepared by the Australian Labor Party. It is a worthwhile effort and it is very important that they should put some stuff on their Internet sites rather than vandalising the Liberal Party's. The relevant article, imaginatively titled `Economic Snake Oil: The Oversold Advantages of a GST', puts the argument in the following terms:
In fact, the competitive advantage from the introduction of a GST or VAT will be offset over time by a rise in the exchange rate. What exporters might gain from a GST, they lose over time from an increase in the price of the Australian dollar.
I must confess that sometimes I treat the economic arguments advanced by the Labor Party a little bit lightly, and I am afraid I was also tempted to treat the shadow treasurer's description of the enormous achievements that Labor made over 13 years even more lightly. But this particular argument did catch my attention.
In fact, it is a mirror image of Paul Keating's famous J-curve—an inverted J-curve. We all remember that Mr Keating had a fantastic way with words and, for a little while, the J-curve did catch the public imagination and entered into the lexicon. No sooner did that happen, than Mr Keating decided he would be better off not speaking about it again and it vanished from the lexicon. But the simple fact is that the exchange rate is a 
 much more complex creature than economic purists would have us believe. Nonetheless, even if we take economists at their word and accept that any improvement in competitiveness would be offset—in that lovely economists' phrase—`over time' by an appreciation in the exchange rate, Australia would still be better off.
The current account is about a lot more than just imports and exports. It also reflects significant financial flows, particularly the servicing of accumulated debt. An appreciated exchange rate makes this task much easier. It also lowers the cost of imported capital goods or intellectual property. This is important, not just from an abstract economic perspective, but in terms of Australia's economic and employment growth and long-term economic prospects.
The Leader of the Opposition has often criticised the government's tax plan on the basis of a partial, incomplete and partisan analysis. Not only does he treat the GST as though it was being introduced in isolation—rather than as part of a comprehensive plan for the reform of Australia's tax system—but he also overlooks its capacity to contribute to reducing a major barrier to economic growth and job creation—a barrier he knows about quite well.
On 31 August 1995, the Leader of the Opposition, in his former role as the Minister for Finance, delivered a speech to the Economist Intelligence Unit, titled `Managing the Long Upswing'. In that speech, the Leader of the Opposition said:
What we want as a nation, and what we are working steadily towards is sustained high jobs growth and low interest rates for Australia . . . There are challenges in this process . . . Historically, Australia has found it difficult to put together the low interest rates/high growth equation in a sustained way. Deficits on the current account have at different times been a serious constraint and are again today . . . A current account deficit is no bad thing in itself. Australia has almost always had one . . . The problem is when the current account deficit gets too high . . . In the past, Australia's current account deficit has tended to shoot up when growth did. This was usually followed by increased interest rates to stop demand spilling over into too many imports. 

In other words, the current account imposes a speed limit  which prevents the economy from growing as quickly as it otherwise might. Given that economic growth is the major generator of employment, anything that contributes to easing the current account speed limit would be highly beneficial. The government's reforms will make such a contribution.
The Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party are, however, proposing to block them for reasons which seem to have more to do with politics than with jobs. But then Labor has always played politics with the GST since it abandoned option C in 1985. In 1993 and 1998 Labor adopted a policy of blanket opposition to the coalition's tax reforms. Nonetheless, Mr Keating said that, if defeated, the Labor Party would not oppose the passage of the reforms through the Senate. The current Leader of the Opposition, on the other hand, said that if Labor were defeated, it would continue to oppose the passage of the GST.
Mr Keating wanted to put up maximum barriers against losing government. His successor wanted to lay the groundwork for a populist second-term agenda in opposition.
The outcomes of the elections were different. In 1993 Labor won and was faced with the reality that it could not sustain its promises. Labor increased taxes and, from the 1993 budget on, the Keating government's credibility and standing were terminally damaged. In 1998 Labor lost the election, so it does not have to face Mr Keating's dilemmas but it does have to confront quite substantial problems of a different sort—the problems flowing from the political consequences of obstructionism.
There has been much discussion about the notion of a mandate since the election, and the shadow treasurer continued that discussion today. I personally gave up political philosophy some time ago when I was asked, `Is that wall really there?' but it seems to me that the ultimate mandate in Australian politics is bestowed by winning a majority of seats in the House of Representatives. This gives a party the authority of government and the capacity to pass legislation through the House. This authority is diminished when, as in the 
 case of the Keating government, it is used to overturn the government's fundamental campaign commitments.
—You used to work for Malcolm Fraser. How can you say that?
—Well, listen very carefully in that case. It is enhanced when used to implement such commitments. This is what this government is doing in the case of the tax reform package. The government made its intentions clear to the electorate during the campaign and won a majority of seats in this House. It now has the unambiguous responsibility to implement the platform on which it stood and on which it was elected. It is doing so.
The problem for Labor is that its response, day by day, falls into the trap of political negativism and obstructionism. The simple meaning of that is opposition for its own sake. I believe that the Australian people concede a wide role for oppositions, but they will not wear obstructionism.
The fact is that Labor is not just opposing the GST but also opposing broader tax reform which is seen as important in itself and long overdue. Labor is opposing income tax cuts, worth $13 billion, which will see over 80 per cent of Australians having a marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less. Labor is opposing family tax measures which provide real benefits to families with children. Labor is opposing the abolition of wholesale sales tax.
Beyond this, Labor's ability to play politics with the tax reform package has been fundamentally undermined by its obstruction of the government's 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance. This obstruction is not justified by policy good sense nor by political imperatives nor by campaign declarations. The private health insurance rebate will put cash in people's pockets where it is needed. The good sense of the rebate is there in terms of taking the burden off public hospitals, and it is widely appreciated.
Overall, as a consequence of Labor's actions, I believe that the public is rapidly being persuaded that not only does Labor not have any policies but its only mission is obstructionism—obstructionism designed to 
 destroy popular and effective measures proposed by this government. I believe the Australian people will punish Labor for this. I commend the bills to the House.
Sitting suspended from 6.27 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—The A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Bill 1998  and cognate bills before the House tonight are amongst the most pernicious pieces of taxation legislation this House has ever considered. They are harshly regressive in impact. They are very bad for most small businesses. They tackle yesterday's tax problems to the extent that they will ameliorate problems in the taxation system. They are addressed to problems that used to exist or problems that are increasingly going to be irrelevant to the real issues that we face in dealing with systemic taxation problems. They do not deal with tomorrow's problems—the problems that are coming down the track. They are designed to ensure that a fiscal straitjacket encumbers all future national governments—prevents them from being able to pursue national agendas in areas such as health, education and transport in order that these areas are left up to the states. Indeed, they also place something of a uniformity straitjacket around the states at the same time.
This should come as no surprise to students of history. This is the traditional role of the Liberal Party and the National Party in Australian politics. If we look back through the past, we will see numerous examples of taxation legislation, particularly in the early stages of a new government, that have been introduced specifically for the purpose of inducing a redistribution of the tax burden away from the better off to the worse off in our community.
For example, in 1950 the Menzies government introduced steps into the income tax scales rather than the continuous progression that had prevailed before. They also replaced the previous system of rebates with tax deductions. Both of these initiatives designed to favour the better off. In 1977 the then relatively new Fraser government introduced substantial changes to the income tax system by cutting the top marginal rate and reducing 
 the number of steps from seven to four. The net effect of these changes was substantially regressive. They diminished the income tax burden on better off taxpayers and increased the burden, in effect, on lower income earners. So the Liberal Party and the National Party have a lot of form in this area. They are playing true to form in the legislation before the House tonight.
This is all about rewarding the better off in the community, the people who predominantly vote for them, and it is all about hitting the lower income sections of the community, the people who predominantly do not vote for them. That is precisely what this legislation is doing. If you look at their own figures, you will see that they estimate that a person on $20,000 a year or thereabouts will be roughly $1.20 per week better off as a result of this legislation, as a result of the shift in the tax mix from direct to indirect taxes. They also say that people on salaries of around $80,000 a year will be better off by about $75 per week—people such as members of this House.
Even if you accept their figures—and we do not; we say that people at the lower end of the scale will actually be substantially worse off as a result of the changes that they are introducing—at face value, that in itself demonstrates the extreme regressivity of this tax package. A GST by itself is regressive but, when you use the proceeds to give massive income tax cuts to people at the higher end of the scale, then you compound that regressivity.
Their proposals mean that 52 per cent of the net value of their tax cuts are going to go to the top 20 per cent of income earners in this community. The only defence they can offer to this is wrapped up in the word `incentive'. They say that, if you reduce the tax burden on higher income earners, people will have more incentive to work, to save and the like. There are many studies on this issue and they produce conflicting results. There is no clear proof that increasing the returns to higher income earners through less taxation will produce more incentives for people to work. 
It is amusing to note Tim Fischer's defence of this particular position when, during the election campaign, he told his no doubt bemused audience that the reason the bulk of the tax cuts were going to higher income earners was that `we're not communists'. We are all very pleased that Tim has cleared up that confusion. Anybody out there who was actually worried that he was a communist can now feel safe that he is actually not a communist. But the implication in his statement is that any form of substantial redistribution from wealthy people, from well-off people and from higher income earners to those people who are battling, to those people who do not have lots of money, is, by definition, communism according to his term.
Under Labor, as in the rest of the Western world over the 1980s and early 1990s, market incomes did grow more unequal because of market pressures. But, under Labor, as research by people like Ann Harding has found, the effect of that was counterbalanced by the action of government over that time. What this government is doing in contrast is throwing petrol on the raging flames of the fire of inequality, which is already substantially growing, rather than putting in place the social wage measures to effectively restrain that growing inequality.
The GST is also going to be a nightmare for many small businesses. Many will have a very complex stocktake process they will have to go through in order for the changeover to occur so they know which of their particular goods already in stock will not have a GST applying to them. There is a built-in bias in favour of large businesses who will get the bulk of the benefit from their ability to hold the cash that is given to them courtesy of the GST and earn interest off that cash, even though there is a provision for differential times.
Because the GST is effectively a tax on a margin, there is a bias built in for big businesses like Coles-Myer as against your small local milk bar, as was very ably demonstrated by the honourable member for Kingston in an MPI debate on this issue late last week. Because those businesses, by definition, have to run higher margins because they are much 
 smaller—they are usually family businesses—they are going to see their competitiveness vis-a-vis the big businesses who are engaged in selling the same products eroded because of the effect of the GST.
I note with some amusement that the $500 million package that is supposedly going to be provided as start-up assistance for small businesses to implement the GST is not dealt with in this legislation. We look forward to it appearing at some stage. There is no question that, for many businesses, this will be inadequate. When you add the problems they will have with respect to the introduction of the GST to the problems such as the year 2000 difficulty, you will see that many small businesses are going to have a prolonged nightmare with the introduction of this legislation.
It is also claimed by the government that this change to the tax system will produce $3 billion worth of revenue courtesy of the fact that the so-called black economy is captured. It is worth noting that experience elsewhere suggests that this is a fanciful claim. Avoidance of GST equivalents in Europe—in countries like Spain, Italy and Germany—is rampant. What this legislation ignores is that the problems that are emerging, such as with Internet commerce and such as with the proliferation of personal services—an increasingly substantial component of our economy—are not addressed by a GST; they are in fact exacerbated by it. We have got substantial difficulties on the taxation front as a result of the changing structure of our economy. The GST is an answer to yesterday's problems. It is not an answer to the problems that are coming down the track; it is not an answer to the issues that we have to deal with—it is an answer to yesterday's problems.
Avoidance, which will proliferate with the GST, is also going to make the GST more regressive. In terms of the different types of goods and services that people buy, consider the typical household budget of a low income family. What it does not include is things like Internet commerce. What it does not include is things like personal services: nannies and gardeners and all those sorts of things. All those are things which it will be easy to avoid 
 a GST on. But what it does include is rent, what it does include is supermarket purchases and what it does include is school books and all of these basic things where the GST will not be avoidable. So the problem of avoidance, which will be substantial, is going to further compound the regressivity that is already inherent to this proposal.
The overall structure and architecture of this taxation scheme are designed to create a fiscal straitjacket for future national governments, in particular future Labor governments. It proposes to guarantee all of the GST revenue to the states in lieu of a basket of state taxes. It is notable that this guarantee is not legislated. In fact, apparently it is referable indirectly to the 13 November agreement which the Commonwealth concluded with the states. If it is ever challenged in court, that agreement should raise some very interesting and peculiar issues of statutory interpretation, especially when you have got some states which have recorded their disagreement with particular issues in the agreement itself.
It also raises questions about what will occur if changes are subsequently made to the horizontal fiscal equalisation principle. Changes have in fact been mooted in this context. It may well then render this commitment to the states completely invalid. The government estimates that the replacement of the financial assistance grants by the GST revenue will produce a net positive flow to the states of $370 million in the year 2003-04, $1.25 billion net positive to the states in 2004-05 and ultimately an additional $7 billion to the states. The states quibble with these figures. New South Wales thinks there will be two years, between 2002-03 and 2004-05, when they will be left in the lurch. Clearly the Commonwealth has failed to deal with that issue. Nonetheless, in the longer term, if the government's figures are correct or even vaguely correct, there will be a substantial net increase in money going to the states.
This will mean that there will be ongoing and mounting pressure on other Commonwealth payments to the states, particularly specific purpose payments. Forty-six per cent of current payments by the Commonwealth to the states consist of specific purpose pay 
 ments. It is about $15 billion at the moment. These cover things like health, schools and local government—a whole range of particular specific purpose payments. If there is legislation guaranteeing that to the states, as the GST revenue rises the Commonwealth, particularly as it is facing an ageing population and an increased burden on social security payments, is going to get squeezed. Where is that squeeze going to be manifested? I will tell you where it will be manifested: it will affect specific purpose payments to the states. If there is still a conservative government—which we hope there will not be—the Commonwealth will turn around and say, `We are now letting you have all this GST revenue, so we're going to cut back on the specific purpose payments.'
It is designed to produce this outcome. That is precisely the objective. It is designed to ensure that future governments will be forced to retreat from national agendas in areas like health, education and transport. In an era when even conservatives, even employer organisations, are seeing the need for things like a national agenda in areas such as curriculum, it is just an absurdity that we should be creating a fiscal straitjacket that is designed specifically to preclude that and to force these issues back to the states—back to the bad old days when six different things happened on one front and where you had all the problems associated with differential approaches being taken when what was really needed was a national approach.
The regressive effect that is inherent to this package is compounded by the inadequacy of the compensation and the arrangements being made with respect to price monitoring. The four per cent increase being offered for pensioners is in fact a half a per cent increase. It has been double counted with the 3½ per cent increase that was automatically going to be theirs because of the nexus with average weekly earnings—25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The GST compensation, so-called, will automatically be gobbled up to a significant extent by increases in rent for public tenants.
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—That is the absolute literal truth, because their rental rates are related to their incomes, so the rent rates will automatically go up.
Self-funded retirees, people in some cases in their late fifties, are being given $3,000 to compensate them for the impact of the GST. These people, who have paid income tax for many years and have had their tax based on their earnings for many years, suddenly face, at the time when they are shifting from a period when they are earning a lot to a period when they are actually spending a lot, the fact that suddenly the tax regime is shifting to spending. They are getting $3,000 for what could be 30 years or more of expenditure. That $3,000 is not going to compensate them for very much.
On the question of the government's assumptions, if you actually look at some of the detail here and at some of the figures that were published in the election, you will see that they assume that for certain levels of income, certainly ordinary income earning categories, an extra child in the family will increase their GST burden at the rate of 30c a week—30c a week. That is a very cheap child. That is a child that presumably is locked away in a cupboard with no clothes and no food. That is an absurdity. The government's assessments about the compensation and about the net outcomes for people in this whole new arrangement for taxation are based on absurd calculations that defy commonsense, defy reality and defy the experience of the ordinary individual.
This GST package is inherently regressive and inherently unfair, and it is made doubly so by some of its specific features. It has massive tax cuts for the wealthy. It is a huge burden for many small businesses. It will not tackle the problem of avoidance and, in fact, the avoidance problem will exacerbate the regressivity that is inherent to the package. It is designed to preclude future federal governments from being able to pursue national agendas on issues like health and education which, in themselves, are a very important means of contributing to reducing inequality and disadvantage in our community.
Many journalists criticised Labor for not supporting tax reform. We do not support what people opposite call tax reform. We do not see that as tax reform; we see that as tax regression. We do not see it as addressing the key issues that are problems in our tax system at the moment—the interplay between the social security system and the tax system, insufficient incentives to work, problems with people going into the higher marginal rates, and those sorts of things. We sought to address those issues in the election, and a majority of the Australian community voted against the GST. A very substantial majority of the Australian community voted for parties in the Senate which explicitly opposed the GST.
We are going to fight to the end on this issue. We support tax reform, but this is not tax reform—this is tax regression; this is going back to the bad old days. This is precisely what the conservative parties in this country have always stood for. It is throwing more fuel on the flames of inequality in our community. Inequality is a very serious problem which is growing despite the best efforts of the previous government. It will continue to grow and it will ultimately overwhelm this country, which has traditionally prided itself on being decent, civilised, egalitarian and compassionate. We cannot afford this legislation in Australia. It will set us back decades.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1998-12-07,"—It is interesting to listen to those opposite huff and puff and claim that the tax system which this government inherited is in some way fair and equitable for Australia as we approach the next millennium. Everyone knows that the taxation system in this country is in dire need of fundamental reform. Everyone accepts that it is entirely inappropriate that, in a couple of years time, people on close to average weekly earnings will find themselves in the top marginal tax rate. It is also entirely inappropriate that the 1930s tax system which we have in Australia, and which has been abandoned by virtually every other country in the world, should continue to be the tax system 
 we have. It is now an impediment to Australia's ability to compete internationally for job creating investment.
Let us get back to the facts. Our government is introducing a tax system for which it has a mandate. Before the election, we announced to the Australian people that we believed it was necessary to have real, meaningful, fundamental and equitable tax reform in Australia. The Prime Minister outlined a number of benchmarks against which tax reform would be judged. When the tax plan was announced prior to the election, there was national debate over the various matters included in it. We all know—and the opposition has criticised the fact—that there are substantial income tax cuts to benefit Australians.
We believe that lower tax rates create incentive. They create the opportunity for businesses to grow and invest and, most importantly, they assist in the creation of real long-term jobs. We abolish 10 taxes, including the unfair, inequitable and arbitrary wholesale sales tax. We have a compensation package for people in receipt of pensions and benefits. Prior to the introduction of the goods and services tax, there will be a four per cent boost in pensions and benefits. There is a guarantee that the rate of pensions and benefits will stay at least 1½ per cent above the price impact of inflation.
It is also interesting to note that independent Treasury calculations said that the price impact of our tax plan will merely be a 1.9 per cent increase in inflation. When one looks at the four per cent boost in pensions and benefits and the guarantee that pensions and benefits will stay 1½ per cent above the cost of any rate of inflation, it is very clear that the government has kept its pledge to make sure that people who are in need of compensation receive it.
The Sunshine Coast, like many other areas throughout the nation, strongly supported the government's plan for tax reform. Over the years, politics has not been well served by the way in which one party opposes reform plans of the other. In the 1980s, the Labor Party knew there was a need for a broad based consumption tax. We all remember option C. 
 We all recall how then Treasurer Keating and the people who are currently in very senior positions in the ALP supported the principle of what was effectively a GST.
In 1993, we brought forward a tax plan and sought the backing of the people at that time. The Labor Party was entirely hypocritical in that, while in the 1980s it had supported the principle of a GST, it opposed our proposals in 1993. In 1998, this government, led by this Prime Minister, had the courage to stand before the Australian people, bringing forward a very broad based raft of meaningful reforms and seeking the support of the Australian people for it. When we got that support, the Labor Party said, in effect, `We know you won the election. We know the people of Australia voted for you to have this mandate, but we are seeking to thwart the will of the people.'
The Labor Party reform plans were merely to fiddle at the edges. However, they wanted to grab the assets of senior Australians retrospectively. They wanted to bring in a retrospective capital gains tax, despite the fact that in 1985, when the capital gains tax was introduced by the Labor Party, they said that all assets owned at the time of the introduction of the capital gains tax would not be brought within its reach. But in 1998, the Labor Party paid very heavily because the people of Australia decided that that was not the appropriate way to go. The Labor Party also considers that the wholesale sales tax, which is levied at seven rates from zero up to 45 per cent, is somehow fair. It is completely arbitrary, outdated and unfair and it is destroying our future in many areas.
The Labor Party's approach to tax reform was to bring in a few tax credits. Most people believe that those tax credits were poorly targeted, unfair and inequitable. Labor said that they wanted to tax jets and caviar, and yet they believe it is in some way appropriate that items which are currently taxed should remain taxed and items which are free of the wholesale sales tax net should remain free.
Let us look at some of the exemptions to the wholesale sales tax. Recently the Australian Taxation Office was involved in a ruling that frozen yoghurt was exempt from whole 
 sale sales tax as long as it was above a certain temperature or pH level. This kind of nonsense is outdated and not accepted by the Australian people. On 3 October when the election was held the people of Australia voted against the system we have at the moment and they voted for our tax plan, which will see 10 taxes abolished, including the wholesale sales tax, substantial income tax cuts and compensation for those people in the Australian community deserving of compensation.
The new tax system will deliver income tax cuts worth $13 billion. Marginal income tax rates for ordinary workers will be reduced dramatically. It was interesting to listen to the honourable member for Melbourne when he tried to maintain that it is somehow in the interests of Aussie battlers for the current tax rates to remain in place.
Mr Martin interjecting—
—The shadow minister ought not to interject; he ought to stand up and apologise for being part of a party which sought to retrospectively tax with a capital gains tax the assets owned by Australians.
—Vulnerable old Australians.
—As the minister at the table says, they were striking at vulnerable old people, and those people reacted very dramatically when the Labor Party was not elected on 3 October.
It should be noted that, following the introduction of the tax plan, the top marginal tax rate for 81 per cent of taxpayers will be 30 per cent or less. That is a very major step forward. The minister at the table is one of the very strong supporters in the government of this tax plan.
It is important to recognise that our tax system ought to clamp down on tax cheats and those people who do not pay their fair share, and that will indeed happen under our tax plan. I am particularly disappointed that the Labor Party has sought to frustrate the decision of the Australian people. This is a very good plan. It is a very substantial plan. It is a plan which was overwhelmingly supported by the people of Australia. Yet, regrettably, we find that the Labor Party is prepared 
 to do absolutely anything to prevent the implementation of this real and meaningful tax reform. If we are not successful in bringing our plan into legislative effect it will be many years before another government is again prepared to grasp the nettle, to stand up and be counted, and seek the support of the Australian people.
One aspect of our plan that I do want to mention in particular is the very many benefits for small business. On the Sunshine Coast, which I am privileged to represent in this parliament, small business is very important. Small business is the engine room of the Australian economy and it is responsible for the creation of an enormous percentage of jobs in this country. The Labor Party will be interested in this: small business costs will be reduced by three per cent after our income tax reforms. Other benefits will also flow to small business. Payment arrangements for the GST will deliver a cash flow benefit to most businesses. For businesses with sales less than $50,000, registration as a GST payer will be optional. Tax payments will be streamlined to a simple pay-as-you-go system of regular instalments. Most businesses will make only one payment each quarter on one form for all their taxes. Paperwork involved in registration and reporting will be cut.
Up to $500 million in financial assistance for small and medium sized businesses will reduce the start-up costs of a GST. Cost to exporters will fall 3.5 per cent and Australian exporters will gain some $4½ billion a year. Most importantly, provisional tax and the provisional tax uplift factor will be abolished. The government will consult with business on the taxation treatment of business investment with the prospect of further capital gains tax relief and movement towards a company tax rate of 30 per cent.
The Labor Party has spent some time in this debate seeking to criticise the regime that will be in place to ensure that price reductions are passed on. The minister at the table will be responsible for legislation which will ensure that the people of this country will receive the flow on benefits from our tax reform. This government is absolutely determined to ensure that there is no profiteering and that the 
 benefits that will flow right through the community are in fact received by consumers.
The principal manner of this occurring will be through the impact of competition, but we will, through certain amendments to be introduced into the parliament, have provisions in place which will ensure that profiteering, should it occur, will be met with the full force of the law. Independent retirees will receive benefits, as will aged people. Families will be given new opportunities as a result of this legislation.
Part of our tax plan included the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, a policy strongly supported by my constituents. I want to place on the record my very strong urging of the opposition to accept that people in all electorates, both those held by the coalition and those held by Labor, believe in the private health insurance rebate. When one looks at the percentages of the community in various electorates who are covered by private health insurance, it is clear that many Labor electorates have a very high proportion of private health insurance coverage. Indeed, the battlers of Australia are the people who are scrimping and saving and struggling to pay their private health insurance, but regrettably they are the people whom the Labor Party wants to kick in the teeth through its refusal to accept our mandate to bring in the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.
This rebate would make it possible to put a platform under the decline in the percentage of the Australian community covered by private health insurance. It would make sure that many people who were currently finding it extremely difficult to stay in a private health insurance system would be able to do so. It ought to be noted also that a healthy private health system ensures a healthy public health system.
The legislation before the chamber is a broad change to Australia's tax system. The Prime Minister and the government have displayed great courage in being prepared to stand up prior to the election and say that we believe that Australia deserves better as we approach the next century. Our tax plan contains the scrapping of 10 Labor taxes, including the wholesale sales tax. It includes 
 dramatic reductions in personal income tax. It includes a reduction in fuel tax. It includes fair compensation packages for those people who are deserving of compensation, including recipients of pensions and other beneficiaries, as well as retirees. This is a fair package. It is a package for which the Australian people voted and I would urge the Labor Party to respect the mandate of the government to bring in this new tax system as we approach the next millennium.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—A bit over three years ago, John Howard told all Australians there was no way he would introduce a goods and services tax. He said, on 2 May 1995:
A GST or anything resembling it is no longer Coalition policy. Nor will it be policy at any time in the future. It is completely off the political agenda in Australia.
Yet here we are debating the tax that we were never ever going to have, with the government proposing to put it through the Senate using the vote of a senator it was never ever going to accept. It is precisely this kind of conduct that causes present day cynicism about politics and politicians, where a government promises no GST and then says, `Yes, let us have a GST.' It says it is not going to use the vote of Senator Colston and then says, `We need the vote of Senator Colston, therefore we are prepared to accept it.'
It ought to be noted that the Senate was elected back in 1996 and that half of the senators elected then continue to serve. This government is intent on getting this legislation to a Senate that at least in half measure was elected on the basis of both government and opposition senators saying they would never ever support a GST. Those are the kinds of political standards being shown by this government, bringing this House into disrepute as a result.
The GST is one of the most regressive, unfair pieces of legislation ever to be introduced into this House. It is a tax from the big end of town to slug the small end of town, a tax that will forever change financial relations between our three levels of government for the worse, a tax that will rise and rise, a tax that will do nothing for employment creation 
 and a tax that involves in part some $13 billion in tax cuts, of which 52 per cent will go to the top 20 per cent of income earners. We see here the Liberal Party agenda exposed for what it has always been—an attempt to transfer money away from those who are not well off, away from battlers and the disadvantaged, towards those who are already well off.
When this government came in they said, `We have this terrible black hole—a $10 billion black hole—and as a result we are going to have to slug ordinary Australians.' They did that in abandoning the Dental Health Care program, increasing the HECS charges and taking the money out of nursing home capital upgrades and the like. Now, when there is a projected $5 billion to $7 billion surplus, what do they say? They do not say, `Let us put the money back into those programs.' Instead we see some $6.6 billion of income tax cuts going to the top 20 per cent of income earners in this country. So we see this government and this Liberal party doing what it has always done—transferring wealth away from those who have less towards those who already have more.
This piece of legislation has come to this House through fraud. Amongst other things, we saw some $17 million worth of taxpayers' funds used to advertise the government's program, with no allowance for a `no' case. If this election were a referendum on the GST, then the government would have lost it with over 51 per cent of the voters on a two-party preferred basis preferring Labor. Equally significant was that only one side of the argument was funded by taxpayers. Some $17 million was used to promote the government's case. As part of that production, they put out this booklet called Tax reform—Not a new tax, a new tax system, and this was distributed to every Australian household—at their expense.
If you go and have a look at the figures in it, you will find, for example, at page 11 reference made to senior Australians, and in particular a happy and smiling Marj and Dave, said to be $23 a week better off after the GST. If you turn over to page 12, you will find Doug and Betty, the self-funded 
 retirees, who are said to be $18 a week better off after the GST. And they too are smiling.
Perhaps they would not be smiling so much if they were aware that, in the calculations that the Treasury used to arrive at these figures, firstly no allowance was made for the abolition of the savings rebate. That is to say, the $2 billion which had been earmarked for savings rebates of up to $450 per annum for those who were eligible for them. These would have been potentially of benefit to pensioners and self-funded retires. The government proposed as part of its tax package to abolish the savings rebate and is proceeding to do so. But no allowance for that has been made in the calculations on pages 11 and 12, and there is no reference anywhere in this booklet to the fact that the savings rebate was going to disappear.
Secondly, the government made no allowance for the application of the assets test. If you look at their assumptions, they have simply assumed that neither Marge nor Dave, neither Doug nor Betty, nor any other aged pensioner or self-funded retiree, will be subject to the assets test. That is a pretty far-fetched assumption in my view and it is one which, once again, was not presented in this booklet. So nobody looking at this booklet would have understood, on the face of it, that the assets test was not being taken into consideration.
Thirdly, the government talked about the aged persons savings bonus and included that in the calculations. So, when they said you would be $20 a week or $18 a week better off, as the case may be, they included that aged persons savings bonus. Yet that is a one-off bonus. It applies for 12 months only. It will not be there after its first year. So on those three counts we find this a most misleading document produced at taxpayers' expense and circulated to all Australian households. There are many flaws in the government's modelling of the tax package and they will become increasingly apparent as this bill makes its way through both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The other matter I want to say something about is the extraordinary claim that every cent of tax reduction is going to be passed on 
 to consumers, an assumption that 100 per cent of reduced costs or charges will be passed on to consumers. This is completely unrealistic. Indeed, Minister Vaile, when he referred to transport costs, said that, because of the high level of competition within the road transport industry, the `majority' of savings would be passed on to consumers as end users of the transport chain. `Majority' is not good enough. The modelling assumes 100 per cent. When the government claims 1.9 per cent in terms of price rises, they are assuming 100 per cent, and we all know that is certainly not going to happen. That figure is simply not credible.
There are a whole series of reasons why I and other Labor members are not prepared to support a GST. Firstly, we will not support it because it transfers the burden to the less well-off. Because it introduces a 10 per cent tax on presently untaxed necessities like food, electricity, gas, books, public transport and all those sorts of things, it transfers the burden to the less well-off.
Secondly, in particular it transfers the burden towards pensioners and retirees. There is simply no effective way of compensating people who have left the work force after a lifetime of work under relatively higher income taxes and relatively lower sales taxes. As for this idea of the one-off compensation package, as my father says to me, `Do you think we're going to stop eating after 12 months?'
Another reason why we are not prepared to support a GST is its impact on small business. It will force small business to become unpaid tax collectors. Presently, something like 80,000 small businesses are involved in the wholesale sales tax collection arrangements. The GST, on the other hand, will involve in the order of a million small businesses. They will be roped into the tax collection net. They will be the victims of substantial compliance costs, both start-up and ongoing compliance costs, as they implement the government's tax reform package.
Certainly, as I went around my electorate and on occasion others, I found in talking to a lot of small businesses and a lot of retailers great concern about the impact of a GST on 
 them. That was one of the reasons why Labor polled over 51 per cent on a two-party preferred vote and, in terms of senators, polled even better than that with something like 60 per cent of the votes for senators being cast for parties and candidates who indicated their opposition to the GST.
The other area that I think is of great concern involves sporting, voluntary and charitable groups. How is this going to impact on them? We have not been able to get from the government straight answers as to what happens when scouts are trying to retail a $2 bar of chocolate, what happens to garage sales, what happens to a whole range of activities being undertaken by not-for-profit organisations.
These matters have not been satisfactorily resolved, nor have the issues involving financial supplies. I have had contact with people in the superannuation industry and in the life insurance industry where the arrangements concerning financial supplies are far from clear. We start coming across anomalies. We have seen the anomalies with the marriages—the civil celebrant marriages compared with the religious marriages—and we have seen the anomalies in the arrangements as they affect credit unions compared with banks and other financial institutions.
We also see in the insurance area, for example, that the legislation specifies life insurances as a financial supply but other insurances are not going to be exempt from GST. So with death and disability cover, which are traditional superannuation fund offers, charges for the death part of the insurance will be exempt from GST but disability cover will presumably attract the GST. That is a most unsatisfactory situation. It is going to make the life of the superannuation funds and others who offer that sort of death and disability cover much more complex than it ought to be, and that will only be at the expense of members of these funds whose benefits will diminish accordingly.
The other thing that ought to be said about this legislation is that it is an absolute stone-cold certainty that the GST will rise, as it has in some 21 out of 23 countries where it has 
 been introduced. In Britain it started at 10 per cent—now 17½ per cent; in New Zealand it started at 10 per cent—now 12½ per cent. As for this lock-in mechanism, it is not even here in the bill before the House. The government are a bit like used car salesmen trying to sell you a used car. You ask where the brakes are, and they say, `Oh, they're still coming. They're going to come later.' Anyone who understands the constitutional arrangements which govern this country and the nature of parliamentary democracy knows that there is no prospect that this parliament can bind a successor parliament or stop the GST being increased if that becomes the wish of a future government or parliament.
On all those counts, I and the opposition reject the GST. We understand it is regressive. We understand the impact it is going to have on ordinary Australians. We had support from ordinary Australians at the last election to put forward the view that we are now putting forward. I urge members of the House of Representatives and senators to understand the impact this bill is going to have on Australia's taxation arrangements, shifting the taxation burden to those who are least able to afford it, to those who are least able to look after themselves. It is an outrageous sleight of hand on the part of this government and it ought to be rejected by all honourable members.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,1998-12-07,"—The Australian Labor Party are desperate on this matter of taxation reform—for a number of reasons. In their arguments to date in the debate we are having on these important bills, they are trying to ignite some sort of cheap class warfare on one hand, and they are trying to complete the chronicle of absolute lies that they offered during the recent federal election campaign on the other. In some sort of weird and wonderful way they are trying to hold some sort of faith with their supporters by carrying through the lies they uttered to try to get votes in the 3 October election and by repeating them in this place.
They have shown that they do not understand the federation of states, the fact that our constitution clearly defines a role for each state parliament as well as for the chambers 
 in this place, and that there are 13 separate chambers in this country that would have to agree to an increase in a goods and services tax. Once it is introduced, an increase in the rate could come only if 13 chambers were to agree to that measure.
The only people talking about a GST increasing at some point in time are the Australian Labor Party. They get up day after day asking questions about increasing the tax. So we now know. Their secret agenda is exposed. If at some stage in the future those opposite form government in this country you know that one of the first things they are going to do is what they always do—in typical Australian Labor Party style, they will  increase tax.
The debate to date has shown very clearly yet again that we know exactly what the Labor Party are against but we have yet to find out what they stand for. As I said in my opening comments, they are absolutely desperate to defeat this measure. They will not defeat it here in the House of Representatives but over in the Senate they want to use every means possible to try to delay and defeat it, because they know all too clearly that their carefully woven web of lies during the 3 October election campaign will be exposed, once the government's tax reform measures are in place. They know that the reforms that the government are putting forward in these bills before us today were supported overwhelmingly by younger Australians who, in particular, wanted to see an end to the ramshackle old system of tax collection that Labor left us before the 1996 election.
So they know that, once it is in place, this new taxation system—which the government have proposed and put before the people of Australia to get their permission to propose it in this place—will prove an absolute disaster for the Australian Labor Party's electoral prospects in the future. They know for a fact that an entire generation of voters will be affected by the fact that they were misled by Labor in such great measure in the lead-up to the last election. They know that there will be an entire generation of Australians who will pass on to their children—and I dare say will also influence their parents and their grand 
 parents—that Labor are not interested in good policy but simply in perpetuating scare and lie tactics. They do not mind if they hurt the innocent by some of the utterings they are offering here and some of the nonsense they offered during the election campaign. They do not mind if they pick on older Australians—anything to get a vote. If you listen to those opposite, you would swear that the sky is falling in, that parts of people's anatomies are going to be lopped off as a result of the taxation reform agenda the government are proposing here.
Yet the central premise of what the government have on their agenda is to help Australia, to help Australians. This is good policy that is going to be good for this country, not  only because it is going to set up our exporters and our small business sector in such a way that jobs will be created and markets will be realised as our prices and the competitive nature of the goods we produce improve, but also because it will help each individual Australian.
The government have set out to put forward to the people of Australia a very clear-cut agenda. I know that I received an absolute mandate from the people in my electorate, as did a majority of members in this place receive a mandate from the people in their electorate, to push forward with the government's reform agenda that was clearly stated for all to consider. Despite all the efforts of those opposite and their henchmen in the electorate of Moreton and the absolute nonsense and deliberate hurt they inflicted upon constituents of mine to try and get a vote, I am here today to support the government's agenda.
This is the most comprehensive reform of the Australian taxation system in the history of the federation of this wonderful country. It is timely that we are proposing such reforms in the face of a new millennium—a new century. Yes, we are going to hear a lot of talk about the new century and the new millennium over this 39th Parliament. But this government that is now in place is prepared to face the prospect of turning our back on the old in order to bring about the good new.
Our current outdated, inefficient tax system—the tax system which those members opposite are prepared to support and prepared to hurt people in the process of supporting—has to go. We have to see a reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations. We do not want to see a continuation of the year in year out uncertainty as governments from the states come here, cap in hand, attempting to get a certain lick of money here or a lick of money there. We want to make sure that income tax for families and average wage earners is fairer. We want to reintroduce incentive for people who want to go out and earn a little bit more. This is all part of the plan that was put to the people, and the people in my electorate and the people in the majority of electorates in this country endorsed that plan. The word `mandate' has been used a lot in this debate, and there is no doubt that the government has one, because the people of Australia gave it one.
The Australian Labor Party cannot handle the fact that this government actually took a proposal to the people of Australia. This government took the people inside the confidence of the government's plans, gave them a ton of detail and asked them to approve the detail. The Labor Party cannot stand the fact that today this place is debating a matter that the government has put forward in fulfilment of what we said we would do; unlike 1993 when those opposite were sitting on this side of the chamber as the government and Prime Minister Keating said, `Don't you worry about that,' in the words of a famous Queenslander, `if we are returned, you are going to get tax cuts and there will be no GST.' But, instead, what did they do? The Australian Labor Party came back into power in the 1993 election and up went wholesale sales taxes.
Wholesale sales taxes are taxes that the Australian Labor Party loves because they can increase them by the stroke of a pen in some dark room somewhere around the corridors—in one of the big offices in this building. They are taxes that do not have to come into this chamber for approval as have these tax measures today. We are not doing anything that we said we would not do. We are doing 
 exactly what we proposed. We have proved it. We put the policy forward and the people of Australia approved it for us. Our aim is to make our country far more productive and far more competitive than it currently is. We want to help our exporters. We want to deliver more jobs. We want to increase the standard of living of all Australians.
This is the first part of a package of measures that will bring about this new tax system by 1 July 2000. It will provide a modern, broad based low-rate goods and services tax. That is the central hallmark of the way the system will work. But hand in hand with that, up to 10 taxes that the Australian Labor Party seem to dearly love will go. Hand in hand with that will be massive personal income tax cuts, and an increase in the tax-free threshold which will mean that low income earners will automatically get the benefit of additional money without having to pay tax on it. But at the heart of what the government's measures are about is empowering the average Australian—which again is something that those opposite do not like, as can be seen by the union boss oriented tantrums that they throw in here from time to time. They do not like the idea of individuals actually having some control over their own destiny. They do not like the idea of empowerment.
The real problem we have in this country is the complexity of the taxation system, and all those opposite talk about is trying to make it even more complex. The complexity of the system is felt by average Australians. It cannot be underestimated how annoyed average Australians are about the complexity of the system that the Australian Labor Party want to hold on to. The problem is that if people cannot feel confident in the sum total of the tax acts that make up this country's system, and if they cannot cope with all the changes and the unbelievable complexities, they simply will find ways and means to get around the system. They will turn their back on the system. They have no faith in the law if it is bad law. Consumers at other levels simply turn their back on a product that does not meet their particular levels of satisfaction—and that is true of our taxation system.
I would ask those opposite to reconsider their position. This government was elected to do what we are currently doing. If those opposite are so confident that what we have proposed is so bad for Australia, let these bills pass not only the House of Representatives but also the Senate. By the time the next election comes around in late 2001, if those opposite are right and the system is so bad, people will vote us out. Labor might then be able to do what they want to do; that is, increase the GST.
But, no, they do not want these bills to get up. They do not want them to see the light of day because they know very well that the people of Australia will be very happy with what the government has proposed. If this bill passes, Labor will be exposed as the charlatans they are and the con merchants they were during the last election campaign. People want this current government to do more than just simply add to what the previous failed Labor governments have done. People actually want something new. People want to be empowered. They want to make a contribution to this nation by building up their businesses, by being good citizens. When they pay tax they want to know what they are paying for. They want to understand the systems that are involved. People do not mind paying their fair share of tax.
The current tax system—which Labor has had more than a little bit to do with over the past two decades—seems to be keyed more towards helping a lot of people at the big end of town with their trusts and all sorts of interesting arrangements. But there does not seem to be a lot of assistance for the average Australian. Those opposite keep talking about the average Australian and the average worker. I am not sure how many of them have actually tripped over one in recent months. Certainly the election campaign should have flushed a few of them out and got them out to meet people. If they had actually spoken to average Australians, people would have said, `Let's get a fairer and simpler and more easily understood taxation system.'
The taxation system in this country cannot be underestimated for the impact that it has not just on economic wellbeing but also on 
 the social fabric of this nation, because the tax system can either create envy or dispel it. It can create or destroy jobs. It can promote or suppress growth. It can create or put completely under strain social justice. It can create opportunities for those who want to work hard, but it can also discourage effort. A number of people have said to me that they would like to work overtime, but the current tax system—the one Labor wants to defend at all costs—is all about discouraging people who want to work harder and earn extra in overtime, because people on about 1.4 times average weekly earnings start to pay the top rate of tax. It is a system that has got to go. If those opposite were fair dinkum in caring about the workers and battlers of this country they would support the package of bills before the House.
We no longer need a taxation system which seems to be more about maintaining the system and the bureaucracy that runs it than getting good outcomes from it for the average Australian. We need to make sure that people are able to make a fair and equitable contribution to the running of this nation. We need a law that has universal support, a law that is fair and easily understood. Otherwise, if it is not easily understood, if it is not easily adhered to or easily respected by those it is supposed to govern, of course it is a law that is destined to be broken.
We can make tax laws in this country more transparent. Nothing can be more transparent and more easily understood than a standard rate of tax across a wide range of goods and services in this country. It is no longer fair to burden those who produce things—goods—ahead of those who provide services. It is no longer realistic. This is 1998. I remind members of the Labor Party opposite, and those who may be listening in to this debate, that they should search inside their hearts and realise the workers they claim to represent—it may be more folklore than fact—are going to be in far more secure jobs as a result of the businesses they work for having this sort of taxation system in place.
The taxation reforms proposed by this government are good for Australia; they are good for average Australians. They will be 
 good for people in my electorate. I am pleased that the majority of people in the electorate of Moreton saw through the phoney campaign and the outrageous claims that were made in my electorate by those opposite and their henchmen. We have such an unfair, complex and outdated taxation system, yet it is constantly being defended by those opposite. We need a system that no longer delivers the worst possible result, especially to low income earners, to self-funded retirees and to pensioners, along with the small business sector. They are the sorts of people for whom this government is prepared to champion this cause.
We are in favour of heading towards the new millennium with a modern taxation system, something that will have a positive impact on the social fabric of this nation. I ask those opposite to reconsider their simple opposition for opposition's sake mantra that they seem to constantly chant in debates in this place.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—I was listening very intently to the member for Moreton. These goods and services tax bills put into effect what the member for Moreton calls `tax reform'. I prefer to refer to it as `tax change' because these bills are simply about shifting the burden from the big end of town to those in the Australian community who can least afford to carry that burden. There are really only three tests for a tax system, in my view.
The first is the relative size of the tax take, as a percentage of the size of the economy. I see the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation at the table agreeing with me on that issue. By OECD standards or by any international standard, it has to be said that this country is a low taxing country. It surprises me that the minister at the table denies that fact. It was the Hawke and Keating governments that took us down that path and ensured that the Commonwealth revenue as a percentage of GDP over those 13 years came down significantly.
The second test for any tax system is its progressive nature, whether or not it acts progressively and is effective in ensuring that we use the tax transfer system to help those 
 most in need and tax people on their ability to pay. Again, I think the minister at the table should agree that we have a very progressive tax system in this country, given that such a large slice of government revenue comes from the PAYE system and given that the wholesale sales tax system is in itself progressive in that it taxes luxury goods at a very high rate and exempts the essentials of life. So, given that such a large slice of government revenue comes from the very progressive PAYE system and given that the wholesale sales tax, by its very nature, in the way that it is structured, is progressive in itself, we have by international standards a very progressive tax system in this country.
The third test is the efficiency of our tax system. Here is where the minister at the table will cheer and say, `This is what it is all about.' If the wholesale sales tax leads to any inefficiencies due to the cascading effect that might flow on to exports, that is not a structural problem with the wholesale sales tax. It can be fixed. If the problem is the way it applies to business inputs, exempt them. That is very easily done. These are other issues that can be addressed.
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—If that is your main beef, if you say there is a structural problem with the wholesale sales tax, in the same way that the government says, `This is a terrible tax; it taxes some food but not caviar,' that is simply fixed as well—tax caviar. If you say there are anomalies in the wholesale sales tax—and we recognise that they exist—tax them. The minister at the table is saying, `What about plumbers, accountants and all those people?' I understand that currently the services of accountants, plumbers, electricians and motor mechanics are untaxed. I appreciate the recognition of the minister at the table that all these services, which ordinary Australians are so dependent upon, are currently untaxed.
There are really only two very good reasons for introducing a goods and services tax. The first is that any GST represents a huge revenue raising mechanism for the government; it is a big win for the government. The second is that it adds to the stability of the 
 government's revenue—of course it does. In many senses it is very non-sensitive to economic downturns because people's expenditure or consumption patterns remain largely the same, because those who work within the economy commit so much of their income to the essentials of life. So there are two advantages with respect to a GST but, unfortunately, both of those advantages are seen through the eyes of the government only. I do not see any advantages for the wider Australian community. I can see, though, a great deal of pain for the wider Australian community. The government talks about compensation—and I will not go into all of the issues because the member for Hotham has articulated and outlined them so very well.
I noticed the member for Morton looking a bit nervous because he knows that he will be in trouble in his marginal seat if he looks to be too enthusiastic about the introduction of this tax. Let us put it in simple terms. Let us talk about the last election. I hear members of the government in here claiming a mandate for this tax. This election more than any other was a referendum on one issue—this last election was a referendum on the GST.
And who got the majority of the two-party preferred vote in this country? Who got a larger swing against them than Paul Keating did in 1996? It was John Howard proposing this new and regressive tax on the Australian community. It was John Howard who went to the Australian electorate and told older Australians and those on fixed and lower incomes that if he was re-elected he was going to whack them with a flat 10 per cent tax on every service and good they buy.
There is a very simple way of summing up what is happening here: you cannot take such a large slice out of the progressive PAYE system—which I have already argued is a progressive wholesale sales tax system—and transfer that to a flat tax on everyone, regardless of their income, and pretend it is not going to hurt them. It is as simple as that.	 They can argue all they like. The arithmetic of this measure is as simple as that: a huge whack out of two progressive taxes transferred to a big flat tax on everything you buy, whether it be a good or a service, regardless 
 of your capacity to pay. That is what this tax is about. I said there is no mandate for this new tax, nor do I expect there ever will be.
—What do you mean there is no mandate? Of course there is a mandate. Who is in government?
—You cannot have a mandate with about 48 per cent of the two-party preferred vote. Those who the government were able to convince that a GST might be a good idea for the Australian economy were those who were courted by the prospect of personal income tax cuts—but there were not too many of them. There were not too many of them because most of them were smart enough to realise that these tax cuts are unfunded and are likely to be undelivered. They were pretty quick to work out that about 80 per cent of those income tax benefits are going to 20 per cent of the community, and of course they are the 20 per cent of the community who are earning the most money. So the Australian electorate worked that out pretty quickly.
All this is notwithstanding the fact that the government squandered $20 million or more of taxpayers' money to sell this lousy and regressive tax to the Australian community. The top earners will be okay under this change, if the Senate is foolish enough to pass it, but the people I represent in the Hunter electorate will not be. Low and middle income earners certainly will not be, and certainly small business operators and tourism operators in my electorate will not be better off as a result of this tax.
The tourism sector retails, largely, one commodity—it retails services. It provides services to the community, services hitherto untaxed. A GST is also a tax that ensures that a holiday in Bali is going to be cheaper than a trip from Sydney to Cairns or from Melbourne to Cairns. I was disappointed to see the Minister for Sport and Tourism, who was in here for only a moment, leave, because she is setting the example already by taking a honeymoon in Bali, but I do wish her well on her wedding last Saturday.
Even more so, this is a new tax that is going to hit the small business community for six. This is the tax that is going to create 1.3 
 million unpaid tax collectors. This is a business community already struggling. It is already struggling because the government has failed to match up on the issues really important to it—the market dominance issues. The Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business has been ducking and weaving on the issue of an inquiry on market dominance issues. I am told he might finally be dragged screaming to have something to say about that tomorrow, but he has dropped the ball on the red tape issues, and he has failed to embrace the Bell report. Of course, this is only a feeble attempt to address the real issues in the small business community.
A GST is going to mean huge compliance costs. I have here a document from the New Zealand government's Department of Inland Revenue entitled GST guide: a guide to working with the GST. It says:
We have written this booklet to help all businesses and organisations that have to charge GST and need more information about it. We hope you find this guide helpful when filling in your GST returns. It will show you how you can avoid incurring penalties and how or when GST is refunded to you.
I ask the minister at the table to have a look. It is 80 pages long and, of course, the New Zealand model is generally accepted as one of the more simple forms of a GST in the international community. It is 80 pages, and this is the quick, easy guide to operating a small business under a GST regime in New Zealand! When you open it up, you see a whole plethora of complicated forms that business people in the New Zealand economy have to face daily.
—Will you table it?
—I will be happy to table it, as the minister at the table invites me to do. I am sure it will make great bedtime reading for him tonight. I seek leave to table the document.
Leave granted.
—Contrary to what the government would have us believe, this is a poor, regressive tax which is going to produce huge cash flow problems for the small business sector. As a consequence, it is going to lead to higher operating costs.
This is a poor, regressive tax. I was pleased to see the government finally appoint a consultative committee to look at the impact of the GST—the finer detail of the GST—on the small business sector. I congratulate those people who have been appointed to that committee. I have had the opportunity to meet with them and discuss matters of importance to the sector over the last few weeks. I wish them well in their endeavours, because there is no doubt that there are a number of issues for them to address and Curt Rendall and his team will have to grapple with those over the coming weeks.
The government should make no mistake about the fact that the small business community is, at the very best, ambivalent about these tax changes. I will not call them tax reforms as the government chooses to. You will hear certain representatives of some of the peak bodies—in some cases out of loyalty to the conservative side of politics—say that this is not a bad thing for their members. But, if the minister at the table took the time to walk the streets, the strip developments and the shopping centres and actually talk to the small business community, I can assure him he would find a small business community very concerned about the impact of this tax.
—They love it.
—The minister at the table says that they love it. I have travelled the length and breadth of the country over the last few months as well as talking to my own small business community in my electorate and I have not yet found one small business operator enthusiastic about this tax. I remind the minister at the table that the ABS definition of a small business is one which employs 20 people or less or, in the case of a manufacturing firm, 100 or less. I point out that it is time that he left the big end of town and stopped talking to those who least need assistance. He should get down to the other end and talk to the mum and dad businesspeople of this world and find out what sorts of issues they are facing. Learn for yourself, Minister, that they are horrified by the prospect of the introduction of this tax. They are prepared to listen but, as last week's Yellow Pages Small Business Index showed, you 
 have a long way to go before you convince the small business community that this is a good tax for them.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,1998-12-07,"—I am amazed at the hypocritical nonsense coming from the other side in this debate on the goods and services tax bills. I am absolutely appalled at their head in the sand approach which denies the real need for tax reform in this country. They somehow try to fool themselves into thinking that the current tax system is sustainable or workable.
This tax reform proposal is long overdue. It contains fundamental and widespread reforms that this country needs—reforms that will sweep away the inequities, complexities, contradictions and inefficiences in the current tax system. These reforms are necessary to create a fair system, one that provides incentives to work and to save, one that helps small business, one that helps exporters and one that is sustainable and will take this country into the next century. Yet Labor wants to pretend that the current system is fine. Labor wants to try and defend the indefensible. Labor is opposed to fairness, efficiency and incentive. Labor would rather support a system that is full of inadequacies, inefficiencies, complexities and inequities. Labor would rather tinker at the edges and apply more bandaids than do anything fundamental to improve the tax system in this country.
Anyone who looks at the current system in any amount of detail knows that it is fraught with problems. The direct income tax system and the indirect system are both fundamentally flawed. Compared to other OECD countries, our direct income tax system means we have far too much reliance on income taxes. Tax rates in this country are too high. Not only are they high but they are also constantly rising through the process of bracket creep or fiscal drag.
In 1954 someone on average weekly earnings had a marginal income tax rate of only 17.5 per cent. By next year someone on average weekly earnings will have a marginal income tax rate of 43 per cent and by the year 2003 a marginal income tax rate of 47 per cent. In 1954 someone on average weekly 
 earnings paid an average tax rate of nine per cent; now it is an average tax rate of 25 per cent.
This system of rising marginal and average income tax rates is a system that the Labor Party seeks to defend—a system that is propelling average Australian income earners into higher and higher income tax brackets. In 1970, one per cent of this country was in the top income tax bracket; by the year 2000, 20 per cent will be in the top income tax bracket. Yet this is a system that the Labor Party seeks to try and defend.
The current system is just not fair to battling, hardworking Australians. Not only is the system not fair but it provides no incentives to the average worker to go out and work harder. The average worker who does a bit of overtime is faced with a problem of paying almost 50 cents in the dollar on every extra dollar that they earn. There is no incentive to do overtime, there is no incentive to study, there is no incentive to seek promotion and there is no incentive to save. Yet the Labor Party seeks to support a system that destroys all the incentive in this country.
The only incentive with the current system is an incentive to evade tax and avoid tax—an incentive to promote the burgeoning black economy in this country, a system that the Labor Party would seem to want to support. There is incentive for elaborate tax minimisation, tax avoidance and tax evasion methods. The trouble is that these are available only to the wealthy while the PAYE earner, who does not have access to elaborate tax avoidance schemes, gets slugged the full rate. The problem is that the current tax system, which is supposed to be progressive, loses its very progressivity because of the access of higher income earners to tax avoidance measures. Yet the lower income earners, the PAYE earners, do not have access to those tax avoidance measures. So the current system that is supposed to be progressive in fact loses its progressivity. Yet this is a system that the Labor Party seeks to support and tells us is working okay. We had the member for the Hunter trying to tell us what a wonderful tax system we currently have and 
 trying to convince us that it needed no reform whatever.
The current income tax system creates poverty traps with the interplay between the social security system and the high marginal income tax rates. The loss of social security at some levels involves an effective marginal tax rate for some income earners of up to 70 per cent, yet the Labor Party seeks to support a system that provides no incentive at all to work and to improve and to invest. Furthermore, the current system provides distortions to investment decisions because they tend to be based on tax minimisation criteria rather than on real returns, yet Labor wants to entrench these inequities, to entrench these disincentives and to entrench these inefficiencies.
The indirect tax system is every bit as bad. It is an outdated system based on a wholesale sales tax which remains in only a handful of Third World countries. No modern industrial country has the sort of wholesale sales tax system that the opposition wants to burden us with for another generation. It is full of hidden taxes—it is almost dishonest in its secrecy.
Many of those hidden taxes that Labor supports are on necessities such as soap, toothpaste, toilet paper, detergents, fruit juices—taxed with Labor's unfair hidden wholesale sales tax system. It is full of inconsistencies and illogical rates—12 per cent, 22 per cent, 32 per cent, 37 per cent, 41 per cent and 45 per cent—illogical inconsistencies that Labor wants to support. Engagement rings are taxed, wedding rings are not. Flavoured milk is, plain milk is not. Biscuits are, caviar is not. Cars are, aeroplanes are not. Toothpaste is taxed, toothbrushes are not. What is the rationale for these inconsistencies? There is no rationale, yet Labor wants to burden us still with these inconsistencies.
Furthermore, the current tax system burdens small business with massive compliance costs, estimated now to be hundreds of millions of dollars a year just in complying with the current indirect tax system. Much money and much time is spent in trying to minimise tax rather than trying to get on with the job. It is estimated that one in four dollars in tax 
 revenue collected by small business is spent in trying to comply with the complex tax laws—a system that is strangling small business. After the election in 1996, a number of small businesses and accountants said to me, `Now you are in office, we want to see you reforming the current tax system. It's a mess, it's unfair, it's too complex, it's strangling small business and we want to see it changed.'
The other problem with the indirect tax system is that it has a shrinking base. It ignores the growing service sector where the wealthy spend their money and unfairly focuses on the goods sector. It is unfair because it ignores the area where the wealthy tend to spend more of their money. The household expenditure survey shows that the wealthy spend four times as much money on services as the lower income earners do, and yet, by leaving the service sector out of the indirect tax system, we are favouring the wealthy and putting all the burden of indirect taxes on the poor.
Over the past decade or so, the percentage of the total indirect tax paid by the lowest decile of income earners has nearly doubled. There is an increasing burden on low income earners by the current inequitable, regressive wholesale sales tax system. If we are going to make it fair and sustainable, we need to extend the indirect tax system to services. Yet Labor wants to retain the current wholesale sales tax system based just on goods. We have seen over the years what has happened to that system—a wholesale sales tax rate that started at 2½ per cent and is now averaging 22 per cent.
We saw what happened with the Labor Party when they got back into office in 1993. Right across the board, they raised wholesale sales taxes by two per cent because the current tax system is unsustainable. As the Institute of Chartered Accountants says, `If Australia does not get a GST, inevitably the wholesale sales tax system will increase,' and it will increase and keep increasing.
Look at the list of goods that had no sales tax at all when Labor came into office in 1983 that now carry rates of 12 per cent and 22 per cent: agricultural machinery, anti 
 dandruff treatment, skin repair creams, household disinfectants, tractors and ride-on mowers, sunscreen agents, wines, non-alcoholic wines and ciders, biscuits, snack foods, ice-cream, domestic stoves, water filters, wrapping material, fruit juice, muesli bars and health food bars—no sales taxes when Labor came in 1983, now most of them with 22 per cent and some at 12 per cent tax because the current wholesale sales tax system inevitably, and especially under Labor, requires ever increasing rates. And that is exactly what will happen if we do not broaden the indirect tax base to include services. These were all zero in 1983 and under Labor they have risen and they have kept rising.
The current wholesale sales tax system penalises exporters because the wholesale sales tax is built into the products that we export, yet our competitors rebate the value added tax when they export. Labor wants to retain a system that penalises our exporters, makes it harder for our exporters and makes it easier for the countries they are competing against.
The current system is unsustainable. If we are going to have a tax base that will provide the ever increasing services people expect from governments, it has to be an expanding tax base based on expanding expenditure based on services, not a shrinking narrow tax base that the head in the sand opposition wants to burden us with for years to come. Not only that, the current system, as we know, costs us billions of dollars in evasion and avoidance.
This government has put forward a proposal that will remove these inequities, give us a sustainable expanding tax base, remove the inefficiencies, remove the complexities and provide real incentives. These changes are long overdue. This government's tax reform package has significant reductions in income tax—reductions in income tax totalling around $13 billion, reductions in income tax right across the board for all income earners, reductions in income tax that will leave the average family $40 to $50 a week better off net from any increases due to the GST. The average family will be $40 to $50 a week better off, and yet the Labor Party is saying 
 to these average families, `No, you can't have these tax reforms. We want to lumber you with the current, inefficient, inequitable sales tax system for another generation.'
It ought to be on the Labor Party's conscience that it is depriving average families of those sorts of tax cuts, those sorts of incentives to work, those sorts of incentives to improve themselves. The government's proposals remove 10 hidden taxes: wholesale sale tax, which I have already talked about, financial institutions duties, bank account debit taxes, bed taxes, conveyancing charges on business property and five different stamp duties. It removes provisional tax which is a pain in the neck for small business and a burden for self-funded and independent retirees. It wants to replace these with one simple, across-the-board, fair, broadly based 10 per cent tax on goods and services. The government's proposals have adequate built-in compensation for low income earners and pensioners that will in fact see them better off as well.
We have heard much from the other side about how bad this will supposedly be for small business, yet small business wholeheartedly supports these proposals. Angela Ryan, the Tax Director of the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, said:
The appeal for business is the simplicity of the system.
Rob Bastian from the Council of Small Business Associations said:
Losing provisional tax and the uplift factor were shots in the arm for small business . . . the income tax cuts represent the big win for the sector.
Kerrie Clayton, an ASCPA small business adviser, said:
The best part about the proposal is that it contains tangible initiatives that will save many small businesses a lot of time and money.
Small business is in support of this package and these measures. The National President of the Association of Independent Retirees said this:
All fair minded Australians have been calling for a total reform of our current Tax system which is unbalanced and unfair to many Australians. The proposed Tax Reform Plan is both comprehensive 
 and imaginative. It should provide a sound basis for the future.
The Government seems to have provided more than adequate compensation to those on low incomes . . . if we reject it, we may never get another opportunity to update our taxation system.
The support for this tax system is logical. The support for these changes is well founded. The support for these changes is widespread. The editorial in the Australian Financial Review  the day after the tax reform package was announced said this:
The coalition must be applauded for its proposal to broaden the tax base and lower the rate structure. There are many reasons why its tax plan should be supported.
There are many reasons why the government's tax plan should be supported, yet Labor supports the old system. Labor wants to retain the system that is unfair, that is inefficient, that is unsustainable. Labor's approach in this is hypocritical. It is obstructionist for playing politics for the sake of it. It is backward looking and it has no answers for the future. Labor stands condemned for their approach to tax reform. They stand condemned for their hypocrisy, condemned for their obstruction, condemned for their ineptitude and dishonesty, and, most of all, condemned for putting their own political interests ahead of the interests of Australia. This is necessary reform. It is what Australia needs. We cannot delay any longer on these tax reform proposals.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—The government has talked a lot about mandate. Mandate is one of those words that can be used and abused as seen fit, and never has it been so abused than by this government and this Prime Minister with regard to the debate over the GST. We all know John Howard's true thoughts about the mandate theory of politics. They are a matter of public record. But since the election we have been witness to a conversion of near biblical proportions as he tries to convince us that he has a mandate to impose a GST on the people of Australia. I am here to say that he does not have a mandate.
How many times does the Prime Minister need to be reminded that on 3 October this year more people of this country voted for 
 political parties opposed to a GST than for those in favour of it? The Australian Labor Party polled 51.3 per cent of the two-party preferred vote across the nation. In my own state of Tasmania that figure rose to 57.3 per cent, enough to deliver the Australian Labor Party all five seats in the House of Representatives from that state. That is a mandate and that is why I am here today to say that never ever should this parliament pass a bill that allows a goods and services tax. It is a mandate my colleagues take very seriously. The people of Tasmania have told us that they do not want a GST, and for a very good reason.
A GST will not do the things that the Prime Minister has claimed. A GST will not mean the end of the black economy. In fact, a GST provides some of the more unscrupulous within our community with an incentive to enter the black economy. This is borne out by research overseas where in the UK it has been discovered that more than one in three British consumers now regularly negotiate to pay in cash to avoid the country's GST. A similar situation exists in Tasmania. A GST will do nothing to stop tax evasion. It will not help with the nation's savings and it will not repair our trade imbalance. Most importantly of all, a GST will not redistribute the tax burden to make it fairer for ordinary Australian men and women.
But there are some things a GST will do. It will add to the cost of the basic necessities of life, especially at the supermarket for such basic items as bread, milk, fresh fruit and vegetables. It will mean that, for the first time in our country's history, people will be paying a tax every time they telephone a plumber, electrician or mechanic. It will mean that small business will spend their time being tax collectors for the government instead of getting on with the business of earning a living.
People in Tasmania will feel the effects of a GST much more than anywhere else in the nation. Just a few days ago the President of the Australian Council for Social Services, Michael Raper, told a forum in northern Tasmania that Tasmanians already pay more for essential items than in any other regional centre of the country. This is a matter of 
 established fact. Also a matter of established fact is that the average earnings in Tasmania are less than those on the mainland, so the already unequal effects of a GST on Tasmanians will be amplified twice over.
In my own seat of Lyons, community concern over the GST has been overwhelming. Local councils fear it. They fear the inconsistencies that have already been flagged, particularly that many local government activities such as holiday programs, swimming pools, sports facilities and hall hire, if they charge a nominal fee, are liable for the GST. Any work they contract out is liable for the GST. Their biggest concern is channelling funding through the states, because they are concerned that local government will become the poor neighbour to everyone. This is particularly true of country councils, who raise a good deal less than half their revenue from rates.
Welfare and charitable organisations fear it. Small businesses dread it. Most of all, pensioners, low income earners and people living in small rural towns and hamlets fear it. They fear it because, as a regressive tax, it discriminates in favour of wealthier sections of the community over the less wealthy. Most people who live in my electorate are not wealthy people. They are on low incomes and in many cases live without easy access to the sorts of facilities and services many in the cities take for granted. They are the families who spend most of their income on food: up to 25 per cent or more of their budgets, compared to the 12.5 per cent spent by the wealthiest 20 per cent of Australian families. In the game of tax winners and losers, the vast majority of my constituents will be losers.
It is not hard to predict the winners. Using the government's own projections, we see that the Prime Minister of this country will get 17 times more out of his own tax package than the average pensioner—17 times! He then has the temerity to claim that his proposals are fair and equal. I think many Australians feel sickened at the Prime Minister's definition of fairness—which is a bit of a problem in itself, given that most over-the-counter medicines will increase in price under a GST. As put to 
 me in one piece of correspondence recently, the GST is payable by the poor, collected by small business and payable to the rich.
The Australian Labor Party and the people of Lyons do want tax reform. The proposals the Labor Party put forward at the last election reflect our commitment to a fair and socially just taxation system that provides tax relief where it is most needed: to struggling low and middle income families, especially those with children. It also includes a commitment towards ensuring that those wealthy Australians who can and should be paying their fair share of tax are made to do so. Nothing at all sticks in the throat of the average Australian more than the knowledge that the mega-rich of our country are not paying their way. These people make their fortunes in Australia but use every means at their disposal to avoid making a fair financial return. Why is it that the government only ever talks about the need for mutual obligation in the context of social security recipients, whom it knows it can push around, vilify and scapegoat on a whim, and not the rich and powerful?
As everybody bar the government seems to realise, a GST is not only bad for people, it is also bad for the economy. The inflationary impact of a GST is well documented, as is its impact on consumer spending and jobs growth. In the service sector, from where most future employment prospects are expected to come, a GST will hit very hard indeed. For the government to knowingly go down the road of exposing our economy to these perils borders on the reckless.
And no-one, not one person in this place, truly believes that a GST, if introduced, would never ever rise. It simply beggars belief to think that a GST would remain at 10 per cent forever and a day. Take, for instance, these simple historical facts. In 21 of 23 countries that have a GST, the rate has risen. In New Zealand the GST was introduced at 10 per cent; it is now 12.5 per cent. In Spain the initial rate was 12 per cent; it is now 16 per cent. In Britain it was 10 per cent; it now stands at 17.5 per cent. In Denmark it started at 10 per cent and is now a colossal 25 per 
 cent. Every time the rate of a GST in these countries increases, so does the unfairness.
The supposed safeguards the government has put in place to prevent increases can only be described as a sham. `What the parliament giveth, the parliament can taketh away.' Any future Commonwealth government can legislate a rise in the GST, with or without the consent of the states. Australians simply do not believe the Prime Minister's promise that the GST will not rise. After all, this is the same Prime Minister who gave a commitment three years ago that he would `never ever' introduce a goods and services tax. This is the same Prime Minister who has performed more backflips in the past three years than an Olympic gymnast, albeit without the grace and elegance.
Australians have a reputation for egalitarianism—a fair go for everybody. It is a notion embedded deep within the psyche of our people. What will become of our nation if we lose this picture of ourselves? So much of what this government has done, and is trying to do with this bill, will take us further down the path of a divided society, a society of haves and have nots, of people being left without the safety nets that set us apart from other countries. A GST is one step along this path. The chronic underfunding of our public health system is another.
The Prime Minister wants to compensate for his government's failing to provide adequate safety nets by asking business to donate more to charity. At the rate this government is going, it will not be long until we have a `charity state', and from there I guess we will have workhouses for the unemployed and goodness knows what else. The mind simply boggles. At least he has had the good sense to exempt charities from the GST; an act of charity, you might say. But I dare say we will see many new `charities' arising which seem to have rich benefactors, not beneficiaries.
Perhaps on the eve of Christmas our Prime Minister has revisited A Christmas Carol and is hearing the ghost of Christmas past on the matter of the GST. Will he heed the ghost of Christmas future that tells us that, if he continues down this path, many people will 
 be the poorer on Christmas Day after the advent of the GST? Can he remember back before the last election saying there would `never ever' be a GST? Will the ghost of Christmas past be heard echoing around the corridors, `Never ever, never ever.'
—Save us.
—There are many in my electorate who are questioning and are really concerned about their future, despite all these promises of exemptions on this and exemptions on that. Exemptions can easily disappear, Mr Minister at the table. This government must start heeding the voice of the electorate, and the electorate is saying that they do not want a GST. I am reminded in this debate of the Prime Minister's defence of the monarchy in the republic debate. This defence is premised on the belief that `if it ain't broke, don't fix it'. All our present tax system requires is the sort of periodic maintenance proposed by Labor during the election. I repeat, `It ain't broke and it don't need fixing.'",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NP,1998-12-07,"—I rise to speak on the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Bill 1998  and cognate bills. These bills cover the full gamut of tax changes. I am a country person and I go on form. Looking across the divide here, I do not have a great deal of enthusiasm for the form. I would like to talk about form because in the bush form tells it all. How you performed is a good indication of how you are going to perform in the future, so let us take a little trip back through time.
I would like to go back to before the 1996 election. I was a candidate, and I won my seat then for the first time and, like a good country girl, I remember form. When you buy a racehorse, you remember form. When you buy a bull, you remember form. And when you buy a dud, you remember form, I can tell you.
Mr Melham interjecting—
—I know a dud when I see one! Let us have a look at form. This is what I told my electorate before the 1998 election.
—That is why you did so well.
—I thank the minister. We did so well because we had a plan. I would like to talk about form, because form makes the difference. When the coalition asked for the people's votes before the 1996 election, people could still remember the circumstances then. The Australian people have a good memory, God bless them! I would like to go over some of the form.
Labor left us with a budget deficit of $10 billion. I will remind you of some of the terms we have learnt in the last three years. `Black hole' was an astronomical term—it was not something that referred to the economy. Six per cent interest rates were something grandad used to talk about. Labor has taught us a lot about those terms in the last few years. Before the 1996 election, we were left with a budget deficit—a black hole—of $10 billion.
—Speak to the bill.
—He hasn't got much form, Mr Deputy Speaker, you are right.
—He's got no form.
—The honourable member for Banks and the minister will be quiet.
—We are going to take him for a little ride down memory lane tonight. The coalition took the government to a budget surplus in 1998-99—the first surplus in a decade. Before the 1996 election, Labor left us with interest rates of up to 22 per cent, and I remember them well. We have now had five cuts in official interest rates. We are back to the Beatles, blue suede shoes and bell-bottoms in terms of interest rates—10.5 per cent down to 6.7 per cent, and falling. Like Labor's popularity, they are falling, falling, falling.
Before the 1996 election, Labor gave us an unemployment rate of 11.2 per cent—the highest since the Depression. In the last six years of Labor, only 16,000 full-time jobs were created. What a miserable performance. What form? Would you buy a racehorse like that? No, you would not. We now have 8.1 per cent unemployment, and it is falling—like Labor's popularity.
Since we took government, 300,000 new jobs have been created—209,200 since August 1997. Labor gave us $10 billion in increased taxes—an increase in the wholesale sales tax, and the l-a-w law tax cuts. Let's look at the form, because that is what counts when you buy a dud. That is what the Australian people did not buy—a dud. They bought us. Labor neglected vocational education and training and let the apprenticeship system get run down.
I remind the member for Banks that apprenticeships and traineeships in 1996-97 were 100,400. In the last years of Labor government there were only 63,600. In 1996-97, there were 87,000 new places, with $433 million spent on that area in 1998-99. Labor had a new schools policy that was basically a no schools policy. Do you remember that? Two new schools opened in Dawson—terrific! Labor gave us a private health system that was so run down that in 1983, 65 per cent of Australians had private health insurance and by 1995 it had dropped by half.
Labor gave us an unsustainable budget in which the Medicare benefits bill was greater than the budget of Western Australia. The PBS budget was greater than the budget of Tasmania. We have maintained Medicare, we have put Medicare easy claim facilities into rural towns so you can claim in your little bush town. We are introducing a 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance.
Mr Melham interjecting—
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—The honourable member for Banks should remain silent, as should the minister at the table. You have both been constantly interjecting. The member for Dawson does not want any help. She wants to be heard in silence, so listen to her.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I appreciate your intervention. There was $30 billion in the last budget for private hospitals. Labor was soft on social security fraud, and now we are saving $28 million a week. Tough, isn't it? Form is what counts. When I buy something, I look at form—whether I buy a bull or a racehorse, I 
 look at form, and the Australian people are great people for looking at form.
There is an old Chinese curse which says, `May you live in interesting times.' Unfortunately, we do live in interesting times. Australia has been greatly insulated from the difficulties we all face. The National Institute of Economic and Industry Research has warned that Australia will be pulled into the Asian slump. It is not the time, and it certainly was not the time, to let an irresponsible, big spending Labor government take over the economic leadership of Australia. Thank goodness the Australian people agreed with that.
I want to tell you another little story. We are going to go back even further than 1996—to 15 May 1936. I would like to share with you the set of instructions the first airline stewardesses had when passengers boarded planes. These are little rippers and I could not believe them when I read them. These are the instructions stewardesses were given: `Keep the clock and altimeter wound up; carry a railroad timetable in case the plane is grounded; warn the passengers against throwing their cigars and cigarettes out the windows; keep an eye on passengers when they go to the toilet to be sure they do not go out the emergency exit.' That would be a bit of a disaster. I feel sorry for the passenger who went out the emergency exit when he was trying to go to the bathroom.
This is really extremely funny. We read that and we absolutely laugh. It is a little bit of old history. But, do you know what? We still have the same tax system they had then and it is equally funny. Do not go out the emergency exit in the tax system because you will absolutely be finished. We have the same tax system. It is absolutely laughable. And that lot over there are going to vote for it. They are going to vote for a tax system as old as the system that those airline stewardesses had to deal with in the aircraft. It is just amazing. Are you going to vote for it? Yes, you are.
—Those were the good old days!
—Those were the good old days! It is really quite amusing, isn't it? It shows you a lot about form. We have 
 come a long way. Fortunately, we have a coalition government. It is funny to read those old rules and laugh over them, and it is funny to look over to the other side of the House and laugh over them. But the reality is that there is a moral imperative here.
For a start I want to talk about the moral imperative in my electorate, because we have a lot of working people in Dawson. Back in the 1950s you had to be earning 19 times the average weekly earnings to be paying the highest marginal tax rate. Admittedly, that was a higher rate than it has been to date. In other words, you could put a bit aside, you could raise your family and you could have a go. You cannot now. In the next few years somebody on average weekly earnings—about $38,000 to $42,000 a year—struggling to raise a family and make their contribution will be paying the highest marginal tax rate.
That is absolutely unacceptable. Any government of any persuasion that allows people on average weekly earnings to bear the brunt of taxation in this country has no moral vision. You cannot allow that to go on, and this government will not allow that to happen.
The second great moral imperative that faces a responsible government is the situation with our exporters. The world is getting harder, there is no doubt about that. Regardless of whether one thinks that globalisation is a good or a bad thing, the fact is that it is the exporters in a country like Australia that are going to pull us through. They have an unacceptable level of taxation on them. There is only one way to remove that level of taxation and enable them to compete and that is to put in some form of goods and services tax. The coalition government is going to do that. It is going to take $4.5 billion in costs off the backs of our exporters—3½ per cent of their costs.
Times are pretty tough in the sugar industry. They are going to be very tough in the next few years. We have had a lot of rain on our sugar, and prices are falling. It is a very hard time and our exporters in the sugar industry certainly do not need any additional government costs.
So there are two moral imperatives: being fair to those who are the backbone of this 
 country, the workers, and giving our exporters, who are going to create the future for our children, an opportunity to shed some costs and take their shackles off.
I want to talk about the Labor Party particularly. During the election the Labor Party in my electorate offered a gain but no pain tax reduction system. Superficially, it sounded attractive. I will be honest with you, Mr Deputy Speaker: for a while I was a bit concerned. Fortunately, people in Dawson have a lot of commonsense and they realised that there is no such thing in life as gain but no pain. The reality is that if you want to save something for your family you have to go through some serious saving. If your children want to pass an exam they have to go through some serious study. If you want to lose a few pounds you have to go through some serious exercise.
People in Australia realise that there really is no formula for a gain but no pain. If you are really serious about bettering your family, your community or your country you have to go through some gain with pain. And that is exactly what the coalition proposed—a big change to the tax system but one which, in the end, gave a gain to all Australians, whether they were average families, pensioners, exporters or small business people.
I would like to go briefly through some of the advantages of the proposed tax system. For the first time, 81 per cent of Australians will be paying less than 30 cents in the dollar personal income tax. What a tremendous change for everybody. We are looking at $10 billion worth of taxes off the back of small business. We are cutting tax returns to one page, four times a year.
I want to see what the Labor Party is going to do about fuel because they keep talking about rural and regional Australia. But the reality is that we are going to take $3.5 billion off fuel excise. That means that costs are going to come off products transported into Dawson, including fresh food from the south. It means that everything that comes into our electorate is going to cost less in terms of transport. It means that the Bowen mangoes, the melons and the raw sugar that 
 we export from our electorate are going to cost less.
It is a tremendous change. For the tourism operators, every one of the big tourism cats that goes out to the reef is going to save on average about $186,000 a year in fuel excise. It is a tremendous change for tourism and for small business. For our pensioners and for those self-funded retirees, there is a safety net to ensure that those who have contributed to this country are able to be insulated, quite properly, against any detrimental effects.
This is a package for the future. It is a package for those who are looking at a future for our country. When you look at something, look at its form. Look at the Labor Party's form and look at the form of the coalition. We have delivered on every commitment that we have made. We have a plan for the future. Look at the form, and when you look at the form you will not buy a dud. The Australian people did not buy a dud. What they want is a change for the future. I thoroughly endorse the full number of bills here in the new tax system. I always say to the Australian people: do not buy a dud, go with those who have the form. The coalition has the form.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—I would like to remind the honourable member for Dawson who has just spoken that something else came out of the 1930s. John Howard was born in 1939.
A new tax system bill. What a joke of a title. It is as if Moses has just walked off the mountain, with the stone tablets in his hands, and is delivering a message from God to the chosen people. The fanfare and headlines given to these bills far outweigh their true character. These bills do one thing—they change the way the federal government collects revenue. They change it from income to expenditure. That is it. It is not the Sermon on the Mount. It is not the Gettysburg address. It is definitely not Martin Luther King's `I have a dream' speech. And this government is trumpeting the news as if we are all being saved from the damnation of economic hell.
The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have constantly claimed that this tax package is the economic panacea for all the ills of this nation. They claim that the only way forward 
 for this economy is for this tax package to be endorsed by this parliament. They are wrong.
The Treasurer must think that his job is pretty easy. He inherited an economy vastly different from the one the Labor Party was left in 1983, when the current Prime Minister was then the outgoing Treasurer. Back in 1983, the budget deficit was enormous, interest rates and inflation were high, manufacturing was in a slump and the unemployment rate was appalling.
In the years that followed Labor's win in 1983, there was a wholesale reform of this nation's economy that the members on the other side of the chamber have ignored. Under the leadership of former prime ministers Hawke and Keating, this country saw dramatic changes not just economically but socially. Exporting became a mantra, companies looked to diversify and value add, and tertiary industries and services boomed in the new wave of development that washed over our shores. You would think that the Labor government had slept for 13 years or had sold out the country. If that was the case, why were they elected five times?
Now the Treasurer claims that the great things that are happening are all his achievements and that all the problems are ours. With that in mind, the government now claims that the GST will solve all of our nation's ills—they campaigned on that fact. Well, we did not. We campaigned on the issues that concern the people of this nation: health, aged care, education, child care, unemployment, racial tolerance, and the list goes on. This government had only one issue—tax.
If you listen to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, the GST will solve all of our problems: health care, unemployment, exports, wool prices and probably hangnails and haemorrhoids. But there are two arguments against theirs. Not all countries have a GST. The United States does not and it is the strongest economy in the world. China does not and it has a huge economy. A GST does not mean success.
As I mentioned before, this is about changing revenue collection. While that may seem an innocuous statement, the implications for people are far worse. Everyone is a winner— 
that is the message that the government would like us all to believe. But the people of my electorate of Fowler are, for good reason, more than a little sceptical of the Treasurer's cry. Perhaps they have been ripped off once too often—dudded by a spiv when they were sold a lemon of a used car; promised the world but delivered nothing. Too often they have bought the lucky dip only to win the useless toy. But wait, there is more. Just when they begin to think the package is too good to be true, along comes another bonus. Everyone is a winner—families, singles, exporters, farmers and miners. The longer the list gets the more unbelievable it becomes. People are used to seeing a full-page list of winning lottery ticket numbers, but somehow their ticket number is never there.
When it is all said and done, the people of the Fowler electorate were not taken in by the Prime Minister or his fast-talking Treasurer. At the 3 October election, fewer than one voter in five cast a primary vote for the Liberal Party. What does that say for the government's mandate for a goods and services tax? It certainly says a lot about the misgivings that people have about changes to the tax system. The suspicion is that, whatever changes are made, people will be worse off. No matter how many times the Treasurer cries, `Everyone is a winner,' the people of Fowler just do not believe him—and for good reason.
The majority of families in the Fowler electorate struggle to make ends meet. They have to balance their mortgage or rent payments and their transport, gas and electricity costs, as well as meet the food and clothing needs of growing families. All of their income is expended. Indeed, as many borrow to meet the cost of major items of expenditure, they actually spend more than they earn. That spending, in most cases, will attract a GST.
The unfairness of the GST can best be seen in its application to food. The estimates of Professor Neil Warren suggest that, in the poorest 20 per cent of households, 40 per cent of income is spent on food compared with 11 per cent in the richest households. Yet the government insists on applying a GST to 
 basic food items. A GST on food slugs poorer families more than it does richer ones.
Families in Fowler also face the added expense of a GST on clothing. While it may be claimed that rich families spend more on clothing, families with growing children spend a high proportion of their income on clothing. With growing children you have no choice—children grow out of school uniforms and they need new shoes. A GST is totally unfair to families with young children. Living in the outer suburbs of Sydney, families have high gas, electricity and transport costs, all of which will attract a GST. These are extra costs for families that can least afford them. What then of the government's promised trade-offs and compensation? For pensioners, we have already seen how the government's supposed compensation is nothing more than increases which would have come through adjustments in the near future anyway.
For taxpayers in Fowler, you cannot escape the conclusion that what the government is offering by way of tax cuts will go nowhere near making up for the added costs to the family budget of a GST. Indeed, a taxpayer on the median income in Fowler—around $30,000—can expect a tax cut of a mere 2.8c in the dollar while someone on $75,000 per year gets a cut of 6c in the dollar. How fair is that? Is it any wonder that people in the Fowler electorate do not want a bar of the GST? When taken with other measures which disadvantage two income families with children, cuts to services over the past two years which have placed great strain on families and threats to employment security, you can see why the people of Fowler voted against a GST.
It is hard to find many winners in Fowler under the government's GST, so you have to wonder where all the winners are. The people of Fowler know all too well that they are getting the rough end of the stick. They know that higher income earners will benefit most from the tax cuts. They know that the buyers of luxury cars will get the biggest savings from a flat-rate GST. They know that a tax on food and clothing hits them harder than high income earners. Call it the politics of envy if you will, but the people on Struggle Street 
 know that they will be worse off under a GST.
Finally, I would like to turn to mandates. I know the Prime Minister likes to rabbit on about them, so I would like to talk about my mandate. I was elected to represent the wonderful people of Fowler. I have spoken many times before in this chamber about what a privilege it is to represent these people. During the campaign I went to those people with a very clear platform. One of the issues I raised was `no GST'. I made it clear for all of the electorate to see what stance I was taking. They had no doubt as to what the different positions were. That was obvious, considering all the material sent to them by the government just prior to the election.
The government did all it could to spread the message of the GST. Just prior to the election they spent taxpayers' money to the tune of about $17 million. They ran a negative advertisement campaign on Labor during the election, rather than inform voters how the GST would affect them. They sent appalling material from the government members secretariat, a group set up by this government not to assist backbenchers in their official duties but to provide grubby political material at taxpayers' expense. It does not even pretend to be non-partisan. On top of that, they even had a spin doctor on Sydney radio as a spokesperson on all government policies.
If we look at a few examples of Howard cabinet ministers, what can we see in terms of their mandates? The Prime Minister lost four per cent of his vote. The Deputy Prime Minister lost 6.5 per cent. The Treasurer lost one per cent. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services lost five per cent; the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, six per cent; the Minister for Defence, seven per cent; the Minister for Finance and Administration, five per cent; and the Minister for Health and Aged Care, who had to run away from his seat of Chisholm—which, might I add, was won by Labor—lost two per cent in Casey. Wherever you look, members on the other side of the chamber lost votes.
But in Fowler the people of my electorate saw the campaign and rejected the govern 
 ment's agenda. They rejected it like they have never done before. Fowler now has a margin of 26.33 per cent. That is my mandate, a mandate to oppose this unfair and retrograde attack on the people of my electorate. So my mandate is to ask questions like: will a GST fix the problems in the Job Network, in nursing homes or with reconciliation? Will it fix the drug problem? The answer is no. Only leadership can fix those problems, and the Prime Minister has shown precious little of that in the last three years.
I would like to end with a quote made in this House with which I agree:
Let us look at the position: the Government is exposed by the facts, exposed on a policy front, exposed by the backbench, and exposed by its own incompetence on the frontbench. We might stop and ask ourselves what has changed? There are a few new ties, a few new dresses and a few new suits but, fundamentally, nothing else. It is just the same old tired lot over there. They have no direction, no policies, no mandate, no sense of direction for Australia, and no capacity to put in place, if it did have them, the policies that are required to deal with our very deep-seated economic circumstances as they have emerged and are still emerging.
These words were said at the wrong time for the wrong government but they seem very apt now for this government, and I must thank Dr John Hewson for saying them.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1998-12-07,"—I rise in support of the government's bill. I am delighted to do so. In fact, the last speaker actually highlighted the great naivety of the Labor Party when it approaches economic management in Australia today. The talk about the people in Struggle Street shows that the member for Fowler simply does not understand the shift in the Australian economy away from goods and more into services. How are we going to meet the requirements of not only the people on Struggle Street but of their parents and their kids without a fundamental shift in the way that Australia manages its economy, a fundamental shift in the way it manages its tax system and a fundamental shift that will ensure that Australia is competitive domestically and also overseas? Without that change, we would become the poor men of Asia and of the world. This is about taking the right action.
I congratulate the Prime Minister and the Treasurer on taking this action. The cafe latte set, to which I am sure the member for Fowler belongs, sit back and pontificate about how we can fix things in Australia. Without the fundamental reforms you are not going to fix anything in this country—let alone in Struggle Street. It is interesting to look at the editorial in the Daily Telegraph on Thursday, 3 December. It says:
Australia set itself apart from the regional economic mine yesterday with a five per cent annual growth rate.
The editorial concludes on this note:
Economic management is not a matter of luck but of consistent policy and constant attention to global movements. The current managers, the Government of Prime Minister John Howard, have been doing this.
To disrupt the Government's work by blocking tax reform would be sheer political bloody-mindedness and a betrayal of all Australians.
The Telegraph  editorial is saying to people like the member for Fowler, `Get your act together. If you want to climb aboard the economic engine of what Australia is today, this is the direction you should follow.' You are basically into retro politics. Of course we have heard that from one of your members who said, `You are stuck in the past. It is a 1950s revisit, and you haven't looked at how the world has fundamentally changed.'
It is very important to recognise that the world has moved away from just taxing goods and into the service area. There is very little taxing of services in this country. So if people want to go to the gym, if they want to get their hair cut, if they want to go to the restaurant, if they want to go to a resort, they are not taxed. But that shift to taxing services is happening everywhere in the world economy.
Tourism—and we had 4.2 million international visitors here last year—is one of the growth engines of the economy and is part of the services sector. The member for Fowler might not understand that, but a fundamental shift has occurred. I can tell you that the tourism industry—the shadow minister is there—was very happy about the fact that bed taxes across the country are going to be removed. And the Labor Party did not promise that they were going to stop those taxes 
 across the country. That was a fundamental flaw of the Labor Party's when they talked to the tourism industry. The industry knew that the bottom line was that they were going to be better off under a GST proposal.
It is important in terms of this shift that we also see what has happened in terms of indirect taxes. Indirect taxes as a proportion of the take of taxation have been constantly shifting. We have seen taxes from the indirect area dropping by 0.5 per cent to one per cent of GDP, which represents $500 million per year. That means that we have to find other tax areas, otherwise we would have a problem. When you have a shift in the indirect tax, you have to move it onto the direct tax. We have seen that the share of indirect taxes has gone from 27 per cent to 24 per cent and the direct taxes have continued to grow from 63 per cent to 70 per cent. The factor operating here is seen, for example, in the fact that we have not seen a taxation flow-on, despite the productivity improvements, in the area of car prices. People are not smoking and drinking to the same degree, and of course that means less in terms of tax take. So we need to find new avenues for taxation.
The third major factor, following on from the need to broaden our tax base and the problem of that indirect system, is the need to protect the salary and wages earners of this country. In the 1950s, the taxpayer had to be earning 19 times average weekly earnings before paying the top marginal rate of taxes; today it only takes 1.2 times weekly earnings to pay the top marginal tax rate, or by the year 2000. We need to shift that whole approach.
The fourth major factor is the personal income taxes and the increased family allowances that will become available to the people of Australia because of these tax changes. They are a great incentive to get people out there working. Under the GST, despite the claims from the member for Fowler, nobody will be worse off. Eighty per cent of taxpayers will be paying 30 per cent tax, and the average family will be $50 a week better off. There will be $13 billion in tax cuts, an extra $2.5 billion assistance for families. There will be a reduction of $4.5 billion in taxes reduced 
 right across the board in terms of the net cost to the government.
The fifth major reason we should be supporting these tax proposals today is the overall reduction in business costs because of the ability to provide important tax credits. So  it is passed up the line and the credits continue until finally the consumer pays for the tax.
I think that provides us with the sixth major reason, which is significant. It allows us to get at the tax cheats. As you check the processes through, you can certainly trace those who have been rorting the system. In New Zealand thousands of companies came out to register in order to get the tax credits. That is what we will see under this program—the people who are rorting the process, rorting the tax system, will be caught out.
The seventh major reason is the great incentive that will be provided to Australian exporters. There is no doubt that Australia depends just as much as ever on exports. It used to be that we depended on wool; now it is manufactures, as well as the mining sector and of course the tourism sector. The incentive of taking off a whole range of indirect taxes and not having the GST means that Australian exporters will not operate under the type of handicap they have been operating under to date. They operate internationally under a 4.5 per cent disadvantage on average now. That will be removed when the GST is introduced. That will have a flow-on effect to the standard of living right throughout this great country of Australia. That is one of the key factors why we should be supporting this tax: providing real incentives to our exporters to assist our balance of payments situation and to increase the standard of living by the flow-on effect from the input of overseas currency.
The eighth major reason that I support this approach is the change in Commonwealth-state financial relations. The Commonwealth will provide the states with a growing source of income. That is something that has been sought by the states for some time. The great opportunity to rationalise state and federal relations is important. The abolition of the wholesale sales tax, the abolition of stamp 
 duties and the abolition of BAD and FID transaction requirements are great incentives for all Australians.
As I mentioned, the Labor Party are involved in their retropolitics. They simply do not understand that the shift to a greater number of people in retirement and a greater of number of students means that somebody has to pay for the taxes in this country. We need to look at how we can broaden the base as much as possible and how we can reduce the overall burden of direct taxes.
There is no doubt that there are major flaws in the current system. But there is grave hypocrisy in the Labor Party saying, `It's OK. There are no taxes on foods at all,' when even those regarded as being the necessities of life—bread, milk and butter—are already taxed at the rate of three per cent, and fuel is taxed at the rate of 43 per cent per litre. Then there is the sales tax on computers and on motor vehicles. All this flows on to the cost of goods and food.
We have world's best practice in manufacturing and in service delivery. Why don't we have world's best practice in tax delivery? More than 120 countries all over Europe have a VAT. Canada, most of South America and most of Asia have a VAT or a GST. The USA has a retail sales tax and its economic basis is exactly the same as the GST. However, the IMF says that, when you get over 10 per cent of retail price, it is better to go to a multistage tax with offset. A tourism tax is imposed in various countries. In the UK it is 17.5 per cent, in France it is 26.6 per cent and in New York City it is 15 per cent. So there are various taxes around the world with a similar rate to the rate in Europe.
Monitoring of price reduction will be an important aspect and business will see the benefits. The ACCC will make sure that there are criteria to monitor the prices. There will be competition out in the marketplace to ensure that prices are minimised. There will be far greater uniformity of taxes right across the board. But there will also be opportunities for the individual—whether they want to put their money into direct consumption or whether they want to save. There will be direct opportunities for savings. The new 
 system will be fairer to administer across the board. The current system is far too complex. A person on an average weekly wage earns $37,000 a year. The tax rate on $38,000 a year is 43 cents in the dollar. That is absolutely absurd. The rate will be brought down to 30 cents in the dollar under a GST proposal.
In terms of the criteria of fairness, equity and transparency, obviously the GST meets each of those proposals. Why is it that business is so enthusiastic? Why is it that the taxation community are totally in support of these proposals? The reality is that this is a logical system, it is a clear system, it is a transparent system. The reality is that most people in Australia today do not know what taxes they are actually paying. Let us look at toothpaste, for example. We pay 22 per cent on toothpaste and nothing on toothbrushes. We pay 30 per cent on engagement rings and nothing on wedding rings.
—Fix it!
—The shadow minister for tourism says, `Fix it.' The reality is that this is fixing it. There will be uniformity. Instead of rates of 12 per cent, 22 per cent, 32 per cent, 37 per cent, 41 per cent and 45 per cent, there will be one rate. So we will see uniformity right across the board. The tax will be implemented on an easy basis. We will see dramatic price changes when it is implemented—the price of cameras, the price of watches, the price of cars.
Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting—
—You say it is a tax on jobs. May I ask my honourable colleague opposite if he could explain to me how it is that this will not create jobs for the Australian car producers if they have a reduction in price from the current levels down to 10 per cent? It just does not make sense that you can move from levels of 32 per cent down to 10 per cent as if there is no elasticity of demand at all—as if people will not shift at all. If somebody offers you a very significant reduction in price, you will be interested. This will occur right across the board. This will occur with consumer products and, most importantly, this will occur with Australia's export products. With every country that we compete 
 with we now have a four to five per cent handicap because these taxes are taken off by our competitors in those 120 countries that have a VAT or a GST.
We have to operate an outdated wholesale sales tax with a multilevel system that is difficult to understand, that is complex and that has a huge range of volumes of tax books to which you can refer as to whether or not a particular exemption applies. This will be a simple system. Those who are disadvantaged will be taken care of. The charities will be taken of. It is very interesting to note that Mr Vos, who headed up this inquiry as to how these various exemption areas would be administered, is a former member of the Salvation Army, so he knows how to look after the charitable areas. I think the provisions agreed to in relation to the charitable areas are very generous. The new system looks after the disadvantaged. It gives pensioners a four per cent increase. They will be 1½ per cent ahead of the CPI increases.
We will have a fairer system, we will have an equitable system, we will have a transparent system. We will have a system that provides real incentives for those who want to work overtime. Those who want to move from one area of work to another will not be held back by lack of incentive because of their concern that they will go up to maximum rates. It is a system that will provide us with a basis of internationally competitive advantage right across the board. It will exempt religions, it will exempt charities, it will look after the disadvantaged and it will look after retirees. It will transform the Australian economy. It will put us in a globally competitive position. This is the tax that we have been looking for for the past 30 years. It has taken this government, this Prime Minister, this Treasurer, to make it happen.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,1998-12-07,"—Once banks were the pride of most towns. In any country town, the most prestigious build 
 ings and the architecturally most pleasing buildings were usually the banks, symbolising their position in the town and in the community. The local bank manager was also quite a significant person in any of the small country towns, often serving on many boards. Today, banks have done away with that position of trust and respect in the community. Indeed, they are often seen as villains as more and more banks move away and take away the services not only to country towns but also to urban communities. Indeed, in my own electorate of Throsby, all the suburbs there have had bank closures over the last few years. It is not only the Commonwealth Bank that is withdrawing; all the banks are withdrawing.
We are always told that this is because the banks have to rationalise their service and that it will be a better service. I remember going with the member for Kiama and the mayor of Shellharbour to see the state manager of the Commonwealth Bank when they were closing the Shellharbour branch. We had an interesting discussion with the state manager when he told us all the reasons why that bank could not stay there. The interesting thing is that as the banks are closing the profits are going up, but service to the people is getting worse.
I had to ring my own local bank the other day. The Dapto branch has recently closed and moved over to Shellharbour Square to rationalise the service. They send you a very nice, assuring letter but when I rang the bank—it was the Colonial State Bank—my telephone call rang out three times before they finally answered. I said, `Thank goodness someone is there. I thought you were all gone.' The person said, `We've been terribly busy.' Obviously, they were so busy that they could not answer the phone. Not only that: the profits of the bank have been astronomical over the last few years—there is no other word for it. Now they are doing away with even more services. They do not even want us inside the bank. For all those years we were encouraged to treat the bank as our special thing. Now we are told we are not to go to the bank, that we must do our banking electronically. They do not want to know us, but 
 they want to use our money to continue to make their massive profits.
On the radio the other day, I was listening to some people from the Local Government Association. They were suggesting that there be local branches formed by the Local Government Association. I think that is an excellent idea. In my area, the city of Wollongong, the city of Shellharbour and Kiama would have a huge amount of banking—we have BHP. If all the local businesses in my area used a local bank and if the councils used local banks, I think we could have local banks. The insurance companies are the other villains in the piece, especially in the Illawarra. Today, I heard a Mr Netterkorn, who is the President of SWAG, calling for a local insurance company based in the Illawarra. I think this also is an excellent idea.
As big business is deserting us, the consumers, we are going to have to band together and do what we did so many years ago, forming our own community groups, whether in banking or in insurance. We need to say, `Enough is enough' to big business, whether it is the bank or the insurance company.

(1) What measures has the Minister's Department undertaken which are categorised as positive discrimination programs, that is, providing preference to certain citizens on the basis of their gender, sexuality, age, race, place of birth or some other personal characteristic.
(2) What are the details and funding commitments involved in each case.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Positive Discrimination Programs</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,15,1,question
"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,1998-12-07,"—The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(1) & (2) Within the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, the following programs could be categorised as positive discrimination programs:
Indigenous Cadetship Project
The Department appoints Indigenous Australians, from time to time, under the Indigenous Cadetship Project (ICP). The ICP is an initiative under the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs' (DETYA) Training for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Program.
The funding commitment required can vary depending on the age of the Cadet and the length of the course of tertiary study they are completing. Financial support can be divided into three categories:
.	 the study salary paid to Cadets during the academic year (this is reimbursed to the Department by DETYA);
.	 the practical training salary paid to Cadets during their work placement within the Department over the long summer break between academic years; and
.	 allowances (eg. Book and Equipment Allowance, Reviewed Travel Allowance).
In the case of a 20 year old Cadet, for example, the study salary is currently $12,480 per annum (paid pro-rata based on the academic year), the 
 practical training salary is $21,860 per annum (paid pro-rata based on the practical training period), with a maximum Book and Equipment Allowance of $350.
For Cadets who are required to temporarily relocate from interstate in order to do the annual work placements, additional expenses are incurred in the form of airfares, accommodation and Reviewed Travel Allowance (RTA). Airfares can vary greatly depending on the Cadet's home base location. Twin share accommodation costs in the vicinity of $45 per night, and the Cadet would be eligible for RTA of approximately $92 per week during the practical training period.
Indigenous Cadets are responsible for their own Higher Education Contribution Scheme liabilities.
Community Broadcasting
The Government continues to support community broadcasting as a valuable means to provide access for those whose voices are not regularly heard on other media. In 1998-99, a total of $4.824 million was allocated to the sector under a grant to the Community Broadcasting Foundation Ltd. Community broadcasting allows special interest broadcasters to communicate with specific, or targeted, audiences. For example, there are five full time ethnic stations, and a further 70 general stations, which offer access to almost 1400 hours of ethnic programs weekly, in 90 different languages. Eight stations provide services specially designed for the needs of Australia's print handicapped citizens. Ten community stations provide special interest programming for indigenous Australians, and 30 indigenous media groups produce over 1000 hours of programming which is broadcast on general community stations, thus providing opportunities for all Australians to hear Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people express their own achievements, concerns and values.
To advance the principle of equity in the delivery of broadcasting services, the Government specified that the 1998-99 grant to the Community Broadcasting Foundation was to be allocated as follows:
.	 $2.376m for ethnic community broadcasting;
.	 $0.574m for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander broadcasting;
.	 $0.270m for print handicapped; and
.	 $1.096m for community broadcasting generally. 

AccessAbility Grants Program
The AccessAbility Grants program, administered by the Department, was introduced in the 1998/99 Budget as a measure to improve access to the Internet and online services for people with disabilities. The 1998/99 Budget allocated funding of $1.5 million for grants in each of the years 1998/99 and 1999/2000.
Grants are awarded on a competitive basis for eligible organisations to undertake projects designed to improve access to online services for people with disabilities, and which demonstrate innovation and best practice. The program does not attempt to meet the funding needs of individuals whose disability impedes access to the Internet, but rather, seeks to demonstrate new models for supporting access, that can be taken up widely. The program has been well received by the disabilities sector.
Eighteen (18) projects have been funded in the first round, announced on 30 July 1998. The successful projects range across a variety of disabilities, and all States and Territories, with the exception of the Northern Territory, are represented.
The AccessAbility program is complemented by an online data base, developed in response to calls from the disabilities sector for a Web resource, providing comprehensive information on a broad range of online accessibility issues. The AccessAbility Online Resource incorporates information on standards development and other policy issues, case studies, training issues, hardware and software products and support programs, both from Australian and key international sources.
It is envisaged that submissions for the next round of funding will be called for around March 1999.
The Universal Service Obligation (USO) and the Universal Service Levy
The USO includes a requirement to supply standard telephone services to people in Australia on request. Under section 142 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 , the requirement includes a telephone handset that does not have switching functions or any equivalent customer equipment supplied in order to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (DDA). The Act also includes a power to specify in regulations customer equipment, other goods and services to be supplied to a person with a disability to give people with disabilities and industry greater certainty about the extent of the obligation. The USO is funded under the Universal Service Levy, as required under the Act, to which all carriers contribute according to their eligible revenue for the financial year.
To this end, the Telecommunications (Equipment for the Disabled) Regulations 1998 (the Regulations) specify the kind of customer equipment that 
 is to be supplied to a person with a disability for use in connection with the STS. These Regulations aim to take into account improvements in technology by giving flexibility for equipment provision to vary as technology changes or reduces in price.
Telstra, as the USP, is required to provide this equipment to comply with the Regulations and announced its Disability Equipment Program (DEP) on 17 September 1998. The DEP effectively replaces the Government's original equipment services for TTY's, Telstra's TTY Program and Telstra's broader equipment program for people with disabilities. The current DEP has guaranteed funding under the USO.
National Relay Service
In order to ensure the delivery of the standard telecommunications services to people who are deaf, or who have a hearing and/or speech impairment, the Act also requires the provision of a National Relay Service (NRS). The new arrangements under the Act allow for the funding of the NRS through the NRS Levy to which all carriers are required to contribute on a quarterly basis. As a result, the NRS has guaranteed funding and its services are continually reviewed and enhanced. For example, the NRS now includes the provision of a dedicated emergency call service that is better integrated for faster dispatch of emergency services. The provision of the NRS has been contracted out to the Australian Communication Exchange Limited (ACE LTD).
Funding for consumer representation
The Act (s.593) also allows for the funding of consumer representative bodies on telecommunications issues.
The Blind Citizens of Australia (BCA) successfully applied to the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts for funding of $100,000 under this provision. As required under their contract, BCA has obtained the services of a wide range of representatives from various disability organisations who, when required, work with industry in the development of telecommunications codes and regulations.
Other Comments
The Department administers a range of cultural programs. While many of these encourage applications from particular groups all applications are judged strictly on merit and none therefore include ""positive discrimination"" in the sense of preferential treatment. Departmental cultural programs which provide advice or information contain special features for use by people with disabilities but costings for these elements are included in total program costs. The Department also runs programs directed at overcoming geographic isolation, however, this was not viewed as a personal charac 
 teristic and programs are aimed at communities rather than individuals.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Positive Discrimination Programs</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,15,1,answer
