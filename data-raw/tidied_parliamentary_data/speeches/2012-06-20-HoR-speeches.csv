Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (09:07):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Defence Logistics Transformation Program.


The Defence Logistics Transformation Program is a key strategic reform initiative that will deliver a modern robust and efficient logistic system to support the Australian Defence Force. The program will modernise defence logistics infrastructure and mounting bases, introducing new technologies and refine the business practices across the whole defence logistics network.


New warehouses and maintenance facilities are to be constructed in Moorebank in Western Sydney; Ipswich and Townsville in Queensland; Darwin in the Northern Territory; Perth in Western Australia; Adelaide in South Australia; and Wodonga in regional Victoria.


The capital investment in the program will have economic benefits in these locations for local industry, with significant opportunities for subcontractors and the construction industry over the next three years. 


The total capped budget for the program is $899.6 million, which includes $752.7 million plus GST, which provides for the construction costs; management and design fees; furniture, fittings and equipment; contingencies; and an escalation allowance.


Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in late 2012 and is planned to be completed on all sites by mid-2015. I commend the motion to the House.


Question agreed to.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Development and construction of housing for Defence members and their families at Kellyville, Sydney, New South Wales.


Defence Housing Australia, DHA, proposes to develop a four-hectare greenfield property at Withers Road, Kellyville, New South Wales. The site is approximately 21 kilometres from the Parramatta CBD, 47 kilometres from the Sydney CBD and 24 kilometres from RAAF Base Richmond.


DHA purchased this well-located land from the private market via a private treaty in late 2011. The site was selected due to its close proximity to established shopping and service facilities at Rouse Hill and its central location between RAAF Base Richmond and the Parramatta CBD.


The proposal will involve development of the site over two stages with stage 1 consisting of general, civil and roadworks for the development of 65 serviced allotments; and stage 2 consisting of the construction of 34 dwellings for defence personnel use in the form of 26 integrated townhouses and eight detached dwellings.


The estimated overall project cost is $22.834 million, including GST and excluding the cost of the land. The cost will be met by DHA and recovered through the sale of surplus lots and the DHA sale and lease-back program.


Subject to parliamentary approval, civil construction is expected to commence in April 2013 with dwelling construction to be completed by December 2014. I commend the motion to the House.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report:


Moorebank Units Relocation, Holsworthy, New South Wales.


On 23 April 2012, the Australian government announced its commitment to facilitate delivery of an intermodal terminal by mid-2017 at Moorebank, New South Wales. The future Moorebank Intermodal Terminal is to be developed on land currently occupied by a number of Defence units and facilities, the largest of which is the Australian Army's School of Military Engineering.


Through the Moorebank Units Relocation project, the affected Defence units will be relocated from the Moorebank site into the new facilities to be constructed at the nearby Holsworthy Barracks by the end of 2014. The project proposes to establish five new precincts within the existing Holsworthy Barracks cantonment, which will include the provision of new working, training, living and support facilities for all relocated Defence units.


As part of establishing the new precincts, the project also proposes to improve the overall capability of the base by upgrading or replacing inadequate and non-compliant essential engineering services. Within the new entry precinct, the project also proposes to provide upgraded security arrangements and a new entry to Holsworthy Barracks to address local traffic congestion issues, which will involve the development of a new intersection on Heathcote Road.


In addition to the facilities required at Holsworthy Barracks to support the relocated Moorebank units, several new multi-use facilities are also proposed to be provided by the project to better support the increased base population and to achieve improved cost efficiencies and operational synergies. Redundant facilities beyond their economic life in the vicinity of the proposed new works will be demolished. With about 2,000 construction jobs to be generated by this project over the next three years, it is expected that this project will provide major economic benefits for the wider Sydney region and local industry.


The decision to deliver an intermodal terminal at Moorebank has provided Defence the opportunity to consolidate its activities at Holsworthy Barracks and to achieve cost-effective capability upgrades. This is consistent with extant Defence policy of co-locating units to achieve enhanced operational outcomes and improved operating efficiencies.


The estimated out-turned cost of the proposed work is $869.999 million plus GST. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, the main construction program is scheduled to commence no later than January 2013 and all works are planned to be completed by late 2015. I commend the motion to the House.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (09:27):  This package of bills before the House deals with a range of measures. Schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 and Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012 seek to make directors personally liable for unpaid superannuation. Directors' penalties cannot be discharged by placing the company into administration and directors and associates are liable for PAYG withholding non-compliance tax where a company has failed to pay. 


Schedule 2 of the tax laws amendment bill seeks to retrospectively legislate changes to the taxation financial arrangement scheme, which includes related changes to consolidation tax cost-settings arrangements outlined in schedule 3 of the bill. Finally, schedule 4 of the tax laws amendment bill and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill seeks to double the final withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. I can state at the outset that the coalition will not be supporting the passage of this legislation through the House.


Firstly, I want to deal with schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill and Pay as You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012. As I outline the coalition case for opposition to this package of bills, I will do so sequentially, starting with schedule 1 of the tax law amendment bill and the related pay as you go bill, which contain provisions dealing with director penalties and phoenixing activities. The changes being put forward in relation to director liability and phoenixing activities seek to (1) expand the application of the director penalty regime to unpaid superannuation guarantee charges—and this is what I said before, (2) ensure that directors cannot discharge their director penalties by placing their company into administration or liquidation when PAYG withholding or superannuation guarantee remains unpaid and unreported three months after the due date and (3) in some instances makes directors and their associates liable for PAYG withholding non-compliance tax where the company has failed to pay amounts withheld to the commissioner.


This is the second time that the government has moved to legislate this issue. The first was in November last year, when the government moved an amendment to excise the provisions from TLAB 8 and the associated Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill. This was after a House Standing Committee on Economics inquiry noted concerns from the business community that these bills could apply to all directors, whether engaged in phoenix activity or not. The committee made a bipartisan recommendation that the government should seek to tighten the provisions in those bills to better target actual phoenix activity.


The House economics committee has now inquired into the provisions of the government's second legislative attempt. The coalition have noted in our dissenting report to the House economics committee that this legislation still fails to appropriately target phoenix activity. When is the government going to get it right? We have expressed concerns that 'liability would apply indiscriminately to all directors, including those of charities and not-for-profits that are limited by guarantee'. This is a classic example of further red-tape burdens on business and now further red-tape burdens on charities, and the coalition still views this as a considerable impediment to getting on with the job of life.


The coalition condemns the practice of phoenixing—we always have—which involves a company intentionally accumulating debts to improve cash flows or wealth and then liquidating to avoid repaying the debt. As I have noted to the House previously, phoenix activities are actions by directors to strip out assets to a new company with the intention of liquidating the old company, which is left with net debts. The directors use the corporate veil to protect themselves against any personal liability for the old company's debts. The directors then run the old business through the new company. The old operation rises up from the ashes. The coalition is concerned about the effects of this activity and we recognise the need for legislative safeguards in order to prevent it from occurring.


However, just as the government failed to address our concerns last time, this bill fails to implement protective action that is directed and focused on phoenix activity. The coalition still views these reforms as sweeping changes to deal with a relatively small number of criminally minded individuals. The possibility is very real that innocent directors will be caught in the net. As I said before, I say again: when will the government and ASIC properly use and explain the existing powers and where the existing powers have failed rather than introducing more red tape, more regulation, more legislation? It is smashing a nut with a sledgehammer.


Schedules 2 and 3 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 retrospectively deal with changes to the taxation of financial arrangements, TOFA, and consolidation tax cost setting arrangements. Schedule 2 of the bill deals with the taxation of financial arrangements in the context of tax consolidation. The TOFA legislation which commenced on 26 August 2009 contains tax-timing rules applying to accruals and realisations relating to financial arrangements. The TOFA provisions generally apply to financial arrangements that a TOFA taxpayer entered into during income years commencing on or after 1 July 2010 unless the taxpayer elected to have the TOFA provisions apply early. The amendments in schedule 2 are to be applied retrospectively to 26 March 2009.


The background appears to be the May 2011 Board of Taxation report to the Assistant Treasurer, Review of the consolidation rights to future income and residual tax cost setting rules, which examined the issue of liabilities in the tax consolidation regime. The Board of Taxation noted that there may be some circumstances in which it would be appropriate for a future tax deduction to be denied for the amount of a liability of a joining entity. Schedule 2 will affect the taxation treatment applying to TOFA liabilities that are assumed by a head company, or a lead company, when it acquires another entity joining the consolidated group. The effect of the amendment will be to deny a deduction to the head company when the liability is eventually discharged.


What makes this retrospective change worse is the fact that it will have an even greater impact on one set of consolidated groups in respect of their pre-TOFA acquisitions. Those most disadvantaged are those consolidated groups that made an election to apply TOFA rules to corporate acquisitions of joining entities they had effected before the TOFA legislation started. This is referred to as ungrandfathering. Taxpayers, advisors and professional bodies are aggrieved at the retrospective nature of these amendments. There will be some corporate groups who have made important investment decisions based on the law as it stood when TOFA commenced. There will be some that made the important election whether to apply TOFA to their existing financial arrangements based on the law as it then stood.


Again, in the wake, in the last 24 hours, of the government's retrospective amendments to transfer pricing, here is legislation that is dealing with retrospectivity, further creating sovereign risk. The submission by Deloitte to the exposure draft on the proposed changes to the consolidation regime noted that it was unfair to deny deduction in the circumstances. It said:


The retrospective application of the proposed changes to TOFA and consolidation interaction provisions 26 March 2009 is unfair to taxpayers who relied on the existing tax legislation when making significant business decisions on acquisitions or deciding whether or not to make a transitional election to apply the TOFA rules to their existing financial arrangements. These taxpayers would have acted on the belief that they would be entitled to certain deductions which will not be available if the proposed changes apply retrospectively.


In this place last night we had divisions because the government was going back seven years to change the law in relation to transfer pricing. Here we have businesses that entered into agreements in good faith relating to transfer-pricing arrangements and the government says, 'Look, even though the law didn't exist at the time, we're going to retrospectively change the law to make things that you thought complied with the law unlawful, even though that law did not exist at the time.'! 


Now, within 24 hours, here we are again—Groundhog Day!—retrospective tax legislation, in this case going back to 26 March 2009—and in this case, even after the tax office had given private rulings approving of transactions. Even now the government are saying: 'Look, we're going back. We are changing the rules. We can't claim enough tax from people going forward; we're gonna claim tax off people going backwards.'! This government just can't get enough tax out of you. So they are not only going to claim more tax out of you for all you do tomorrow; the government are going to claim more tax out of you for what you did yesterday, because what they are getting today just isn't enough to meet their wasteful ways.


Then they say to us, 'You guys are responsible for negativity out there.' That is what they say to us. They blame us for negative consumer sentiment. They blame us for negative business sentiment. It is all our fault. It's all Tony Abbott's fault; it's all Joe Hockey's fault—as if we write the speeches for Ivan Glasenberg in London when he says, 'We are getting greater business certainty out of Congo than we are getting out of Australia.' Or Marius Kloppers or Jac Nasser at BHP when they warn of uncertain business times in Australia. As I said yesterday, we do not write the press releases for Gerry Harvey, John Singleton or John Symond. We do not write those releases, they do, because they have to deal with this type of legislation—retrospective tax legislation. They have to deal with it. How can anyone have confidence about the future when there is a government that is changing today's laws tomorrow? Why would you take a risk? Why would you go out and borrow money to buy a new house? Why would you do that in this environment? Fewer and fewer people are doing it, because they are nervous about the government. 


There is a sovereign risk, and before the House for the second day in a row we have retrospective tax legislation. No wonder people are afraid to take a risk. How do you price-risk when a government says, 'We're going to change yesterday's laws'? How do you do that? And where are the accountable people in the Treasury or in the Australian Taxation Office? Who are the people that are going to be held accountable for what is deemed to be original drafting errors? Where are they? What heads have rolled? Because, if you are writing retrospective tax legislation that involves billions of dollars of back taxes being claimed at a time when there were legitimate business investments, someone is going to be sacked out there. People are going to lose their jobs. Of course they are. Where billions of dollars are transferred from the private sector to the public sector, someone is going to have to pay. Of course there will be job losses. There will be investments that will stall. Who is accountable in the government? If it occurred under a previous coalition government and now it occurs under the Labor Party, who are the public servants that were responsible for these drafting errors? Is the minister going to answer that? This is serious stuff. It involves billions of dollars, as I understand it, and yet there is no accountability. They think: 'Oh well, we'll just shuffle it through the House of Reps and the Senate. It'll be okay.' 


But out there real people will lose their jobs. They have to, so who is going to be accountable here? This is what kills confidence. The government kills confidence. It kills confidence when it changes the laws that applied yesterday, but also it kills confidence when it changes the laws as they stand. We have seen it in relation to company tax, carbon tax, mining tax, superannuation tax, taxation of employee share schemes and now it seems there is an endless list of retrospective taxes. The mountain that we have to climb if there is a change of government is just getting bigger and bigger every day.


Schedule 3 is another complex amendment to the tax consolidation legislation. At Senate estimates last month in response to coalition question, Treasury advised that the amendments in schedule 3 addressed issues that arose out of amendments to the tax legislation enacted on 3 June 2010. Treasury's advice was that there had been extensive public consultation over a number of years prior to the 2010 amendments being passed. Despite that, the Board of Taxation noted in its report I referred to earlier that in 2011 the ATO were aware of claims and potential claims by consolidated groups for deductions of over $30 billion in respect to the 2010 amendments. This amount did not include interest or the revenue associated with transactions that have taken place since 30 June 2010.


The Treasury is to be commended for carrying out an internal examination of why the revenue risk associated with the amendments was not recognised prior to passage. But there are questions that remain. The fact that the amendments took effect from the commencement of the consolidation regime on 1 July 2002 only partly explains the quantum of the claims. Evidence given by Treasury at estimates was that the information given to Treasury through the consultation process did not fully draw out the downside risks with the legislation.


Quality control in relation to taxation legislation is crucial. This is even more so where transactions are large and involve considerable commercial complexity. Tax consolidation legislation is almost a category of its own. Quality control starts with competent and capable personnel. It involves appropriate supervision and monitoring of compliance with the department's standards, having regard to the huge sum of revenue associated with the claimed deductions. There must be careful oversight by Treasury into the quality and risk processes associated with developing tax policy, drafting the requisite legislation, and ensuring that consultation is open and frank, including the participation of the ATO.


This process would not have been helped by the fact that the government has had no less than five Assistant Treasurers since coming to office only 4½ years ago—five Assistant Treasurers in 4½ years! The pick-up and put-down of legislative priorities for this particular portfolio by the various ministers wandering through the revolving door of the Labor ministry seems to have negatively impacted the consultation processes, reviews, stakeholder feedback and deadlines for taxation legislation. Quite simply, this is not the way to run a country. It is not the way to run a taxation system.


In summary, the changes contained in schedule 3 seek to modify the consolidation tax cost setting arrangements and rights to future income rules so that tax outcomes for consolidated groups are more consistent, in the view of the government, with the tax outcomes that arise when assets are required outside of the consolidation regime.


This raises a number of concerns, given that the government is retrospectively amending the consolidation tax cost setting arrangements according to the time when the corporate acquisition took place. The changes within the bill will impact acquisitions that took place on various dates. The first period is prior to 12 May 2010, being the date when the amending legislation was passed by both houses of parliament, when what are referred to as the 'pre rules' will apply. The second time period is after 30 March 2011, being the date the Board of Taxation was asked to review the 2010 amendments, and referred to as the 'prospective rules'. The final period is the intervening period, known as the 'interim rules'. Did you hear that? And this is a government committed to simplification! Given that the changes passed on 12 May 2010 relates to amendments that date back to 2002, some of the amendments related to consolidation within this bill will have effect from 2002—that is, 10 years of retrospectivity. They are cheering out there in business land. Ten years of retrospectivity!


Entities affected by the proposed changes in schedule 3 will be adversely impacted by the retrospective changes, in particular, those changes editing the acquired rights to future income. This is because, for tax purposes, many of these rights will now have a cost base of zero, as opposed to those entities outside the consolidation's regime with a cost base equal to that of the purchase price. The resetting of the cost base to nil for entities of the consolidation regime, combined with its retrospective application, will disadvantage taxpayers that have elected to be in the consolidation regime.


The coalition opposes retrospective application. That is a position that we on this side of the House uphold. In its submission to the House Standing Committee on Economics, the Tax Institute referred to a number of factors that weigh against the retrospective amendments proposed in schedule 3. Another relevant point, made by CPA Australia, that it is inequitable that a taxpayer who has lodged a ruling or amendment request prior to 31 March 2011 receives a different treatment simply because it is not actioned by the relevant cut-off time, which at the time of the lodgement was not a factor. They said:


Taxpayers should not receive differing treatment in circumstances where they have no control over the outcome.


It is because of their retrospective application that the coalition will not support the measures contained in schedules 2 and 3.


Schedule 4 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill, along with the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012, seeks to double the final withholding tax on management investment trusts from 7½ to 15 per cent from 1 July 2012. The coalition understands the minister is going to be moving an amendment to excise schedule 4 of the tax law amendment bill and the related managed investment trust withholding tax bill. How about that? After announcing it in the budget, the government rushes in the legislation and now are they going to excise it! I am sorry, is this meant to be a key budget initiative?


This is the third backflip from the government and the financial year has not even started! It seems like yesterday that the Treasurer delivered the budget—now we have got the third major amendment to the budget. The first is that they were dumping the company tax cuts, but now they are back on the table—those tax cuts that were only recently dumped in the budget are an article of faith, according to the Prime Minister. The second one is the passenger movement charge, remember that? The government has now dumped the CPI increases that they said were a part of the budget. The CPI increases have now gone. Now, there is the third factor—three strikes. The third one is that they are now dumping their determination to increase the withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent.


You wonder why people are uncertain and why business is confused. Look no further than the actions at the hands of the government over the last three weeks alone. We had already announced that we would be opposing the measure after the Labor government previously reducing interest on withholding tax—which we praised. They reduced it and now they want to double it. What does that say to investors? The government make a decision—it is the same political party; it is the same Treasurer—and they reduce the interest withholding tax and then they wake up one day and decide, 'We are going to double it'. And you wonder why people like Ivan Glasenberg are giving speeches in London, saying that it is easier to deal with the Congo than it is to deal with the Australian government. Well, there is the evidence.


David Denison, President and CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board stated—and this is what we hear all the time:


In this era of fiscal restraint and additional direct and indirect taxes, we are becoming increasingly concerned that some risks associated with ownership of infrastructure are expanding. For instance, it is easy to envision the regulatory rate setting process becoming politicized instead of objective and fair. The same could occur with taxes—in fact, Australia’s budget that was tabled last week effectively doubled the tax burden on our real estate and infrastructure holdings in that country.


If we conclude that these kinds of risks within any country become significant enough to call into question the predictability and stability of cash flows that are at the heart of the investment rationale for infrastructure, our response will be very quick and rational—we will simply stop investing there.


That was the head of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. He is saying it is too hard to do business. I did not write that speech. Tony Abbott did not write that speech. These are international investors that are saying, 'Hang on; this sort of sovereign risk in Australia is becoming just too hard. We will stop investing in infrastructure.'


The chopping and changing of the MIT withholding tax has yet again reduced our predictability, our stability and our certainty in the eyes of international investors when they want to come here. They want to come here. They want a stable place to invest for the long term, and Australia as a net importer of capital needs that. But they have a government that keep screwing it up. In 2008 they reduced the interest withholding tax from 30 per cent to 7½ per cent, and now they want to double it, as they announced in the budget: 'Sorry, we've changed our minds; now we're taking it out'. Why? Why can't the government hold a policy position? Forget four years, three years or two years; why can't they hold a policy position for three weeks? Why can't they hold a policy position for two months?


I know the minister at the table is one who frets about this. He was sent out into the coalface and told to sell a carbon tax package that the Labor Party promised they would never deliver—but, of course, they have. And they wonder why there is uncertainty. The coalition does not support the doubling of final withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. We are going to ask the minister at the table, who is responsible when this amendment is being moved by the government, to explain himself. Why can't the government hold a tax policy together? Why does the government now go deep into retrospective tax legislation in order to try and fund its budget?


As I stated earlier, the coalition will not be supporting the passage of this package of bills through the parliament. We believe on many fronts that the government has failed to listen to the community. We believe that the government gives lip service to consultation with stakeholders. We keep getting this feedback, saying, 'Oh, the Treasury, the Australian Taxation Office and the government have consulted with the business community.' The business community is over that feigned, pretend consultation. It does not seem to move the government during what is meant to be a fair dinkum consultation process. No, the government is so determined to proceed that it then goes and announces initiatives in the budget, goes and introduces legislation into the parliament, and then changes its mind.


What a dysfunctional rabble we have running the place in Canberra. This is tax policy. This is not tens of millions of dollars or a program here and a program there; it is billions and billions of dollars. It involves international confidence in our nation. The more the Treasurer and the Prime Minister talk about Australia and the Australian way, the more they are ridiculed by their actions—their actions in having retrospective tax legislation yesterday going back seven years, in having retrospective tax legislation today going back 10 years, in announcing policy in relation to interest withholding tax and then changing their mind a few weeks later, in the passenger movement charge and in the company tax cuts. This is a government that cannot be trusted. It is an embarrassment, and the Minister for Resources and Energy knows how embarrassing it is to be a part of a government that cannot keep its promises or make up its mind. (Time expired)

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (09:58):  I speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012, the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. There we saw a pitiful and pathetic attempt by the shadow Treasurer to oppose these bills. Gough Whitlam, the former Labor Prime Minister, once said that only the impotent are pure. Well, I tell you what, there is not much purity on the other side when it comes to retrospectivity, as the Assistant Treasurer outlined yesterday in this place, with example after example of those opposite bringing in retrospective taxation legislation. So do not come into this place and lecture us about this, when we are fixing up a problem that has operated in one of these respects, on the shadow Treasurer's admission, since 2002. Who was in power in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and for most of 2007? Those opposite were in power, and they did nothing about fixing up the problems, as we are doing here.


The shadow Treasurer said in relation to the passage of these particular bills that it involved billions and billions of dollars of taxpayers' funds. Have a look at the financial impact that the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill is going to have. The revenue impact this year of schedule 1 of the bill will be $32.5 million; the impact of schedule 2 will be $66 million; the impact of schedule 3 will be nil; and the impact of schedule 4 will be $65 million. So it will not be the billions and billions of dollars the shadow Treasurer referred to time and time again in his speech. He made exaggerated claim after exaggerated claim, and the same thing is happening all the time.


The shadow Treasurer talked about sovereign risk and said that the passage of these bills and the operation of this government present a sovereign risk to this country. He spoke as if there has been a great exodus of investment from this country, when in fact half a trillion dollars has been invested in the mining sector—in iron ore and in coal. You can see Australian ships carrying iron ore and coal lined up one after another in places such as the Pohang steelworks in South Korea. People came into this country and made massive investments notwithstanding the GFC. In 2009 and 2010 we saw massive foreign investment in this country. In 2009, there was an 11.1 per cent increase in foreign direct investment in Australia. This was followed by a 7.5 per cent increase—a total of $474 billion—in 2010. Are all the foreign investors coming to this country stupid? No, they are not. Do they have economic idiocy running through their brains? No, they do not. But to believe the jeremiads from the shadow Treasurer about these bills is to believe that all these barons of capitalism and captains of industry—these mining companies and these superannuation funds trustees—are all dills. Why, if you believed a word that those opposite have said, would they invest in Australia? Why would all these shadow ministers and opposition backbenchers invest in these companies—as we have seen them do time and time again—if you believed a word of what the shadow Treasurer said was true? He is like a profit of doom. He is like some sort of Old Testament prophet—woe is me! I half expected sackcloth and ashes to be thrown around the chamber during the shadow Treasurer's speech! It was nonsense.


He said not a word about how schedule 1 of the bill protects the superannuation entitlements of workers and therefore the revenue base of this country by making directors liable to pay superannuation and preventing them getting credits through collapsing their companies and not paying the PAYG withholding obligations. There has been not a word from the architects and the apostles of Work Choices over there about protecting workers. There has not been a word about that from them, but that is what schedule 1 of the bill is all about—making sure that workers' superannuation entitlements and government revenue are protected. The shadow Treasurer is not worried about workers or the revenue base of the country. Those opposite are not interested in either putting in place deterrents to phoenix operations or strengthening and extending the director penalty regime—the DPR—to cover superannuation obligations. It currently only applies to PAYG withholding obligations. The shadow Treasurer said nothing about that—and just waxed on, way off beam.


These bills are important because we do not want people to fail in their obligations to workers, as has happened in the past. I am sure that as members of parliament all of us have had people come up to us at street stalls, at mobile offices and at electorate offices and have talked to us about fraudulent phoenix activity. I am sure that there is not a member of this chamber who has not had someone come and say to them: 'I'm working for a business, and that business has failed. It's unable to pay its debts. I had superannuation, and they didn't pay the superannuation guarantee. They didn't meet their taxation obligations.'


We are making sure that these directors are more accountable for what they fail to do. We are making sure that there is a deterrent in place to prevent directors doing just this sort of thing. We are making sure make sure that they fulfil their obligations. We do not want taxation liabilities left unpaid, and that is why these bills are before this chamber. We do not want outstanding debts, and we want to make sure that these directors are liable. If the company is unable to meet its withholding amounts to the commissioner, the directors must place the company into voluntary administration or liquidation. Currently the Commissioner of Taxation has the ability to penalise the directors an amount equal to any PAYG withholding that has fallen overdue, but the director penalty regime in the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill makes them personally liable.


We want to expand the responsibility and the scope of liability of the directors to cover unpaid superannuation guarantees to employees; remedy any possible escape from liability by preventing the discharge of the director's penalties when a company is placed in liquidation and PAYG or superannuation obligations remain outstanding; and impose obligations on directors and their associates to pay PAYG withholding non-compliance tax on withheld PAYG amounts that have not been paid to the commissioner and so forth. I did not hear much from the shadow Treasurer about those measures, which, in my view, are the principal reasons for bills such as those that are before the House.


We are committed to making sure that we protect workers' entitlements. This Labor government has a proud record of getting rid of pernicious and arbitrary legislation imposed on Australian workers by those opposite and of standing up to protect the revenue base of this country when those opposite set themselves against government on taxation issues, as they always seem to do. Schedule 2 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill deals with problems that have been around for a while. It amends the taxation of financial arrangements—consolidation interaction provisions—in the Income Tax Assessment Act and balances these adjustments with other legislation to make sure that the tax treatment of financial arrangements is part of assets and liabilities in a merger or takeover, that it is consistent with the TOFA tax timing rules and that it takes into account changes in the value of financial arrangements or liabilities. This is important legislation. It amends legislation to make sure that our provisions are consistent, it makes sure that we have a good arrangement protecting the taxation bases. It ensures that taxation treatment of financial arrangements is consistent with the rules we have put in place in terms of timing and I support that.


Schedule 3 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act, modifying consolidation of tax cost setting rules so that the tax outcomes for consolidated groups are more consistent with the tax outcomes that arise when assets are acquired outside the consolidation arrangement. We amended the regime in relation to consolidation in 2010 as clarification. For some assets this reset tax costs from the original tax costs, in the case of consolidation of corporate arrangements. We want to make sure that it is used as a taxing point when it later arises for the purpose of the assets. 


Shortly after that some unintended consequences arose. We have taken steps about that. The opposition say they are not supportive of what we are saying, but the Board of Taxation was asked to look at these arrangements and recommended that we conduct the kind of legislative amendments that are necessary. The board concluded the scope of the new rules was broader than was originally intended at the time of the announcement in 2005—when we were not in power—and could allow some consolidating groups to access deductions that were not available to other taxpayers outside the consolidation regime. So it is a longstanding problem that operated before we came into power. This is fixing up a mess that happened on the watch of the previous government as well.


I will let the minister talk about schedule 4 but I want to make a point about criticisms made of us that we reduced the withholding tax rate paid from managed investment trusts. We reduced the MIT payments to foreign residents from the rate of 30 per cent to 15 per cent. We did that as part of our election commitment back in 2007 when we went to the polls. That is consistent with other countries. The United States and the United Kingdom have 15 per cent. It was 30 per cent under the previous coalition government.


We are a government that is interested in foreign investment. We welcome foreign investment in this country. We think it is important. We do not have sufficient population or dollars and cents to develop our country—vast continent that it is—without foreign investment. We are a country that has grown by virtue of immigration and having people come to this place. They come as employees and employers. We welcome them when they come to the rural, manufacturing and the mining sectors. We, on this side of the chamber, are people who believe both in free trade and fair trade and believe that the criticism of our support of foreign investment is unjustified and exaggerated. We saw that well and truly on display by the shadow Treasurer whose words were nonsensical and alarmist in this regard, once again so much like some sort of Old Testament prophet going around saying, 'We are all doomed and no-one should have any confidence,' and then having the temerity to criticise us when we say that they are putting a dampener on consumer and business confidence in this country. I support the legislation.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (10:11):  It is always fascinating to follow the member for Blair. He seems to have one theme, no matter what he is talking about. It is always contradictory when you sit and listen. He stands up and, in the most virulent manner, accuses the opposition of endless negativity and then proceeds for the length of his 15-minute contribution—or whatever it may be—with endless negativity. The government seem to be obsessed with abusing this side of politics and the member for Blair is a classic example of that. I think it reflects the fact that, even though they are the government and should have plenty to say because they are responsible for introducing measures and legislation and defending that legislation, they have nothing to say really. The member for Blair read what is contained in the bill and in essence gave no argument of any consequence in support of those measures.


The bill has been in the public arena now for some weeks. There have been some very trenchant concerns and frustrations about some of these provisions. There have been statements made not only by the opposition—let us put us aside—but by the people in the businesses and investors who will be affected by the changes that are proposed. At the very least the lead speaker for the government on this bill should provide some critique of the concerns that have been raised by important members of the community, people who are creating thousands of jobs, looking to promote billions of dollars of investment, looking for certainty, looking for the absence of sovereign risk.


You would think that the member for Blair would address some of these concerns that have been listed over several weeks very prominently in the newspapers and elsewhere, yet he went on an exercise of simply reading out what is in the legislation in between all these histrionic attacks on the opposition and inflammatory language about the way in which we have expressed our concerns over the legislation. I must say it is a pathetic contribution and it adds nothing to this debate. It does reflect the morale that we see on the other side and the concern by the adults on the other side that this government is one of the most inept, if not the most inept, governments in our lifetime. It is a government which has lost any sense of direction, if it ever had any. It is a government that is confusing people all over this economy and, externally, with investors in foreign markets. It is a government that has, at its root—because of its incompetence, inconsistency, flip-flopping and lack of direction—very materially created a crisis of confidence amongst households in this country. They have been saving disposable income at a rate of 12 per cent over the last year because they are afraid to spend. They are building up reserves and paying off the mortgage because of their fear. They are worried about their jobs. There is a crisis of confidence. They have pulled $90 billion of discretionary income out of the marketplace. 


No wonder our retail sector is on its knees. It is because of the lack of confidence. It is because they are waking up at 2.30 in the morning worried about whether they are going to have a job. We see endlessly, each week, reports of companies that are going to the wall and putting off thousands of people. Sure, we are blessed with what is going on with the mining boom in the west and in Queensland. Put that aside, and the rest of the country has stopped. The investors, major companies, have got serious money on their balances sheets that they are not investing because there is a crisis of confidence not only amongst households but also amongst businesses.


This sort of legislation is another classic example, another symbol, of the deep sense of confusion and lack of confidence and uncertainty that is now riddled through our economy—at a time when we are blessed with the mining boom. It is a boom that has been going for 10 years and has been wasted by this government. Every dollar of the $800 cheques that are going out is still being borrowed. Can you believe it! After 10 years of a boom and the highest terms of trade in our history—monumentally higher than anything we ever had before—we still have $800 going out to households, every dollar being borrowed. And then there is the flip-flopping that is represented in this bill. 


We will not be supporting this set of bills, as my colleague the shadow Treasurer announced, because it adds to the great uncertainty and concern about consistency, flip-flopping and the litany of sovereign risk issues that now confront investors who may be looking to put their money in Australia—or investors in Australia looking to take a risk and invest in and create jobs. The changes proposed under the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2011 do not appropriately target phoenix activity. The government has failed to argue a strong enough public justification for the retrospective application of proposed changes contained in schedules 2 and 3 of the tax laws amendment bill. This is in relation to consolidation tax cost-setting arrangements and related changes to taxation and financial arrangements. 


My colleague the shadow Treasurer went through in some detail—and with great clarity—the way in which schedules 2 and 3 are a lazy attempt to plug some spending holes that this government has. It is a lazy attempt to use retrospective legislation to grab some tax from years ago. The retrospective application of these changes heightens our sovereign risk profile.


As an opposition we have very strong in-principle opposition to retrospective tax changes and if anything were ever to be done it would need enormous justification. The reasons this government has put forward are very shallow. In fact, if you listened to the member for Blair he gave no justification of any consequence for the retrospection. All he did was criticise and defame the shadow Treasurer and others on this side of the House. Our opposition stems from the fact that retrospective tax changes can change the substance of bargains struck between taxpayers who made every effort to comply with laws prevailing at the time the agreement was entered into. People who acted lawfully are now going to be slugged, potentially some years later, with an unexpected and in some cases highly significant tax grab by this government.


We are opposed to retrospective changes because they can expose taxpayers to penalties in circumstances where taxpayers could not possibly have taken steps, at the earlier time, to mitigate the potential for penalties. We oppose retrospective changes because they may change taxpayers' tax profiles. This, in turn, can materially impact on the financial viability of investment decisions and the pricing of those decisions—years after they were taken, years after people acted in good faith and made a case based on the prevailing legislation. They did their ROI assessments and deals with other companies and took risks based on the prevailing legislation. Now they find they will be lumped with an unexpected, highly material and in some cases debilitating tax bill. It will also leave a mark on their reputation. For many if not all who have acted within the law they will feel they have been unjustly labelled as tax cheats. In some cases, businesses will go to the wall because they took decisions at the time based on the prevailing law. We are opposed to retrospective tax changes because they could increase Australia's level of perceived sovereign risk. Added to these changes is the litany of sovereign risk issues from the introduction of a carbon tax, which was promised never to be introduced, and from the introduction of the mining tax, which exists nowhere else in the world, and, again, the incompetent way in which that has been dealt with over the last 18 months or nearly two years. Then there is the way in which they handled the live cattle job. They have actually created a long-term poisoned pill in the middle of our relationship with Indonesia—our closest neighbour, with a population of nearly 300 million, and a big part of our future, and yet our trade with that country is smaller than with New Zealand and its four million people. Can you believe it? And yet this government has gone out of its way to compromise and frustrate and demean that nation by, overnight, with absolutely no forewarning, announcing, via email, that we were going to cut off 40 per cent of their imported protein, indefinitely, because of a television program three nights before in Australia. Can you believe it? This is the sign of a government which is just amateur hour, and people see all of these things. Now we have a whole raft of changes which have retrospective elements to them.


The final element of these bills is the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. We hear rumours now that it is going to be withdrawn and possibly some grubby deal is to be done with the Greens. Maybe we will see it introduced, who knows? Nothing will surprise us. Nothing will surprise the rest of business. It will only confirm the judgment they are making: 'Let's not invest. There's too much uncertainty. This government's got no idea.' They have already made a change, yesterday, in the CPI matter, for the passenger movement charge—only a lazy $140 million! But they have withdrawn that. Now, today, we hear that they may well have withdrawn this bill, which increases the withholding tax on foreign investment from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent—just another lazy $265 million! It is the only reason they introduced it in the first place. It was a measure that they introduced some four years ago and received great commendation, including from ourselves. It was an inspired move, to reduce the withholding tax to 7½ per cent. And it has had a material effect. There have been literally billions of dollars, especially coming into the housing and construction sector. We were starting to see billions of dollars being invested in infrastructure through this mechanism. Now all of that will be put on hold. We are literally sacrificing billions and billions of dollars of investment, and a decision, which got commendation around the world and certainly within this country, has now been turned on its head for a miserable $264 million. We even have a situation where research subsequently conducted by Allen Consulting Group is saying that, for every billion-dollar drop in investment—and there will be billions, many billions—from the increased tax, it will raise $40 million less in revenue from the tax increase in 2015-16, than the $75 million predicted by the government. So it is not even going to raise the money they expected. So they have taken this step which has again materially affected our sovereign risk for no good reason.


So we have a $400 million hole in the budget. And today we see the Reserve Bank has indicated that the forecast sharp swing to budget surplus next financial year mostly reflects shuffling of spending that will limit the scope for further interest rate rises. The RBA has just confirmed that the budget surplus is a hoax—it is a con. It is a fiction. What we have been saying all along—and what businesses suspects, and what everyone suspects, everyone knows—is that the one-and-a-half-billion-dollar surplus is a con. It is never going to happen. Again, it is a sovereign risk issue now.


All of these things are adding up—adding up to a point where this is very dangerous for the country. We are opposed to these bills. This government is out of control. It is all over the place. It must be stopped. The only way this will happen is with an election. (Time expired)

"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Mr MELHAM
 (Banks) (10:26):  I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012, the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012. 


I want to address a couple of points that the member for Goldstein made in his contribution. The first thing I want to say to the House is: I am not opposed to retrospective legislation in certain circumstances. That has been a feature of legislative reform over the years—obviously, not in every single case, but it is warranted in a number of cases. Indeed, it is warranted sometimes in the criminal law. Indeed, when we had the war crimes legislation under the Hawke government, it produced retrospective legislation against abhorrent conduct that occurred at the time of the Second World War. That legislation was supported, and it made criminal acts that should have been criminal at the time. So you just cannot rule it out.


Today we see on the front pages of the newspapers a shyster, a solicitor, who was overcharging his clients and who, some 12 months ago in New South Wales, transferred to his wife millions of dollars worth of assets, be it his share of the family home for a dollar, or his share of a farm for a dollar. It is said that his assets can be recovered. That is what is being said in the papers. But I say to you, Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath: if that shyster's assets cannot be recovered then the New South Wales government should introduce legislation and it should be retrospective legislation that enables it to recover his assets, because he was under investigation and during the period of that investigation has transferred his assets, for a dollar, in some instances, where the value was much more. What are we supposed to do as legislators—do what the coalition does in a number of instances: be like moo cows, watching the passing traffic? No, in my opinion, you come in and you legislate, and a retrospective feature is warranted—not in all circumstances but in some circumstances.


The reason I rise to support this particular legislation has to do with features of it in terms of phoenix activity. I go to the explanatory memorandum, which says:


Schedule 1 to this Bill strengthens directors’ obligations to cause their company to comply with its existing Pay As You Go (PAYG) withholding and superannuation guarantee requirements. These amendments reduce the scope for companies to engage in fraudulent phoenix activity or escape liabilities and payments of employee entitlements by:


extending the director penalty regime to make directors personally liable for their company’s unpaid superannuation guarantee amounts;


ensuring that directors cannot discharge their director penalties by placing their company into administration or liquidation when PAYG withholding or superannuation guarantee remains unpaid and unreported three months after the due date; and


in some instances, making directors and their associates liable to PAYG withholding non-compliance tax where the company has failed to pay amounts withheld to the Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner).


The explanatory memorandum goes on to summarise regulation impact statements and explain other aspects of the bills. In particular, it says at paragraph 1.7:


The director penalty regime makes directors of companies that fail to comply with their obligation to pay amounts withheld under the PAYG withholding regime to the Commissioner (or fail to pay an estimate of their PAYG withholding liability) personally liable for the amount that the company should have paid, through imposition of a penalty.


It continues in paragraph 1.11:


Phoenix activity poses a significant threat to employee entitlements, government revenue and the economy as a whole. In its most basic form, a fraudulent phoenix company is used to intentionally accumulate debts and then is placed into voluntary administration or liquidation to avoid paying those debts. The business then ‘re emerges’ as another corporate entity, controlled by the same person or group, but free of debts. However, some aspects of the director penalty regime limit its efficacy in ensuring that directors cause their companies to comply with their obligations, including in phoenix cases.


Some evidence was put before the Standing Committee on Economics on 27 October 2011 by Mr Grant Darmanin, a senior director and the Phoenix Risk Manager of the Australian Taxation Office, that is worth mentioning. On page 29 of the committee report, he says:


Our best estimate is that at any given time there are around 6,000 phoenix companies operating in Australia, and we estimate that, given that not all of them have a single director—some have two directors—somewhere between 7½ thousand and 9,000 company directors could be exposed in particular to this legislation. These are fraudulent phoenix operators; they are not just people making business decisions.


That is what he says in evidence. Then on page 31 he says:


Fraudulent phoenix operators, almost to a person, do not report, they do not lodge and they do not pay. We have to go out and identify them and quantify the liability, sometimes using forensic-style investigative or audit techniques.


I think it is important to put on the record that on page 32, Mr Darmanin says:


There are, but phoenix operators, particularly the fraudulent ones, are very adept at flying under the radar, so to speak. When they come back into the ATO's systems, they will quite often use as the director someone who is not directly related to the former group. It might be someone that they engage, pay or hire or a name they pick from the telephone book. When we profile that individual when it comes through, quite often the direct links to that former business are not obvious. I take your point, though, that if we ask them questions we may get some answers, but phoenix operators do not like telling the truth.


Then on page 33, the chair says:


Okay. So there are 6,000 to 7,000 that you know about. Do you have an estimate of how many you might not know about and how many new ones come in every year? 


Mr Darmanin responded:


No, we do not. There have been various studies done over the years, not so much by the ATO but by other committees and organisations, that have made various assessments of the impact of phoenix activity on the Australian economy. The most recent one was a 2004 parliamentary joint committee inquiry into corporations and financial services. That put the impact on the Australian economy at that time—2004—as being between $1 billion and $2.4 billion per annum. That is the most recent hard data we have to work with. Since that time, all the ATO's experience is that fraudulent phoenix activity has continued to increase not decrease, despite the ATO having a targeted approach to try to address this behaviour since the late nineties. 


The chair then asked:


How much is it increasing every year?


Mr Darmanin responded:


It is hard to be definitive around that. When I say 'increasing', the indicators that we look at are the number of complaints being lodged by individuals whose entitlements have not been paid and we look at those companies and find that they are involved in repeat phoenix behaviour. We have incidents of companies incurring repeat liabilities—companies who are given an income tax adjustment the first time who choose to liquidate and continue their business through a new company rather than pay those assessments, for example. We have break-outs in different parts of our business, as I talked about before. A lot of phoenix activity in previous years used to be at the lower end of the SME market; now it is across the whole of the SME market. It is active in the micromarket as well. Originally, it used to be PAYE and prescribed payments, when we had that system; now it is in the superannuation, GST and income tax.


The member for Goldstein talks about sovereign risk. What I see here is risk to the ordinary taxpayer—to the ordinary hardworking individual—from shonks. The parliament should go after the shonks and set a legislative framework, even if it requires retrospectivity, that puts these people on notice that they will be personally liable and that we will come after them if they engage in this sort of behaviour. And we should not apologise for it. Recently we saw a situation where the High Court came down in terms of directors' liabilities and duties to do with a particular company dealing with asbestos. I welcome that unanimous decision of the High Court, because what it says is, 'If you want to be a director, don't bother just picking up your director's cheque. You actually have to do your homework. You have to read your papers. You have to read the press releases before they go out.' What it means is that directors have to take responsibility as directors, not just occupy those positions for the sake of an honorarium or some remuneration, and that they can themselves be liable. What we had in the James Hardie case, I think, was the High Court being spot-on in terms of the liability of those directors—those that tried to hide behind the claim, 'Well, I didn't read the press release, so I'm not liable.'


In relation to phoenix companies, which are much worse, we should not apologise for the action that we are taking, even involving a level of retrospectivity in this legislation. When the member for Goldstein talks about sovereign risk, I think he is using an expanded definition of 'sovereign risk' to bring this sort of activity that the government is involved in into the definition of 'sovereign risk'. I am concerned about sovereign risk, as we all are, but I am also concerned about employees' entitlements, because time and again we have seen under this government and the former government companies going belly-up and employee entitlements going out the window. Here we are talking about activity that is despicable activity, deliberately setting up companies to do the wrong thing, maximising the money to certain individuals and minimising any liability.


So I have no hesitation in standing up in the House today and supporting this legislation, notwithstanding the fact that there are elements of retrospectivity in the legislation, because what I would say is that it should not cause concern if the conduct that we are talking about is captured retrospectively. It is not outside the bounds. This notion of 'retrospectivity never at any cost' is rubbish. I believe in retrospectivity in appropriate cases. When it comes to phoenix activity or dishonourable behaviour, you can legislate retrospectively to pick it up, because the threat of that retrospectivity of itself is a powerful deterrent to the shonks. It says to them, 'You're not going to be able to get away with it.'


What it is about is greed, so you have to attack the greed and the loot that they are looking for with, in some instances, the threat of retrospectivity, which might stop certain behaviour. That is the only way. When you talk about deterrent effects, I say to you: when it comes to money and when it comes to this sort of behaviour, deterrence does have an impact in the corporate sector for some of these shonks. If they think they can transfer assets to their partners, their relatives or whatever with immunity and it is not going to be captured or picked up if they are caught out, they will do it. I am not arguing for retrospectivity in every instance—I am not saying that—but what I am saying to you is that in some instances it is warranted. In this instance, to me, it is certainly within the realm and within the principles. It has been, I think, pointed out by other speakers that there has been retrospective legislation in the life of the former government. So they did it—not as a regular occurrence, but on a number of occasions it was done. So let us not be too precious in relation to that. I commend the bills to the House.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (10:41):  What an interesting group of bills: the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012; the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012, which has the retrospectivity linked to it; and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012. It is quite a complex group of bills. However, I rise today to speak about the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill, the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill.


I express my concerns in relation to these bills because I believe they are inadequate in their process and assessment and they fail to pay consideration to a number of associated issues and recommendations. In particular, the government has not adequately addressed the bipartisan concerns of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics inquiry into the government's previous attempts at legislating these measures. A prospective undue increase in taxation and proposed retrospective measures without proper justification to raise automatic and indiscriminate liabilities to directors add pressure on investments and are not acceptable. The potential automatic increase in the liability of directors under the PAYG bill raises concerns about the preservation of natural justice and the considerable burden to business.


Before I go on, I just want to start with a very basic point. Let us get a determination on what a company director is. When you think of a company director, depending on your background, does your mind go to someone who is maybe taking a board position on one of the major banks or an influential organisation and who could be paid enormous amounts of remuneration, or does your mind go to your local mechanic or butcher, who could have a net household income of around 100 grand a year and who could have taken advice from their accountant that, because they are around that $100,000 level, it is more advantageous for them from a tax perspective as a small family business to set up a company structure as opposed to a partnership? This bill captures the mechanic. It captures the butcher. It captures the bloke in the main street. I have not heard anyone from the other side stand in this House to defend the rights of the common man and the worker. This bill is doing them over. I want you to take your mind to a place where when you hear the word company director during the debate on this bill you think of the mechanic, the bloke who has grease up his arms. Do not think of the bloke in the suit in Collins Street on a million bucks a year—or a million bucks a month in some cases. Making directors personally liable for the failure of someone else will only add more red tape to the business and will add more bureaucracy, and would most definitely cause most potential directors to run a mile in the other direction. What will happen to the future of Australian business and thus the economy?


Phoenixing is a terrible practice. We do not support phoenixing in any capacity whatsoever. For those of you that may not totally understand what phoenixing is, it is a horrible practice where a business bloke might see that he is getting into trouble and is going to go out the back door, so he transfers the assets out of his business with the distinct intention of avoiding paying super and other liabilities that his staff are entitled to. We will not have a bar of that. We will crack down on phoenixing and assist in whatever capacity we can because we do not support that. Phoenixing is corrupt and there is enough corruption going on in this nation as it is.


The previous speaker spoke about evidence the Taxation Office gave to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. I happen to sit on that committee. This bill seeks to give the Taxation Office enormous, overreaching powers. The tax office claims this will give it the capacity to stop phoenixing. But guess what? These powers reach to every single business in the nation. The evidence was there are only 6,000 cases of phoenixing. But this bill allows the Taxation Office, under the auspices of investigating phoenixing, to go into your business, to tear the place apart, find whatever other anomalies that may be happening in your business and go after it. This is just a trigger to get through the front door of your business to try and grab more cash.


One of the people who gave evidence to the economics committee was John Colvin. He is the CEO of the Australian Institute of Company Directors. He said:


The bill was conceived to target phoenix operators. The regulatory impact statement prepared in June 2011 in respect of the bill only addresses the measures the context of phoenix activity. There have been some minor amendments to that regulatory statement as we understand it; however, the premise of the bill and the way it is constructed is basically still targeting or based on phoenix activity. Even if you accept the ATO figures which have been put forward, less than half a per cent of directors may be engaged in phoenix activity and yet the bill potentially imposes liability on the whole 2.2 million. That is a very big and damaging net to catch a few fish, we would contend.


If you are serious about wanting to shut down phoenixing then why, when a business shuts down one day, do you give a tax file number to directors to open up the next day? Would it not just be easier to not give them another tax file number? Where did that idea come from, out of the blue? Do not let them start up again. Your mechanism is so big and so clumsy you do not know who they are. There are not enough rigorous checks. The ACCC has powers already that can prohibit it but they are not exercised. The Taxation Office has powers that can stop this type of practice but it is not exercising them. What does this government do? It continually says the answer is: 'More red tape, more bureaucracy! We'll fix it and we'll go and affect every other small business in the nation.' I say that is wrong because I stand on this side of the House as a small businessman who believes in less government, less interaction, less bureaucracy. Let the punter on the street, the bloke who is trying to drive the prosperity of this nation have a go.


I am not going to support anything that goes towards fraudulent activity where staff liabilities are in question, but please let common sense prevail on phoenixing. You have provisions that already exist to stop phoenixing in its tracks by not giving directors a tax file the very next day when they go to transfer. You are going to affect the lives of 2.2 million businesses, company directors and mechanics; that is the link. Do not think we are chasing the end of top end of town. This affects everyone. It is a bad bill.


This bill would impose liability to all directors, including those of charities and not-for-profit organisations. They are limited by guarantee, as many directors are. Many of these organisations are the lifeblood of the community and should not be placed under unnecessary stress and inconvenience. Overall these bills will punish taxpayers who, in good faith, abide by prevailing laws. This bill is nothing more than a blatant tax grab, an attempt to remedy Labor's erosion of the Australian fiscal position.


The bill represents a number of issues each of which has been examined at length by the House Standing Committee on Economics. The first issue I raised today was in relation to making directors personally liable for unpaid superannuation guarantee amounts to their company employees. I raised the question as to whether directors of companies may be liable for these measures if they join the board after the fact. The government cannot answer this question about if an existing board is in place. Now we are back at the top end of town, and the organisation has been going for 15 or 20 years. 


I go on and take a position on that board and, because of my diligence and my strong governance procedures, I instigate investigations to make sure that we have contingent liabilities for staff entitlements. As a result of those investigations, I find that the company that I have just joined may be negligent in that and I want to remedy it. As a result of this, I am in the tin for the 20 years of liability.


So what is my motivation then as a company director? What is the actual intent of this legislation? It is encouraging me not to say anything, because I am going to be liable for it. Why aren't we promoting good faith for directors to come out and be transparent? Who knows? One of the most important aspects that has been omitted from these bills is that phoenixing activity, and I could go on all day about that. 


According to the Australian Institute of Company Directors, there are some 11,700 companies in Australia that are limited by guarantee. We are talking about charity organisations, grower groups, and businesses that serve the Australian people. As John Colvin from the Australian Institute of Company Directors mentioned in his speech to the parliamentary estimates committee, it targets almost all of Australia's 2.2 million directors including those who volunteer their time to work with charities and community organisations. Mr Coleman also pointed out that following submissions to the parliamentary estimates committee in 2011, the committee recommended the government investigate whether it was possible to amend the bills to better target phoenix activity. Yet the government has made virtually no attempt to target phoenix activity in revising the bill. 


But it has not just been to the economics committee, it has been to a Senate committee. They raised concerns about this part of the bill, and still there is no amendment. It is just typical of Labor's attempt to burden the directors of those companies, even where there was no illegitimate activity, with undue liability. And why, I ask: because the Labor government has no interest in the successful operations of business in Australia.


These bills also look at amending the taxation of financial arrangements provisions, TOFA, to ensure that the tax treatment of financial arrangements that are part of a consolidation event is consistent with the TOFA tax-timing rules. This is both a revenue protection measure and a revenue gain over the forward estimates. These amendments are said to protect a significant amount of revenue over the forward estimates and generate a revenue gain of $253 million over that period.


The consolidation tax cost-setting arrangements and related taxation of financial arrangements are in simple terms retrospective tax changes. The government have failed to justify the retrospective aspect of this legislation. The government describe this measure as 'revenue protection', but have not quantified the amount of tax revenue which would be lost if the tax measure was not passed. That is important—a lot of this stuff is important. The government describe this measure in the bill as 'revenue protection', but have not quantified the amount of tax revenue that would be lost if the measure were opposed. So they are saying that it is not going to have any impact on budget if it goes through, but if it does not go through we are going to have to find some money. I just do not get that part of it.


Retrospective measures can expose taxpayers to penalties when taxpayers could not possibly have taken steps to mitigate the potential for penalties to be imposed. As an opposition and as a coalition, we fundamentally oppose retrospectivity. When you pay your tax bill on 30 June each year, it is fundamentally the security of your business to know that you are clear. What a horrible day it is when you wake up the next day and find that you have got an eight-year tax bill, knowing that in good faith you had paid your tax. This bill is bad for the country. It is bad for business confidence, confidence that is lacking in our market at the moment. Thank you.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (10:56):  In speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 and the package of bills before the House, let me also join with my colleagues, the shadow Treasurer, the shadow minister for finance and those others from this side of the House, who spoke in this debate in reiterating our opposition to these bills. The shadow Treasurer outlined in great detail, schedule by schedule, the deficiencies with this legislation.


In my contribution today I particularly want to focus on one aspect of the legislation that is before the House, which has received some debate this morning and that of course is the schedule that deals with the managed investment trusts withholding tax for foreign investments. The shadow Treasurer this morning outlined some of the government's history on this legislation. He also indicated that the government has tabled an amendment to delete these very schedules this day, so it appears that we are witnessing, apparently—not that the government has said anything discernible at this point—a U-turn in slow motion on this issue. Let us focus on this issue because it says so much about this government's approach to taxation.


In the budget the government announced that it would double from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent the withholding tax for foreign investments for managed investment trusts, and the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance have outlined the great damage that announcement has done already and the flawed nature of that announcement. They have also outlined in great detail how this is completely contrary to earlier actions and statements by the government.


I just said the government 'announced' this in the budget. That is being too generous to the Treasurer. In my cursory look at his budget speech just now, before beginning my contribution to this debate, I could not find any mention of it. On a closer reading maybe there is a word or two there, but I suspect not. I start from the position with this Treasurer that if there is some bad news to announce it will not be in his budget speech. He has got great history on this, of course. This is the Treasurer who refused to name the debt or deficit figures in his budget speech in 2009.


I will take the House through the history of this because it exposes so much: not only the incompetence of those opposite but their complete lack of understanding on matters of taxation. If you go back to the Treasurer's budget speech of 2008, he very clearly outlined the government's plan to cut this particular tax. He said:


Our nation has the potential to be a financial services hub in the Asia-Pacific Region—the fastest growing region in the world. To support this ambition, the Budget begins the process of significantly reducing the withholding tax—


et cetera, et cetera—


to a final rate of 7.5 per cent …


He was quite happy to make great fanfare of it in his speech. That 7½ per cent rate was to be doubled in this year's budget. There is no parallel statement, and it must flow that if the government thought the 7½ per cent rate was so necessary for what they wanted to achieve, a doubling of that rate indicates a change of policy; and if what they said was so important and so beneficial, a doubling of that rate must therefore be detrimental.


Look to the statements of some of those who have spoken in the debate—it is a wonderful thing Hansard, Madam Deputy Speaker, as you know. We have had in this House today a number of those opposite trying to defend the indefensible. My friend the shadow Treasurer was a bit harsh on the member for Blair, who speaks on all of these tax law amendment bills. My friend the shadow Treasurer rightly pointed out that he had not addressed the substance of this issue. I can tell you why: the member for Blair is a good bloke with a bad brief. What this Treasurer has asked those opposite to do is to vote to cut this particular tax to 7½ per cent and then in his budget to double it. They will be able to go around Australia saying, 'We've supported a cut and an increase in the same tax.'


I have said this before in this House and I cannot be sure that every member will know what I am talking about here, but I know the minister at the table will because he has a great understanding of Australian history and a great understanding of sporting history.




Mr Crean:
  I do know what I'm talking about.




Mr TONY SMITH:
  Many years ago when I was a mere kid, and the minister at the table was probably in his 30s, there was an Australian opening batsmen called Graeme Wood. No-one wanted to bat with him because he was famous for saying, 'Go, stop, wait, no, go back!'—and you would always end up standing next to him at one end of the pitch. You see that on tax policy with those opposite.


Let us remind them of their words. The Assistant Treasurer introduced these bills on 24 May announcing the increase in this tax rate, the doubling of it. Let us look at what he said almost four years ago to the day. On Wednesday, 18 June 2008, here is what the now Assistant Treasurer said as a backbencher in the newly minted government who were going to create a financial services hub here in Australia. Talking about the cut to 7½ per cent, he said:


That will be a very clear signal, a marker to global capital that this is the place to invest—that Australia is a country where you are able to invest and you are able to get a reasonable rate of return without being slugged with excessive levels of tax, as may be the case in other jurisdictions.


I regret to inform members opposite that the Assistant Treasurer at the time went further. In introducing the legislation, the member for Prospect and then Assistant Treasurer, now the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, had this to say, again on 18 June 2008, on why the government was cutting the rate to 7½ per cent:


Why did we do that?


Get ready for this. He said:


Because you do not create a financial services hub with tinkering.


What did they do in this year's budget if they didn't cut the rate to 7½ per cent, and they announced they're increasing it to 15, if that's not tinkering, if that's not a doubling, if that's not change? Right back then you had this new government, this new band of brothers, and they were going to cut the rate to 7½ per cent. Now they are doubling it to 15 per cent, and no mention can be found in the Treasurer's speech. I will go on and continue to quote the then Assistant Treasurer:


You do not create a major policy reform by working around the edges. We took the view that if we could give Australia the lowest withholding tax rate in the world this would be a major advance in making Australia the financial services hub of Asia. We took the view that a withholding tax rate of 7½ per cent was an appropriate way to promote Australia as a financial services hub.


Well, you do not have that view now. In the budget it was doubled. It says so much about this government that their approach on these issues creates uncertainty, leverages risk and sends out the message to international investors that this is a government that chops and changes.


Think about what the effect of that budget night announcement was on international investors. They got the message from the new government in 2008: 'Come here because we have a 7½ per cent rate'—and, as the shadow Treasurer said, they invested on that basis. If they were listening to the Treasurer's speech on budget night that would not have mattered but once they digested the detail they discovered that the rate was to be doubled. What impression about tax policy in Australia does that leave in international quarters? Let me be very blunt: it shouts out the message that the government cannot be trusted on tax. It shouts out the message of uncertainty—and uncertainty is toxic in the world environment. It says, 'Whatever this government says, you're at great risk of that tax rate being changed on you retrospectively.'


You do not have to take my word for it; you can take the word of so many commentators. That would take up a lot of time in this House but I do want to quote one because this gives a real world view to those opposite about the effect the government's conduct has created. The shadow Treasurer quite rightly quoted David Denison this morning. David Denison, president and CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board addressed it directly:


In this era of fiscal restraint and additional direct and indirect taxes, we are becoming increasingly concerned that some risks associated with ownership of infrastructure are expanding. For instance, it is easy to envision the regulatory rate setting process becoming politicized instead of objective and fair. The same could occur with taxes—in fact, Australia’s budget that was tabled last week effectively doubled the tax burden on our real estate and infrastructure holdings in that country.


If we conclude that these kinds of risks within any country become significant enough to call into question the predictability and stability of cash flows that are at the heart of the investment rationale for infrastructure, our response will be very quick and rational—we will simply stop investing there.


The shadow finance minister made the point that the member for Blair did not have a lot to say—he had got word that the amendment I mentioned earlier was being tabled. The member for Blair, who speaks on all of these bills, was elected in 2007; he sat there in 2008 and hailed the reduction to 7½ per cent. He voted for it and then on budget night discovered that the 7½ per cent rate was doubled. Those opposite understand—at least the member for Blair does—the impact of this but they have a Treasurer and an Assistant Treasurer who have no idea on these matters.




Mr Baldwin:
  Incompetence personified!




Mr TONY SMITH:
  That does damage. My friend at the table said, 'Incompetence personified'. That raises a very important point: lack of competence in Canberra creates a lack of confidence outside Canberra. (Time expired)

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (11:12):  Once again we stand in this House, less than 24 hours since I last spoke on another piece of legislation that contains retrospectivity and lacks clarity and detail. As the member for Casey has so well pointed out, it adds to the level of uncertainty in our business community about the future direction of tax policy in this country. I will go through this package of bills, the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 and related bills, one by one and have a look at the various schedules.


We fully support some of the ideas contained in this legislation. We have always supported the notion that phoenixing activity should be minimised as quickly as possible because it has lots of deleterious effects on confidence, particularly in the construction industry. I saw that firsthand on many occasions when my father worked as a ceramic tiler. Building companies would close for business on Friday and reopen as a new company on Monday; they would ring him up to work on new projects but had not paid him for the old ones that he was working on in the weeks prior.


We will start with a look at schedule 1. It refers to the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012, which makes directors personally liable for unpaid super. It means directors' penalties cannot be discharged by placing a company into administration and looks to make directors and associates liable for PAYG withholding noncompliance tax where a company has failed to pay. It seeks to expand the application of the director penalty regime and ensure that directors are held to account for their activities. What is important in this legislation is that it is not just about phoenix activities. Once again, we see a failure to clearly articulate what phoenixing activity actually is. The changes are justified in the explanatory memorandum as being part of an attempt to combat phoenix activities. This is the second attempt by the government to make these types of changes. The first attempt was made in the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 8) Bill 2011 and the associated Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2011. An inquiry into these bills by the House Standing Committee on Economics made a bipartisan finding that the provisions in the bills did not add to existing requirements but instead applied a more effective penalty regime to phoenix operators who were abusing the law to obtain an unfair competitive advantage. I do not think there is anyone in this House that would disagree with that notion to achieve that outcome.


However, the committee noted concerns from the business community and its representatives that the bills would potentially apply to a broad range of directors, whether they were engaged in phoenix activity or not. This is the crux of the matter. The committee unanimously recommended that the government should investigate whether it would be possible to tighten the provisions of the bills to better target phoenix activity. After the House economics committee tabled its report, the government withdrew the relevant provisions from those bills, including withdrawing the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill.


The House economics committee has now inquired into the provisions of the package of bills currently before the House. The coalition members of the committee have again found that the measures proposed by the government are not properly directed to or focused on phoenix activity. The coalition members found that the measures were, instead, 'broad based and not targeted' and would impose such onerous obligations that company directors would become more focused on compliance, rather than on performance and running the business.


A particular concern expressed to the committee was the liability that these provisions would apply to board members of charities and other non-profit organisations, and that this liability would act as a disincentive to undertake those roles. When we consider the time and effort that these people put into volunteering their skills and their talents to important charitable institutions in our community, this would be of grave concern. It is a point I would particularly like to emphasise, because in my electorate the not-for-profit community organisations and their volunteers are one of the key pillars of strength. I have no doubt that that would be reflected in many other electorates around Australia, if not all.


The government continues to introduce ad hoc and piecemeal measures to deal with phoenix activity. However, as I have touched on previously, the government has yet to provide a comprehensive definition of what phoenix activity is. It has continually failed to target the measures so that they apply to directors of phoenix companies without imposing onerous new obligations on directors of the vast majority of companies that continue to comply with their legal obligations.


Within the current regulations—within ASIC, within the Corporations Act and within the tax act—there are more than sufficient provisions to prevent those directors from being able to be issued with tax file numbers or re-registered as directors of new companies. As I have touched on previously in this House, it is a matter of enforcing the regulations that are already there—not seeking to impose new levels of regulation because our regulators failed to apply the laws that are already in existence.


I reiterate that the coalition is strongly opposed to fraudulent phoenix activity—and I have already given a personal example of that—and supports all appropriate measures to stamp out this practice. As I said last year in debate on the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures Bill), phoenixing is a cancer that is eating away at the foundation of trust upon which our business community and the broader community are built. It sours relationships and creates a distrust that means people can no longer rely on those they do business with. We remain concerned that the government's approach to this important public policy matter is again confused, ad hoc, piecemeal and not appropriately targeted.


Schedule 2 makes changes to the taxation of financial arrangements provisions, both as a revenue protection measure and as a revenue gain over the forward estimates. These changes apply to consolidated groups and work together with provisions of schedule 3 that have a retrospective impact. It also changes the consolidation tax cost setting arrangements—that is the retrospective component.


As I mentioned last night in the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2011, the coalition is opposed to retrospective taxation changes as a matter of principle. We are opposed to these changes for a number of reasons. Firstly, the proposed changes can change the substance of bargains struck between taxpayers who have made every effort to comply with the prevailing law at the time the agreement was entered into. They can expose taxpayers to penalties in circumstances where taxpayers could not possibly have taken steps at an earlier time to mitigate those potential penalties. Secondly, they may change the tax profile of taxpayers, which in turn can materially impact the financial viability of investment decisions and the pricing of those decisions. Thirdly, they can increase Australia's level of perceived foreign risk. I again make the point that the perception of sovereign risk these days with this government is no longer perceived or real and actual. How can taxpayers be expected to have complied with laws they did not know existed at the time they were supposedly expected to have complied with them?


Earlier today I received an email from a constituent who made the following remarks in relation to the retrospective effect of the proposed cross-border transfer pricing amendment bills debated last night. He said:


The retrospective effect of this legislation is particularly abhorrent because it goes back much longer than tax records are required to be retained.


My understanding of the bill before us today is that the retrospectivity actually goes back 10 years rather than the eight we were discussing last night. He goes on to make the point:


The whole tenor of the bill is predicated on the fact that the courts have ruled on the effect of the law as it is written and have dared not to support a 'policy' position taken by the Commissioner of Taxation. The law is now absolutely clear and the government should accept the ruling of the courts like all other citizens are required to do, or appeal if it thinks it has good grounds.


If these proposed changes were made prospective from the date of announcement, which in the case of the transfer pricing was 25 November 2011, then we would be inclined to support these measures.


Schedule 4 in the outlined bill is proposed to double the withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. We heard this morning that the government will now make changes to this schedule, and we wait with bated breath to hear what they actually are. At the end of the day, we still call on the government to scrap its ad hoc, piecemeal approach to double the tax on managed investment trusts. Our focus should be on encouraging further investment from our foreign counterparts through internationally competitive taxation arrangements so we can grow our economy more strongly.


As all of us in this House well know, we are a nation and an economy that relies on foreign capital to grow and build our economy and our wealth. The first example that springs to mind here is how destructive the world's biggest carbon tax is going to be for competition in this sense. I have spoken with an export business in my electorate that is considering shutting down operations for periods during the year, forcing staff onto annual leave or leave without pay in an effort to stay below the 25,000-tonne threshold for the carbon tax. This is in order to keep them competitive in their export markets against other countries that they compete with, such as the USA.


Getting back to the proposed changes to the managed investment trust withholding tax, as they stand, they would double the managed investment trust withholding tax for foreign investment from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. I will continue on this, despite the fact that the government is proposing changes which none of us have seen. Again, they would be retrospective in that they would apply to all income distributions made after 1 July 2012, irrespective of when the original investment decision was made. In 2008, when the government reduced the rate of withholding tax progressively from 30 per cent to 7½ per cent, the coalition did not oppose that; we actively supported it.


However, at the time, we did express concerns that the reduction was not a genuine reduction for international taxpayers because, through the operation of the double taxation agreements, any reduction in taxation paid in Australia might simply lead to higher taxes being paid in other jurisdictions. At the time, the coalition also expressed concerns that the bill had not been subject to proper scrutiny as the government had not allowed the bill to be considered by the Senate Economics Committee, that Labor's costings of the measure may have been underestimated and that the government had delivered a tax cut to foreigners but had not delivered a tax cut for Australian taxpayers.


It is the government's constant chopping and changing in relation to the withholding tax that is yet again reducing our predictability in the eyes of international investors. If passed, this legislation will undermine Australia's objective of becoming a regional financial services hub in the Asia Pacific. Attracting more foreign investment is as important as ever to achieve stronger economic growth for our future. (Time expired)

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (11:27):  I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. I rise to speak on these budget measures, which are of huge significance to the tourism industry and our ability to ensure the infrastructure pipeline. I have to say that I have never seen a government more out of touch with the tourism industry, one that has so breached trust with the tourism and one that has so failed in basic communication between ministers. I say that because on 2 May this year the government announced a tourism investment guide to market Australian tourism investment to potential foreign investors in Shanghai.


It is true that this government needs to lift their game to attract these investors. For example, they need to restore the Survey of Tourist Accommodation and a comprehensive way to deliver a complete industry-wide performance model. They need to reduce government borrowing, which competes with tourism accommodation providers when they seek finance to improve their properties. They need to set KPIs for Austrade officials around the world to find inward investment, and they need to reduce red tape that currently makes residential property development more attractive than developing tourism accommodation stock.


Despite this, I welcomed the initiative that day and I commended the minister, saying, 'It is a good first step towards improving Australia's accommodation stock.' Depending on which model we assume to be true, we will need to provide somewhere between 30,000 new beds and 70,000 new beds to reach the Tourism 2020 targets. The opposition would help the sector help itself, by properly restoring the Survey of Tourist Accommodation. Under Labor the requirement for small boutique accommodation providers to report guest numbers was scrapped. Hotels and motels offering fewer than 15 beds are not required to report on occupancy.


While this saves the ABS less than $1 million, it means Australia no longer has reliable data on occupancy and no way for bank managers to determine returns on investment sought by providers. Work has begun within the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism to restore reporting, with an online system to replace its expensive and slow phone interview based system. However, important parts of the sector have been dismayed by the lack of industry-wide consultation, by the extended delays in this project and by the government's long-term commitment to the project itself. The exclusion of small accommodation providers from the data capture represents a lost opportunity to establish complete research platforms upon which to base important tourism decisions. The government's prospectus was a totally powerful measure so long as it was part of the broader policy to deal with underinvestment. I was dismayed therefore to learn that, six days after launching its prospectus, the government doubled the tax on international hotel investors. The increase to managed investment trust withholding tax is one of the measures announced in the budget which have set the tourism industry into an absolute spin.


In this budget, the government has directly attack the tourism industry. For example (1) there is no carbon tax compensation for tourism, and this stands to destroy 6,400 jobs, mostly in regional and rural Australia and cut 10 per cent from industry profits; (2) the budget for Tourism Australia has been reduced by 6.2 per cent, which is $8 million in real terms; (3) the passenger movement charge has been increased from $47 to $55 per passenger, and a desire has been expressed to index it by the CPI; (4) $118.1 million in costs for AFP security at airports has been passed on, and these will be passed on to airlines, who will pass them on to tourists; (5) there have been 90 headcount cuts to Customs staff, so increasing tourist waiting times at airports; (6) duty-free concessions have been reduced; (7) the visa label charge will increase by $10; (8) there is a $7 million investment in SmartGates at the same time as the government is cutting $10 million from elsewhere in Customs' budget, and this will take the form of further staffing cuts; and (9) there are tax-loss carrybacks only for companies, and these are limited to two years. Australian Federation of Travel Agents CEO Jayson Westbury says:


If the Government has a budget black hole, it is not reasonable to hit the one industry that provides long term and career based jobs to everyday Australians, who already contribute significantly more than their fair share of taxes.




Mr Bradbury:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the matters to which the member is referring have no relevance to the bills that are being debated.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Grierson
):  Thank you, Minister. I have been listening to the member for Paterson, who has strayed quite a few times from the legislation before us. I would ask him to come back to the legislation.




Mr BALDWIN:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I am exactly on the legislation. Like many on this side of the chamber, I followed proceedings in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics and the questioning by the member for Wright. As that committee learned through testimony and from its publication a week ago of the report by the Allen Consulting Group, the net effect of the MIT bill will be that by 2016 there will be less money for government to spend—$172 million less, in fact—and that there will be reductions of $533 million in household consumption. In short, the tax will wipe out a large proportion of the household discretionary spending that tourism relies on for financial stability.


I am aware of a range of tourism investments threatened by the MIT bill, but I will not add to the pressure already put on developers by disclosing commercially sensitive information and citing individual cases. The Allen Consulting Group report made known to the House economics committee indicates the following: a one per cent increase in the rate of tax reduces the level of investment activity by three per cent; there will be a $1 billion decline in foreign capital results by financial year 2016; there will be a net overall reduction in federal tax revenue—that is, a substantial decline in economic activity will wipe out the entire estimated revenue rise; there will be a $172 million reduction in government spending capacity; 4,640 jobs will be lost; and there will be a reduction in household consumption of $533 million and in GDP of $580 million. The Allen Consulting Group concludes that an increase in withholding tax will be self-defeating. The Property Council of Australia and the Financial Services Council have evidence that the $1 billion decline has already occurred.


In advance of this debate many members will have been sent a copy of the Business Council of Australia's study into Australia's capital project investment pipeline called Pipeline or pipe dream? Securing Australia's investment future. As Business Council of Australia CEO Jennifer Westacott said when launching the study:


The study provides for the first time a total picture of how capital investment is driving the economy, and underlines why policy priorities for a stronger economy must help focus on the delivery of Australia's investment pipeline.


The study highlights how important the effective delivery of major projects will be to the future shape and health of the economy and living standards. The $921 billion pipeline is not assured, and we are becoming a high-cost place to invest.


The government's changes to the managed investment trust taxation, which fly in the face of the week-old Shanghai launch, are prime examples of the ways in which this government is making Australia a poor choice for investors. The BCA launched their report at the Prime Minister's Economic Forum last week. As reported in the media, the Tourism and Transport Forum opted not to attend that event—and they were wise not to do so. The last time they attended a similar event, their Deputy Chair, Ann Sherry, appeared at the future tax summit to advocate accelerated depreciation of assets to drive investment in the sector. The outcome was a budget plan scotched at the last minute to do just the opposite for aircraft. When the Prime Minister was quizzed on the TTF's nonattendance her pat response was to say Labor has been meeting with the tourism sector—and especially the cruise sector—and talking about their needs. Labor has lost all credibility with the cruise sector over two recent decisions. Firstly, where is the Prime Minister's decision to allow Carnival Corporation and P&O Cruises access to Garden Island as an overflow facility? Secondly, Labor completely disregarded Orion Expedition Cruise's very reasonable expectations, which were put to Labor through the shipping reform bills process.


Instead of attending the Prime Minister's Economic Forum, TTF CEO John Lee came to my electorate along with others, including Jayson Westbury, the CEO of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, and John Hart, CEO of Restaurant Catering Australia, to meet with our shadow Treasurer. They and the others who came to speak with the shadow Treasurer about managed investment trust withholding tax and the passenger movement charge know that the coalition will both listen to and act on their concerns. They were reassured by the shadow Treasurer's comments on the need for a stable, predictable and sensible approach to policy. They have seen him respond by arguing the case on managed investment trust withholding tax and the passenger movement charge. These are the two key concerns facing tourism and hospitality out of this year's budget.


With these bills today, the government proposes to add to the cost of hotel management where a property is owned by a managed investment trust. According to Tourism Accommodation Australia, most MIT hotel investment in Australia is from Singapore and Malaysia and feedback from these investors is not good. According to John Lee, CEO of the TTF, the new tax impost in these bills will create instability and uncertainty for specific transactions. He says:


It is bewildering that such a long-considered policy, we understand developed over 2½ to three years, would be changed overnight without consultation or regard for the potential ramifications for the hotel and investment industry.


Minister Ferguson attended the National Tourism Alliance post-budget wrap-up with me the day after the budget was handed down. During the Q&A session he would have heard Rodger Powell of the Tourism Accommodation Association refer to advice from lawyers Baker & McKenzie recommending:


… non-residents holding Australian assets through MIT structures consider whether a MIT remains the appropriate structure for their investments in light of the government's decision.


I received a letter from Mr Powell earlier this week, in which he advises:


MITs are the vehicle through with much of the investment in Australian accommodation occurs. The Government's inconsistency in doubling the tax on MITs at a time when Tourism Australia is broadening its remit by actively seeking foreign investment in the Australian tourism industry is alarming. 


You are, of course, well aware of the need for new investment in accommodation to ensure Australia is able to offer the travel experiences being demanded by our key tourist markets. The only way this can happen is by offering an attracting investment climate.


Mr Powell goes on to further advise that increasing the MIT withholding tax will:


1.Threaten existing projects and deter new investment in accommodation


2. Reduce tax revenue;


3. Damages Australia's reputation amongst foreign investors;


4. Increases Australia's reliance on foreign debt;


5. Undermines Australia's ability to serve as a regional financial hub; and


6. Scare off investors committed to long-term investments.


Of course, Labor will highlight that the rate was 30 per cent under the coalition. However, the Howard government brought down a range of taxes relevant to tourism, whilst creating Tourism Australia and lifting its funding to its highest level.


As my colleague Senator Cormann said on 29 May:


Labor's zig-zag approach to withholding tax on Managed Investment Trusts has also yet again increased Australia's sovereign risk profile.


The Gillard government has yet again managed to reduce the confidence of international investors in the stability and predictability of our taxation arrangements.


More important than the rate per se is the paramount importance that we give to hotel investor confidence in their 10-year investment plans that they will not change on a whim.


Howard had a plan to pay off Keating's $96 billion debt and provide assistance to business and individuals through easing tax pressures. Labor talks good when it comes to help meeting our Tourism 2020 targets which include boosting accommodation growth stock so that we can meet potential growth from China. As former Minister for Tourism Nick Sherry was quoted in a leading tourism industry publication Travel Weekly:


Unlike other sectors of the economy, investment in the broad tourism industry has ""not been particularly good. Tourism Research Australia says investment growth in tourism is lagging behind the rest of the economy,"" Sherry said. ""It's been a struggle to reach investment growth of 2% a year which is insufficient. The stark reality is that there has been no meaningful addition to Australia's accommodation supply for a decade or more.


Sherry was further quoted as saying:


The sad fact is that much of Australia's accommodation is outmoded and outdated and Chinese visitors in particular ... are used to very modern facilities in their own country. There is a great challenge in tourism to invest in the modernisation of facilities.


I urge the House—and particularly those members on the crossbenches to whom the tourism and hospitality industry looks for support—to consider the following facts: tourism's contribution to the Australian gross domestic product was $73.3 billion, or a 5.2 per cent share of the Australian economy. Total gross value added tourism was $69.1 billion, representing a 5.3 per cent share of the Australian economy. In Australia, tourism directly and indirectly employs 907,100 persons, representing 7.9 per cent of total Australian employment, and shrinking. Australians spent 130 million nights abroad in the year 2010. During its peak under the Howard government, Australian tourism made a profit of $3.584 billion. Next year the sector will stand to make a net loss of $8.7 billion. Since 2008, Australia has slipped from fourth to 13th place in the World Economic Forum Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index rankings.


Let us look past the nonsense of this tax. I encourage the government to back down on this, as they are doing on the CPI aspect of the passenger movement charge. They need to understand the industry. They need to work with the industry. You actually create growth and investment by reducing taxes, not increasing taxes, on individuals and companies. That is why this part of the budget is an absolute farce and the Assistant Treasurer sitting opposite should recognise these facts.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (11:41):  Firstly I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. Schedule 1 amends the tax law to better protect workers entitlements to superannuation and to strengthen the obligations of company directors to help prevent fraudulent phoenix activity. The failure to withhold tax and pay superannuation amounts impacts all aspects of the economy. These amendments aim to ensure that compliant businesses and employees are not being disadvantaged by companies that fail to meet their obligations. Those opposite will say that they oppose this bill because the director penalty regime can apply to all directors whose companies fail to meet their obligations. What they fail to recognise, and what they fail to admit, is that the existing regime has applied this way for pay-as-you-go obligations since 1993 and for the entire time that they were in government. 


It is no surprise, of course, that those opposite are willing to come into this place and to vote against a bill that seeks to protect workers' entitlements. We know that they are not interested in the superannuation of hardworking Australians. They opposed superannuation when it was first introduced and the now Leader of the Opposition is on the Hansard as having said that compulsory superannuation was the biggest con job ever foisted on the Australian people. They are strong words.




Mr Hockey:
  Why are we keeping it?




Mr BRADBURY:
  The member opposite says, 'Why are we keeping it?' Well, one may well ask why they have so vociferously opposed this government's efforts to increase the superannuation entitlements of working people. Of course, we know that they have opposed and have voted against our plans to increase superannuation to 12 per cent. This for a 30-year-old worker on an average wage, under our reforms, will mean that they will retire with an extra $100,000 of retirement savings. And it should come as no surprise to any of us that, once again, we have the opposition, the member for North Sydney and his colleagues, coming into this place opposing workers' entitlements. 


I note that there are some references in the Australian Financial Review today to a speech that was given by Liberal senator, Senator Sinodinos, who has indicated that changes to industrial relations are on the coalition's agenda.




Mr Hockey:
  They're on your agenda, too!




Mr BRADBURY:
  The member opposite who interjects and protests so loudly was the handmaiden, the one who was left carrying the baby when it came to delivering and inflicting the pain upon the Australian working community that Work Choices ultimately delivered. 


They are the party of Work Choices. They come in here and they want to vote against workers' superannuation entitlements.




Mr Baldwin:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The same minister who stood up and asked me to be relevant to the debate has now strayed so far from the debate that I ask you to bring him to the point. Or does he not understand his own bills?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Murphy
):  There is no point of order. The member for Paterson was heard in silence—




Mr Baldwin:
  That is not true.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  In the time I have been in the chair he was heard in silence. The member for Paterson will desist from interjecting and the Assistant Treasurer will be heard in silence.




Mr BRADBURY:
  The bill very specifically and very clearly goes to the protection of superannuation entitlements of working people. That is what those opposite are voting against. They are voting against protections that we want to put in place that will ensure that a regime is in place that provides some accountability with respect to the provision of superannuation entitlements. 


It is a shameful thing. I can understand why the member for Paterson does not want to accept the fact that that is what he is voting against. When he was talking about the bill he preferred to focus on other parts of the bill. But it is no surprise that the opposition come into this place and launch a further attack on the entitlements of working people.


Schedule 2 of the bill amends the taxation of financial arrangements, the TOFA regime, to ensure that the tax treatment of joining/consolidation events is consistent with the TOFA tax-timing rules and that financial assets and financial liabilities are treated symmetrically.


Schedule 3 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to modify the consolidation tax cost-setting rules. The changes are necessary to take away unexpected retrospective benefits arising from amendments to the consolidation regime that were made in 2010. There is an important point to make. Amendments were made in 2010 that provided retrospective benefits. These amendments merely recognise the fact that unanticipated and unintended benefits flowed from those amendments. It is widely recognised that it is appropriate to correct it to ensure that a more balanced outcome is achieved. 


These changes demonstrate the government's commitment to maintaining equity, fairness and integrity of our tax system. The changes implement recommendations made by the Board of Taxation for future consolidations and will ensure that companies inside consolidated groups do not receive tax benefits that companies outside consolidated groups are unable to receive. Following extensive consultation, the changes affecting a corporate acquisition will depend on the time when the acquisition took place.


The changes affecting corporate acquisitions that took place before 12 May 2010 are necessary to ensure deductions are claimed only when it was intended and to protect a significant amount of revenue that would otherwise be at risk. Changes for the period between 12 May 2010 and 30 March 2011 will largely protect taxpayers who made business decisions on the basis of the current law, before the Board of Taxation was asked to review the law. For corporate acquisitions after 30 March 2011, the changes will increase certainty for taxpayers and will implement the board's recommendation to apply a business acquisition approach in certain cases.


Those opposite talk about these changes to the consolidation regime, going back to the start of the regime in 2002. They say that they will oppose this bill, because taxpayers were right to act based on the law at that time. This reveals their complete ignorance about what these changes are actually doing. What they fail to understand is that under the law at the time, between 2002 and 2010, taxpayers could not claim immediate deductions for what were essentially capital items, such as goodwill. The 2010 amendments changed this position. What we are now doing is taking away the unanticipated and unintended windfall gains arising from those changes. In fact, this bill confirms that consolidated groups will still be able to claim more deductions for those years between 2002 and 2010 than they would have been able to under the law as it stood when the coalition were last in government.


Schedule 3 to this bill removes unintended windfalls from the 2010 changes that would provide consolidated groups with inappropriate tax benefits, benefits that are not available to companies and small businesses outside the consolidation regime.


Taxpayers who did act on the law at the time, between 2010 and March 2011, are largely protected. Taxpayers who have written advice from the tax office or who have already finalised their tax returns are also protected. We are acting appropriately to protect the integrity and fairness of the tax system and to remove these unintended windfall gains.


It is true that we need to backdate these changes to the start of their respective regimes. The government never takes lightly the decision to make retrospective changes but there are circumstances where retrospective legislation is justified. The Board of Taxation said that the 2010 changes went much further than was intended and the Australian parliament rightly considers each proposal for retrospective legislation on its merits. Like this case, this is generally only done where the law is operating in a manner inconsistent with the parliament's intention and where there is a significant risk of revenue loss. The revenue at risk here from these unintended windfalls is definitely significant. This bill protects over $6 billion of revenue at risk. To demonstrate the lack of credibility of the opposition on this question of retrospectivity: they seek to come into this place and, whiter than the snow, suggest that they have never supported, and they never will support, retrospective legislation, particularly in the tax context. Do not have a look at what they say; have a look at what they did when they were in government. They introduced numerous measures, many of which were backdated by up to several years, in order to go back and ensure that the original intent of a policy was actually delivered, and there were numerous examples. This particular bill also seeks to protect the rights of working people, which they are seeking to oppose. In the very same week when these matters are being debated, when they come in and say that they never support retrospective legislation, when they have done that in the past, their New South Wales Liberal colleagues are supporting retrospectively ripping away the entitlements of workers with changes to the workers compensation scheme in New South Wales. So retrospectivity is something that they say they oppose, but when they were last in government they embraced it, where it was appropriate or where they deemed it to be appropriate, and in New South Wales this week we see them retrospectively ripping away the rights of working people. Do not listen to what they say; look at what they do.


I will also be moving an amendment to remove schedule 4 to the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012, which will be introduced into parliament at a later date. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (12:03):  This is the third roll-back on the budget and we are six weeks in. It has been six weeks since the budget was delivered and this is the third change to a budget that has not even started. Aren't you embarrassed? You cannot hold a budget for six weeks! Company tax cuts back on the agenda, dumping the CPI increase on the passenger movement charge and now you are dumping your own tax increase on interest withholding tax. What sort of rabble are you guys? We used to joke that the Labor Party could not hold a policy from Lateline to lunchtime. Now you cannot hold a budget for six weeks. How embarrassing! Where is Swannie? Here he is! How do you feel about that? So much for the surplus.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for North Sydney will refer to individuals by their appropriate title.




Mr HOCKEY:
  So much for the surplus that was promised. The member for Lindsay wrote to his constituents in a recent newsletter. He said: 'Guess what? We've delivered a surplus!' He said to his constituents—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney needs to talk to the amendment.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am talking to the amendment, Madam Deputy Speaker. The Labor Party is dumping and trashing its own budget and now, without any explanation whatsoever, the Labor Party amends a bill it introduces from the budget. They roll back before they get a chance to roll forward. The Labor Party reduced interest withholding tax from 30 per cent to 7½ per cent and they are so committed to getting back to surplus they said, 'We're going to have to increase interest withholding tax to 15 per cent. But wait, there's more. We're going to pull it back. We're not going to tell you what we're gonna do.'


This is the confusion. This is the indecision. This is the incompetence that has writ large of Labor in government. This is what the Labor Party is about: absolute total taxation incompetence and absolute total policy incompetence, whether it be the carbon tax or the mining tax or employee share schemes or the alcopops tax or company tax cuts, which the government was so determined to deliver that it dumped them when it came to the budget. But wait. The Prime Minister, in a moment of great revelation to the business community, came down from the top of the mountain and said: 'Our top priority is company tax cuts.' But then the Passenger Movement Charge, and today they are dumping the interest withholding tax changes.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney needs to come back to the amendment.




Mr HOCKEY:
  This is the amendment, Madam Deputy Speaker, in case you are not familiar with it.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The previous two were not; the previous discussion was.




Mr HOCKEY:
  It is the Labor Party dumping a key budget commitment to increase the tax on managed investment trusts, and today they are dumping it. The Assistant Treasurer has not even got the guts to explain why. So come on: the Assistant Treasurer should get up here now and explain why the Labor Party is dumping its own budget promise.


Why is the Labor Party doing this? I thought this was your budget. The Treasurer stood up here six weeks ago and said this was a key component, and now the government is dumping and trashing its own budget. It is okay to dump a Labor leader, but your budget—come on, guys, what is this?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney is now straying.




Mr HOCKEY:
  But I am straying to the right place, Madam Deputy Speaker. The budget has not lasted six weeks and already there are three amendments. The Treasurer said solemnly at budget time that 'if there is anything that is going to affect our $1.5 billion surplus, you know what, we're going to increase taxes'. So far they have had three measures that have affected their $1.5 billion promised surplus. This is why you cannot trust Labor. This is why Australians believe the government is incompetent. Don't blame us for the negativity out there: it is all at the hands of the Labor Party. Now Assistant Treasurer, get up here and answer: why are you dumping your own budget today?



Mr Pyne interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Sturt is warned. It is not even question time. The question is that the amendments be agreed to.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I will keep talking until I get an answer: why is the government dumping this measure from the bill? Why is the government doing it? Is this policy on the run again? The Assistant Treasurer and the Treasurer owe an explanation to the parliament and the Australian people: why is this major budget measure being dumped from the bill today; why is it being dumped from the budget? Answer the question.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The question is that the amendments be agreed to.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I ask again—don't be mute; answer the question: why is the government dumping its own budget measure today? Why—for what reason? Answer the question. Have the courage of your convictions. Have some guts. Answer it now.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. He is now abusing the process of consideration in detail. This is consideration in detail; it is not question time. There is no automatic right under the standing orders in consideration in detail for anyone to answer a question. The question is that the amendments be agreed to.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (12:10):  This amendment goes to the fact that this government has now compiled a litany of sovereign risk issues and this is another classic symbol to investors both in Australia and overseas that this is no longer a safe place, a stable place or an effective place in which they can trust investment dollars. There is a great onus on the Assistant Treasurer and the Treasurer to come to this dispatch box and explain why they would trash further our reputation as a safe and stable destiny for investment in this country.


This is a government that has introduced a carbon tax against an iron cast commitment. They have introduced a mining tax with a level of incompetence that is incomprehensible plus it is something that does not exist anywhere else in the world. They have handled the live cattle job in a way which has added to sovereign risk. They have introduced retrospective taxation in this very bill, more retrospective taxation. In doing so, they have again added to the litany of sovereign risk issues in this country.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! The member for Goldstein has the call. Could people who are having conversations around the room, please go outside. This is the parliament and the member for Goldstein has the right to be heard in silence.




Mr ROBB:
  Thanks, Madam Deputy Speaker. I suspect the conversation reflects the attitude that is now prevailing across the community. No-one can take anything that this government is doing seriously. People have made up their minds. There is a level of crisis of confidence, and no-one is prepared to engage. Even their own backbench, their own frontbench, have not got the commitment to engage in these sorts of substantive issues. Even the Assistant Treasurer has spent most of his time jaw-boning—probably about football or something else.


These issues are not taken seriously, yet they have caused an amazing crisis of confidence in this country. It is absolutely critical that a decision such as the doubling of the withholding tax on investment funds—a decision that some four years ago received great commendation from both us and investors around the world—now without any explanation, they increased it. Now without one scintilla of explanation, they are going to dump it. What other deals are going on behind the scenes? What more responsibility can you have than to explain the actions that you have taken?


You have dumped measures in this budget. If you put it together with yesterday's decision on the indexation of the departure tax, we are now talking a $400 million hole in the budget. What was the surplus? $1.5 billion. What have they now in the space of 12 hours sacrificed? $400 million. Could you explain, Assistant Treasurer, where you are going to get that $400 million to deliver the $1.5 billion surplus?


Nearly one-third of the surplus has gone as a consequence of two decisions taken in less than 24 hours. More than one-third of the surplus is gone. What a joke! And now on the front page of the Financial Review the Reserve Bank is saying that the surplus is not worth the paper it is written on, that the whole thing is a series of money shuffles. What has everyone been saying? Exactly that. And now we have the Reserve Bank saying that not only was this budget never an accurate account; this government is even making that case worse; $400 million has gone out of their budget literally in the last 12 hours. Now we have, on top of that, an addition to the great sovereign risk that this government has created, with endless decisions, and this final one, this one of dumping the 7½ per cent and increasing to 15 per cent the withholding tax.


We need an answer to this. The Assistant Treasurer cannot just sit there with a bland look on his face. Come to this dispatch box and tell us why. Give us one reason why you would dump this, why you would create a black hole in your budget surplus?

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (12:15):  The government is not abandoning or dumping anything. The government remains committed to the managed investment trust withholding tax arrangements that were outlined and proposed in the budget. We will be separately reintroducing those measures as part of a separate bill. In relation to the matters that are being raised—




Mr Robb:
  At 15 per cent?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Goldstein has had his opportunity.




Mr BRADBURY:
  The member opposite says 'at 15 per cent'. He should remember that when they were on the government benches, the rate was 30 per cent; not 15 per cent, not 7½ per cent, but 30 per cent. They came into this place—I remember the debate well—the member for Casey came in here and started quoting some of my comments. I remember it well. I said that we need to make sure that we have a competitive rate, and we will have a competitive rate. Once these amendments are passed—and I am confident that they will be passed by the parliament—then we will have a competitive rate.


At 15 per cent we will be competitive. It is exactly the same rate as Japan and the United States; and the UK is 20 per cent. But, most importantly, our rate will be very competitive with the rate that existed when they were last in government—30 per cent. It will be much better than that. So, on the question of the competitiveness of the rate, we are confident that there will not be any difficulties.


The member for North Sydney in his haste—amid all the hyperbole that we often get, the huff and puff and the bluster that we get from him in this place—started talking about interest withholding. That demonstrates that he either does not get it, he does not realise that we are talking about withholding tax rates in respect of distributions from managed investment trusts—distributions, not interest—or he has not read the bill. I am not sure which of the two it is. People can go back and have a look at the Hansard if they like and have a look at some of the comments that he made there, which betrayed a fundamental lack of understanding about the key measure. He does not know the difference between interest and a distribution from a managed investment trust. He wants to hold himself out as the alternative Treasurer, but he cannot get a fundamental issue like that right. It is no wonder he has a $70 billion black hole.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (12:18):  At last the admiral speaks—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Casey will withdraw and refer to members appropriately.




Mr TONY SMITH:
  I withdraw. It took the Assistant Treasurer four occasions, in a government dealing with a tax bill, to answer a question on an amendment that he moved. The shadow Treasurer asked him on three occasions to justify why this amendment has been moved. The shadow minister for finance had to ask him. But the default position of this Assistant Treasurer is to sit there at the dispatch box in this parliament and say nothing. That speaks volumes about the Assistant Treasurer's incompetence and the incompetence of this government on tax policy generally.


The government made a great fanfare four years ago of the fact that they had cut this tax rate to 7½ per cent. They were like a band of brothers, they were better than anyone else, and the reason they did that was they wanted to send a signal to the international community that Australia would be a financial services hub and this is where they wanted people to invest.


They also made the point that they needed to take that step to show that we were different. They made the point that you could not tinker around or muck around with this. As the shadow minister for finance rightly pointed out—and nothing illustrates it more than their conduct and their actions on this issue—the signal this government has sent time after time on tax policy is uncertainty. They have sent uncertainty right around the globe. Even when they change their minds, they cannot explain it.


The Assistant Treasurer sits at that dispatch box with the shadow Treasurer asking him for a simple explanation of why they have moved an amendment to delete an entire schedule from their bill, an entire schedule that was a major budget announcement just six weeks ago. And the Assistant Treasurer in this government says nothing for three occasions. That was his default position; like a battery operated kid's toy run out of batteries. Maybe the parliamentary secretary at the table changed the batteries. Sitting there with a glum look on his face. There might be an explanation. Let's give him a break. Perhaps the shadow finance minister has been too hard on him. Perhaps he does not know why the amendment has been moved in his name.


The one thing this Assistant Treasurer can do is go around Australia on this issue and he can say, 'Whatever your position is, I have adopted it at some point in time.' He came into this House four years ago, and proudly advocated the 7½ per cent and said why that was important and he introduced the legislation to double it.


As I said earlier in the debate, this is an important part of the government's budget, as the shadow finance minister pointed out. I do not think you will find it in the Treasurer's budget speech, though. That is the best indication of any significant measure the government is moving that they think might be unpopular; just like the time the Treasurer forgot to mention the debt and deficit. It was only when the shadow finance minister spoke after the shadow Treasurer had spoken three times that the Assistant Treasurer was prompted to get up in the debate—not to tell us, but to tell the public and the parliament. Here in the House of Representatives we have an Assistant Treasurer who will not explain and will not talk. I will tell you why: it is because he is not sure that it will not change again. And he meekly says that they will be introducing separate legislation. Finally, when pushed, he talked about 15 per cent being competitive. I would like him to confirm that the separate legislation will be 15 per cent. I think the international community would like to know from the Assistant Treasurer what today's policy position is.


As the shadow minister pointed out, uncertainty is toxic in the international community. The Assistant Treasurer will not take the word of the shadow finance minister—I know that—but he ought to take the word of international investors: people like David Denison, the President and CEO of the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board. Mr Denison said:


... in fact, Australia’s budget that was tabled last week effectively doubled the tax burden on our real estate and infrastructure holdings in that country.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (12:23):  I am pleased to rise in the consideration in detail stage of this bill to seek some further clarification from the Assistant Treasurer as to precisely what the government is doing here. As all in this House would be aware, at this stage of the process the opportunity is presented for ministers at the table to explain to the chamber the details of the merits of the particular amendments that are being moved by the government.


It tends to raise eyebrows when the government is moving amendments to its own legislation at this late stage. It tends to suggest that it is a government that is making things up on the run. It tends to suggest that it is a government that is not certain that it is able to deliver what it is seeking to deliver, because of the need to engage in constant negotiation with the Independents.


Unfortunately, what goes on in this chamber has enormous implications for the economy of Australia, for the financial services sector of Australia and for international investors who are considering investing in our country. It is an uncontentious proposition—it is shared by all here in the chamber—that the rate of withholding tax is a question of the highest importance in determining the incentives for foreign investors to invest in Australia. That was the basis on which the government announced changes to its policy some years ago. That has been the basis on which questions have been raised about the policy change announced with not very much fanfare during the budget recently.


We now find ourselves, here in the House of Representatives—the people's house—weighing up, as we are charged to do, the merits of legislation put before the House by the government, particularly the merits of a specific amendment put before the House now by the government. We find ourselves charged with assessing the merits of a particular amendment, when it is very difficult to understand the full intent of what is proposed.


Let us remind ourselves that the government in its budget announced that there would be a change in the withholding tax for these kinds of vehicles—managed investment trusts—which are, as we all know, of the first importance as a vehicle for foreign investment into Australia. The Treasurer announced on budget night that this withholding tax would increase from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. As we all know, that was consistent with a budgetary strategy of seeking to return the budget to surplus.


That is an aspiration with which we can all agree, even if, on this side of the House, we entertain very serious doubts as to the government's capacity to deliver on that stated aspiration. We now find that an element of the strategy laid out by the Treasurer only a few weeks ago which was going to be used by the government to achieve its stated objective of a surplus of approximately $1.5 billion is, by virtue of the amendment put before the House this afternoon by the Assistant Treasurer, going to be removed. That is to say, the measure which the Treasurer announced only a few weeks ago, under which the withholding tax rate will increase with a view to securing additional revenue for the Commonwealth, is now to be removed. Yet we have no clear explanation as to why that is happening. We have no clear explanation as to what the implications are for the budget and the achievement of that promised $1.5 billion surplus. We have no clear indication as to whether the government is now abandoning its policy of increasing the withholding tax rate and we have no clear demonstration of a government calmly and consistently implementing a strategy.


On the contrary, we have all the indicators of a government making it up in a panicked rush as it goes along, apparently impervious to the disastrous implications that that has for confidence in the Australian economy on the part of foreign investors. So I repeat the question to the Assistant Treasurer which has been put by colleagues on this side of the House: what on earth is going on here? Please give us an explanation.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (12:28):  I rise in this consideration in detail debate in absolute amazement as to why we cannot get a simple answer out of the Assistant Treasurer. I, too, ask the question: why? I think the whole principle of this comes back to trust. Managed investment trusts make a conscious decision to come into our country to invest. As a nation we are net importers of capital. We are net importers of funds. They have been a fundamental building block in creating the quality of life that we have.


In the Standing Committee on Economics hearings we took evidence from Martin Cordina of the Financial Services Council. This may help in understanding why the government has chosen to offer the amendment today. In response to a question at the hearing, Mr Cordina said:


We were disappointed that we were not consulted prior to the announcement being made on budget night.


This bloke is from the Financial Services Council. Whenever I have the opportunity to take evidence from the Taxation Office or from Treasury, their words are always: 'We have consulted extensively with the market. We have consulted with industry.' Guess what—industry did not have a clue that this was coming. Mr Codina went on to say:


Since this government came into office in 2007, we have issued something like 10 media releases which were supportive of subsequent changes that have been made, either to our tax system or regulatory-wise, that essentially had their origins in the Johnson review. We were one of the leading participants in the Johnson review, involved in much of the work that was conducted there. So I guess all I can say is … in this area, that the announcement was made without any prior consultation.


So here you have it—Martin Codina from the Financial Services Council saying that they were not aware that we were going to see, overnight, a doubling of the rate, from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent.


We are asking the Assistant Treasurer why. When you listen to the rest of the evidence provided by Mr Codina, it becomes crystal clear. He was asked:



Is there any evidence for that flight of capital occurring?



That was asked by a member of the government, and he was inquiring whether or not, if there were an increase from 7½ to 15 per cent, there would be a flight of capital out of this country. Mr Codina replied:


There is absolutely evidence of that. Collectively we have quantified in excess of $1 billion, some of which has been made public and some of which is highly sensitive, because of the nature of the foreign investors. In some cases you have sovereign funds—in other words, it would be akin to a foreign government being critical of the Australian government as a consequence of the change.


When you look at the wafer-thin budget surplus that has been forecast and when the Financial Services Council of Australia—a body not to be dismissed or taken lightly—have identified in good faith a potential flight of $1 billion of capital out of this country, it is no wonder these guys are now standing up and saying, a couple of weeks after the budget, 'We got it wrong,' and that we are now having to make amendments.


All we need is for the Assistant Treasurer to stand up and answer our question as to why, because it does come back to trust. Foreign investment in this country is raised on the back of us providing good government. What happens in this room fundamentally underpins the confidence of foreign investment markets in our nation—it is what happens in this room, the way we carry ourselves, our integrity. Business confidence is at an all-time low. Do not take my word for it; have a look at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry-Westpac survey for the last 17 consecutive quarters. The biggest inhibitors of investment in business at the moment are government taxes and red tape. We in this room need to get it right. The shadow Treasurer needs to get to his feet and explain the backflip made a couple of weeks after the budget, because we have to gain the trust of other nations—they have to know they can depend on us—if we want investment in this nation.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (12:33):  Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you. I appreciate you recognising me in this debate.



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr BRIGGS:
  Sorry, Parliamentary Secretary, I was just being polite.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Thank you, Member for Mayo.




Mr BRIGGS:
  The Deputy Speaker is doing a terrific job in current circumstances and I think being polite to someone doing their job in these circumstances as well as she is doing deserves that. I congratulate her for it. Deputy Speaker, while your circumstances, acting in this position, are unique, this is also a unique event in the history of this House—a budget unravelling before our eyes, a budget which was only delivered some six weeks ago, in the current parliamentary session. The normal procedure of bills following the budget to implement the measures announced on budget night by the Treasurer is unravelling, without explanation.


I think it is extraordinary of the Assistant Treasurer, who is not known for not wanting to talk and explain the government's views or his own views on things like immigration policy up near Darwin. In fact, he is such a detailed researcher that he looks in great detail into issues which affect his constituency. We know during the last election he took the trouble to travel all the way to Darwin to see about the situation in relation to—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Mayo will return to the amendment.




Mr BRIGGS:
  That said, I am utterly surprised that on this occasion—




Mr Bradbury:
  How did that FOI request go?




Mr BRIGGS:
  We are still working through it, David. On this occasion we are utterly surprised that he has decided not to explain to the House why the government's budget is unravelling in front of us. Why is it? The most important statement that a Treasurer can make, arguably—in effect, Australia's own version of the state of the union speech—made just six weeks ago, is now falling apart before us, without explanation. We know there are lots of discussions going on privately within the government. We just saw that in the chamber during the division—lots of small chats and quiet discussions working out what to do next. Obviously this is happening with their budget as well.


On budget night, the Treasurer announced a plan to deliver a surplus. He did not deliver a surplus. He delivered a plan to deliver a surplus—unlike the misleading information being sent to some constituents around the country, which I find very concerning, that they have delivered a surplus. Of course, the Australian Labor Party has not delivered a surplus for 20 years, so the member for Lindsay in his capacity as the local member is telling his electorate that is of course wrong. And now we have this bill, this backdown, without explanation—




Mr Bradbury:
  It's a fantastic piece of material—you ought to have a look at it.




Mr BRIGGS:
  I will get a copy and have a look at it, and I will give it good consideration from my own material, because we on our side know what it is like to deliver a surplus. Nine out of 11 budgets under the Howard-Costello government were surplus budgets. That is why we left you money in the bank, Assistant Treasurer Bradbury.


Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, you were here when Peter Costello was Treasurer. You remember those days very fondly, I know. You would remember that Peter Costello, when he announced a budget, followed through with the budget. He put the bills into the parliament, followed them through and had them delivered in the face of unrelenting opposition from the Labor Party, which opposed every decent measure. He delivered the budget. He did not come into this place, or send his Assistant Treasurer into this place, to unwind budget revenue measures without explanation. Why is it that this measure, which was announced on budget night, is being unwound without explanation? This is a very important question because it gets to confidence in the budget and to the ability of the government to deliver its surplus. Will the government have enough money to deliver its surplus? Will foreign investors know what the withholding rate will be when they invest in our country? We need this investment to help develop our great country even further. These are important questions.


The Assistant Treasurer—soon to be shadow Assistant Treasurer—has announced that there will be another piece of legislation. What will be in that legislation? Answer us that question. Will the revenue be the same? Give us an explanation—that is all we ask. (Time expired)

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2012-06-20,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (12:38):  May I commend you, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, on the very fine job you are doing in the chair since your ascension to this high office. I look at these amendments to the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 with some amazement. On page 65, lines 1 to 21 were written and printed only weeks ago. The ink is barely dry on this document and we have an amendment to the government's own budget. The ink is barely dry on the legislation and the government is amending it. What does that say to the Australian people? It says that we have a government that lacks the competency to implement the budget that it handed down just back in May.


One of the really interesting things about that budget night was looking around the galleries when the Treasurer was delivering the budget. What did we see? We saw galleries that were half empty for the Treasurer's speech. I have never seen that before. I have never seen a Treasurer deliver a budget where he could not even fill the galleries. I think that is because the Australian people have no confidence in this Treasurer. They have no confidence in this government. The fact that this amendment is being put before this House to effectively rescind a proposal within the government's own budget—delivered only six weeks ago—shows the lack of competence in this government. It shows the lack of ability of this government to maintain a policy position. It shows the lack of ability of this government to follow through and provide the sort of certainty that the Australian people need.


These amendments are a worry not only because they rescind a measure announced in the budget but also because they reflect the wider competence of this government, and that is why consumer confidence is so low. That is why business confidence is so low. The Australian people lack confidence in this government. It is quite astounding.


We have had the promise: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' and no sooner did the Prime Minister get into office than—what do you know?—the government changed its mind. In this case, we have a proposal to change the withholding tax contained within the budget and only weeks later the government has changed its mind. How can business plan for the future when we have a government that cannot maintain a position for more than a few weeks? Australian business needs to make long-term decisions based on sound policy and we have a government that is doing backflip after backflip on its own budget document. That is hardly inspiring the sort of confidence that Australian business needs to make the investments that are going to drive future jobs and employment within this country.


No wonder small business is doing it tough. No wonder the customers are not coming through the door. They are concerned about the competence of this government. They are concerned about the fact that they cannot rely on the word of this government, the Prime Minister or the Assistant Treasurer. I think the Assistant Treasurer will go down as Nostradamus: being able to forecast and claim a budget surplus when he has not delivered it. He is, indeed, showing up Nostradamus, because we will not know whether this government has delivered a budget surplus. It has so far delivered the four biggest deficits in this nation's history. Now we have the Assistant Treasurer already claiming a surplus, but we are not going to know whether that surplus is delivered until September next year. I do not know that the electors of Lindsay will accept this rather Nostradamus-like prediction that this government is going to deliver a surplus. We see the sorts of measures contained in this amendment eroding the very surplus that this government is claiming to be able to deliver over the next financial year when the Australian people have no faith in that at all. They do not have confidence in this government. They do not have confidence in the ability of this government to maintain a policy position. They are certainly showing that they are concerned about this economy through poor consumer confidence and poor business confidence, and this government is at fault on all counts.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (12:43):  On the Australian political landscape there is one big set piece speech given every year and that is when the government brings down its budget. The budget is the most important document that any government brings down. It outlines the government's priorities and where expenditure is going to be. It really is a blueprint for how the government is going to govern in the following year. Indeed, it is a blueprint for how the government is going to govern in the following few years after that as well. It is a vitally important document.


If I cast my mind back to the budgets for which I have been in this parliament, the idea of Prime Minister Howard or Treasurer Costello bringing down a budget which they would subsequently amend would be completely and utterly unthinkable. Unfortunately, the unthinkable has become the norm under this incompetent Labor government. We are debating a bill here today and, astonishingly, the next bill we are debating is going to show the government moving to amend its own budget document within 1½ months of that document being brought down. I think a government that cannot bring down a budget—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  I remind the member for Stirling that this is consideration in detail on the amendment before the chair. I have allowed a very wide-ranging debate, but we do need to get back to what is before the chair, which is the amendment we are now debating.




Mr KEENAN:
  I appreciate that, and I am dealing with the withholding tax on managed investment trusts. I am concerned about the fact that we have a government that is unable to produce a document for the Australian people which is supposed to outline its priorities, which is supposed to outline where the expenditure is for the coming year and for the forward estimates period, which is supposed to provide some certainty for both domestic investors and international investors. When a government cannot do that, you really have to wonder whether it has forfeited the right to continue to govern.


I think that this bill and other debates that we will be having in this parliament later on today are a great indicator for the Australian people that minority government is a failed experiment.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Stirling is now straying considerably from the amendment before the chair. I have allowed a wide-ranging debate, but this is an amendment and the bill cannot be canvassed again, nor can whole ranges of things. It is a very defined piece of legislation we are looking at.




Mr KEENAN:
  I am looking at the amendment, but I am doing so within the broader context of the government.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You actually cannot. That is my ruling.




Mr KEENAN:
  I will restrict my remarks specifically to the amendment as per your instructions.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the member for Stirling for his candour.




Mr KEENAN:
  I do believe it is important to establish the context in which we are having this debate today. What is very important is that a government can set a course and stick to it. It is important that they can provide certainty for investors in Australia. What business needs when it comes to making investment decisions, the time frames of which can sometimes be years or even decades out, is knowledge that when a government gives its undertakings about what is going to happen, those undertakings will actually be delivered. When you have a government that cannot even deliver a budget document six weeks after it has been brought down, clearly that investment climate is being sabotaged.


Sovereign risk is a very important issue. It is not one which investors in Australia traditionally would need to be concerned about. Something that we as a country have been able to go out and sell as one of the vital parts of the investment climate in Australia is the fact that, when you invest in Australia, you are not subject to the types of sovereign risk that you would be subject to if you were investing in other parts of the world. That reputation for stability is being trashed by this government. It is being trashed by the fact that they cannot hold onto a budget document for even six weeks after it has been brought down. It has been trashed by the fact that the Assistant Treasurer cannot even today give some certainty to investors about what is going to happen going forward with this particular measure. It has been trashed by the other measures that the government has taken to destroy the investment climate in Australia. You wonder why consumer confidence is low in Australia. You wonder why people who have the money are not prepared to invest it. This amendment we are discussing here today is a great example of why.


This government cannot even bring down a budget and hold on to it for six weeks. This is the greatest indication that minority government has failed, and the only way to address that is via an election.

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (12:48):  As the previous speakers have touched on, once again we see the government succeeding in adding to the uncertainty in the business community rather than adding to certainty. As I touched on in my earlier speech, one of the key things that has allowed us to grow our economy well over the past 20 or 25 years is some certainty and understanding about the direction of tax policy. Again we see a schedule or bill put up to double the tax rate on managed investment trusts and all of a sudden have it pulled. As numerous speakers have asked, where is the explanation from the Assistant Treasurer? Why can the government not explain the rationale?




Mr Bradbury:
  Weren't you in the chamber when I spoke? Did you listen?




Mr VAN MANEN:
  It was no explanation.



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Forde has the call and will speak to the amendment before the chair.




Mr VAN MANEN:
  This removal of this schedule and the inability for this government to stick to its plans is adding continually to the uncertainty in the business community and the international community that is looking to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in this country over the coming years in the mining industry and in a number of other areas.




Mr Lyons:
  You told us the mining industry was going to die! They went out and bought shares!




Mr VAN MANEN:
  I did not say the mining industry was going to—




Mr Lyons:
  Yes you did.




Mr VAN MANEN:
  How many shares have you guys bought in the clean energy companies? None. That is how confident you are about the clean energy market. The hypocrites sit over there. But let me get back to this.



It is another backflip of this government and the trashing of the budget. We see $400 million being removed from the surplus that we are supposed to see in September 2013, yet there is no explanation of how that is going to be made up and what the rationale is for pulling it out of this bill and seeking to maybe reintroduce it at some point in time. There is no certainty about when it is going to be reintroduced or what tax rate it is going to be reintroduced at. It is just another of the myriad examples of the inability of this government to create certainty and a clear direction for the future of this country and the future of our economy. In addition, we have seen the retrospective nature of a number of things proposed in bills last night and again today. It is just a sad indictment of the failure of this government to engender any confidence in our economy for the future.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2012-06-20,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (12:52):  I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak again on this amendment, because it does raise an area of concern for me with the issue of certainty. It is a matter that I have raised previously, in an earlier contribution, but one that cannot be reinforced too much, because when you look at markets they are adversely affected by a lack of confidence. This amendment before the House today can only reduce the confidence that exists in our financial markets and the confidence with which foreign investors will view this country. Heaven forbid! We have a situation where Australian consumers have virtually given up hope and Australian business is losing hope, and now we want to encourage overseas investors in Australia to lose hope as well. That is a very worrying trend—all because this government cannot maintain a policy position from budget day to the present. The ink was barely dry on this document, and they are already making amendments. It shows a lack of competence. It goes to the very heart of the problems that have beset this government since it was first elected. When the Australian people have lost faith and international investors are losing faith, what does that leave us with? It leaves us with a very poor outcome for the people of Australia.


This government is charged with the responsibility of governing wisely for all Australians. What we have is a government that governs incompetently on its own behalf. It is governing for the Australian Labor Party rather than for the people of Australia. It is incompetent in the extreme. It cannot manage its own budgetary process, as we see now. Not only does it run up massive deficits; it cannot even manage the budgetary process, let alone the finances of Australia. We have seen you cannot manage the finances of Australia, and now we find you cannot even manage the budget process. That is, I think, a new low point in public administration, even by this government's already low standards.


But we do have some optimism. We have the member for Lindsay, the Assistant Treasurer, doing his Nostradamus impression and claiming a surplus 13, 14 or 15 months before we are going to know what the outcome is. That is a very brave and very courageous minister—to claim a surplus now, Nostradamus, when you do not have one shred of proof or evidence based on your past performance that you are actually going to deliver a surplus. So we have the Australian people and Australian business in a state of dismay at the performance of this government, we now have overseas investors disillusioned as a result of the performance of this government, and they still try to claim somehow that they can maintain some shred of credibility in the economic community or the international community. I think that that is pure delusion.


We have a government that has failed the test. It has failed the test in relation to delivering a balanced budget over the time that this government has been in power. It has failed the test with regard to the degree of competency that is required in the budget process. It has failed the test with regard to the need for consistency of policy announcement and policy implementation. This is a government that has failed spectacularly. It is a government that continues to fail, and it is of great concern to the Australian people. That is why this amendment is so significant. It goes to the very heart of the lack of confidence in this government and this minister, who is boldly predicting a surplus that he has little prospect of delivering.




Mr Keenan:
  At least he's optimistic.




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  Yes, at least he is optimistic—thank you, Shadow Minister. He is at least optimistic. That is more than can be said for the Australian people and Australian business, who have lost faith in this government. I know that as time goes on the continued failings of this government, unfortunately, are only going to grow and grow and grow. The people of Australia will have their chance to decide on their level of competence at the next election.

Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  No, the government simply moved an amendment to its own bill. He has not explained, after all the encouragement we have given him. We want to encourage you, old sunshine! We want him to get up there and tell the truth. Let the sun shine in—that is what we say. Let there be a transparent hung parliament. Let the Independents—like the member for Lyne, the member for New England and the member for Denison—come in and help the sun to shine, because now the government is amending its own bill and it will not tell us why. Oh, dear. Do you know why? He does not know why. He does not know why they are amending their own bill. Given that we have had five assistant treasurers in 4½ years, you would think that by the time they get to the fifth they would get it right. But no. We have him coming to this place. Old Swannie has wheeled him out. He said, 'You go out and do it, Admiral. You tell them that we're pulling this out of the bill.' The old admiral, taking instructions from the 'chief of defence', says, 'Righto, sir. I'll do it.'

  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the member for North Sydney referred to the Assistant Treasurer as something other than his proper title, and I ask him to withdraw.

  I know this is quite humorous, but he still must refer to the Assistant Treasurer by his correct title and he did not that time.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the member for Bass and I do remind the member for North Sydney of that provision.

  From our perspective obviously we welcome the government dumping this initiative but we are not sure they are dumping it, because they have flagged now they are going to reintroduce it.




Mr Bradbury:
  We are not dumping it.

  The minister interjects 'we are not dumping it'. So what is it going to be? What is the interest withholding tax going to be?

  Say it in the chamber now. What is it going to be?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The question is that the amendments be agreed to.



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  The minister is interjecting across the table that he said it all. I invite him to get up again and say it so that not only the whole of Australia can hear it but, most importantly, so all those international investors can hear it. I have just been handed a press release from TTF Australia. TTF Australia was headed by Chris Brown, who was well known to the Labor Party—he was even a member of the Labor Party. It is now headed by Mr John Lee, the brother of Michael Lee. I would not necessarily say John Lee was a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party. In fact, I seriously doubt he is anything other than a card-carrying member of the Labor Party. Perhaps he has torn up his card because he says that the decision not to proceed with a doubling of the withholding tax rate for managed investment trusts will go some way, not all the way, to restoring foreign investor confidence. He said:


The proposal to double the withholding tax rate for managed investment trusts stopped foreign investment in tourism in its tracks.


That is exactly what we said.


As investors were suddenly facing a tax bill twice the size jeopardising their returns. This announcement in the federal budget came as a complete surprise to industry—


it has obviously come as a complete surprise to the Assistant Treasurer as well—


as there was no consultation on this issue despite repeated requests for any changes to at least be flagged with the sector.


It also flew in the face of the release less than a week earlier of the tourism investment guide, which detailed 100 investment opportunities to improve Australia's tourism product offering. Following consultation with members, TTF raised its concerns about the impact this would have on tourism investment and has been actively pursuing this issue with MPs.


This is the part—get ready ladies and gentlemen—where he said:


Thanks must go to the coalition for its recognition of the impact this measure has caused and will continue to cause in the future.


This is from a strong Labor member.


While some damage has been done to Australia's reputation as an investment destination, the decision not to proceed with doubling the withholding tax rate will help to restore investor confidence and renew interest in Australian tourism products.


We welcome this amendment because it dumps it. But you know what? The Assistant Treasurer now says it is not dumped. He now says it is coming back. What is it? Is it morning or night or afternoon or evening? I do not understand where the Labor Party is going. But what I do understand is it is not the Liberal Party, Tony Abbott, Joe Hockey or Andrew Robb who are raising these concerns; it is in fact the Ivan Glasenbergs, the Marius Kloppers and the Jac Nassers. It is the Gerry Harveys, the John Symons and the John Singletons and now the John Lees. These are the people who, by their own words, are saying this government is incompetent.


This is a government that is inconsistent. This is a government that simply does not understand that what investors are crying out for are stability and certainty and predictability and reliability. So when the Treasurer stands at the dispatch box and gives a budget speech, Australia and the world do not expect that within six weeks three key components of the budget will be dumped before the financial year has even started. And yet our Prime Minister has the gall to go overseas and give them a sermon on the mount about the Australian way. The Australian way, as Labor defines it, is to have three different policies in three days and to have a budget that does not last six weeks. It is their policy to dump and rebirth leaders from time to time and now it is their policy to add to the sovereign risk of investment in Australia.


So I say to you: do not start giving us a lecture about negativity. Do not give us a lecture about poor consumer confidence. Do not give us a lecture about poor business confidence. It comes back directly to the actions of this incompetent government, a government that cannot hold the policy, a government that cannot be consistent, a government that deliberately and intentionally misleads people when it comes to core policy responsibilities of a day-to-day government in Australia. Shame, Labor, shame! Shame on you for being incompetent. Get out of the way and give us an election so we can give Australia a predictable, stable, reliable and trustworthy government again.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (09:27):  This package of bills before the House deals with a range of measures. Schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 and Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012 seek to make directors personally liable for unpaid superannuation. Directors' penalties cannot be discharged by placing the company into administration and directors and associates are liable for PAYG withholding non-compliance tax where a company has failed to pay. 


Schedule 2 of the tax laws amendment bill seeks to retrospectively legislate changes to the taxation financial arrangement scheme, which includes related changes to consolidation tax cost-settings arrangements outlined in schedule 3 of the bill. Finally, schedule 4 of the tax laws amendment bill and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill seeks to double the final withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. I can state at the outset that the coalition will not be supporting the passage of this legislation through the House.


Firstly, I want to deal with schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill and Pay as You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012. As I outline the coalition case for opposition to this package of bills, I will do so sequentially, starting with schedule 1 of the tax law amendment bill and the related pay as you go bill, which contain provisions dealing with director penalties and phoenixing activities. The changes being put forward in relation to director liability and phoenixing activities seek to (1) expand the application of the director penalty regime to unpaid superannuation guarantee charges—and this is what I said before, (2) ensure that directors cannot discharge their director penalties by placing their company into administration or liquidation when PAYG withholding or superannuation guarantee remains unpaid and unreported three months after the due date and (3) in some instances makes directors and their associates liable for PAYG withholding non-compliance tax where the company has failed to pay amounts withheld to the commissioner.


This is the second time that the government has moved to legislate this issue. The first was in November last year, when the government moved an amendment to excise the provisions from TLAB 8 and the associated Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill. This was after a House Standing Committee on Economics inquiry noted concerns from the business community that these bills could apply to all directors, whether engaged in phoenix activity or not. The committee made a bipartisan recommendation that the government should seek to tighten the provisions in those bills to better target actual phoenix activity.


The House economics committee has now inquired into the provisions of the government's second legislative attempt. The coalition have noted in our dissenting report to the House economics committee that this legislation still fails to appropriately target phoenix activity. When is the government going to get it right? We have expressed concerns that 'liability would apply indiscriminately to all directors, including those of charities and not-for-profits that are limited by guarantee'. This is a classic example of further red-tape burdens on business and now further red-tape burdens on charities, and the coalition still views this as a considerable impediment to getting on with the job of life.


The coalition condemns the practice of phoenixing—we always have—which involves a company intentionally accumulating debts to improve cash flows or wealth and then liquidating to avoid repaying the debt. As I have noted to the House previously, phoenix activities are actions by directors to strip out assets to a new company with the intention of liquidating the old company, which is left with net debts. The directors use the corporate veil to protect themselves against any personal liability for the old company's debts. The directors then run the old business through the new company. The old operation rises up from the ashes. The coalition is concerned about the effects of this activity and we recognise the need for legislative safeguards in order to prevent it from occurring.


However, just as the government failed to address our concerns last time, this bill fails to implement protective action that is directed and focused on phoenix activity. The coalition still views these reforms as sweeping changes to deal with a relatively small number of criminally minded individuals. The possibility is very real that innocent directors will be caught in the net. As I said before, I say again: when will the government and ASIC properly use and explain the existing powers and where the existing powers have failed rather than introducing more red tape, more regulation, more legislation? It is smashing a nut with a sledgehammer.


Schedules 2 and 3 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 retrospectively deal with changes to the taxation of financial arrangements, TOFA, and consolidation tax cost setting arrangements. Schedule 2 of the bill deals with the taxation of financial arrangements in the context of tax consolidation. The TOFA legislation which commenced on 26 August 2009 contains tax-timing rules applying to accruals and realisations relating to financial arrangements. The TOFA provisions generally apply to financial arrangements that a TOFA taxpayer entered into during income years commencing on or after 1 July 2010 unless the taxpayer elected to have the TOFA provisions apply early. The amendments in schedule 2 are to be applied retrospectively to 26 March 2009.


The background appears to be the May 2011 Board of Taxation report to the Assistant Treasurer, Review of the consolidation rights to future income and residual tax cost setting rules, which examined the issue of liabilities in the tax consolidation regime. The Board of Taxation noted that there may be some circumstances in which it would be appropriate for a future tax deduction to be denied for the amount of a liability of a joining entity. Schedule 2 will affect the taxation treatment applying to TOFA liabilities that are assumed by a head company, or a lead company, when it acquires another entity joining the consolidated group. The effect of the amendment will be to deny a deduction to the head company when the liability is eventually discharged.


What makes this retrospective change worse is the fact that it will have an even greater impact on one set of consolidated groups in respect of their pre-TOFA acquisitions. Those most disadvantaged are those consolidated groups that made an election to apply TOFA rules to corporate acquisitions of joining entities they had effected before the TOFA legislation started. This is referred to as ungrandfathering. Taxpayers, advisors and professional bodies are aggrieved at the retrospective nature of these amendments. There will be some corporate groups who have made important investment decisions based on the law as it stood when TOFA commenced. There will be some that made the important election whether to apply TOFA to their existing financial arrangements based on the law as it then stood.


Again, in the wake, in the last 24 hours, of the government's retrospective amendments to transfer pricing, here is legislation that is dealing with retrospectivity, further creating sovereign risk. The submission by Deloitte to the exposure draft on the proposed changes to the consolidation regime noted that it was unfair to deny deduction in the circumstances. It said:


The retrospective application of the proposed changes to TOFA and consolidation interaction provisions 26 March 2009 is unfair to taxpayers who relied on the existing tax legislation when making significant business decisions on acquisitions or deciding whether or not to make a transitional election to apply the TOFA rules to their existing financial arrangements. These taxpayers would have acted on the belief that they would be entitled to certain deductions which will not be available if the proposed changes apply retrospectively.


In this place last night we had divisions because the government was going back seven years to change the law in relation to transfer pricing. Here we have businesses that entered into agreements in good faith relating to transfer-pricing arrangements and the government says, 'Look, even though the law didn't exist at the time, we're going to retrospectively change the law to make things that you thought complied with the law unlawful, even though that law did not exist at the time.'! 


Now, within 24 hours, here we are again—Groundhog Day!—retrospective tax legislation, in this case going back to 26 March 2009—and in this case, even after the tax office had given private rulings approving of transactions. Even now the government are saying: 'Look, we're going back. We are changing the rules. We can't claim enough tax from people going forward; we're gonna claim tax off people going backwards.'! This government just can't get enough tax out of you. So they are not only going to claim more tax out of you for all you do tomorrow; the government are going to claim more tax out of you for what you did yesterday, because what they are getting today just isn't enough to meet their wasteful ways.


Then they say to us, 'You guys are responsible for negativity out there.' That is what they say to us. They blame us for negative consumer sentiment. They blame us for negative business sentiment. It is all our fault. It's all Tony Abbott's fault; it's all Joe Hockey's fault—as if we write the speeches for Ivan Glasenberg in London when he says, 'We are getting greater business certainty out of Congo than we are getting out of Australia.' Or Marius Kloppers or Jac Nasser at BHP when they warn of uncertain business times in Australia. As I said yesterday, we do not write the press releases for Gerry Harvey, John Singleton or John Symond. We do not write those releases, they do, because they have to deal with this type of legislation—retrospective tax legislation. They have to deal with it. How can anyone have confidence about the future when there is a government that is changing today's laws tomorrow? Why would you take a risk? Why would you go out and borrow money to buy a new house? Why would you do that in this environment? Fewer and fewer people are doing it, because they are nervous about the government. 


There is a sovereign risk, and before the House for the second day in a row we have retrospective tax legislation. No wonder people are afraid to take a risk. How do you price-risk when a government says, 'We're going to change yesterday's laws'? How do you do that? And where are the accountable people in the Treasury or in the Australian Taxation Office? Who are the people that are going to be held accountable for what is deemed to be original drafting errors? Where are they? What heads have rolled? Because, if you are writing retrospective tax legislation that involves billions of dollars of back taxes being claimed at a time when there were legitimate business investments, someone is going to be sacked out there. People are going to lose their jobs. Of course they are. Where billions of dollars are transferred from the private sector to the public sector, someone is going to have to pay. Of course there will be job losses. There will be investments that will stall. Who is accountable in the government? If it occurred under a previous coalition government and now it occurs under the Labor Party, who are the public servants that were responsible for these drafting errors? Is the minister going to answer that? This is serious stuff. It involves billions of dollars, as I understand it, and yet there is no accountability. They think: 'Oh well, we'll just shuffle it through the House of Reps and the Senate. It'll be okay.' 


But out there real people will lose their jobs. They have to, so who is going to be accountable here? This is what kills confidence. The government kills confidence. It kills confidence when it changes the laws that applied yesterday, but also it kills confidence when it changes the laws as they stand. We have seen it in relation to company tax, carbon tax, mining tax, superannuation tax, taxation of employee share schemes and now it seems there is an endless list of retrospective taxes. The mountain that we have to climb if there is a change of government is just getting bigger and bigger every day.


Schedule 3 is another complex amendment to the tax consolidation legislation. At Senate estimates last month in response to coalition question, Treasury advised that the amendments in schedule 3 addressed issues that arose out of amendments to the tax legislation enacted on 3 June 2010. Treasury's advice was that there had been extensive public consultation over a number of years prior to the 2010 amendments being passed. Despite that, the Board of Taxation noted in its report I referred to earlier that in 2011 the ATO were aware of claims and potential claims by consolidated groups for deductions of over $30 billion in respect to the 2010 amendments. This amount did not include interest or the revenue associated with transactions that have taken place since 30 June 2010.


The Treasury is to be commended for carrying out an internal examination of why the revenue risk associated with the amendments was not recognised prior to passage. But there are questions that remain. The fact that the amendments took effect from the commencement of the consolidation regime on 1 July 2002 only partly explains the quantum of the claims. Evidence given by Treasury at estimates was that the information given to Treasury through the consultation process did not fully draw out the downside risks with the legislation.


Quality control in relation to taxation legislation is crucial. This is even more so where transactions are large and involve considerable commercial complexity. Tax consolidation legislation is almost a category of its own. Quality control starts with competent and capable personnel. It involves appropriate supervision and monitoring of compliance with the department's standards, having regard to the huge sum of revenue associated with the claimed deductions. There must be careful oversight by Treasury into the quality and risk processes associated with developing tax policy, drafting the requisite legislation, and ensuring that consultation is open and frank, including the participation of the ATO.


This process would not have been helped by the fact that the government has had no less than five Assistant Treasurers since coming to office only 4½ years ago—five Assistant Treasurers in 4½ years! The pick-up and put-down of legislative priorities for this particular portfolio by the various ministers wandering through the revolving door of the Labor ministry seems to have negatively impacted the consultation processes, reviews, stakeholder feedback and deadlines for taxation legislation. Quite simply, this is not the way to run a country. It is not the way to run a taxation system.


In summary, the changes contained in schedule 3 seek to modify the consolidation tax cost setting arrangements and rights to future income rules so that tax outcomes for consolidated groups are more consistent, in the view of the government, with the tax outcomes that arise when assets are required outside of the consolidation regime.


This raises a number of concerns, given that the government is retrospectively amending the consolidation tax cost setting arrangements according to the time when the corporate acquisition took place. The changes within the bill will impact acquisitions that took place on various dates. The first period is prior to 12 May 2010, being the date when the amending legislation was passed by both houses of parliament, when what are referred to as the 'pre rules' will apply. The second time period is after 30 March 2011, being the date the Board of Taxation was asked to review the 2010 amendments, and referred to as the 'prospective rules'. The final period is the intervening period, known as the 'interim rules'. Did you hear that? And this is a government committed to simplification! Given that the changes passed on 12 May 2010 relates to amendments that date back to 2002, some of the amendments related to consolidation within this bill will have effect from 2002—that is, 10 years of retrospectivity. They are cheering out there in business land. Ten years of retrospectivity!


Entities affected by the proposed changes in schedule 3 will be adversely impacted by the retrospective changes, in particular, those changes editing the acquired rights to future income. This is because, for tax purposes, many of these rights will now have a cost base of zero, as opposed to those entities outside the consolidation's regime with a cost base equal to that of the purchase price. The resetting of the cost base to nil for entities of the consolidation regime, combined with its retrospective application, will disadvantage taxpayers that have elected to be in the consolidation regime.


The coalition opposes retrospective application. That is a position that we on this side of the House uphold. In its submission to the House Standing Committee on Economics, the Tax Institute referred to a number of factors that weigh against the retrospective amendments proposed in schedule 3. Another relevant point, made by CPA Australia, that it is inequitable that a taxpayer who has lodged a ruling or amendment request prior to 31 March 2011 receives a different treatment simply because it is not actioned by the relevant cut-off time, which at the time of the lodgement was not a factor. They said:


Taxpayers should not receive differing treatment in circumstances where they have no control over the outcome.


It is because of their retrospective application that the coalition will not support the measures contained in schedules 2 and 3.


Schedule 4 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill, along with the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012, seeks to double the final withholding tax on management investment trusts from 7½ to 15 per cent from 1 July 2012. The coalition understands the minister is going to be moving an amendment to excise schedule 4 of the tax law amendment bill and the related managed investment trust withholding tax bill. How about that? After announcing it in the budget, the government rushes in the legislation and now are they going to excise it! I am sorry, is this meant to be a key budget initiative?


This is the third backflip from the government and the financial year has not even started! It seems like yesterday that the Treasurer delivered the budget—now we have got the third major amendment to the budget. The first is that they were dumping the company tax cuts, but now they are back on the table—those tax cuts that were only recently dumped in the budget are an article of faith, according to the Prime Minister. The second one is the passenger movement charge, remember that? The government has now dumped the CPI increases that they said were a part of the budget. The CPI increases have now gone. Now, there is the third factor—three strikes. The third one is that they are now dumping their determination to increase the withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent.


You wonder why people are uncertain and why business is confused. Look no further than the actions at the hands of the government over the last three weeks alone. We had already announced that we would be opposing the measure after the Labor government previously reducing interest on withholding tax—which we praised. They reduced it and now they want to double it. What does that say to investors? The government make a decision—it is the same political party; it is the same Treasurer—and they reduce the interest withholding tax and then they wake up one day and decide, 'We are going to double it'. And you wonder why people like Ivan Glasenberg are giving speeches in London, saying that it is easier to deal with the Congo than it is to deal with the Australian government. Well, there is the evidence.


David Denison, President and CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board stated—and this is what we hear all the time:


In this era of fiscal restraint and additional direct and indirect taxes, we are becoming increasingly concerned that some risks associated with ownership of infrastructure are expanding. For instance, it is easy to envision the regulatory rate setting process becoming politicized instead of objective and fair. The same could occur with taxes—in fact, Australia’s budget that was tabled last week effectively doubled the tax burden on our real estate and infrastructure holdings in that country.


If we conclude that these kinds of risks within any country become significant enough to call into question the predictability and stability of cash flows that are at the heart of the investment rationale for infrastructure, our response will be very quick and rational—we will simply stop investing there.


That was the head of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. He is saying it is too hard to do business. I did not write that speech. Tony Abbott did not write that speech. These are international investors that are saying, 'Hang on; this sort of sovereign risk in Australia is becoming just too hard. We will stop investing in infrastructure.'


The chopping and changing of the MIT withholding tax has yet again reduced our predictability, our stability and our certainty in the eyes of international investors when they want to come here. They want to come here. They want a stable place to invest for the long term, and Australia as a net importer of capital needs that. But they have a government that keep screwing it up. In 2008 they reduced the interest withholding tax from 30 per cent to 7½ per cent, and now they want to double it, as they announced in the budget: 'Sorry, we've changed our minds; now we're taking it out'. Why? Why can't the government hold a policy position? Forget four years, three years or two years; why can't they hold a policy position for three weeks? Why can't they hold a policy position for two months?


I know the minister at the table is one who frets about this. He was sent out into the coalface and told to sell a carbon tax package that the Labor Party promised they would never deliver—but, of course, they have. And they wonder why there is uncertainty. The coalition does not support the doubling of final withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. We are going to ask the minister at the table, who is responsible when this amendment is being moved by the government, to explain himself. Why can't the government hold a tax policy together? Why does the government now go deep into retrospective tax legislation in order to try and fund its budget?


As I stated earlier, the coalition will not be supporting the passage of this package of bills through the parliament. We believe on many fronts that the government has failed to listen to the community. We believe that the government gives lip service to consultation with stakeholders. We keep getting this feedback, saying, 'Oh, the Treasury, the Australian Taxation Office and the government have consulted with the business community.' The business community is over that feigned, pretend consultation. It does not seem to move the government during what is meant to be a fair dinkum consultation process. No, the government is so determined to proceed that it then goes and announces initiatives in the budget, goes and introduces legislation into the parliament, and then changes its mind.


What a dysfunctional rabble we have running the place in Canberra. This is tax policy. This is not tens of millions of dollars or a program here and a program there; it is billions and billions of dollars. It involves international confidence in our nation. The more the Treasurer and the Prime Minister talk about Australia and the Australian way, the more they are ridiculed by their actions—their actions in having retrospective tax legislation yesterday going back seven years, in having retrospective tax legislation today going back 10 years, in announcing policy in relation to interest withholding tax and then changing their mind a few weeks later, in the passenger movement charge and in the company tax cuts. This is a government that cannot be trusted. It is an embarrassment, and the Minister for Resources and Energy knows how embarrassing it is to be a part of a government that cannot keep its promises or make up its mind. (Time expired)

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (09:58):  I speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012, the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. There we saw a pitiful and pathetic attempt by the shadow Treasurer to oppose these bills. Gough Whitlam, the former Labor Prime Minister, once said that only the impotent are pure. Well, I tell you what, there is not much purity on the other side when it comes to retrospectivity, as the Assistant Treasurer outlined yesterday in this place, with example after example of those opposite bringing in retrospective taxation legislation. So do not come into this place and lecture us about this, when we are fixing up a problem that has operated in one of these respects, on the shadow Treasurer's admission, since 2002. Who was in power in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and for most of 2007? Those opposite were in power, and they did nothing about fixing up the problems, as we are doing here.


The shadow Treasurer said in relation to the passage of these particular bills that it involved billions and billions of dollars of taxpayers' funds. Have a look at the financial impact that the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill is going to have. The revenue impact this year of schedule 1 of the bill will be $32.5 million; the impact of schedule 2 will be $66 million; the impact of schedule 3 will be nil; and the impact of schedule 4 will be $65 million. So it will not be the billions and billions of dollars the shadow Treasurer referred to time and time again in his speech. He made exaggerated claim after exaggerated claim, and the same thing is happening all the time.


The shadow Treasurer talked about sovereign risk and said that the passage of these bills and the operation of this government present a sovereign risk to this country. He spoke as if there has been a great exodus of investment from this country, when in fact half a trillion dollars has been invested in the mining sector—in iron ore and in coal. You can see Australian ships carrying iron ore and coal lined up one after another in places such as the Pohang steelworks in South Korea. People came into this country and made massive investments notwithstanding the GFC. In 2009 and 2010 we saw massive foreign investment in this country. In 2009, there was an 11.1 per cent increase in foreign direct investment in Australia. This was followed by a 7.5 per cent increase—a total of $474 billion—in 2010. Are all the foreign investors coming to this country stupid? No, they are not. Do they have economic idiocy running through their brains? No, they do not. But to believe the jeremiads from the shadow Treasurer about these bills is to believe that all these barons of capitalism and captains of industry—these mining companies and these superannuation funds trustees—are all dills. Why, if you believed a word that those opposite have said, would they invest in Australia? Why would all these shadow ministers and opposition backbenchers invest in these companies—as we have seen them do time and time again—if you believed a word of what the shadow Treasurer said was true? He is like a profit of doom. He is like some sort of Old Testament prophet—woe is me! I half expected sackcloth and ashes to be thrown around the chamber during the shadow Treasurer's speech! It was nonsense.


He said not a word about how schedule 1 of the bill protects the superannuation entitlements of workers and therefore the revenue base of this country by making directors liable to pay superannuation and preventing them getting credits through collapsing their companies and not paying the PAYG withholding obligations. There has been not a word from the architects and the apostles of Work Choices over there about protecting workers. There has not been a word about that from them, but that is what schedule 1 of the bill is all about—making sure that workers' superannuation entitlements and government revenue are protected. The shadow Treasurer is not worried about workers or the revenue base of the country. Those opposite are not interested in either putting in place deterrents to phoenix operations or strengthening and extending the director penalty regime—the DPR—to cover superannuation obligations. It currently only applies to PAYG withholding obligations. The shadow Treasurer said nothing about that—and just waxed on, way off beam.


These bills are important because we do not want people to fail in their obligations to workers, as has happened in the past. I am sure that as members of parliament all of us have had people come up to us at street stalls, at mobile offices and at electorate offices and have talked to us about fraudulent phoenix activity. I am sure that there is not a member of this chamber who has not had someone come and say to them: 'I'm working for a business, and that business has failed. It's unable to pay its debts. I had superannuation, and they didn't pay the superannuation guarantee. They didn't meet their taxation obligations.'


We are making sure that these directors are more accountable for what they fail to do. We are making sure that there is a deterrent in place to prevent directors doing just this sort of thing. We are making sure make sure that they fulfil their obligations. We do not want taxation liabilities left unpaid, and that is why these bills are before this chamber. We do not want outstanding debts, and we want to make sure that these directors are liable. If the company is unable to meet its withholding amounts to the commissioner, the directors must place the company into voluntary administration or liquidation. Currently the Commissioner of Taxation has the ability to penalise the directors an amount equal to any PAYG withholding that has fallen overdue, but the director penalty regime in the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill makes them personally liable.


We want to expand the responsibility and the scope of liability of the directors to cover unpaid superannuation guarantees to employees; remedy any possible escape from liability by preventing the discharge of the director's penalties when a company is placed in liquidation and PAYG or superannuation obligations remain outstanding; and impose obligations on directors and their associates to pay PAYG withholding non-compliance tax on withheld PAYG amounts that have not been paid to the commissioner and so forth. I did not hear much from the shadow Treasurer about those measures, which, in my view, are the principal reasons for bills such as those that are before the House.


We are committed to making sure that we protect workers' entitlements. This Labor government has a proud record of getting rid of pernicious and arbitrary legislation imposed on Australian workers by those opposite and of standing up to protect the revenue base of this country when those opposite set themselves against government on taxation issues, as they always seem to do. Schedule 2 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill deals with problems that have been around for a while. It amends the taxation of financial arrangements—consolidation interaction provisions—in the Income Tax Assessment Act and balances these adjustments with other legislation to make sure that the tax treatment of financial arrangements is part of assets and liabilities in a merger or takeover, that it is consistent with the TOFA tax timing rules and that it takes into account changes in the value of financial arrangements or liabilities. This is important legislation. It amends legislation to make sure that our provisions are consistent, it makes sure that we have a good arrangement protecting the taxation bases. It ensures that taxation treatment of financial arrangements is consistent with the rules we have put in place in terms of timing and I support that.


Schedule 3 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act, modifying consolidation of tax cost setting rules so that the tax outcomes for consolidated groups are more consistent with the tax outcomes that arise when assets are acquired outside the consolidation arrangement. We amended the regime in relation to consolidation in 2010 as clarification. For some assets this reset tax costs from the original tax costs, in the case of consolidation of corporate arrangements. We want to make sure that it is used as a taxing point when it later arises for the purpose of the assets. 


Shortly after that some unintended consequences arose. We have taken steps about that. The opposition say they are not supportive of what we are saying, but the Board of Taxation was asked to look at these arrangements and recommended that we conduct the kind of legislative amendments that are necessary. The board concluded the scope of the new rules was broader than was originally intended at the time of the announcement in 2005—when we were not in power—and could allow some consolidating groups to access deductions that were not available to other taxpayers outside the consolidation regime. So it is a longstanding problem that operated before we came into power. This is fixing up a mess that happened on the watch of the previous government as well.


I will let the minister talk about schedule 4 but I want to make a point about criticisms made of us that we reduced the withholding tax rate paid from managed investment trusts. We reduced the MIT payments to foreign residents from the rate of 30 per cent to 15 per cent. We did that as part of our election commitment back in 2007 when we went to the polls. That is consistent with other countries. The United States and the United Kingdom have 15 per cent. It was 30 per cent under the previous coalition government.


We are a government that is interested in foreign investment. We welcome foreign investment in this country. We think it is important. We do not have sufficient population or dollars and cents to develop our country—vast continent that it is—without foreign investment. We are a country that has grown by virtue of immigration and having people come to this place. They come as employees and employers. We welcome them when they come to the rural, manufacturing and the mining sectors. We, on this side of the chamber, are people who believe both in free trade and fair trade and believe that the criticism of our support of foreign investment is unjustified and exaggerated. We saw that well and truly on display by the shadow Treasurer whose words were nonsensical and alarmist in this regard, once again so much like some sort of Old Testament prophet going around saying, 'We are all doomed and no-one should have any confidence,' and then having the temerity to criticise us when we say that they are putting a dampener on consumer and business confidence in this country. I support the legislation.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (10:11):  It is always fascinating to follow the member for Blair. He seems to have one theme, no matter what he is talking about. It is always contradictory when you sit and listen. He stands up and, in the most virulent manner, accuses the opposition of endless negativity and then proceeds for the length of his 15-minute contribution—or whatever it may be—with endless negativity. The government seem to be obsessed with abusing this side of politics and the member for Blair is a classic example of that. I think it reflects the fact that, even though they are the government and should have plenty to say because they are responsible for introducing measures and legislation and defending that legislation, they have nothing to say really. The member for Blair read what is contained in the bill and in essence gave no argument of any consequence in support of those measures.


The bill has been in the public arena now for some weeks. There have been some very trenchant concerns and frustrations about some of these provisions. There have been statements made not only by the opposition—let us put us aside—but by the people in the businesses and investors who will be affected by the changes that are proposed. At the very least the lead speaker for the government on this bill should provide some critique of the concerns that have been raised by important members of the community, people who are creating thousands of jobs, looking to promote billions of dollars of investment, looking for certainty, looking for the absence of sovereign risk.


You would think that the member for Blair would address some of these concerns that have been listed over several weeks very prominently in the newspapers and elsewhere, yet he went on an exercise of simply reading out what is in the legislation in between all these histrionic attacks on the opposition and inflammatory language about the way in which we have expressed our concerns over the legislation. I must say it is a pathetic contribution and it adds nothing to this debate. It does reflect the morale that we see on the other side and the concern by the adults on the other side that this government is one of the most inept, if not the most inept, governments in our lifetime. It is a government which has lost any sense of direction, if it ever had any. It is a government that is confusing people all over this economy and, externally, with investors in foreign markets. It is a government that has, at its root—because of its incompetence, inconsistency, flip-flopping and lack of direction—very materially created a crisis of confidence amongst households in this country. They have been saving disposable income at a rate of 12 per cent over the last year because they are afraid to spend. They are building up reserves and paying off the mortgage because of their fear. They are worried about their jobs. There is a crisis of confidence. They have pulled $90 billion of discretionary income out of the marketplace. 


No wonder our retail sector is on its knees. It is because of the lack of confidence. It is because they are waking up at 2.30 in the morning worried about whether they are going to have a job. We see endlessly, each week, reports of companies that are going to the wall and putting off thousands of people. Sure, we are blessed with what is going on with the mining boom in the west and in Queensland. Put that aside, and the rest of the country has stopped. The investors, major companies, have got serious money on their balances sheets that they are not investing because there is a crisis of confidence not only amongst households but also amongst businesses.


This sort of legislation is another classic example, another symbol, of the deep sense of confusion and lack of confidence and uncertainty that is now riddled through our economy—at a time when we are blessed with the mining boom. It is a boom that has been going for 10 years and has been wasted by this government. Every dollar of the $800 cheques that are going out is still being borrowed. Can you believe it! After 10 years of a boom and the highest terms of trade in our history—monumentally higher than anything we ever had before—we still have $800 going out to households, every dollar being borrowed. And then there is the flip-flopping that is represented in this bill. 


We will not be supporting this set of bills, as my colleague the shadow Treasurer announced, because it adds to the great uncertainty and concern about consistency, flip-flopping and the litany of sovereign risk issues that now confront investors who may be looking to put their money in Australia—or investors in Australia looking to take a risk and invest in and create jobs. The changes proposed under the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2011 do not appropriately target phoenix activity. The government has failed to argue a strong enough public justification for the retrospective application of proposed changes contained in schedules 2 and 3 of the tax laws amendment bill. This is in relation to consolidation tax cost-setting arrangements and related changes to taxation and financial arrangements. 


My colleague the shadow Treasurer went through in some detail—and with great clarity—the way in which schedules 2 and 3 are a lazy attempt to plug some spending holes that this government has. It is a lazy attempt to use retrospective legislation to grab some tax from years ago. The retrospective application of these changes heightens our sovereign risk profile.


As an opposition we have very strong in-principle opposition to retrospective tax changes and if anything were ever to be done it would need enormous justification. The reasons this government has put forward are very shallow. In fact, if you listened to the member for Blair he gave no justification of any consequence for the retrospection. All he did was criticise and defame the shadow Treasurer and others on this side of the House. Our opposition stems from the fact that retrospective tax changes can change the substance of bargains struck between taxpayers who made every effort to comply with laws prevailing at the time the agreement was entered into. People who acted lawfully are now going to be slugged, potentially some years later, with an unexpected and in some cases highly significant tax grab by this government.


We are opposed to retrospective changes because they can expose taxpayers to penalties in circumstances where taxpayers could not possibly have taken steps, at the earlier time, to mitigate the potential for penalties. We oppose retrospective changes because they may change taxpayers' tax profiles. This, in turn, can materially impact on the financial viability of investment decisions and the pricing of those decisions—years after they were taken, years after people acted in good faith and made a case based on the prevailing legislation. They did their ROI assessments and deals with other companies and took risks based on the prevailing legislation. Now they find they will be lumped with an unexpected, highly material and in some cases debilitating tax bill. It will also leave a mark on their reputation. For many if not all who have acted within the law they will feel they have been unjustly labelled as tax cheats. In some cases, businesses will go to the wall because they took decisions at the time based on the prevailing law. We are opposed to retrospective tax changes because they could increase Australia's level of perceived sovereign risk. Added to these changes is the litany of sovereign risk issues from the introduction of a carbon tax, which was promised never to be introduced, and from the introduction of the mining tax, which exists nowhere else in the world, and, again, the incompetent way in which that has been dealt with over the last 18 months or nearly two years. Then there is the way in which they handled the live cattle job. They have actually created a long-term poisoned pill in the middle of our relationship with Indonesia—our closest neighbour, with a population of nearly 300 million, and a big part of our future, and yet our trade with that country is smaller than with New Zealand and its four million people. Can you believe it? And yet this government has gone out of its way to compromise and frustrate and demean that nation by, overnight, with absolutely no forewarning, announcing, via email, that we were going to cut off 40 per cent of their imported protein, indefinitely, because of a television program three nights before in Australia. Can you believe it? This is the sign of a government which is just amateur hour, and people see all of these things. Now we have a whole raft of changes which have retrospective elements to them.


The final element of these bills is the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. We hear rumours now that it is going to be withdrawn and possibly some grubby deal is to be done with the Greens. Maybe we will see it introduced, who knows? Nothing will surprise us. Nothing will surprise the rest of business. It will only confirm the judgment they are making: 'Let's not invest. There's too much uncertainty. This government's got no idea.' They have already made a change, yesterday, in the CPI matter, for the passenger movement charge—only a lazy $140 million! But they have withdrawn that. Now, today, we hear that they may well have withdrawn this bill, which increases the withholding tax on foreign investment from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent—just another lazy $265 million! It is the only reason they introduced it in the first place. It was a measure that they introduced some four years ago and received great commendation, including from ourselves. It was an inspired move, to reduce the withholding tax to 7½ per cent. And it has had a material effect. There have been literally billions of dollars, especially coming into the housing and construction sector. We were starting to see billions of dollars being invested in infrastructure through this mechanism. Now all of that will be put on hold. We are literally sacrificing billions and billions of dollars of investment, and a decision, which got commendation around the world and certainly within this country, has now been turned on its head for a miserable $264 million. We even have a situation where research subsequently conducted by Allen Consulting Group is saying that, for every billion-dollar drop in investment—and there will be billions, many billions—from the increased tax, it will raise $40 million less in revenue from the tax increase in 2015-16, than the $75 million predicted by the government. So it is not even going to raise the money they expected. So they have taken this step which has again materially affected our sovereign risk for no good reason.


So we have a $400 million hole in the budget. And today we see the Reserve Bank has indicated that the forecast sharp swing to budget surplus next financial year mostly reflects shuffling of spending that will limit the scope for further interest rate rises. The RBA has just confirmed that the budget surplus is a hoax—it is a con. It is a fiction. What we have been saying all along—and what businesses suspects, and what everyone suspects, everyone knows—is that the one-and-a-half-billion-dollar surplus is a con. It is never going to happen. Again, it is a sovereign risk issue now.


All of these things are adding up—adding up to a point where this is very dangerous for the country. We are opposed to these bills. This government is out of control. It is all over the place. It must be stopped. The only way this will happen is with an election. (Time expired)

"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Mr MELHAM
 (Banks) (10:26):  I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012, the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012. 


I want to address a couple of points that the member for Goldstein made in his contribution. The first thing I want to say to the House is: I am not opposed to retrospective legislation in certain circumstances. That has been a feature of legislative reform over the years—obviously, not in every single case, but it is warranted in a number of cases. Indeed, it is warranted sometimes in the criminal law. Indeed, when we had the war crimes legislation under the Hawke government, it produced retrospective legislation against abhorrent conduct that occurred at the time of the Second World War. That legislation was supported, and it made criminal acts that should have been criminal at the time. So you just cannot rule it out.


Today we see on the front pages of the newspapers a shyster, a solicitor, who was overcharging his clients and who, some 12 months ago in New South Wales, transferred to his wife millions of dollars worth of assets, be it his share of the family home for a dollar, or his share of a farm for a dollar. It is said that his assets can be recovered. That is what is being said in the papers. But I say to you, Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath: if that shyster's assets cannot be recovered then the New South Wales government should introduce legislation and it should be retrospective legislation that enables it to recover his assets, because he was under investigation and during the period of that investigation has transferred his assets, for a dollar, in some instances, where the value was much more. What are we supposed to do as legislators—do what the coalition does in a number of instances: be like moo cows, watching the passing traffic? No, in my opinion, you come in and you legislate, and a retrospective feature is warranted—not in all circumstances but in some circumstances.


The reason I rise to support this particular legislation has to do with features of it in terms of phoenix activity. I go to the explanatory memorandum, which says:


Schedule 1 to this Bill strengthens directors’ obligations to cause their company to comply with its existing Pay As You Go (PAYG) withholding and superannuation guarantee requirements. These amendments reduce the scope for companies to engage in fraudulent phoenix activity or escape liabilities and payments of employee entitlements by:


extending the director penalty regime to make directors personally liable for their company’s unpaid superannuation guarantee amounts;


ensuring that directors cannot discharge their director penalties by placing their company into administration or liquidation when PAYG withholding or superannuation guarantee remains unpaid and unreported three months after the due date; and


in some instances, making directors and their associates liable to PAYG withholding non-compliance tax where the company has failed to pay amounts withheld to the Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner).


The explanatory memorandum goes on to summarise regulation impact statements and explain other aspects of the bills. In particular, it says at paragraph 1.7:


The director penalty regime makes directors of companies that fail to comply with their obligation to pay amounts withheld under the PAYG withholding regime to the Commissioner (or fail to pay an estimate of their PAYG withholding liability) personally liable for the amount that the company should have paid, through imposition of a penalty.


It continues in paragraph 1.11:


Phoenix activity poses a significant threat to employee entitlements, government revenue and the economy as a whole. In its most basic form, a fraudulent phoenix company is used to intentionally accumulate debts and then is placed into voluntary administration or liquidation to avoid paying those debts. The business then ‘re emerges’ as another corporate entity, controlled by the same person or group, but free of debts. However, some aspects of the director penalty regime limit its efficacy in ensuring that directors cause their companies to comply with their obligations, including in phoenix cases.


Some evidence was put before the Standing Committee on Economics on 27 October 2011 by Mr Grant Darmanin, a senior director and the Phoenix Risk Manager of the Australian Taxation Office, that is worth mentioning. On page 29 of the committee report, he says:


Our best estimate is that at any given time there are around 6,000 phoenix companies operating in Australia, and we estimate that, given that not all of them have a single director—some have two directors—somewhere between 7½ thousand and 9,000 company directors could be exposed in particular to this legislation. These are fraudulent phoenix operators; they are not just people making business decisions.


That is what he says in evidence. Then on page 31 he says:


Fraudulent phoenix operators, almost to a person, do not report, they do not lodge and they do not pay. We have to go out and identify them and quantify the liability, sometimes using forensic-style investigative or audit techniques.


I think it is important to put on the record that on page 32, Mr Darmanin says:


There are, but phoenix operators, particularly the fraudulent ones, are very adept at flying under the radar, so to speak. When they come back into the ATO's systems, they will quite often use as the director someone who is not directly related to the former group. It might be someone that they engage, pay or hire or a name they pick from the telephone book. When we profile that individual when it comes through, quite often the direct links to that former business are not obvious. I take your point, though, that if we ask them questions we may get some answers, but phoenix operators do not like telling the truth.


Then on page 33, the chair says:


Okay. So there are 6,000 to 7,000 that you know about. Do you have an estimate of how many you might not know about and how many new ones come in every year? 


Mr Darmanin responded:


No, we do not. There have been various studies done over the years, not so much by the ATO but by other committees and organisations, that have made various assessments of the impact of phoenix activity on the Australian economy. The most recent one was a 2004 parliamentary joint committee inquiry into corporations and financial services. That put the impact on the Australian economy at that time—2004—as being between $1 billion and $2.4 billion per annum. That is the most recent hard data we have to work with. Since that time, all the ATO's experience is that fraudulent phoenix activity has continued to increase not decrease, despite the ATO having a targeted approach to try to address this behaviour since the late nineties. 


The chair then asked:


How much is it increasing every year?


Mr Darmanin responded:


It is hard to be definitive around that. When I say 'increasing', the indicators that we look at are the number of complaints being lodged by individuals whose entitlements have not been paid and we look at those companies and find that they are involved in repeat phoenix behaviour. We have incidents of companies incurring repeat liabilities—companies who are given an income tax adjustment the first time who choose to liquidate and continue their business through a new company rather than pay those assessments, for example. We have break-outs in different parts of our business, as I talked about before. A lot of phoenix activity in previous years used to be at the lower end of the SME market; now it is across the whole of the SME market. It is active in the micromarket as well. Originally, it used to be PAYE and prescribed payments, when we had that system; now it is in the superannuation, GST and income tax.


The member for Goldstein talks about sovereign risk. What I see here is risk to the ordinary taxpayer—to the ordinary hardworking individual—from shonks. The parliament should go after the shonks and set a legislative framework, even if it requires retrospectivity, that puts these people on notice that they will be personally liable and that we will come after them if they engage in this sort of behaviour. And we should not apologise for it. Recently we saw a situation where the High Court came down in terms of directors' liabilities and duties to do with a particular company dealing with asbestos. I welcome that unanimous decision of the High Court, because what it says is, 'If you want to be a director, don't bother just picking up your director's cheque. You actually have to do your homework. You have to read your papers. You have to read the press releases before they go out.' What it means is that directors have to take responsibility as directors, not just occupy those positions for the sake of an honorarium or some remuneration, and that they can themselves be liable. What we had in the James Hardie case, I think, was the High Court being spot-on in terms of the liability of those directors—those that tried to hide behind the claim, 'Well, I didn't read the press release, so I'm not liable.'


In relation to phoenix companies, which are much worse, we should not apologise for the action that we are taking, even involving a level of retrospectivity in this legislation. When the member for Goldstein talks about sovereign risk, I think he is using an expanded definition of 'sovereign risk' to bring this sort of activity that the government is involved in into the definition of 'sovereign risk'. I am concerned about sovereign risk, as we all are, but I am also concerned about employees' entitlements, because time and again we have seen under this government and the former government companies going belly-up and employee entitlements going out the window. Here we are talking about activity that is despicable activity, deliberately setting up companies to do the wrong thing, maximising the money to certain individuals and minimising any liability.


So I have no hesitation in standing up in the House today and supporting this legislation, notwithstanding the fact that there are elements of retrospectivity in the legislation, because what I would say is that it should not cause concern if the conduct that we are talking about is captured retrospectively. It is not outside the bounds. This notion of 'retrospectivity never at any cost' is rubbish. I believe in retrospectivity in appropriate cases. When it comes to phoenix activity or dishonourable behaviour, you can legislate retrospectively to pick it up, because the threat of that retrospectivity of itself is a powerful deterrent to the shonks. It says to them, 'You're not going to be able to get away with it.'


What it is about is greed, so you have to attack the greed and the loot that they are looking for with, in some instances, the threat of retrospectivity, which might stop certain behaviour. That is the only way. When you talk about deterrent effects, I say to you: when it comes to money and when it comes to this sort of behaviour, deterrence does have an impact in the corporate sector for some of these shonks. If they think they can transfer assets to their partners, their relatives or whatever with immunity and it is not going to be captured or picked up if they are caught out, they will do it. I am not arguing for retrospectivity in every instance—I am not saying that—but what I am saying to you is that in some instances it is warranted. In this instance, to me, it is certainly within the realm and within the principles. It has been, I think, pointed out by other speakers that there has been retrospective legislation in the life of the former government. So they did it—not as a regular occurrence, but on a number of occasions it was done. So let us not be too precious in relation to that. I commend the bills to the House.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (10:41):  What an interesting group of bills: the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012; the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012, which has the retrospectivity linked to it; and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012. It is quite a complex group of bills. However, I rise today to speak about the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill, the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill.


I express my concerns in relation to these bills because I believe they are inadequate in their process and assessment and they fail to pay consideration to a number of associated issues and recommendations. In particular, the government has not adequately addressed the bipartisan concerns of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics inquiry into the government's previous attempts at legislating these measures. A prospective undue increase in taxation and proposed retrospective measures without proper justification to raise automatic and indiscriminate liabilities to directors add pressure on investments and are not acceptable. The potential automatic increase in the liability of directors under the PAYG bill raises concerns about the preservation of natural justice and the considerable burden to business.


Before I go on, I just want to start with a very basic point. Let us get a determination on what a company director is. When you think of a company director, depending on your background, does your mind go to someone who is maybe taking a board position on one of the major banks or an influential organisation and who could be paid enormous amounts of remuneration, or does your mind go to your local mechanic or butcher, who could have a net household income of around 100 grand a year and who could have taken advice from their accountant that, because they are around that $100,000 level, it is more advantageous for them from a tax perspective as a small family business to set up a company structure as opposed to a partnership? This bill captures the mechanic. It captures the butcher. It captures the bloke in the main street. I have not heard anyone from the other side stand in this House to defend the rights of the common man and the worker. This bill is doing them over. I want you to take your mind to a place where when you hear the word company director during the debate on this bill you think of the mechanic, the bloke who has grease up his arms. Do not think of the bloke in the suit in Collins Street on a million bucks a year—or a million bucks a month in some cases. Making directors personally liable for the failure of someone else will only add more red tape to the business and will add more bureaucracy, and would most definitely cause most potential directors to run a mile in the other direction. What will happen to the future of Australian business and thus the economy?


Phoenixing is a terrible practice. We do not support phoenixing in any capacity whatsoever. For those of you that may not totally understand what phoenixing is, it is a horrible practice where a business bloke might see that he is getting into trouble and is going to go out the back door, so he transfers the assets out of his business with the distinct intention of avoiding paying super and other liabilities that his staff are entitled to. We will not have a bar of that. We will crack down on phoenixing and assist in whatever capacity we can because we do not support that. Phoenixing is corrupt and there is enough corruption going on in this nation as it is.


The previous speaker spoke about evidence the Taxation Office gave to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. I happen to sit on that committee. This bill seeks to give the Taxation Office enormous, overreaching powers. The tax office claims this will give it the capacity to stop phoenixing. But guess what? These powers reach to every single business in the nation. The evidence was there are only 6,000 cases of phoenixing. But this bill allows the Taxation Office, under the auspices of investigating phoenixing, to go into your business, to tear the place apart, find whatever other anomalies that may be happening in your business and go after it. This is just a trigger to get through the front door of your business to try and grab more cash.


One of the people who gave evidence to the economics committee was John Colvin. He is the CEO of the Australian Institute of Company Directors. He said:


The bill was conceived to target phoenix operators. The regulatory impact statement prepared in June 2011 in respect of the bill only addresses the measures the context of phoenix activity. There have been some minor amendments to that regulatory statement as we understand it; however, the premise of the bill and the way it is constructed is basically still targeting or based on phoenix activity. Even if you accept the ATO figures which have been put forward, less than half a per cent of directors may be engaged in phoenix activity and yet the bill potentially imposes liability on the whole 2.2 million. That is a very big and damaging net to catch a few fish, we would contend.


If you are serious about wanting to shut down phoenixing then why, when a business shuts down one day, do you give a tax file number to directors to open up the next day? Would it not just be easier to not give them another tax file number? Where did that idea come from, out of the blue? Do not let them start up again. Your mechanism is so big and so clumsy you do not know who they are. There are not enough rigorous checks. The ACCC has powers already that can prohibit it but they are not exercised. The Taxation Office has powers that can stop this type of practice but it is not exercising them. What does this government do? It continually says the answer is: 'More red tape, more bureaucracy! We'll fix it and we'll go and affect every other small business in the nation.' I say that is wrong because I stand on this side of the House as a small businessman who believes in less government, less interaction, less bureaucracy. Let the punter on the street, the bloke who is trying to drive the prosperity of this nation have a go.


I am not going to support anything that goes towards fraudulent activity where staff liabilities are in question, but please let common sense prevail on phoenixing. You have provisions that already exist to stop phoenixing in its tracks by not giving directors a tax file the very next day when they go to transfer. You are going to affect the lives of 2.2 million businesses, company directors and mechanics; that is the link. Do not think we are chasing the end of top end of town. This affects everyone. It is a bad bill.


This bill would impose liability to all directors, including those of charities and not-for-profit organisations. They are limited by guarantee, as many directors are. Many of these organisations are the lifeblood of the community and should not be placed under unnecessary stress and inconvenience. Overall these bills will punish taxpayers who, in good faith, abide by prevailing laws. This bill is nothing more than a blatant tax grab, an attempt to remedy Labor's erosion of the Australian fiscal position.


The bill represents a number of issues each of which has been examined at length by the House Standing Committee on Economics. The first issue I raised today was in relation to making directors personally liable for unpaid superannuation guarantee amounts to their company employees. I raised the question as to whether directors of companies may be liable for these measures if they join the board after the fact. The government cannot answer this question about if an existing board is in place. Now we are back at the top end of town, and the organisation has been going for 15 or 20 years. 


I go on and take a position on that board and, because of my diligence and my strong governance procedures, I instigate investigations to make sure that we have contingent liabilities for staff entitlements. As a result of those investigations, I find that the company that I have just joined may be negligent in that and I want to remedy it. As a result of this, I am in the tin for the 20 years of liability.


So what is my motivation then as a company director? What is the actual intent of this legislation? It is encouraging me not to say anything, because I am going to be liable for it. Why aren't we promoting good faith for directors to come out and be transparent? Who knows? One of the most important aspects that has been omitted from these bills is that phoenixing activity, and I could go on all day about that. 


According to the Australian Institute of Company Directors, there are some 11,700 companies in Australia that are limited by guarantee. We are talking about charity organisations, grower groups, and businesses that serve the Australian people. As John Colvin from the Australian Institute of Company Directors mentioned in his speech to the parliamentary estimates committee, it targets almost all of Australia's 2.2 million directors including those who volunteer their time to work with charities and community organisations. Mr Coleman also pointed out that following submissions to the parliamentary estimates committee in 2011, the committee recommended the government investigate whether it was possible to amend the bills to better target phoenix activity. Yet the government has made virtually no attempt to target phoenix activity in revising the bill. 


But it has not just been to the economics committee, it has been to a Senate committee. They raised concerns about this part of the bill, and still there is no amendment. It is just typical of Labor's attempt to burden the directors of those companies, even where there was no illegitimate activity, with undue liability. And why, I ask: because the Labor government has no interest in the successful operations of business in Australia.


These bills also look at amending the taxation of financial arrangements provisions, TOFA, to ensure that the tax treatment of financial arrangements that are part of a consolidation event is consistent with the TOFA tax-timing rules. This is both a revenue protection measure and a revenue gain over the forward estimates. These amendments are said to protect a significant amount of revenue over the forward estimates and generate a revenue gain of $253 million over that period.


The consolidation tax cost-setting arrangements and related taxation of financial arrangements are in simple terms retrospective tax changes. The government have failed to justify the retrospective aspect of this legislation. The government describe this measure as 'revenue protection', but have not quantified the amount of tax revenue which would be lost if the tax measure was not passed. That is important—a lot of this stuff is important. The government describe this measure in the bill as 'revenue protection', but have not quantified the amount of tax revenue that would be lost if the measure were opposed. So they are saying that it is not going to have any impact on budget if it goes through, but if it does not go through we are going to have to find some money. I just do not get that part of it.


Retrospective measures can expose taxpayers to penalties when taxpayers could not possibly have taken steps to mitigate the potential for penalties to be imposed. As an opposition and as a coalition, we fundamentally oppose retrospectivity. When you pay your tax bill on 30 June each year, it is fundamentally the security of your business to know that you are clear. What a horrible day it is when you wake up the next day and find that you have got an eight-year tax bill, knowing that in good faith you had paid your tax. This bill is bad for the country. It is bad for business confidence, confidence that is lacking in our market at the moment. Thank you.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (10:56):  In speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 and the package of bills before the House, let me also join with my colleagues, the shadow Treasurer, the shadow minister for finance and those others from this side of the House, who spoke in this debate in reiterating our opposition to these bills. The shadow Treasurer outlined in great detail, schedule by schedule, the deficiencies with this legislation.


In my contribution today I particularly want to focus on one aspect of the legislation that is before the House, which has received some debate this morning and that of course is the schedule that deals with the managed investment trusts withholding tax for foreign investments. The shadow Treasurer this morning outlined some of the government's history on this legislation. He also indicated that the government has tabled an amendment to delete these very schedules this day, so it appears that we are witnessing, apparently—not that the government has said anything discernible at this point—a U-turn in slow motion on this issue. Let us focus on this issue because it says so much about this government's approach to taxation.


In the budget the government announced that it would double from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent the withholding tax for foreign investments for managed investment trusts, and the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance have outlined the great damage that announcement has done already and the flawed nature of that announcement. They have also outlined in great detail how this is completely contrary to earlier actions and statements by the government.


I just said the government 'announced' this in the budget. That is being too generous to the Treasurer. In my cursory look at his budget speech just now, before beginning my contribution to this debate, I could not find any mention of it. On a closer reading maybe there is a word or two there, but I suspect not. I start from the position with this Treasurer that if there is some bad news to announce it will not be in his budget speech. He has got great history on this, of course. This is the Treasurer who refused to name the debt or deficit figures in his budget speech in 2009.


I will take the House through the history of this because it exposes so much: not only the incompetence of those opposite but their complete lack of understanding on matters of taxation. If you go back to the Treasurer's budget speech of 2008, he very clearly outlined the government's plan to cut this particular tax. He said:


Our nation has the potential to be a financial services hub in the Asia-Pacific Region—the fastest growing region in the world. To support this ambition, the Budget begins the process of significantly reducing the withholding tax—


et cetera, et cetera—


to a final rate of 7.5 per cent …


He was quite happy to make great fanfare of it in his speech. That 7½ per cent rate was to be doubled in this year's budget. There is no parallel statement, and it must flow that if the government thought the 7½ per cent rate was so necessary for what they wanted to achieve, a doubling of that rate indicates a change of policy; and if what they said was so important and so beneficial, a doubling of that rate must therefore be detrimental.


Look to the statements of some of those who have spoken in the debate—it is a wonderful thing Hansard, Madam Deputy Speaker, as you know. We have had in this House today a number of those opposite trying to defend the indefensible. My friend the shadow Treasurer was a bit harsh on the member for Blair, who speaks on all of these tax law amendment bills. My friend the shadow Treasurer rightly pointed out that he had not addressed the substance of this issue. I can tell you why: the member for Blair is a good bloke with a bad brief. What this Treasurer has asked those opposite to do is to vote to cut this particular tax to 7½ per cent and then in his budget to double it. They will be able to go around Australia saying, 'We've supported a cut and an increase in the same tax.'


I have said this before in this House and I cannot be sure that every member will know what I am talking about here, but I know the minister at the table will because he has a great understanding of Australian history and a great understanding of sporting history.




Mr Crean:
  I do know what I'm talking about.




Mr TONY SMITH:
  Many years ago when I was a mere kid, and the minister at the table was probably in his 30s, there was an Australian opening batsmen called Graeme Wood. No-one wanted to bat with him because he was famous for saying, 'Go, stop, wait, no, go back!'—and you would always end up standing next to him at one end of the pitch. You see that on tax policy with those opposite.


Let us remind them of their words. The Assistant Treasurer introduced these bills on 24 May announcing the increase in this tax rate, the doubling of it. Let us look at what he said almost four years ago to the day. On Wednesday, 18 June 2008, here is what the now Assistant Treasurer said as a backbencher in the newly minted government who were going to create a financial services hub here in Australia. Talking about the cut to 7½ per cent, he said:


That will be a very clear signal, a marker to global capital that this is the place to invest—that Australia is a country where you are able to invest and you are able to get a reasonable rate of return without being slugged with excessive levels of tax, as may be the case in other jurisdictions.


I regret to inform members opposite that the Assistant Treasurer at the time went further. In introducing the legislation, the member for Prospect and then Assistant Treasurer, now the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, had this to say, again on 18 June 2008, on why the government was cutting the rate to 7½ per cent:


Why did we do that?


Get ready for this. He said:


Because you do not create a financial services hub with tinkering.


What did they do in this year's budget if they didn't cut the rate to 7½ per cent, and they announced they're increasing it to 15, if that's not tinkering, if that's not a doubling, if that's not change? Right back then you had this new government, this new band of brothers, and they were going to cut the rate to 7½ per cent. Now they are doubling it to 15 per cent, and no mention can be found in the Treasurer's speech. I will go on and continue to quote the then Assistant Treasurer:


You do not create a major policy reform by working around the edges. We took the view that if we could give Australia the lowest withholding tax rate in the world this would be a major advance in making Australia the financial services hub of Asia. We took the view that a withholding tax rate of 7½ per cent was an appropriate way to promote Australia as a financial services hub.


Well, you do not have that view now. In the budget it was doubled. It says so much about this government that their approach on these issues creates uncertainty, leverages risk and sends out the message to international investors that this is a government that chops and changes.


Think about what the effect of that budget night announcement was on international investors. They got the message from the new government in 2008: 'Come here because we have a 7½ per cent rate'—and, as the shadow Treasurer said, they invested on that basis. If they were listening to the Treasurer's speech on budget night that would not have mattered but once they digested the detail they discovered that the rate was to be doubled. What impression about tax policy in Australia does that leave in international quarters? Let me be very blunt: it shouts out the message that the government cannot be trusted on tax. It shouts out the message of uncertainty—and uncertainty is toxic in the world environment. It says, 'Whatever this government says, you're at great risk of that tax rate being changed on you retrospectively.'


You do not have to take my word for it; you can take the word of so many commentators. That would take up a lot of time in this House but I do want to quote one because this gives a real world view to those opposite about the effect the government's conduct has created. The shadow Treasurer quite rightly quoted David Denison this morning. David Denison, president and CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board addressed it directly:


In this era of fiscal restraint and additional direct and indirect taxes, we are becoming increasingly concerned that some risks associated with ownership of infrastructure are expanding. For instance, it is easy to envision the regulatory rate setting process becoming politicized instead of objective and fair. The same could occur with taxes—in fact, Australia’s budget that was tabled last week effectively doubled the tax burden on our real estate and infrastructure holdings in that country.


If we conclude that these kinds of risks within any country become significant enough to call into question the predictability and stability of cash flows that are at the heart of the investment rationale for infrastructure, our response will be very quick and rational—we will simply stop investing there.


The shadow finance minister made the point that the member for Blair did not have a lot to say—he had got word that the amendment I mentioned earlier was being tabled. The member for Blair, who speaks on all of these bills, was elected in 2007; he sat there in 2008 and hailed the reduction to 7½ per cent. He voted for it and then on budget night discovered that the 7½ per cent rate was doubled. Those opposite understand—at least the member for Blair does—the impact of this but they have a Treasurer and an Assistant Treasurer who have no idea on these matters.




Mr Baldwin:
  Incompetence personified!




Mr TONY SMITH:
  That does damage. My friend at the table said, 'Incompetence personified'. That raises a very important point: lack of competence in Canberra creates a lack of confidence outside Canberra. (Time expired)

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (11:12):  Once again we stand in this House, less than 24 hours since I last spoke on another piece of legislation that contains retrospectivity and lacks clarity and detail. As the member for Casey has so well pointed out, it adds to the level of uncertainty in our business community about the future direction of tax policy in this country. I will go through this package of bills, the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 and related bills, one by one and have a look at the various schedules.


We fully support some of the ideas contained in this legislation. We have always supported the notion that phoenixing activity should be minimised as quickly as possible because it has lots of deleterious effects on confidence, particularly in the construction industry. I saw that firsthand on many occasions when my father worked as a ceramic tiler. Building companies would close for business on Friday and reopen as a new company on Monday; they would ring him up to work on new projects but had not paid him for the old ones that he was working on in the weeks prior.


We will start with a look at schedule 1. It refers to the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012, which makes directors personally liable for unpaid super. It means directors' penalties cannot be discharged by placing a company into administration and looks to make directors and associates liable for PAYG withholding noncompliance tax where a company has failed to pay. It seeks to expand the application of the director penalty regime and ensure that directors are held to account for their activities. What is important in this legislation is that it is not just about phoenix activities. Once again, we see a failure to clearly articulate what phoenixing activity actually is. The changes are justified in the explanatory memorandum as being part of an attempt to combat phoenix activities. This is the second attempt by the government to make these types of changes. The first attempt was made in the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 8) Bill 2011 and the associated Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2011. An inquiry into these bills by the House Standing Committee on Economics made a bipartisan finding that the provisions in the bills did not add to existing requirements but instead applied a more effective penalty regime to phoenix operators who were abusing the law to obtain an unfair competitive advantage. I do not think there is anyone in this House that would disagree with that notion to achieve that outcome.


However, the committee noted concerns from the business community and its representatives that the bills would potentially apply to a broad range of directors, whether they were engaged in phoenix activity or not. This is the crux of the matter. The committee unanimously recommended that the government should investigate whether it would be possible to tighten the provisions of the bills to better target phoenix activity. After the House economics committee tabled its report, the government withdrew the relevant provisions from those bills, including withdrawing the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill.


The House economics committee has now inquired into the provisions of the package of bills currently before the House. The coalition members of the committee have again found that the measures proposed by the government are not properly directed to or focused on phoenix activity. The coalition members found that the measures were, instead, 'broad based and not targeted' and would impose such onerous obligations that company directors would become more focused on compliance, rather than on performance and running the business.


A particular concern expressed to the committee was the liability that these provisions would apply to board members of charities and other non-profit organisations, and that this liability would act as a disincentive to undertake those roles. When we consider the time and effort that these people put into volunteering their skills and their talents to important charitable institutions in our community, this would be of grave concern. It is a point I would particularly like to emphasise, because in my electorate the not-for-profit community organisations and their volunteers are one of the key pillars of strength. I have no doubt that that would be reflected in many other electorates around Australia, if not all.


The government continues to introduce ad hoc and piecemeal measures to deal with phoenix activity. However, as I have touched on previously, the government has yet to provide a comprehensive definition of what phoenix activity is. It has continually failed to target the measures so that they apply to directors of phoenix companies without imposing onerous new obligations on directors of the vast majority of companies that continue to comply with their legal obligations.


Within the current regulations—within ASIC, within the Corporations Act and within the tax act—there are more than sufficient provisions to prevent those directors from being able to be issued with tax file numbers or re-registered as directors of new companies. As I have touched on previously in this House, it is a matter of enforcing the regulations that are already there—not seeking to impose new levels of regulation because our regulators failed to apply the laws that are already in existence.


I reiterate that the coalition is strongly opposed to fraudulent phoenix activity—and I have already given a personal example of that—and supports all appropriate measures to stamp out this practice. As I said last year in debate on the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures Bill), phoenixing is a cancer that is eating away at the foundation of trust upon which our business community and the broader community are built. It sours relationships and creates a distrust that means people can no longer rely on those they do business with. We remain concerned that the government's approach to this important public policy matter is again confused, ad hoc, piecemeal and not appropriately targeted.


Schedule 2 makes changes to the taxation of financial arrangements provisions, both as a revenue protection measure and as a revenue gain over the forward estimates. These changes apply to consolidated groups and work together with provisions of schedule 3 that have a retrospective impact. It also changes the consolidation tax cost setting arrangements—that is the retrospective component.


As I mentioned last night in the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2011, the coalition is opposed to retrospective taxation changes as a matter of principle. We are opposed to these changes for a number of reasons. Firstly, the proposed changes can change the substance of bargains struck between taxpayers who have made every effort to comply with the prevailing law at the time the agreement was entered into. They can expose taxpayers to penalties in circumstances where taxpayers could not possibly have taken steps at an earlier time to mitigate those potential penalties. Secondly, they may change the tax profile of taxpayers, which in turn can materially impact the financial viability of investment decisions and the pricing of those decisions. Thirdly, they can increase Australia's level of perceived foreign risk. I again make the point that the perception of sovereign risk these days with this government is no longer perceived or real and actual. How can taxpayers be expected to have complied with laws they did not know existed at the time they were supposedly expected to have complied with them?


Earlier today I received an email from a constituent who made the following remarks in relation to the retrospective effect of the proposed cross-border transfer pricing amendment bills debated last night. He said:


The retrospective effect of this legislation is particularly abhorrent because it goes back much longer than tax records are required to be retained.


My understanding of the bill before us today is that the retrospectivity actually goes back 10 years rather than the eight we were discussing last night. He goes on to make the point:


The whole tenor of the bill is predicated on the fact that the courts have ruled on the effect of the law as it is written and have dared not to support a 'policy' position taken by the Commissioner of Taxation. The law is now absolutely clear and the government should accept the ruling of the courts like all other citizens are required to do, or appeal if it thinks it has good grounds.


If these proposed changes were made prospective from the date of announcement, which in the case of the transfer pricing was 25 November 2011, then we would be inclined to support these measures.


Schedule 4 in the outlined bill is proposed to double the withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. We heard this morning that the government will now make changes to this schedule, and we wait with bated breath to hear what they actually are. At the end of the day, we still call on the government to scrap its ad hoc, piecemeal approach to double the tax on managed investment trusts. Our focus should be on encouraging further investment from our foreign counterparts through internationally competitive taxation arrangements so we can grow our economy more strongly.


As all of us in this House well know, we are a nation and an economy that relies on foreign capital to grow and build our economy and our wealth. The first example that springs to mind here is how destructive the world's biggest carbon tax is going to be for competition in this sense. I have spoken with an export business in my electorate that is considering shutting down operations for periods during the year, forcing staff onto annual leave or leave without pay in an effort to stay below the 25,000-tonne threshold for the carbon tax. This is in order to keep them competitive in their export markets against other countries that they compete with, such as the USA.


Getting back to the proposed changes to the managed investment trust withholding tax, as they stand, they would double the managed investment trust withholding tax for foreign investment from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. I will continue on this, despite the fact that the government is proposing changes which none of us have seen. Again, they would be retrospective in that they would apply to all income distributions made after 1 July 2012, irrespective of when the original investment decision was made. In 2008, when the government reduced the rate of withholding tax progressively from 30 per cent to 7½ per cent, the coalition did not oppose that; we actively supported it.


However, at the time, we did express concerns that the reduction was not a genuine reduction for international taxpayers because, through the operation of the double taxation agreements, any reduction in taxation paid in Australia might simply lead to higher taxes being paid in other jurisdictions. At the time, the coalition also expressed concerns that the bill had not been subject to proper scrutiny as the government had not allowed the bill to be considered by the Senate Economics Committee, that Labor's costings of the measure may have been underestimated and that the government had delivered a tax cut to foreigners but had not delivered a tax cut for Australian taxpayers.


It is the government's constant chopping and changing in relation to the withholding tax that is yet again reducing our predictability in the eyes of international investors. If passed, this legislation will undermine Australia's objective of becoming a regional financial services hub in the Asia Pacific. Attracting more foreign investment is as important as ever to achieve stronger economic growth for our future. (Time expired)

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (11:27):  I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. I rise to speak on these budget measures, which are of huge significance to the tourism industry and our ability to ensure the infrastructure pipeline. I have to say that I have never seen a government more out of touch with the tourism industry, one that has so breached trust with the tourism and one that has so failed in basic communication between ministers. I say that because on 2 May this year the government announced a tourism investment guide to market Australian tourism investment to potential foreign investors in Shanghai.


It is true that this government needs to lift their game to attract these investors. For example, they need to restore the Survey of Tourist Accommodation and a comprehensive way to deliver a complete industry-wide performance model. They need to reduce government borrowing, which competes with tourism accommodation providers when they seek finance to improve their properties. They need to set KPIs for Austrade officials around the world to find inward investment, and they need to reduce red tape that currently makes residential property development more attractive than developing tourism accommodation stock.


Despite this, I welcomed the initiative that day and I commended the minister, saying, 'It is a good first step towards improving Australia's accommodation stock.' Depending on which model we assume to be true, we will need to provide somewhere between 30,000 new beds and 70,000 new beds to reach the Tourism 2020 targets. The opposition would help the sector help itself, by properly restoring the Survey of Tourist Accommodation. Under Labor the requirement for small boutique accommodation providers to report guest numbers was scrapped. Hotels and motels offering fewer than 15 beds are not required to report on occupancy.


While this saves the ABS less than $1 million, it means Australia no longer has reliable data on occupancy and no way for bank managers to determine returns on investment sought by providers. Work has begun within the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism to restore reporting, with an online system to replace its expensive and slow phone interview based system. However, important parts of the sector have been dismayed by the lack of industry-wide consultation, by the extended delays in this project and by the government's long-term commitment to the project itself. The exclusion of small accommodation providers from the data capture represents a lost opportunity to establish complete research platforms upon which to base important tourism decisions. The government's prospectus was a totally powerful measure so long as it was part of the broader policy to deal with underinvestment. I was dismayed therefore to learn that, six days after launching its prospectus, the government doubled the tax on international hotel investors. The increase to managed investment trust withholding tax is one of the measures announced in the budget which have set the tourism industry into an absolute spin.


In this budget, the government has directly attack the tourism industry. For example (1) there is no carbon tax compensation for tourism, and this stands to destroy 6,400 jobs, mostly in regional and rural Australia and cut 10 per cent from industry profits; (2) the budget for Tourism Australia has been reduced by 6.2 per cent, which is $8 million in real terms; (3) the passenger movement charge has been increased from $47 to $55 per passenger, and a desire has been expressed to index it by the CPI; (4) $118.1 million in costs for AFP security at airports has been passed on, and these will be passed on to airlines, who will pass them on to tourists; (5) there have been 90 headcount cuts to Customs staff, so increasing tourist waiting times at airports; (6) duty-free concessions have been reduced; (7) the visa label charge will increase by $10; (8) there is a $7 million investment in SmartGates at the same time as the government is cutting $10 million from elsewhere in Customs' budget, and this will take the form of further staffing cuts; and (9) there are tax-loss carrybacks only for companies, and these are limited to two years. Australian Federation of Travel Agents CEO Jayson Westbury says:


If the Government has a budget black hole, it is not reasonable to hit the one industry that provides long term and career based jobs to everyday Australians, who already contribute significantly more than their fair share of taxes.




Mr Bradbury:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the matters to which the member is referring have no relevance to the bills that are being debated.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Grierson
):  Thank you, Minister. I have been listening to the member for Paterson, who has strayed quite a few times from the legislation before us. I would ask him to come back to the legislation.




Mr BALDWIN:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I am exactly on the legislation. Like many on this side of the chamber, I followed proceedings in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics and the questioning by the member for Wright. As that committee learned through testimony and from its publication a week ago of the report by the Allen Consulting Group, the net effect of the MIT bill will be that by 2016 there will be less money for government to spend—$172 million less, in fact—and that there will be reductions of $533 million in household consumption. In short, the tax will wipe out a large proportion of the household discretionary spending that tourism relies on for financial stability.


I am aware of a range of tourism investments threatened by the MIT bill, but I will not add to the pressure already put on developers by disclosing commercially sensitive information and citing individual cases. The Allen Consulting Group report made known to the House economics committee indicates the following: a one per cent increase in the rate of tax reduces the level of investment activity by three per cent; there will be a $1 billion decline in foreign capital results by financial year 2016; there will be a net overall reduction in federal tax revenue—that is, a substantial decline in economic activity will wipe out the entire estimated revenue rise; there will be a $172 million reduction in government spending capacity; 4,640 jobs will be lost; and there will be a reduction in household consumption of $533 million and in GDP of $580 million. The Allen Consulting Group concludes that an increase in withholding tax will be self-defeating. The Property Council of Australia and the Financial Services Council have evidence that the $1 billion decline has already occurred.


In advance of this debate many members will have been sent a copy of the Business Council of Australia's study into Australia's capital project investment pipeline called Pipeline or pipe dream? Securing Australia's investment future. As Business Council of Australia CEO Jennifer Westacott said when launching the study:


The study provides for the first time a total picture of how capital investment is driving the economy, and underlines why policy priorities for a stronger economy must help focus on the delivery of Australia's investment pipeline.


The study highlights how important the effective delivery of major projects will be to the future shape and health of the economy and living standards. The $921 billion pipeline is not assured, and we are becoming a high-cost place to invest.


The government's changes to the managed investment trust taxation, which fly in the face of the week-old Shanghai launch, are prime examples of the ways in which this government is making Australia a poor choice for investors. The BCA launched their report at the Prime Minister's Economic Forum last week. As reported in the media, the Tourism and Transport Forum opted not to attend that event—and they were wise not to do so. The last time they attended a similar event, their Deputy Chair, Ann Sherry, appeared at the future tax summit to advocate accelerated depreciation of assets to drive investment in the sector. The outcome was a budget plan scotched at the last minute to do just the opposite for aircraft. When the Prime Minister was quizzed on the TTF's nonattendance her pat response was to say Labor has been meeting with the tourism sector—and especially the cruise sector—and talking about their needs. Labor has lost all credibility with the cruise sector over two recent decisions. Firstly, where is the Prime Minister's decision to allow Carnival Corporation and P&O Cruises access to Garden Island as an overflow facility? Secondly, Labor completely disregarded Orion Expedition Cruise's very reasonable expectations, which were put to Labor through the shipping reform bills process.


Instead of attending the Prime Minister's Economic Forum, TTF CEO John Lee came to my electorate along with others, including Jayson Westbury, the CEO of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, and John Hart, CEO of Restaurant Catering Australia, to meet with our shadow Treasurer. They and the others who came to speak with the shadow Treasurer about managed investment trust withholding tax and the passenger movement charge know that the coalition will both listen to and act on their concerns. They were reassured by the shadow Treasurer's comments on the need for a stable, predictable and sensible approach to policy. They have seen him respond by arguing the case on managed investment trust withholding tax and the passenger movement charge. These are the two key concerns facing tourism and hospitality out of this year's budget.


With these bills today, the government proposes to add to the cost of hotel management where a property is owned by a managed investment trust. According to Tourism Accommodation Australia, most MIT hotel investment in Australia is from Singapore and Malaysia and feedback from these investors is not good. According to John Lee, CEO of the TTF, the new tax impost in these bills will create instability and uncertainty for specific transactions. He says:


It is bewildering that such a long-considered policy, we understand developed over 2½ to three years, would be changed overnight without consultation or regard for the potential ramifications for the hotel and investment industry.


Minister Ferguson attended the National Tourism Alliance post-budget wrap-up with me the day after the budget was handed down. During the Q&A session he would have heard Rodger Powell of the Tourism Accommodation Association refer to advice from lawyers Baker & McKenzie recommending:


… non-residents holding Australian assets through MIT structures consider whether a MIT remains the appropriate structure for their investments in light of the government's decision.


I received a letter from Mr Powell earlier this week, in which he advises:


MITs are the vehicle through with much of the investment in Australian accommodation occurs. The Government's inconsistency in doubling the tax on MITs at a time when Tourism Australia is broadening its remit by actively seeking foreign investment in the Australian tourism industry is alarming. 


You are, of course, well aware of the need for new investment in accommodation to ensure Australia is able to offer the travel experiences being demanded by our key tourist markets. The only way this can happen is by offering an attracting investment climate.


Mr Powell goes on to further advise that increasing the MIT withholding tax will:


1.Threaten existing projects and deter new investment in accommodation


2. Reduce tax revenue;


3. Damages Australia's reputation amongst foreign investors;


4. Increases Australia's reliance on foreign debt;


5. Undermines Australia's ability to serve as a regional financial hub; and


6. Scare off investors committed to long-term investments.


Of course, Labor will highlight that the rate was 30 per cent under the coalition. However, the Howard government brought down a range of taxes relevant to tourism, whilst creating Tourism Australia and lifting its funding to its highest level.


As my colleague Senator Cormann said on 29 May:


Labor's zig-zag approach to withholding tax on Managed Investment Trusts has also yet again increased Australia's sovereign risk profile.


The Gillard government has yet again managed to reduce the confidence of international investors in the stability and predictability of our taxation arrangements.


More important than the rate per se is the paramount importance that we give to hotel investor confidence in their 10-year investment plans that they will not change on a whim.


Howard had a plan to pay off Keating's $96 billion debt and provide assistance to business and individuals through easing tax pressures. Labor talks good when it comes to help meeting our Tourism 2020 targets which include boosting accommodation growth stock so that we can meet potential growth from China. As former Minister for Tourism Nick Sherry was quoted in a leading tourism industry publication Travel Weekly:


Unlike other sectors of the economy, investment in the broad tourism industry has ""not been particularly good. Tourism Research Australia says investment growth in tourism is lagging behind the rest of the economy,"" Sherry said. ""It's been a struggle to reach investment growth of 2% a year which is insufficient. The stark reality is that there has been no meaningful addition to Australia's accommodation supply for a decade or more.


Sherry was further quoted as saying:


The sad fact is that much of Australia's accommodation is outmoded and outdated and Chinese visitors in particular ... are used to very modern facilities in their own country. There is a great challenge in tourism to invest in the modernisation of facilities.


I urge the House—and particularly those members on the crossbenches to whom the tourism and hospitality industry looks for support—to consider the following facts: tourism's contribution to the Australian gross domestic product was $73.3 billion, or a 5.2 per cent share of the Australian economy. Total gross value added tourism was $69.1 billion, representing a 5.3 per cent share of the Australian economy. In Australia, tourism directly and indirectly employs 907,100 persons, representing 7.9 per cent of total Australian employment, and shrinking. Australians spent 130 million nights abroad in the year 2010. During its peak under the Howard government, Australian tourism made a profit of $3.584 billion. Next year the sector will stand to make a net loss of $8.7 billion. Since 2008, Australia has slipped from fourth to 13th place in the World Economic Forum Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index rankings.


Let us look past the nonsense of this tax. I encourage the government to back down on this, as they are doing on the CPI aspect of the passenger movement charge. They need to understand the industry. They need to work with the industry. You actually create growth and investment by reducing taxes, not increasing taxes, on individuals and companies. That is why this part of the budget is an absolute farce and the Assistant Treasurer sitting opposite should recognise these facts.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (11:41):  Firstly I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. Schedule 1 amends the tax law to better protect workers entitlements to superannuation and to strengthen the obligations of company directors to help prevent fraudulent phoenix activity. The failure to withhold tax and pay superannuation amounts impacts all aspects of the economy. These amendments aim to ensure that compliant businesses and employees are not being disadvantaged by companies that fail to meet their obligations. Those opposite will say that they oppose this bill because the director penalty regime can apply to all directors whose companies fail to meet their obligations. What they fail to recognise, and what they fail to admit, is that the existing regime has applied this way for pay-as-you-go obligations since 1993 and for the entire time that they were in government. 


It is no surprise, of course, that those opposite are willing to come into this place and to vote against a bill that seeks to protect workers' entitlements. We know that they are not interested in the superannuation of hardworking Australians. They opposed superannuation when it was first introduced and the now Leader of the Opposition is on the Hansard as having said that compulsory superannuation was the biggest con job ever foisted on the Australian people. They are strong words.




Mr Hockey:
  Why are we keeping it?




Mr BRADBURY:
  The member opposite says, 'Why are we keeping it?' Well, one may well ask why they have so vociferously opposed this government's efforts to increase the superannuation entitlements of working people. Of course, we know that they have opposed and have voted against our plans to increase superannuation to 12 per cent. This for a 30-year-old worker on an average wage, under our reforms, will mean that they will retire with an extra $100,000 of retirement savings. And it should come as no surprise to any of us that, once again, we have the opposition, the member for North Sydney and his colleagues, coming into this place opposing workers' entitlements. 


I note that there are some references in the Australian Financial Review today to a speech that was given by Liberal senator, Senator Sinodinos, who has indicated that changes to industrial relations are on the coalition's agenda.




Mr Hockey:
  They're on your agenda, too!




Mr BRADBURY:
  The member opposite who interjects and protests so loudly was the handmaiden, the one who was left carrying the baby when it came to delivering and inflicting the pain upon the Australian working community that Work Choices ultimately delivered. 


They are the party of Work Choices. They come in here and they want to vote against workers' superannuation entitlements.




Mr Baldwin:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The same minister who stood up and asked me to be relevant to the debate has now strayed so far from the debate that I ask you to bring him to the point. Or does he not understand his own bills?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Murphy
):  There is no point of order. The member for Paterson was heard in silence—




Mr Baldwin:
  That is not true.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  In the time I have been in the chair he was heard in silence. The member for Paterson will desist from interjecting and the Assistant Treasurer will be heard in silence.




Mr BRADBURY:
  The bill very specifically and very clearly goes to the protection of superannuation entitlements of working people. That is what those opposite are voting against. They are voting against protections that we want to put in place that will ensure that a regime is in place that provides some accountability with respect to the provision of superannuation entitlements. 


It is a shameful thing. I can understand why the member for Paterson does not want to accept the fact that that is what he is voting against. When he was talking about the bill he preferred to focus on other parts of the bill. But it is no surprise that the opposition come into this place and launch a further attack on the entitlements of working people.


Schedule 2 of the bill amends the taxation of financial arrangements, the TOFA regime, to ensure that the tax treatment of joining/consolidation events is consistent with the TOFA tax-timing rules and that financial assets and financial liabilities are treated symmetrically.


Schedule 3 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to modify the consolidation tax cost-setting rules. The changes are necessary to take away unexpected retrospective benefits arising from amendments to the consolidation regime that were made in 2010. There is an important point to make. Amendments were made in 2010 that provided retrospective benefits. These amendments merely recognise the fact that unanticipated and unintended benefits flowed from those amendments. It is widely recognised that it is appropriate to correct it to ensure that a more balanced outcome is achieved. 


These changes demonstrate the government's commitment to maintaining equity, fairness and integrity of our tax system. The changes implement recommendations made by the Board of Taxation for future consolidations and will ensure that companies inside consolidated groups do not receive tax benefits that companies outside consolidated groups are unable to receive. Following extensive consultation, the changes affecting a corporate acquisition will depend on the time when the acquisition took place.


The changes affecting corporate acquisitions that took place before 12 May 2010 are necessary to ensure deductions are claimed only when it was intended and to protect a significant amount of revenue that would otherwise be at risk. Changes for the period between 12 May 2010 and 30 March 2011 will largely protect taxpayers who made business decisions on the basis of the current law, before the Board of Taxation was asked to review the law. For corporate acquisitions after 30 March 2011, the changes will increase certainty for taxpayers and will implement the board's recommendation to apply a business acquisition approach in certain cases.


Those opposite talk about these changes to the consolidation regime, going back to the start of the regime in 2002. They say that they will oppose this bill, because taxpayers were right to act based on the law at that time. This reveals their complete ignorance about what these changes are actually doing. What they fail to understand is that under the law at the time, between 2002 and 2010, taxpayers could not claim immediate deductions for what were essentially capital items, such as goodwill. The 2010 amendments changed this position. What we are now doing is taking away the unanticipated and unintended windfall gains arising from those changes. In fact, this bill confirms that consolidated groups will still be able to claim more deductions for those years between 2002 and 2010 than they would have been able to under the law as it stood when the coalition were last in government.


Schedule 3 to this bill removes unintended windfalls from the 2010 changes that would provide consolidated groups with inappropriate tax benefits, benefits that are not available to companies and small businesses outside the consolidation regime.


Taxpayers who did act on the law at the time, between 2010 and March 2011, are largely protected. Taxpayers who have written advice from the tax office or who have already finalised their tax returns are also protected. We are acting appropriately to protect the integrity and fairness of the tax system and to remove these unintended windfall gains.


It is true that we need to backdate these changes to the start of their respective regimes. The government never takes lightly the decision to make retrospective changes but there are circumstances where retrospective legislation is justified. The Board of Taxation said that the 2010 changes went much further than was intended and the Australian parliament rightly considers each proposal for retrospective legislation on its merits. Like this case, this is generally only done where the law is operating in a manner inconsistent with the parliament's intention and where there is a significant risk of revenue loss. The revenue at risk here from these unintended windfalls is definitely significant. This bill protects over $6 billion of revenue at risk. To demonstrate the lack of credibility of the opposition on this question of retrospectivity: they seek to come into this place and, whiter than the snow, suggest that they have never supported, and they never will support, retrospective legislation, particularly in the tax context. Do not have a look at what they say; have a look at what they did when they were in government. They introduced numerous measures, many of which were backdated by up to several years, in order to go back and ensure that the original intent of a policy was actually delivered, and there were numerous examples. This particular bill also seeks to protect the rights of working people, which they are seeking to oppose. In the very same week when these matters are being debated, when they come in and say that they never support retrospective legislation, when they have done that in the past, their New South Wales Liberal colleagues are supporting retrospectively ripping away the entitlements of workers with changes to the workers compensation scheme in New South Wales. So retrospectivity is something that they say they oppose, but when they were last in government they embraced it, where it was appropriate or where they deemed it to be appropriate, and in New South Wales this week we see them retrospectively ripping away the rights of working people. Do not listen to what they say; look at what they do.


I will also be moving an amendment to remove schedule 4 to the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012, which will be introduced into parliament at a later date. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (13:45):  Last Sunday I attended the Marist College Eastwood 75th anniversary mass at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney. The college's principal, Daniel Delmage, was most welcoming as parish priests and local representatives joined current and former students and parents and staff to celebrate the great history of this important local school. Most poignantly, the attendance list included Father Jim Maloney, the first of 107 students to enrol in the college when it opened its doors in 1937.


Since this time, the school has grown in physical size, in student numbers and in acclaim within the local community. By 1970 there were 900 students enjoying a high level of academic education as well as a dynamic syllabus including religion, art, science and music. The modern and contemporary learning centres in Eastwood today would make the college founders very proud.


As a Catholic school in the Marcellin tradition, the school is deeply rooted in its history and conscious of its dutiful purpose. The school also enjoys the service of lay teachers and administrators and has operated under lay leadership for the past 25 years.


I congratulate Marist College on its achievement in educating more than 5,000 young men over the past 75 years and producing an enviable quantity and quality of leaders of our local community. One of these leaders is Victor Dominello, the New South Wales Minister for Citizenship, Communities and Aboriginal Affairs.

3 MS OWENS: To move:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) after almost 12 long years of inaction by the former Australian Coalition Government, the current Australian Labor Government has delivered historic pension reforms that have provided increases of $154 per fortnight for max-rate single pensioners and $156 per fortnight for max rate pensioner couples;


(b) the NSW Government increased public housing rents for pensioners in 2011, taking away some of the Australian Government's 2009 pension increase;


(c) the Australian Government is delivering extra assistance to millions of Australian pensioners through the Household Assistance Package;

",HoR,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Marine Conservation</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,18,1
"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2012-06-20,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (15:20):  The government's unilateral decree to lock up another 1.3 million square kilometres of our seas, more than doubling the number of marine reserves from 27 to 60, has nothing to do with sustainably managing marine environments or fisheries. It is just another empty gesture for the environment; but it is certainly a cruel barb for many coastal regions. This has a lot more to do with hooking a few Greens preferences at the next election or renting the Greens support for another week in this parliament than it has to do with anything about the environment—and that is the real catch. But it has real consequences for Australian commercial and recreational fishers and the regional communities which support them.


When 'lock it up!' is the government's approach to vast areas of Australia's territorial waters, is it any wonder that our supermarkets are overflowing with imported seafood? It is a remarkable fact that Australia imports a massive 72 per cent of the seafood we eat. For a vast island nation surrounded by sea, that is simply bizarre. We control much of the area of the planet's oceans. Australia's exclusive economic zone in terms of sheer scale is third in the world behind only the United States and France, yet we are not allowed to feed ourselves with our own fish. There is no doubt, of course, that we must conserve our oceans and be conscious of the breeding grounds and the seasons so that they can be sensibly harvested. Indeed, to swim or snorkel or dive on the Great Barrier Reef is one of the truly remarkable experiences of life. The wonders of our oceans and the reefs are truly awe-inspiring and they must always be preserved. Our fishing industry understands this only too well and is at the forefront of managing sustainable fisheries. Our recreational fishers and our marine tourism industries understand that the value of their entire industry is dependent upon having a sustainable environment, but they have been ignored.


The government's claim of consultation is a sham. Nor has there been any attempt to justify these new parks on the basis of science or transparent evidence. At no stage has there been fair dinkum feedback or a willingness to listen to the communities. Rather we have seen bureaucrats descend on communities and lecture people about what to expect. They have not been genuinely engaged in taking on board industry or recreational fishers or community concerns. In reality, the government has no appetite to negotiate on the details of its marine parks decree. The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has presented it to the people, the businesses and the community as a fait accompli, saying to take it or leave it. There is supposed to be a 60-day consultation period but in his media release on 14 June 2012 the minister said:


It's too late for people to say I want this line shifted or I want this zone painted a different colour.


The question now is very straightforward: do we go ahead with the most comprehensive marine park network in the world or do we not? 


Minister, is there going to be a genuine consultation period or is there not? If your press release is be relied upon, then the issues are all closed, and the government is not going to even listen to the concerns of people who are affected.


The extension of Australia's system of marine reserves according to the Pew Environment Group is a consequence:


… of a determined coalition of 15 Australian and international conservation groups …


This coalition was made up of  almost half foreign groups, funded from overseas and doing very little in their own countries sometimes about creating environmental and sustainable fisheries, but seeking to impose upon Australia an enormous addition to our environmental reserves.


Between them these sorts of people are opposed to virtually every element of human existence. They want to ban wild catch fisheries, yet they oppose virtually every aquaculture application that is ever proposed. They do not want us to eat meat, they do not want us to use farmed animals and they do not want us to harvest native animals. They do not want us to grow crops because crops might use water or fertiliser or chemicals. Well, what are we expected to live on in this country if every hectare of sea and of land is to be declared a national park? 


Over the last 30 years Australia has led the way in developing management plans for the sustainable use of our fishery resources. Since the introduction of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, all Commonwealth fisheries have been required not only to guarantee the sustainability of the targeted fisheries but also to ensure the sustainability of the impact of removing target stock on other species. This might be the impact of predators of that stock or the impacts of bycatch populations. A comprehensive investment by Australia in the use of bycatch reducing devices and innovative fishing practices to eliminate the interaction of iconic non-target species like sea birds, turtles and seals have now been adopted and recognised around the world as the best sustainable fishing practice.


We do not see the propaganda of the Labor government and the Greens showing images of whiting or flathead or prawns. Instead we have pictures of seals, manta rays, turtles and seahorses. No-one in the scientific community would suggest that these are being exploited by Australian fisheries or that they are at risk in any Australian jurisdiction. The reality is the Australian people were taken aback when the government chose its location for this great announcement. It was an aquarium with a backdrop of stingrays and coral and conveniently passing turtles. These species are not at threat. It will be no surprise to both coastal communities and recreational fishers that they have never targeted any of these creatures by their activities.




Mr Perrett:
  It is hard to get a camera through to the Coral Sea.




Mr TRUSS:
  If you go to the Coral Sea declaration, the eastern boundary of the declared closure adjoins waters that are heavily finished by foreign fishing vessels. We know that the presence of Australian vessels is something of a deterrent to fleets targeting our fish in our own waters. That has to be the case because the government has so downgraded surveillance of our fisheries that there is going to be no-one there to actually supervise and ensure that other countries simply do not take up the fish that we are seeking to preserve. With the level of surveillance we have on our waters at the present time, the only vessels that will be fishing in these new marine reserves will be those who are not Australian. Other vessels will simply come in and take the fish that we have nicely fattened up for them in our reserves and they will sell them on around the world. The government cannot have a credible reserve policy unless it also has an appropriate surveillance policy. 


For as long as I can remember, I have been listening to claims by environmental extremists that the Great Barrier Reef is being destroyed, it is being ruined. They claim the crown-of-thorns starfish destroyed the whole Barrier Reef at least five times a year, if you listen to the media. The coalmining is going to destroy the reef, the ships running aground have destroyed the reef—all 2,000 kilometres of it. Captain Cook ran aground there. That must have destroyed the reef as well. The farmers, of course, are always destroying the reef with chemicals and fertilisers. The tourists destroy it, the dams and the urban development destroy it. The droughts, when there is not enough water for it, destroy it. When there are floods, it gets destroyed again. If you listen to the environmental groups, the Great Barrier Reef has been destroyed every year. You know, when I visit the reef, it is just as beautiful. magnificent and awe-inspiring as it has ever been—a true wonder of the world that needs to be looked after and needs to be carefully managed. But what this government is doing is in fact damaging the capacity to manage that area rather than enhancing it. 


We all know that the Coral Sea declaration is not about protecting the environment; it is about green votes. In May 2009 the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts used emergency provisions in the EPBC Act that gave him the ability to declare a conservation zone. 


The conservation zone provisions are meant to provide emergency protection over an area—protection from some sudden, unexpected, emergent threat—to give the minister some breathing space to consider what long-term protection might be needed. This move was a clear and obvious abuse of the act. There was no emerging threat. There was none. There were no applications for new fishing licences, no applications for mining. There was nothing. The minister did not even try to make one up. He just abused the act.


According to marine scientist Professor Ray Hilborn, from the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington, the motives for non-government organisations going into denial about the fisheries management in Australia are deplorable. He recognised our fisheries management as the best in the world. I have heard the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities proudly boast that our fisheries management is the best in the world and I agree with him. But Australia has been subject to a relentless antifishing campaign that is causing the doom and gloom myths from misrepresentations of overseas examples of inadequate fisheries management. 


Hanging up a 'no-fishing' sign over so much of Australia's coastline is just another stunt so the Prime Minister can laud herself at the United Nations Rio Plus 20 conference in Brazil this week. She is now tired of lecturing Europeans on economic management. After all, with her $174 billion deficits, she does not have much to boast about. On fisheries management we do have a lot to boast about, but the Prime Minister is going to overlook that and instead look to the massive increase in areas that are being locked up around Australia's coastline. 


As I said before, we import 72 per cent of the seafood we eat, despite having one of the largest fishing zones in the world. In 2009-10 Australia produced 171,000 tonnes of seafood from wild catch. These statistics are stunning. By comparison, New Zealand's catch was 441,000 tonnes, from an area half as big as Australia's. They caught three times as many fish in an area half the size. Thailand catches 14 times more fish than we do, despite having a fishing area 10 times smaller than ours. So it is not hard to see that the government's marine park declarations have nothing to do with environmental management of our seas. We are exporting our demand for seafood to countries less concerned about marine management than we are. Australia harvests fewer than 30 kilograms of fish per square kilometre of its ocean territory, compared to a global average 20 times greater than that, at around 750 kilograms per square kilometre.


So we are not raping and pillaging our fisheries. There is no-one in the world that can match our management record, but there is a human cost. About 100,000 people are still left directly employed in the Australian fishing industry and 3.4 million people engage in recreational fishing each year. Senator Conroy confirmed in the Senate on Monday that these parks will have a significant impact on the recreational fisheries. In fact, recreational fishermen, in an area inside 100 kilometres from shore, will be shut out of a staggering 63,000 square kilometres. So the reality is that this will have an effect on fishermen, their families and their communities.


Labor is penalising the wrong people. Australian fishers have been doing the right thing, going about their business in a sustainable and environmentally conscious way. Now, all they are going to be offered is some more compensation. Some of these people have already had several lots of compensation. They have been moved from place to place. I acknowledge that sometimes it was at the hands of our government. But at least under our government $250 million worth of compensation was supplied—not that that was much comfort to the families who had been so adversely affected.


But this government is now offering only about a third of that amount of compensation—we are told $100 million—and yet the area to be affected is vastly greater. It is clear that there will not be decent compensation available to all those fishermen affected, let alone to the communities around Australia which have been adversely affected.


This is a policy response that is in search of a problem. The problem is not that Australian's waters are overfished. We harvest only 30 kilograms of fish per square kilometre. The global average, as I said before, is 20 times greater. We import so much of the fish that we eat. We are now going to import it from fisheries that do not have the standards of management that we have in this country. So, please, Minister, do not respond flippantly. Many families and businesses are affected. Some have already been hurt many times. The majority of fishermen have already left the industry, but there are many who will want to continue to work in this industry. We should certainly not be expected to continually increase our reserve areas just because environmentalists demand more and more and more.

"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (15:35):  It is a pleasure to be here today and have the opportunity to respond to the MPI from the member for Wide Bay. I think there are some very useful things I could do elsewhere, but it is always a pleasure to be here with you. You get about as much sunshine in the meeting room over there as I expect you do in a meeting room over here, but it is a pleasure to be here in tropical Canberra.


I want to deal with a few issues at the start that were raised by the member for Wide Bay. First of all, the claim that there is a lack of a scientific basis for the work that is being undertaken is more than a little bit silly. The member for Wide Bay, Leader of the Nationals, may well presume that the document I held up in question time, I think, two days ago with a photograph of the member for Wentworth in it is the only document underpinning the science as the basis for the decisions that are in front of us. Of course, the document that I held up was in relation to the scientific work that had been undertaken only on the south-west marine region. But similar volumes have been done, all of which are available publicly for the east marine region, the north marine region and the north-west marine region. We then had the additional drafts for consultation, which have been done across the north-west, north, south-west and temperate east regions. You cannot judge quality of science by the kilo, but it is a lot more than what the member for Wide Bay was wanting to claim in terms of scientific underpinnings.


At the core of the argument that the member for Wide Bay has put—and I think it is important for us to deal with this directly—is a presumption that this is a fisheries management decision. The member for Wide Bay knows full well and he would not have to talk to the member for Wentworth for very long to understand that this is not a fisheries management decision; it is not done for those purposes. The science underpinning it is not done that way—in the same way as the science you do when you determine where a national park will be is different from the science you do when you work out whether or not a state forest is being overharvested. It is the exact same principle. You have your overharvesting rates in a state forest, where you know how hard you can go to make it work sustainably. That is how our fisheries are managed, and our fisheries are managed under those methods very, very well.


If you do not have a policy belief that there is a value in having some areas of our land and of our oceans preserved as national parks then you would never support the sort of science on which this is based. But if you have a view, which most Australians do have, that there is actually value not in having the whole country as state forests but in having some areas reserved as national parks, in picking some areas that you reserve for nature—if you see value in that—then that is where you get the difference in the scientific underpinnings of this. You could run an argument that says, 'But the Royal National Park could be sustainably harvested,' and there would be a pace at which you could do it. But you would wreck something pristine and magnificent, and you would do something that Australians do not believe ought to happen. That is the principle. That is the basis of the decisions that have been made with respect to our oceans.


I do have to remind the Leader of the Nationals when he talks about how close in these areas are with respect to—



Mr Ian Macfarlane interjecting—




Mr BURKE:
  The desperation from the member for Groom really says it all. Please do not remind us how far out these areas are. If you are in Airlie Beach, to get to one of the new areas of protection you have to travel for 340 kilometres. If you are in Brisbane, you have to travel for 445 kilometres. If you are in Bundaberg, you have to travel for 492 kilometres before you get to a place where you cannot drop a line. I had a question yesterday from the member representing the area of Darwin, the member for Solomon, where the distance to get to the nearest spot where you cannot drop a line is 680 kilometres. We had photographs in the West Australian—which I am sure delighted members of the opposition—when the maps were put out which showed people casting a line from the beach, with a headline as to how people were going to be denied access to fishing. Now I know there are people who can cast a line a fair way, and I have checked: the world record goes just under 250 metres. But if you went out as far as the longest cast can go and you kept going and you kept going and you kept going, after about 30 casts off the Western Australian coast, you may well get to an area where it is a problem to drop a line. On the Queensland coast, you are looking at a massively greater distance. So, please, do not pretend that for the ordinary recreational fisher they are somehow locked out of fishing. The Leader of the Nationals talked about a no-fishing sign up on our coastline—on our coastline! Unless he has some concept that when you stand on the coastline you are actually looking at something that far beyond the horizon then the argument is misleading in the extreme, and the Leader of the Nationals knows it.


There have been some issues raised. Some members of parliament who have game-fishing tourism operations in their electorates have questioned to what extent these could have an impact within the Coral Sea, because I have added a number of reefs—Osprey, Vema, Shark, Bougainville and Marion reefs—to what was originally in the draft maps. I would ask members to have a think about what sort of fish those game-boat operators go out to catch, because they do not go out travelling and powering out for more than a day in order to catch the reef fish that they could have caught in fishing zones in the Great Barrier Reef. If they are going all that way out, then they are going out for the big pelagic fish; that is what they are going out for—chasing the marlin and those sorts of tours. Have a look at the maps. With the exception of Bougainville Reef and the northernmost end of Osprey Reef, when you look at the rest of the maps you will see that the shape of the highly protected zone follows very close in, within the contours of the reef. And the recreational fishing organisations understand this. Some of the game-boat operators have been told things that are false, but if they go through the maps they will see that. Bougainville is different; Bougainville has been done in a square. But that is a much smaller reef than the others and not a particular spot where you have tourism operations. But if you actually have a look at how the maps have been drawn for those big pelagic game-fishing operations, they have not been drawn in a way that will cause any challenges for them in being able to have those fishing tours. They will not be able to go to the key dive sites where the areas are further out because, once you do get a few hundred metres away from the reef, at those points, you are much less likely to catch a big pelagic fish. But, as you get further south on Osprey and as you go through Shark, Vema and down to Marion, you do get close enough that those tours will still be able to run. There has been a lot of misinformation given to those individual businesses. But all I would say is: for the best evidence, go and have a look at the maps themselves.


I was asked in question time today, and it is relevant to now: 'What are the views of the different organisations?' I was asked for just one. I thought Peter Lindsay was not a bad one, as someone who was as representative as somebody could be within this parliament, but I accept the criticism that the Liberal-National Party is not a representative organisation. I fully accepted the point of order that was taken.


So let us look at some of the people who actually live in those electorates. Col McKenzie, the deputy director of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators said:


I am sure there are some fishing charter operators who will be concerned . . . but it will actually improve tourism generally from the fact it will increase Australia’s profile overseas, particularly among high-end tourists who have high environmental awareness.


Chris Makepeace, Executive Officer of the Amateur Fishermen's Association of the Northern Territory said, 'Basically, there is virtually no impact for recreational fishermen in the Northern Territory, and that is good news.' Paul Anderson, Eurobodalla Shire Council General Manager, said the changes were not likely to have a big impact on recreational fishing in the area. Darren Kindleysides of the Australian Marine Conservation Society said: 'This is a landmark announcement for our seas and one of the most significant advances for environmental protection in Australia's history.' Daniel Gschwind, the Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief, said: 'Most concerns on better protection of reefs, dive sites and game boat access had been met and this was welcome.' Then there is Tony Lagana, manager of the Bermagui Fisherman's Co-op, and this is from the commercials. He said:


It is a good outcome for the far south coast (of NSW). We have had a lot of discussion with the government and Tony Burke has done a great job for Bermagui.


That is my favourite of the quotes!


We are dealing with an opposition that dearly wants to run a line that you can no longer go to the end of a jetty and drop a line. The problem is that in Australia we do not have jetties that long. In Australia we do not have jetties that go for the full length of a state border. We do not have jetties in Australia that reach these sorts of waters—and most wreck fishers never get out to these waters at all. The ones who do, if they are in a commercial operation, are chasing the large pelagic fish that they will still be able to access everywhere other than at the principal dive sites.


No matter how many times the National Party try to dress this issue up as though it is something about minor parties in this parliament, make no mistake, environmental protection for more than three decades has been a cornerstone of what Labor does. We do not need to feel there is some sort of pressure from any other party in this place. The Greens, let us not forget, were critical of these proposals when they came out.


What we have here is something proudly in the Labor tradition of environmental reform. We do not need to feel that there is some sort of pressure out there. This is what Labor does—in the tradition of the party that saved the Franklin, in the tradition of the party that saved the Daintree and in the tradition of the party that protected Coronation Hill and made sure that we expanded Kakadu National Park. Every time we did one of those things, those opposite ridiculed it and those opposite opposed it—every single time. When we said we were going to protect the environment, those opposite said: 'It will be a disaster and you can't do it.'


They have done this every time, without exception. When it was the Franklin, they said no. When it was the Daintree, they said no. When it was Kakadu, they said no. We now talk about being the world leader on protection of the oceans, and what did they say? No. That is the only way they ever respond to environmental reform. Then they will come up with some sort of plan at election time where, in a few suburbs here and there, they will go around planting a whole lot of trees—and that apparently makes them good environmental warriors!


The public is onto the con. The public realises the environmental vandalism that lies at the heart of the arguments put by those opposite. The public understands that, effectively, the view of the oceans put by those opposite is that they should do less than what happened under the Howard government. The arguments they put forward mean the member for Wentworth would never have taken action in the south east at all. It would have been done on the basis of fisheries management, which effectively means the entirety of our oceans get run as though they are nothing more than a water version of a state forest.


This side of the parliament understands there is essential value in some parts of our planet being pristine. We have an understanding that Australians—as a nation of people who not exclusively but overwhelmingly live along our coastline—share a relationship with our oceans and they value them being protected. To establish a national parks estate in our oceans is something sufficiently good that Labor stands here and does it. It is something sufficiently right that Australia has no hesitation, under a Labor government, of being the world leader. It is something which those opposite know strikes a chord with Australians—sufficiently strongly that not one of them has said they have the guts to undo it. So they are playing the same old pattern.


Did they, when they got into government, try to undo the Franklin? They made all the noises about it but when it came to it they knew that we were on the right of history. Did they end up revisiting Joh Bjelke-Petersen's ideas to clear-fell parts of the Daintree rainforest to make it a major residential development? They railed against it for years. They are railing against it right now. Did they have the guts to write to the World Heritage Committee and ask for it to be delisted? Absolutely not. Did they then want to turn Coronation Hill back into a uranium mine and undo the work of Kakadu National Park? Not a chance. 


Then we have the crocodile tears they cry right now—all backed up with a campaign trying to make people believe a lie, trying to make wreck fishers believe that there are impacts they know are not there, trying to run an argument that says there will be an impact on commercial fisheries way beyond one to two per cent of the gross value of production. They try to make up every single argument but, at the heart of it, if they believed a word, if they believed that they were on the right side of history with those sorts of mincing words, they would promise to undo it.


Listen to the next speakers. Ask why none of them have done it. Ask why, when it was so important for me to be here this week, not one frontbencher was willing to chance their own to ask a question about it. Why have they put it all off to the backbench and let them run their local stories but not one person from the frontbench put themselves forward? It is because they know the core question to them is: Would you undo it?

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (15:50):  I rise to speak on this matter of very great importance to the public. The widespread proposals for locking up millions of square kilometres of Australia's waters by the environment minister, Tony Burke, is yet another grand-sweeping statement—one of those grand gestures from Labor. In harness with Christine Milne and the Greens, Tony Burke has decided that he, the minister, is going to single-handedly save Australian waters from the marauders.


He has a bit of form in this area. He was previously the minister for agriculture and four years ago he led a delegation to discuss Australia's southern bluefin tuna quotas, along with that other great green warrior, the now education minister, Peter Garrett. He meekly surrendered almost 30 per cent of Australia's tuna quota. He was out of step then and the science was out of step. It was later proved tuna numbers were well and truly on the increase already. Some of that quota has been returned already. This minister was on the wrong side of science then and he is on the wrong side of it again.


We do not know as much about our deep waters in Australia's care as we would like to. In fact, this grand statement has the possibility of becoming another monument to the government like the Building the Education Revolution or even perhaps the Prime Minister's own favourite, Medicare Gold—you might remember that one—or pink batts. In fact, there are many in the industry who maintain that this park declaration is the new live cattle dispute.


The focus has been on the Coral Sea, and I will briefly touch on that before I get to South Australian waters. Walter Starck, from the Townsville based Australian Environment Foundation—and, according to Keith De Lacy, the former Labor Treasurer of Queensland, one of the foremost proponents, one of the greatest experts in this area—has said:


... well-managed reefs around the world can sustain an average seafood harvest rate of 15,000kg per square kilometre per annum. The average harvest rate for the Great Barrier Reef is 9kg. That's right, 9kg, or if you like a minuscule 90g per hectare.


That is really walloping the waters, isn't it? He says further:


Australia has by far the largest per capita fishing zone in the world yet we import two-thirds of our seafood—


In fact, he is not quite correct; I think it is 72 per cent. So we are underperforming in a major way in our Australian waters. We import 72 per cent of our seafood from countries that are overpopulated and are probably overfishing their waters. If the government were really serious about saving fish in the world, they would ban seafood—but I do not see them sticking their hand up for that.


I will turn to South Australia, my home state. My electorate of Grey contains around 70 per cent of the coastline. So, consequently, we have a fair bit of the fishing. The South Australian marine industry and our aquaculture industry are centres of excellence. They are well managed by anybody's standards and, in fact, are recognised around the world for their fisheries management.


The wild catch in South Australia is worth around $300 million per annum and the aquaculture contribution is around $200 million. You might think that is not linked but it is, because the bulk of the aquaculture comes from farmed tuna; in fact, initially wild caught tuna—something I spoke about before with respect to the minister's previous decisions.


It is a very interesting industry. They steam hundreds of kilometres into the Great Australian Bight, where a very sophisticated surveillance system identifies the schools of tuna. The fishermen net them and then drag the tuna hundreds of kilometres back to Point Lincoln where they are grown out in tuna farms. That industry was developed because that fishery, during the seventies, was fished to the point of extinction. At one time fishermen were catching around 40,000 tonnes a year and then it crashed. The fishermen, the industry and the government recognised that we had a serious problem and that is when serious fisheries management was put into place, the farms were established and the industry has recovered. In fact, we have never fished any species in South Australian waters into extinction.


At the same time as the Commonwealth is planning its new parks, in a related matter, the South Australian government have been on the same boat. They have been out there declaring marine parks willy-nilly all over the place. In fact, they wanted to lock up 40 per cent of state waters in marine parks—19 marine parks, 16 of which are in my electorate of Grey. I can tell you that there has been absolute public outrage, and it is being reignited by the Commonwealth's grab for an enormous patch of water around Australia. The public outrage has forced the state government back to the renegotiation process—back to the drawing board. The Australian Marine Alliance CEO, Dean Logan, has said South Australia will be hit by a double whammy with state and federal marine parks joining up.


I told you a bit about the tuna. Let me tell you about another fishery on my patch, and that is the South Australian Spencer Gulf prawn fishers. There are 39 boats operating in this industry and they turn around about $40 million a year. They are in state waters, but this is one of the best managed fisheries in the world. I have been on board these prawn trawlers. With every drag of prawns they deliver on deck, they report back to the fleet commander on the size and the quantity they have managed to fish in that area and, as soon as the size drops, they pull out of the area; as soon as the quantity drops, they pull out of the area. This is incredibly sophisticated and well managed, and it has industry backing. This is the kind of management we see across South Australian waters, and the fishing is not under pressure at any point. The rock lobster industry is well managed and the abalone industry is well managed.


The minister was just on his feet a few minutes ago telling us that the new parks are not about fish; this is not about fisheries management. Well what on earth is it about? Once you get into these off-coast waters, no-one else goes there. It is only the commercial fishermen. These are the industries that sustain Australia.


I do not think in many cases we fully understand what is in these waters. Let me tell you another thing about the tuna industry: the tuna's food once in the fish farms is pilchards. We import most of our pilchards, for crying out loud. A pilchard industry has been established near Point Lincoln. Because of the price of imported pilchards, they can only afford to steam around 150 kilometres before they return to Port Lincoln. Going further—to 200 kilometres—it starts to become too expensive to harvest them.


Around 10 or 12 years ago we had an enormous kill-off of pilchards. They virtually disappeared from our waters. This was a great calamity. No-one knew what caused it, but there was this enormous kill-off of pilchards and we wondered how quickly stocks would recover. It recovered in about four months. You could not find a pilchard in the water, and four months later they were back again. There is only one explanation for that: it is actually part of a far, far bigger fishery than was previously understood. That has not led to a greatly expanded pilchard fishery as yet because of the economic concerns that I outlined. But it shows us that we do not fully understand what fish species and what numbers are in these areas that the minister wants to now lock up and make sure that no-one ever even finds out. When it comes to compensation, the South Australian industry has lodged a claim against the South Australian government for $500 million worth of damage for losses due to the state marine parks. The federal minister has said, 'Well, $100 million will be enough for all of Australia.' In fact, the estimate is—this is Dean Logan again—40 times that amount, around $4 billion.


I would like to read a little bit from Brian Jeffriess, who fronts up the tuna fishermen's association, but is a good spokesman for a lot of South Australian fisheries. He said:


… The Government has acted very logically in fisheries management up until now - this was never required, … What is symbolic about this is in the minister's statement itself - all this about the biggest and best, the biggest and best in the world and you have to believe that's what it's about, beating your chest in front of the rest of the world rather than good ecosystem management.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (16:00):  It is with great enthusiasm that I rise to speak on this matter of public importance put forward by the Leader of the Nationals, Mr Truss, on the adverse impact on fishing and coastal communities of the government's marine reserve declarations. I deliberately wanted to read out the title, because anyone listening to the previous speakers from the Liberal-National Party coalition would notice that they have not actually touched on that at all. They have been spinning a yarn and trying to engage politically, but they are not actually going to the respected science in this whole process and the actual consequences.


Let us get a bit of the history on the record straightaway. This process has been underway since Prime Minister Paul Keating was in the Lodge. Since then, there was a Liberal-National Party coalition in government for 12 years. They oversaw the same process, the same regime, the same science and the same process in terms of compensation. So let's get the facts on the table right from the start.


We have had crazy suggestions in question time from, I think, the member for Dawson, that there are no collective groups that actually support this process. I just looked through my Courier Mail—I do actually read the Courier Mail, the paper of record in the great state of Queensland. It is worth having a look at it, because there is a full-page ad from 19 and 20 May—



Mr Ian Macfarlane interjecting—




Mr PERRETT:
  I will not take that interjection from the member for Groom. It is a full-page ad that says 'It is time to protect Australia's Coral Sea'. If you had been reading the Courier Mail, you would have seen it. This is by Gary Heilman from DeBrett seafood and on behalf of the longline fishermen in the Coral Sea. It is cosigned by Daniel Gschwind, the CEO of Queensland Tourism Industry Council, and Mike Ball from Mike Ball Dive Expeditions. So the reality is there has been a great consultation process overseen by the Keating, Howard, Rudd and Gillard governments.


Why is it important to get the facts on the table upfront? Because the reality is that, when it comes to protecting the environment—something we take very seriously as parliamentarians—when you strip out the politics, both sides of the chamber in Australian politics respect the environment and do our bit.


Australia is a nation where most of us have come from across the sea. Our roots go across the sea; 98 per cent of Australians have roots stretching across the sea. We know that the ocean is important. Australia is responsible for 11 per cent of the world's surface—an incredible amount of the world that we look after. We are a trading nation, so we understand how important it is to make sure that we have good connections with the rest of the world but we also know how these opportunities to protect the environment only come along every now and then. We heard the environment minister, Minister Burke, talk about those great moments in history—the Franklin, and those other ones—where people made decisions. I seem to recall it was actually the environment minister, Mr Newman, the father of Campbell Newman, the Queensland Premier, who actually took on Joh Bjelke-Petersen over something called Fraser Island, and said: 'No, Joh, you've got it wrong. You don't just strip-mine the lot. We are actually going to protect this significant piece of Australia.' That is the approach to significant blocks of earth of Australia that can only have certain biodiversity. You protect it for our children. So thank goodness that the environment minister, Mr Newman, had the courage to stand up to Joh Bjelke-Petersen. This is our chance to be that brave and protect the planet.


I was up at the War Memorial yesterday laying a wreath with a veteran of the Coral Sea—Hollyoak was his name. When you have the RSL, the French government through New Caledonia, the Howard government and the Labor Party all on the same ticket, it takes a special Leader of the Opposition to break that unity ticket. When you can get the French and the RSL and the Labor Party and the Howard government all on the one page, and then get Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, to come in and break ranks with that unity ticket, that is a special knack; that really is incredible.


Why is that? Let's have a look. Let's go back to the 2010 election and Senator Boswell's duplicitous campaign in Queensland. It was a very sneaky, quick campaign that we did not have a chance to rebut. It did not get a lot of traction in Moreton; that is why I am here telling you the truth. Perhaps in Bonner it did get a little bit more traction. Thankfully Moreton is a little bit far away from the jetties where people go off into Moreton Bay, despite the name of the electorate. The reality is that Senator Boswell managed to fool some people hook, line and sinker and say that there was going to be no fishing basically because of the Labor-Greens alliance. It was disgraceful misrepresentation.




Mr Ian Macfarlane:
  You said there would be no carbon tax.





Mr PERRETT:
  We said that we would price carbon; that is what we said. The reality is that we went to the 2007 election saying that we would price carbon, and that is what we have achieved. You know, member for Groom; you were in the negotiations. I heard those negotiations in Taipei. So, remember that we did have a CPRS deal where we priced carbon and, but for one vote in the coalition party room—where someone actually spoiled a ballot paper because they could not vote for Turnbull or Abbott—we would have had a CPRS. If we had had the Greens vote along with the vote of Senator Sue Boyce from Queensland, who had the courage to join Senator Troeth from Victoria, we would have a CPRS and Tony Abbott would be consigned to the pages of history. 




Th

is a great moment in the history of this parliament

e can actually protect something for our children and our grandchildren. 





The reality is

North Queensland is suffering at the moment in terms of jobs and tourism.





Mr Christensen interjecting
—





Mr PERRETT:
  The reality is that this is part of the product. It is niche tourism rather than the mass brand. We have to have a niche market, and North Queensland can market itself as the pristine environment. The reality is—




Mr Christensen:
  Very niche!




Mr PERRETT:
  I understand the member for Dawson's concerns that he will not be able to stand on the beach at Mackay and cast 450 kilometres out to the Coral Sea as he used to! He will have to go out with an expedition or the like. 


The reality is that the Coral Sea marine reserve is important in so many ways. The scientists agree—the same scientists that advised the Howard government. It was the same process that the Howard government went through, when that crazy left-wing environment minister—




Ms Livermore:
  Kemp!




Mr PERRETT:
  David Kemp. I always get the brothers mixed up. He understood. Peter Lindsay—for heaven's sake!—recognised that this was something to be proud of and that we should be taking a step in history and doing the right thing. I would suggest that he was not exactly a crazy left-winger!




Mr Christensen:
  Well—





Mr PERRETT:
  I will take that interjection from the member for Dawson. He knows him a bit better than me, obviously. This is the right thing to do in this parliament's history and we should be signing up for it proudly.

"Neville, Paul, MP",Nats,2012-06-20,"



Mr NEVILLE
 (Hinkler—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (16:11):  As a person who lives at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef and in close proximity to the Coral Sea, I have found this debate extraordinary. Before I got into parliament my job was in regional development—specifically, in industry and tourism. So I know a bit about the Great Barrier Reef and the coastal areas of Queensland; they were my bread and butter, so to speak. I was in on the early days of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. So I do not come to this debate with any sense of ignorance and I am not speaking against science. 


But I have seen the most vibrant fishing industry in Australia decimated over the last 15 years. It has been decimated by bureaucracy and government intervention. We first had a thing called the east coast trawl plan. Under the east coast trawl plan a decision by the federal and state governments took out 250 of the 750 vessels trawling along the Queensland coast. In fact, when the compensation was paid it was actually 40 more than that—290 came out. It meant a substantial decrease in effort.


Not long after that, we were told that the reef was now sustainable and that fishing could go ahead, but that GBRMPA would need another small amount—perhaps about 20 per cent. People, in good faith, said, 'Well, I suppose that's fair enough.' But when the maps came out it was not 20 per cent; it was 34 per cent. And frequently those fishing areas—the green zones that were put into the Barrier Reef Marine Park—were right over traditional fishing areas. In fact, it is alleged that the log books of the fishermen were used to some extent to plot these areas. The spanner crab industry off Bundaberg won an award as the best controlled fishery for the year before it was closed. How silly can you get? 


We then had to have another reduction. It worked out in my area—the southern end of the reef: fishermen from Gladstone, Bundaberg, Harvey Bay, Tin Can Bay and perhaps some even down to Mooloolaba—that the fishing industry was reduced by 73 per cent or 74 per cent. On top of that we had the state government saying, 'We want to have complementary state zones,' which diminished still further the area available for fishing. 


A lot of people, with those earlier compensations, bought vessels that could go into the Coral Sea. But now they are also going to be excluded—or, if not excluded, almost totally contained. Not that many people go there. About 20 entities go into the Coral Sea. A maximum of about 30 to 32 vessels are spread out across 1.3 million square kilometres—half the size of the state of Queensland. That is the size of the area we are talking about. As someone said earlier, there is no way in the world that the state or the Commonwealth are going to be able to control or look after this fishery, and imposing these rigid rules on ourselves is creating an absolute motza for people who want to come in on the northern side of the Coral Sea and fish the ones we have fattened up for them. What sort of idiots are we? 


You might say: 'Paul, you're generalising a bit. Where's your scientific proof?' Professor Walter Starck has had 50 years experience as a marine scientist. He has a PhD from the University of Miami. He is totally familiar with our environment. What he said about this is:


Australia's fishing industry is under threat, not from depleted fish stocks but from government-financed and sanctioned extreme environmentalism—


note that, 'extreme environmentalism'—



and crippling bureaucratic controls.


Interestingly, during the recent Senate estimates, a Mr Oxley from the department admitted to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee that was questioning him on aspects of these new marine areas in respect of the Coral Sea that there was no new scientific evidence. Professor Starck has said that, for the 347,000 square kilometres of the Barrier Reef, we are allowed to take 3,061 tonnes of fish. That means the weight of fish per square kilometre per year is nine kilograms. But, across the reefs of the Pacific that Dr Starck has also studied, the figure is 7,700 kilograms per square kilometre. Note the difference: nine and 7,700. We are being bureaucratic to a ridiculous level. Even the World Resources Institute, which you might say are not totally friendly to fisherman, have said that 4,000 kilograms per square kilometre is an acceptable, sustainable amount. And what are we taking out? Nine.


You might say, 'Why are you using the Barrier Reef?' Well, I want to move from the Barrier Reef now to the Coral Sea. The Coral Sea is a vastly bigger area. We are going from 347,000 square kilometres to 1.3 million square kilometres. We have only 20 entities with about 30 or 32 vessels going in, and we are going to close it up. If they trawled over that for the next 50 years they would not do it any damage. And all those fishermen will be the first to tell you that you leave specific sensitive areas alone. All the fishermen I have known in my lifetime want to leave a resource there for Australia. They want their sons and grandsons to have the opportunity to go out and fish those areas. They are not rapists; they do not go out just to deplete the stock, and we impose all these rules and regulations on ourselves as Australians. The rest of the world must sit back and laugh. The international trawlers that will come in on the northern side of the Coral Sea, which is outside our sphere of control anyhow, will have the time of their lives. You can see how silly it is. The point is that this is not smart science. This is a terrible block.


Recently, and I told this to the party room, Margaret asked me to go out and get some seafood marinara mix. While I was in the shop, after taking my number, I had a look at the big refrigerated fish cabinet. There were nine big stainless steel trays in there. Eight of the nine had foreign fish on them. We are importing, as the Leader of the Nationals said, 72 per cent of the fish we eat. We are not saving the planet or the environment. We are not providing fresh fish for Australians. What we are doing is shifting the effort somewhere else. In doing that, we are depriving ourselves of a rich and healthy resource, of export industries that could be sustainable for generations into the future.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (16:20):  A constituent recently recounted to me a story about an encounter she had had with a resident of Albany. This person was considering the case she had heard for marine parks. She recounted that she came from a former whaling family. She said, looking back, that the experience of transitioning out of whaling in the seventies was hard for her family and they opposed it at the time but that they had come to realise that it was the right thing to do. After some consideration, this person, whose family had subsequently moved into commercial fishing, felt that the move to put in place a network of marine sanctuaries was another of those important moments—the right thing to do.


Last week, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke, on behalf of the federal Labor government announced the single biggest conservation decision in this nation's history: the world's first comprehensive network of marine parks and the world's single largest marine park. This week, as the world's leaders, including our Prime Minister, go from the G20 meeting in Mexico to the Earth Summit in Rio, Australia's decision to protect its oceans takes centre stage. With this unprecedented decision Australia is leading a global turning point in the official understanding and recognition of not only the critical importance of the oceans to sustaining all life on earth but also the devastating impacts of damaging fishing practices, overfishing and the damage that oil and gas drilling can have, and the need to act decisively to set aside key areas from extraction.


As the member for Fremantle I am immensely proud of the strong stand my constituents have taken in calling on the Australian government to acquit its responsibility to protect Australia's unique marine life. In particular I am humbled to have been part of their creation of a vision for the protection of one of the most intriguing and important underwater features in Australia's ocean territory: the magnificent Perth Canyon in Fremantle's very own oceanic backyard. With federal Labor's leadership the Perth Canyon and the incredible underwater ecosystem that this dynamic feature nurtures will be recognised, boosting the livelihoods of the great community of Fremantle, whose history, culture and very life force comes from the ocean.


I am particularly proud that the campaign for marine parks in WA's south-west marine region led the charge nationally in achieving a prioritisation of high-level protection for the most biologically important and threatened part of our oceans: the continental shelf. In Australia's south-west corner the marine worlds collide with the meeting of the wild Southern Ocean and the vast Indian Ocean, mixed together by the magnitude of the force of nature that is the Leeuwin Current as it races south. Our south-west, on both land and sea, is a globally recognised biodiversity hot spot, and it is this legacy of shelf protection that the people of Western Australia are creating now that delivers on the heart of the scientific imperative, and that in doing so provides a firm platform to be built on in the future.


I take the opportunity now to flag the importance of the case that the local community of the Western Australian South Coast has made, many of them long-term recreational fishers, in calling for an end to the long-term inaction by the WA state government and, in particular, the Minister for Fisheries and for Mines and Petroleum, Minister Norman Moore, over the terrible death toll of marine animals and other non-target marine life in the demersal gill nets, a gear type which is not only intolerable but also unnecessary. Hook-and-line is a far better option. This also remains the imperative in the new marine park off Jurien, the most important breeding colony for threatened Australian sea lions on WA's west coast. The community of Geographe Bay has led the way in showing this can and must be done. The next frontier for high-level protection will be the state's north-west—Shark Bay, Ningaloo, the Rowley Shoals, the Pilbara, Coral Coast and the Kimberley—areas that are increasingly at a crossroads with the expansion of resource extraction.


I pay particular tribute to the community of Margaret River, who have overcome great tragedy and challenge in recent times, maintaining control of their destinies by asserting their future as one based on a lifestyle which is the envy of the world. With the creation of a very large no-oil zone the federal government has heard their call that all extraction, like coal, has no part in the future of Margaret River. Margaret River is now flanked on the one side with the old-growth forest protected by Geoff Gallop in 2001, and on the other side with the sea, protected in 2012 by federal Labor.


Fishing is a central part of WA's lifestyle, but the decline of some important fish stocks is gravely concerning. I am excited by the possibilities that last week's announcement opens up for the important contribution it will make to the return of fish stocks to the abundant levels our forefathers knew so well. In 2005 we embraced the opportunity with the introduction of broad-scale sanctuaries in Ningaloo Marine Park, following hard on the heels of the rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park the year before. Great waves of science are now rolling in off the back of these measures, showing that marine sanctuaries are the most effective way to protect marine life. It is no accident that the best fishing spots in the world are on the edges of marine sanctuaries.


These marine parks will now boost the environmental credibility and marketability of an industry which is working its way towards industry-wide environmental certification, and I am pleased that this federal Labor government is contributing to their case. Like on land, national parks in the ocean are just common sense, so it is no surprise that new marine parks are being rolled out at this very moment by the state government of Western Australia in that state's waters. This week the Camden Sound Marine Park was created, including WA's largest marine sanctuary. Last week the Ngari Capes Marine Park was created in the capes region of the south-west and there are three more to come, including the greatly anticipated Greater Kimberley Marine Park. Such is the strength of support out west for these issues that the member for Curtin—the Deputy Leader of the Opposition—and Premier Colin Barnett are very welcome supporters. It is interesting and telling that there is no member of the opposition from Western Australia speaking on this MPI. This is because they know full well that marine protection is extremely popular in Western Australia.


I am disappointed, though, by the confusing messages that elements of the federal coalition are sending on this matter. Is this the same coalition that under John Howard put in place high-level protection over a third of the Great Barrier Reef; that under Robert Hill put in place some of Australia's largest marine parks at the Great Australian Bight, Macquarie Island and Heard and McDonald Islands; whose very own Liberal Senator Chris Back established one of WA's first marine sanctuaries at Kingston Reef off Rottnest Island, which has now been proven by the CSIRO to have boosted rock lobster levels by 500 per cent?


In this MPI debate today the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Burke, talked about the great environmental decisions that have been made by previous governments. In his publication Thoughtlines former New South Wales Premier and now Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr, points to how the big conservation decisions have played an important role in defining leadership in Australia: 'Fraser Island, the reef, New South Wales rainforests, the Franklin River, the wet tropics of North Queensland. Every one of these decisions was tough. Every one of them was politically contested. Every one of them involved the possibility of a backlash in the regions. The Australian government has got it right, and today these great natural areas saved for all time help us define ourselves as Australians.' But it has been a long time between drinks. There is a whole generation of Australians who would not have been born the last time Australia made a globally significant decision for our environment. Now young Australians can celebrate as well in the first-hand knowledge that history has been created.


Let us take a moment to stand back and see what has been done. We started with less than one per cent of Commonwealth waters protected and we now have a national network of marine reserves to protect our ocean environment for future generations. Where did this process start? It started with the Keating government and was continued by the Howard government and now the Rudd and Gillard governments. This is positive change that should be above politics. It is positive change that will benefit not only Australian diving and tourism industries but also recreational and commercial fishers.


I come from a proud fishing community. I have not had one negative response since Minister Burke's announcement last week; not one. Indeed, during the extensive consultation process leading to the announcement I worked closely with Clayton Nelson from the South West Trawl Fishery which operates in a sustainable manner in waters off Fremantle. Notwithstanding some inaccurate news reports last week, the new marine network will have no impact on Clayton's fishery; indeed, he has told us that he is very happy with the result of the federal government's marine process. Australia-wide the impact of this decision on commercial fisheries averages one per cent and for recreational fishers it is negligible. As noted in an article by Paul Gamblin in today's West Australian—which is accompanied by a beautiful picture—interest in marine conservation in Western Australia is growing strongly, with those who have made submissions in favour of protection numbering in the tens of thousands. As Mr Gamblin notes, the real level of support this signals is much greater. And as celebrated Fremantle author Tim Winton noted in a speech in the House recently, when the bumper stickers that say 'I fish and I support marine sanctuaries' go from appearing on kombi vans to appearing on people movers, and now on tradies' utes, you know you have hit the mainstream. I am proud to be part of a federal Labor government that has made this historic decision to support our marine environment. I congratulate the minister for his vision and thank all those involved in the consultation process.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (16:31):  In rising to speak on this MPI, I started to choke on some of the uninformed drivel that was coming from the other side. I was particularly concerned by a couple of speakers who made light of the fact that they are going to have to walk some distance to reach Commonwealth waters. What they do not acknowledge is the fact that most of the inshore waters of these affected areas, particularly in the Coral Sea, have already been shut down. The fishermen who worked in those areas have already been forced out into the Coral Sea to continue their operations and we are now looking at shutting down those operations as well. It just shows you how uninformed those individuals on the other side are in relation to this issue.


About 25 per cent of Australia's coastal waters is already marine park. With about 25 per cent of our fishing area—the Coral Sea and other planned extensions—our marine park areas will comprise about 50 per cent of the global total. Australia has the largest per capita fishing zone and the lowest harvest rates in the world, at about one-thirtieth of the global average. We have the most restrictive and costly marine resource management in the world. Over 70 per cent of our seafood is imported, at a cost of $1.2 billion a year, from markets such as Thailand and Vietnam, where species are far more exploited. We are ripping the guts out of Third World countries. Through our own insatiable demand we are destroying their fisheries. We have done the same thing with forestry. These are the countries that can least afford to destroy their fisheries—and we are making sure that they do, while we lock up ours in their entirety. It is estimated that Australia will need to import 850,000 tonnes by 2020 to satisfy the growing consumption rate and dietary recommendations.


The Coral Sea is one of the world's prime tuna fishing grounds. The estimated value of its production has been reduced to about $8 million from 500 tonnes of tuna. That is what we are down to in this area that we are going to protect. Previously, Japanese fishermen who fished this area since the 1970s had sustainably produced around 30,000 tonnes annually for many, many years. Meanwhile Papua New Guinea licenses Asian fishing companies to fish the same migratory stocks—exactly the same fish—in its 2.4 million square kilometres of EEZ waters. In 2009 PNG took around 400,000 tonnes. In 2010 it grew to 700,000 tonnes—more than five times Australia's total catch of edible fish of all species combined. And PNG is expected to hit one million tonnes in 2011.


Meanwhile, because of all our restrictions and lock-ups, our national fishery only produces about 15,000 tonnes a year. Annual catches in the main commercially fished tuna species of skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye and albacore in the central and western Pacific area have increased continuously in recent decades, peaking in 2009 with the highest ever catch of 2.46 million tonnes recorded which was valued at $4.5 billion. This compares to the 15,000 tonnes that we are allowed to take nationally because of our restrictions. Yet Australia imports more canned tuna than any other seafood product—about $165 million worth. We save our fish so that all of these foreign fishermen—licensed by the PNG government in many cases—can catch them and sell them back to us. This is the intelligence of the mob that sits across from us!


Let us talk about the organisation that captured the minister and this mob over here and decided they would influence the change. It is called Pew. It was founded in 1948 by the Pew family, who made a fortune in oil and gas and have more than $5 billion in assets. Their company is known as Sunoco. It is one of the largest gasoline distribution companies in the United States, but it withdrew from the oil business in 2011. It made a squillion and decided to go out and create some mischief. So what did they do? They tried to become a false prophet. They claim to be an independent, non-profit, non-governmental, non-partisan and non-ideological organisation. How much of a joke is that!


They have got a conservation arm called the Pew Environment Group that literally owns this Labor government and certainly owns the minister. They say they are focusing on reducing what they see as the destruction of the world's oceans. They did not have the guts to take on the Americans. They will not go anywhere near the South-East Asian or European fisheries that already are absolutely trashed. No. They look around for the lowest common denominator. They look around for one of the only governments that is totally dependent on the Greens to survive. So they worm their way in here like the expanding gangrene that they are. They come in here and do a deal with this mob. They frighten the living hell out of them. They say, 'If you don't do a deal with us, the Greens will take away their support.' So this has nothing to do with the environment. It is all about politics. It is an absolute joke. They said 487,000 signatures came through in this email campaign—all nice, glossy ones. But 99.8 per cent of those submissions were bulk emails, and Senate estimates recently revealed that a very significant majority were from overseas. They did not even have a clue where this place was. It was just, 'Do you love your mother? Yes. Do you want to save the Coral Sea? Yes.' That is the way they do this, and it is an absolute farce. Whatever happened to Australians having a say in the management of their own waters?


Pew has a controversial history. In Canada it was accused of smothering grassroots environmental movements. It comes in with its six-figure salaries and the foundation funding, and it uses its influence to exercise control over whatever issues are brought up—the same as has happened here; exercising control over this mob over on the other side, who cannot survive without the Greens. Last month the Pew Trust made headlines by contributing funding to the cash-strapped Barnes Foundation, which looks after the famed Barnes art collection. Despite the donor's will specifying that the collection must stay in Lower Merion, Pennsylvania, Pew helped fund lawyers who fought for the collection's relocation, in violation of the will. It has been reported over there as 'the art theft of the century'.


This is the grubby mob that these guys have decided to take exclusive advice from to destroy the livelihoods of so many people in our area. Bob Lamason of Great Barrier Reef Marine Tuna, who is the only one left up there, used to pay $2,000 a vessel back in 2000 for his six boats, catching about 1,200 tonnes of tuna a year. He is now paying $160,000 a year, an average of over $50,000 per vessel, and he is now only able to catch 500 tonnes of tuna. Back then there were no bycatch restrictions, no wire traces and no VMS, and he had a much wider range. But he faced much higher fuel costs in going further and further out as they pushed him out, and they put five-hook limits et cetera on him. Basically they are driving him out of business. Lyle Squire Junior, a third-generation businessman at Cairns Marine Aquarium, was decimated back when the green zones came out. They pushed him out into the Coral Sea. We look like losing him as well over this.


Minister Burke himself admitted that the scale of the lockup in the temperate zone—because it was so small—was pay-off for the lockup in the Coral Sea. In his speech here he mentioned some fisherman from the south-east saying that he was happy with it, as did the previous speaker. Of course they were, because they traded all of them off. They are not affected by it. The same goes for Chris Makepeace, the Northern Territory recreational fisherman that he mentioned. Of course, he is not affected either. The minister did mention Col McKenzie, the CEO of AMPTO. What he did not mention is that Col McKenzie is also the campaign manager for the state Labor members up in Cairns—a long-term Labor Party member.


The minister did a deal with the dive industry to divide them from the others in the hope that he might get their support. There is a bit of a problem with that, because he is now saying that they are the ones that are going to be managing the fishery; they are going to be the policemen. But Chris Eade, the president of the Cod Hole and Ribbon Reef Mooring Holders Association, which represents nine dive businesses, has already shot down the idea of the minister. He said:


… I don't think you can expect us to be your policemen out there … I cannot expect the crews on my boats, who are civilians, to put themselves at risk. They work for me, not the Government.


This is an absolute disgrace. We have already seen businesses starting to fold on this, and there is a hell of a lot more tragedy to come out of it. (Time expired)




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms O'Neill

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton—Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business) (16:41):  by leave—It is not acceptable in this country, a relatively wealthy one, that so many Australians are homeless. It is not acceptable that a widowed pensioner cannot find a bed or that a teenager is sleeping rough. It is not acceptable that a mother and her children are living in a car. Everyone deserves a safe and secure home. A home is the foundation on which a person builds their life. Without a stable home, people—no matter their age—struggle to live healthily, stay in training or education, or find and keep jobs. That is not good for them, for their families, for their communities or for the country.


That is why this Labor government has made homelessness a national priority. In 2008, we released the inaugural white paper on homelessness, The road home. The white paper outlines how we will reduce homelessness. It will require a sustained effort by governments, business and the community. To get there, we have set clear targets. By 2020, we will halve the rate of homelessness, and we will provide supported accommodation for all rough sleepers who seek it. We do not resile from these ambitious targets, even though those opposite refused to sign up to them. In 2013 we will be in a position to measure our progress. We will draw on robust census data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and use information collected from specialist homelessness services by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. This data will be supplemented by the first national longitudinal study of homelessness in Australia, Journeys Home.


We have also spent over $11 million on the National Homelessness Research Agenda to help drive the development and implementation of evidence-based policy. In addition to Journeys Home, we have supported research that, amongst other things, looks at housing and support options for older people, considers how to end rough sleeping in cities around the country, and examines how we best develop a professional workforce. Combined, these facts and figures will give us the most accurate picture of homelessness in Australia that we have ever had. We will better understand how homelessness comes about, and how we can help people get back on their feet. We are confident that, in partnership with states and territories, community organisations and philanthropists, we are reducing homelessness in Australia. Every single commitment set out in the white paper has been concluded or is underway.




Early intervention



We have intervened early to prevent homelessness. As a result of the community-based early intervention service, Reconnect, more than 50,000 young people are back with their families, and are in school or are in training. The Household Organisational Management Expenses Advice Program has helped over 3,600 families to stay off the streets by providing advice and assistance to people who were struggling to pay the rent or keep up with the mortgage during personal or financial crises. Further, we have prevented people with mental illness becoming homeless with the Personal Helpers and Mentors Program, which provides support for people with a mental illness to build social networks, gain employment, learn how to better manage their illness and live independently.




Improving and expanding services:



We have moved towards integrating mainstream and specialist homelessness services by improving the responses from 'first to know' agencies and providers. For example, headspace assists young people with mental health issues who are also experiencing homelessness; Job Services Australia provides tailored assistance to get homeless job seekers into employment; and Centrelink has started making weekly payments to those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.


I also know how hard people in this sector work and the passion and commitment they have for their jobs. Attracting and maintaining the best workers possible is essential, and was reflected in the significant pay increases proposed for community services workers by Fair Work Australia. This is a historic decision, and one which this government has rightfully supported and will continue to support by funding our share of the salary increases.


We are breaking the cycle of homelessness by providing integrated support in order to ensure that people leave homelessness permanently, not for just for temporary periods. One such example is Foyer accommodation, which provides homeless young people with stable housing and other supports on the basis they participate in education, training or employment.


Under the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, the Australian government, together with the states and territories, has committed $1.1 billion to provide new and better integrated accommodation and support services. The agreement is delivering over 180 new or expanded services across Australia to tackle homelessness as well as 600 homes under the A Place to Call Home initiative. What does that mean for people? It means that since the commencement of the agreement, homelessness services have provided help more than 240,000 times.


Addressing homelessness is not always just about a roof over someone's head, but a roof certainly helps. The government's investment in affordable housing recognises that it is essential, indeed critical, to preventing people becoming homeless in the first place, and it gives people somewhere to go when they come out of crisis accommodation. By increasing the stock of affordable housing we enable people to move from homelessness into stable accommodation and through social housing into the private rental market. This transition, in turn, creates space for other people to access accommodation when they are in dire need.


The Australian government has committed almost $5 billion in new funding since 2008 to provide support services and programs to assist people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. It is worth remembering that whilst those opposite were in government they did not even have a housing minister, let alone a minister for homelessness. Even now they do not have a specific shadow minister for homelessness. In a time of relative economic munificence they ripped $3.1 billion out of the housing budget. Nonetheless, those opposite do have an opportunity to start to redeem themselves in this area of public policy.


Today, the government tabled its response to the Housing the Homeless report of the former House Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth, which inquired into the proposed homelessness legislation. This committee report has provided the foundation of the Homelessness Bill 2012, which I intend to introduce in the spring sittings. In the absence of express constitutional power, the government has given careful consideration to its response to the recommendations of the legislation inquiry. The government has incorporated the recommendations into the draft bill to the extent possible within the constraints of the Australian Constitution.


An exposure draft of this bill has been released for a two-month consultation period concluding on 3 August and the government will consider the feedback of the sector before presenting the legislation to parliament. It is true that this legislation will not provide a home for anyone; however, it will ensure that the spotlight remains firmly on addressing homelessness. The introduction of legislation provides us with a great opportunity to retain in law the important statements about homelessness; the partnerships, the effort and strategies that are needed to tackle it; and the treatment and support that vulnerable Australians deserve. We believe the Gillard government's legislative response will serve as a lasting reminder of the need homeless Australians have for support, and of the need for partnered, strategic effort between governments, community organisations and businesses.


I urge the opposition to engage with the government on the bill, and to support it when it comes to the parliament. As our white paper notes, homelessness is everyone's responsibility. The Labor government has recognised this and remains committed to improving outcomes for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness. Ensuring that people who are experiencing homelessness receive high quality services and get every chance to move out of homelessness or avoid it all together is critical to the Gillard government's policy agenda. Not only does it make social sense to for people to have a home but it also makes economic sense. The cost of having people cycle through hospital emergency departments and mental health services because they do not have stable accommodation outweighs the costs of providing those very same people with a place they can call home.


The welfare and safety of our fellow Australians matters. This is a great and prosperous country but I believe the real mark of a great country is how it treats and assists its most vulnerable. The Gillard government is determined to do all that it can to assist our vulnerable Australians. There can be no more worthy cause than doing all that we can to help reduce homelessness.



I present a copy of my ministerial statement and the government response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth report on the inquiry into homelessness legislation entitled Housing the Homeless. I move:


That the House take note of the document.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the honourable member for Menzies to speak for 10 minutes. 


Leave granted.

",HoR,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Homelessness</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,19,1
"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (16:53):  The ministerial statement we have just heard was one of the more curious that I have heard in this House, not because the subject is unimportant—it quite clearly is—but because it betrays a sense of talk and discussion and wishing for the future rather than actual achievements. This has become a fairly typical Labor tactic: throw up a minister with a ministerial statement and try to push a story. So today they have thrown up the Minister for Housing and Homelessness and the Minister for Small Business. This is another stunt in terms of the way ministerial statements are being used in this place, and we on this side are bracing for more failures in the homelessness area from a minister who has presided over failed programs, failed policies and other cheap stunts. For example, when Labor was watering down mutual obligation and making it easy for people to get on the dole, he was the Minister for Employment Participation. With a white flag flying high as a sign of surrender to the people smugglers, and while people were being endangered, he was the Minister for Home Affairs. And with the Ombudsman, the National Audit Office and the DPP all noting fraud issues at the Department of Human Services, he was the Minister for Human Services.


Labor stands condemned on the important issue of homelessness. The minister professes his pride not in achievements but in setting targets that we on this side of the House knew were unattainable. At the same time, Labor has allowed five years of the 12 years until 2020 to pass without being able to actually measure any progress in this area. And the government has not committed anything in the budget to the renewal of the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, which is due to expire at the end of next financial year. Similarly, when I looked through the budget trying to find homelessness money elsewhere to make up for this funding stream that is finishing, guess what? I found nothing because there is no other commitment; there is no other money. That is because Labor's homelessness policy is all smoke and mirrors. There is no substance. There is no plan. There is no direction. They have got no idea.


The question the minister should have addressed today is: will those 180 new or expanded services continue to exist? The minister probably does not know, and the government does not seem to care. Labor endlessly repeats the line that it has committed almost $5 billion to homelessness since 2008, yet it cannot explain where this money comes from or, indeed, where it goes. When we look at the funding we see that almost $3 billion of the stimulus funding went to remote Indigenous housing funding, social housing funding and mental health funding. These are all are very worthy programs, but none is directly relevant to the homelessness program. Labor's approach is that any housing measures can be counted as homelessness funding.


The minister complains about the opposition not including the word 'homelessness' in the title of the shadow minister for housing, yet this is a government that has had three different ministers for homelessness in just seven months. And, of course, the current health minister served as minister for housing without any mention of homelessness in her title. So the minister's comment is nothing more than a cheap attempt to score some cheap points.


There are estimated to be 105,000 Australians who are homeless each night. In 2008-09, data indicated that 61.5 per cent of those who sought crisis accommodation, or 330 people—205 adults and 125 accompanying children—were turned away per day. Indeed, the data estimated that only one-fifth of Australia's homeless were in these services at any one time. A severe lack of affordable housing in Australia, and in Sydney more than anywhere else, is pushing families out of the rental market and onto endless public housing waiting lists.


But homelessness goes beyond whether Australians can afford to rent a roof over their heads, with domestic and family violence and family or relationship breakdown leading to the plight of around a third of Australia's homeless. Such issues obviously are not easy to address. The question is how we, as a society, can ensure that those who do slip through the cracks are taken care of.


We do not believe that there are easy answers to homelessness because almost every case is unique. Homelessness involves a set of individual circumstances for all those people who are, sadly, caught in this situation. And sadly, without wanting this to be the case, there will always be homeless people amongst us. Their presence and our response is a test of our compassion as a society. When it comes to solutions, most of the experts in this area say that a multidisciplinary approach is required. We need to do more than give the homeless a bed for the night and a meal. We need to give them a pathway out, one step at a time, solving one problem after the other.


While we must always help those who are homeless, we should aim to address the root causes to help prevent struggling families and individuals from slipping into homelessness in the first place. A key focus is addressing Australia's structural housing shortage, which results in less homes being available for those who need them and higher prices at the lower end of the market for those who can least afford them. 


The coalition went to the last election with a homelessness policy based on taking practical measures to ensure the states and territories achieve tangible results, and on helping homelessness service providers focus on the work they do rather than on the administrative burden so often attached to government funding. We are in the process of refining our policies in this area, but an overarching approach will be to address and prevent homelessness by improving housing affordability. Our approach is to solve problems. Labor's approach, it seems, is to create problems and pretend they are fixing things up when they themselves have broken some of them. Only a change of government will deliver positive change for those Australians unfortunately living rough.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (18:37):  This bill, the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Improved Access to Television Services) Bill 2012, has very broad support both in the House and in the community. It seeks to increase the level of captioning that is provided on both free-to-air television stations and subscription television services. The aim of the bill is to eventually achieve a captioning service on 100 per cent of a commercial broadcaster's core or primary channel during the relevant viewing hours of 6 am to midnight. This is done progressively with the bill. It also seeks to incrementally increase the captioning targets for subscription television licences.


It is a fundamental matter of social justice to ensure, as far as we can, that people with disabilities are not deprived of access to those important means of communication and information, participation in which enables them to engage fully with the rest of the Australian community. We warmly support this bill. The principles enshrined in it have had the support of the coalition in government, and captioning requirements have been increased and imposed during our time in government.


There are a number of matters which we believe would enable us to improve the bill, so we have a number of amendments which we will move when we move to consideration in detail. I will not delay the House any further, Mr Deputy Speaker Oakeshott—I did not recognise you with your glasses on there for a moment. We will not delay the House any longer on the second reading given that there is a consensus that this bill should be dealt with tonight. I will come back to the amendments at the appropriate time. Both as a matter of principle and of policy the objects of this bill are worthy ones.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (18:40):  I speak in support of this particular piece of legislation, the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Improved Access to Television Services) Bill 2012. I only want to speak for a few minutes on it. The bill amends the television captioning requirements in the Broadcasting Services Act to provide improved media access for the deaf and hearing impaired. That is a worthy bipartisan approach to take in relation to these issues. There has been consultation with stakeholders, media and other groups associated with this particular piece of legislation.


Access to electronic media is important for all members of a society which is supposed to be inclusive. It means that people regardless of their circumstances, disabilities and limitations can access film, television and the internet. It is important that we in this parliament take an approach that looks at assisting those people to enjoy an important recreation of ordinary Australians, regardless of their circumstance, their income, their geographical location or their physical capacity.


The bill increases requirements for captioning free-to-air and subscription television broadcasts. We have all had the benefit of seeing captioning on our TVs; it assists people with hearing impairment by providing a text version of speech and sound during television broadcasts. Those of us who watch other programs on SBS and the like will have had the benefit of that. In this short time I want to congratulate the government on this bill, congratulate the opposition for their bipartisan approach and support the legislation.

Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (18:41):  I will speak briefly on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Improved Access to Television Services) Bill 2012. I certainly concur with my colleague, the shadow minister for communications, on the importance of providing equity in access to electronic media services. This bill, which addresses the issue of captioning, supports that principle. However, the coalition has some concerns and as my colleague has indicated he will be moving a number of amendments to reflect improvements that we believe should have been made to the bill.


One of the first issues is that it is unclear what happens if the captioning system fails due to a technical difficulty. We have the ironic situation that where a broadcast fails completely and the screen goes black a broadcaster would not necessarily be in breach of their broadcasting licence; however, if there is a failure of the captioning system, it may well be that that broadcaster is in breach of their broadcasting licence. We feel that the provisions of the bill are somewhat onerous on the broadcasters and that a more common-sense approach should apply.


The second issue I would like to address briefly is the hours of captioning. Captioning is required between 6 am and midnight, but it would be reasonable to allow a broadcaster to include the whole duration of a program that begins before midnight and may finish at perhaps 1 am in the morning as part of its contribution to captioning. This is a common-sense approach: a viewer who is dependent on captioning would not want the captioning to conclude halfway through the program. This second amendment is a very sensible measure.


The third matter I would like to reflect on is the very onerous reporting requirement imposed by this bill. A more common-sense approach of having a complaint based system, rather than burdening the network with very extensive requirements for record keeping, would be a better approach.


Finally, there is the issue of pass-through channels such as BBC, CNN, CNBC, Bloomberg and Eurosport which may have relatively small audiences. It would be appropriate to exclude their programs from the captioning regime. Because of the cost of captioning—and it is quite expensive; it can be up to $750 per hour—if they were required to caption their programs it may be that those programs, which are enjoyed by a rather small but important audience, disappear from our market. So there were a number of sensible suggestions that the opposition has made. I would hope that the government could see its way clear to support those. But we certainly do support the thrust of the bill; it is an important improvement for disabled and hearing-impaired people.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (18:45):  I would like to thank members who have contributed to the debate.


Access to electronic media is important to all members of our community. This bill contains a number of measures to improve media access for the many Australians who are deaf or hearing impaired. The bill responds to the consultations with stakeholders, beginning with the Media Access Review process, which commenced in 2008. It amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to implement new captioning targets and obligations on free-to-air and subscription television. Captioning is an important tool that assists people with a hearing impairment. Importantly, the bill makes provision not only for improved quantity of captioning but also for improved quality through the implementation of minimum quality standards regarding the readability, comprehensibility and accuracy of captions.


The bill also enhances the role of the regulator, the ACMA, in working with stakeholders to develop captioning standards, to monitor compliance and to respond to consumer complaints. The bill will also provide for improved access to television emergency warnings for people with a hearing or vision impairment.



The government is committed to making meaningful improvements to levels of media access, while ensuring that our actions are practical for broadcasters and content producers. The amendments in this bill, accompanied by a regulation to be developed by the Attorney-General, will provide both viewers and broadcasters with a level of regulatory certainty through one set of clear future targets, one overarching regulatory system and a clear and cost-effective compliance and complaints mechanism. I commend the bill to the House.

Providing access to services for people with disabilities is one of the most important things government can do. As I said earlier in the second reading debate, we are totally committed to the object of this legislation. Having said that, getting the balance right is vital and we do not think the balance is quite right here.


This bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and introduces new legislative requirements, and in some places increases existing requirements for the provision of captioning services for commercial, national and subscription television broadcasters. The bill also introduces new obligations on broadcasters to transmit emergency warnings in the form of text and speech, and caption where reasonably practicable.


While the broadcasters do not seek to shy away from their commitment to providing captioning services, nonetheless they have expressed concern that the increase in captioning obligations is, in certain respects, overly burdensome. The cost of captioning is substantial—$750 an hour or more—and these costs increase significantly for live captioning of programs such as sport and news.


Turning to the amendments, item 1 amends schedule 1, section 130ZL of the bill and adds a clause to allow that where a captioned program begins before midnight and ends the next day, the part of the program that is broadcast after midnight is taken to have been broadcast during designated viewing hours. Currently the bill does not allow broadcasters to include the captioning of the part of the program that finishes after midnight towards their target. Given the cost and difficulty in captioning programs, this amendment gives broadcasters a greater incentive to caption the whole of a program or sporting event that runs past midnight. It stands to reason that we should not have the law as proposed in the government's bill, which would mean that if a sporting event or some other programming was part-heard or part-viewed at midnight, the broadcaster would simply stop captioning it. There would be no point in captioning it after midnight if it does not go to help them achieve their target. This is a perfectly sensible, practical amendment, and I commend it to the House.


Item 2 amends section 130ZN by inserting an exemption for international pass-through providers. My colleague, the member for Cowper, spoke about this. Briefly, under the bill international news channels, including BBC World News, CNN International, Al Jazeera, Bloomberg, CNBC, Eurosport and Euronews, would become subject to new mandatory captioning requirements. In June 2004, the members of the Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association Inc., ASTRA, made an agreement with the Human Rights Commission to provide captioning on subscription channels with annual increases of the amount of captioning programming of up to five per cent year on year. Under this agreement these international pass-throughs, as honourable members can see from the amendment, are defined as a service that has been compiled and played out at a location outside of Australia—for example, BBC World News is played out of London.


At the moment, if these services are required to be captioned—which is the intention of the bill—it will add such a substantial cost to the subscription television service in Australia that we are advised that a number of these channels will simply no longer be able to be broadcast. That would be a lose-lose situation—that is, the service would not be captioned and the community that is not hearing impaired will be deprived of the channels altogether. So consistent with the previous agreement with the Human Rights Commission, and, we would say, consistent with common sense, these channels should be exempt from the captioning obligations on the basis that, in practical terms, the cost of doing so is unduly burdensome. It has been put to us by the government that these channels would be able to apply for an exemption or a target reduction order under the bill. That is certainly true, but to do so annually for each channel imposes, in our submission, an onerous burden on the providers. It also confers yet more authority and discretion on the minister. There is a Conroybian tendency that we have seen in a lot of legislation from this minister to confer—



Mr Albanese interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  The Conroybian tendency is to grant more and more (Extension of time granted) discretion to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. We do not think that is good practice and, with no disrespect to the particular minister, the Conroybian tendency should be resisted. In this case, the best way to resist it is, rather than the government saying to the subscription television services, 'Trust us; we will give you an exemption,' to just exempt those international pass-through channels now in the legislation. If at some point in the future technology becomes available so that it is financially feasible to caption them in Australia then the parliament can change the law.


Amendments (3) to (5) amend clause 130ZUB. They enable certain breaches of the captioning requirements to be disregarded. Broadcasters, both subscription and free-to-air, are legitimately concerned with the current provisions in the bill under which they will be found in breach of their licence conditions if they are unable to provide a captioning service for reasons beyond their control, such as failure by a third party captioning provider to provide the service for reasons unforeseen by the broadcasters. These amendments would amend the new part 9D of the bill by inserting a new subparagraph (d) in the proposed 130ZUB, subsection (1).


The amendment is consistent with both the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 and section 226 of the Australian Consumer Law. The Competition and Consumer Act recognises that civil penalty provisions can apply in circumstances where a party is not at fault and provides a defence in relevant circumstances. The Consumer Law also provides that a defence to an action for recovery of a civil penalty applies where the person acted honestly and reasonably and, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, ought fairly to be excused. So in this case what we are proposing is language which would enable ACMA to disregard a breach in circumstances where it has found that the licensee has acted honestly and reasonably and, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, ought fairly to be excused. It is a practical amendment and it is consistent with the provisions in the Competition and Consumer Act.


I will deal briefly with the final amendments, which are (6) to (10). They address the very burdensome reporting requirements that all broadcasters will be subject to as a result of the bill. Currently they report on their captioning targets. However, the bill introduces new captioning quality standards to be determined by the ACMA which broadcasters are concerned will require them to keep very detailed records of each program captioned. There is no value in imposing these additional reporting requirements, and obviously they add cost. We are opposed to additional red tape and regulation where it adds no value.


What we propose is to delete those provisions. This would mean that the broadcasters would continue to report on their targets and, of course, they would continue to have the obligation of managing their complaints system—in other words, if they do not provide the captioning required, there will be no shortage of complaints to which they will have to respond and to demonstrate that they have responded. Amendments (6) to (10) are a straightforward means of reducing unnecessary red tape and regulation with absolutely no loss to the overall policy objective. I commend the amendments to the House.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (18:59):  I rise tonight to talk about the damaging effect that Labor's carbon tax will have on local businesses in the Casey electorate. As has been well publicised during the debate on Labor's carbon tax, trade-exposed businesses will be particularly affected by the tax. There has been a great focus in the media on some of the larger trade-exposed manufacturers in Australia—and quite rightly so. Because, whilst they will have the cost burdens of the carbon tax built into all of their prices, they will be competing against imported products that do not have the carbon price built into their prices, and, of course, it is an escalating carbon price which goes up year after year like an escalator in a supermarket.


But there has not been as much national focus on some of the trade-exposed smaller manufacturers. Across the Casey electorate, in the outer east of Melbourne in the Yarra Valley, there are many businesses which are successful manufacturers and which do not mind competing on a level playing field. They have been doing so for some time, and they have a number of cost burdens that they have had to deal with over the years. The carbon tax will put them at a particular disadvantage, and the government's so-called compensation plans—even if everyone believes them—will have absolutely no positive effect on the companies concerned. In the time available I will explain why with just a few examples.


There is Garden City Plastics, which is Australia's premier plastic pot manufacturer; in fact, it is about the only one left. They manufacture most of the plastic pots we all see at Bunnings—or, for that matter, anywhere else—if we go to buy a plastic pot. The government would say, 'The price of these products will increase and people will be compensated, so what is the problem?' The big problem is that everyday Australian consumers, even if they get this carbon tax compensation and it is adequate, do not get to choose to buy a Garden City plastic pot; they go into Bunnings or a wholesaler and have no choice of which brand of plastic pot they buy. The contracts for Bunnings and for the wholesalers are for 1,000, for 10,000 or—sometimes—for 50,000 units, and the competition is all foreign. So it is quite conceivable that manufacturers such as Garden City Pots will miss out on contracts right across the board, and no amount of compensation for the consumer will help the company concerned. Of course, the decision on whether a wholesaler buys 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 or 50,000 pots is based on price.


There are other examples of companies which are affected by the carbon tax and which might not come immediately to mind. In my electorate and in many others there is light manufacturing. I know that my friend and colleague behind me, the member for Gilmore, would certainly have kitchen cabinet manufacturers in her electorate. Increasingly such industries are, through technology and trade, becoming more trade exposed. They do not just compete against the kitchen cabinet manufacturer around the corner; they compete against a cheaper flat-packed product, and increasingly they are competing against full kitchens which are made to measure and can be imported. Those on this side of the House understand that. I took the Leader of the Opposition out to Yarra Valley Cabinet Makers just a couple of weeks ago, and that very point was made. It is a highly successful business which has been operating for 20 years and is facing the imposts associated with the carbon tax. In many ways companies such as Yarra Valley Cabinet Makers are the silent victims of the tax.


There is also Crown Industries, which is a small business in my electorate producing coffee urns. It is the competition to what we would know as the Burco—coffee percolators for catering. Crown Industries is a manufacturing firm producing these percolators, and it competes— (Time expired)

They came to discuss in particular the campaign of a local GP clinic, Loxley House, to have Bathurst considered a district of workforce shortage—which is similar to the Area of Need scheme—to have Bathurst classified as a region with a shortage of doctors so they can qualify for government assistance in attracting doctors to move to Bathurst to fill impending vacancies in their clinic.


I was stunned to learn of the problems that Bathurst is having with getting doctors, because this is a town of 40,000-odd people, 2½ hours from Sydney. Loxley House clinic has spent four years advertising within the Rural Doctors Network without success, and there currently is another practice in Bathurst also advertising without success. What chance have the smaller towns further west got when a town like Bathurst is unable to attract doctors over that time?


According to recent census data, Bathurst has a population of almost 40,000 people, with an ageing population—in other words, residents over 65 years of age—making up 12.7 per cent. According to the Central West Division of General Practice, Bathurst currently has 33 full-time or part-time GPs, or 22½ full-time equivalent, and a GP-population ratio of one doctor to every 1,743 people. Looking at the map of the areas considered for a district of workforce shortage—a shortage of doctors—most of my electorate falls into the 'yes' category, except for the local government areas of Orange and Bathurst. With Orange, which is probably the only other serious medical area west of Sydney, you can understand it, but Bathurst has almost 40,000 people and has been unable to get a doctor in four years. That is pretty terrifying. I will be talking to the Minister for Health. This is something that must be resolved, and Bathurst needs to come under that scheme.

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:01):  The fact is that there is no clearer sign of a strong economy than a surplus. I know that the shadow minister standing opposite me would be well aware of that. 




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The consideration in detail is an opportunity for the opposition to further examine the budget. If the minister is simply going to make a rhetorical statement to the chamber—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  I understand that the member for Sturt did jump—




Mr Pyne:
  I am surprised that the call was not given to me. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The procedure in this place is that the minister makes an opening statement and then we open up for the different calls. That is the pattern that has been happening in this place and I will—



Mr Pyne interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Sturt will sit in silence and wait for his call. 




Ms Hall:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would like to correct the record. This is also an opportunity for members, not just the opposition—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I will correct the record. The record is that the minister has the call to make an opening statement, and the minister has the call. 




Mr GARRETT:
  As I was saying before I was interrupted by the shadow minister, there is no clearer sign of a strong economy than a surplus. This government delivered a surplus in the budget and, not only that, it means that we have a buffer in case the global economy gets worse. It means that we can protect jobs. It builds on the successful economic management of this government in steering the country through the global final crisis, without Australia going into recession and without the really significant and very serious job losses that many other nations have faced. 


In particular in this budget we have secured our key education spending areas while making responsible savings wherever possible. The fact is that the Gillard Labor government continues to make record investments in school education and in early childhood—and my colleague Minister Kate Ellis is here as well—in comparison to the previous Howard government, of which the shadow minister was a member. The fact is that in this budget, in this financial year, the government will investment $13.6 billion in our schools compared to the $8.5 billion spent by the Howard government in its last budget. Over the next four years we will spend an estimated $59.9 billion on our schools. Nearly $60 billion will be spent by the Labor government because we recognise that substantial investment in education is absolutely central to our prospects as a nation in the future and we are prepared to show by the decisions we have made in this budget—by this financial commitment—how important education is for the Labor government. Of course, over the next four years we will spend about $22.3 billion on early childhood education and care measures as well, again highlighting the fact that this Labor government has a specific understanding of the need to invest right across the learning years from early childhood into primary school, high school and beyond.


In particular, I draw your attention to some of the commitments that were specifically made in the budget when it came through earlier this year. In Indigenous education, some $583 million will be provided in the Northern Territory's through the Stronger Futures package—a really significant commitment on our part. There will be significant additional investments for maths and science in schools as part of an overall $54 million joint announcement that I made with Minister Evans. As well as that, there will be two other further measures which I think are particularly important: $55.7 million will be provided to expand the HIPPY program, which was a joint announcement with my colleague Minister Ellis; and, of course, we will be continuing the critical funding for literacy and numeracy schemes which we announced on 5 May. A commitment of some $243 million has been made to literacy and numeracy. This recognises that literacy and numeracy are the building blocks of any child's school education and, in particular, it recognises the existing investment that we have made in national partnerships in the states not only in literacy and numeracy but in teacher quality and low SES communities as well. There are significant commitments to education in this budget as part of our overall recognition of how central education is to the future of the nation. (Time expired)

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (10:07):  It is no wonder that the minister would rather talk about the nonexistent surplus—the dodgy surplus—than about education, because the government's record in education, and his as a minister in particular, is so shallow. Unfortunately, in the sector they know that education is no longer at the centre of government policy as it was when Julia Gillard, as the Deputy Prime Minister, was also the Minister for Education. Unfortunately, this minister now holds the portfolio and as a consequence education has moved to the outer reaches of the government—and doesn't it show.


In this consideration in detail stage, I would like to ask a number of questions about the budget papers. The first of those goes to the issue of computers in schools. The minister would know that, at page 58 of the 2011-2012 Budget Paper No. 3, $200 million per year was provided across the forward estimates as payments for the states for the Digital Education Revolution—the computers in schools program. The government previously advised that the $200 million for maintenance and upgrades was to support the states maintain and upgrade the new computers. This year, Budget Paper No. 3 2012-2013 at page 55 now provides $200 million for 2012-2013 only, rather than for each year of the so-called Digital Education Revolution. So across the forward estimates there has been a significant cut to that $200 million a year that was promised last year.


Can the minister explain why the $200 million is no longer provided across the forward estimates annually after 2012-2013? Is this the end of the Commonwealth's involvement in the Digital Education Revolution program? Doesn't this mean that the program now amounts to a one-off investment in computers by the government with the states now left with the cost of maintaining the one-for-one ratio of computers in schools when we know that the states are severely cash-strapped—except for Western Australia—and therefore are highly unlikely to be able to find the resources to maintain the laptops in schools program? They have also, of course, struggled already over the last few years to find the resources necessary to install and maintain the laptops program, leading to very long delays in the computers in schools program and, of course, the significant cost blowout that we have already seen in the laptops program. Turning to the response of the government to the Gonski review, Budget Paper No. 2 also suggested the government is currently working through the reform proposals in consultation with the states and the territories and other education stakeholders. It is also understood that modelling has been released to the sector for the years 2009 and 2010.  TheSydney Morning Herald reported on 22 May:


But the first year-on-year comparison—between 2009 and 2010 funding—generated by the Gonski model, shows indexation in secondary schools falling to only 2.9 per cent and 3.8 per cent for primary schools. The executive director of the association, Geoff Newcombe, said the minister's promise that no school would lose a dollar now looked 'hollow'.


Can the minister confirm that indexation levels under the new model are as low as 2.9 per cent? Have further details been released to the sector on indexations since 22 May? How can the government assure all schools that they will now not lose a dollar under this model, if adopted, when indexation is in the range of two to four per cent rather than the approximately six per cent as is the current funding model—in other words, can the minister assure schools that they will not lose dollars in real terms over the next quadrennium of funding rather than his hollow promise at the moment that they will not lose one dollar. We know it would be a $4.2 billion cut to non-government schools if the indexation is not at six per cent but as low as zero. Will the minister make the policy and technical work being undertaken publicly available to all schools? 



Finally, there are other issues I would like to raise about literacy and numeracy, the Australian National Audit Office report and the paltry response of the government to the Gonski review. If I get another opportunity, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will do that. As you would know, it is a five-minute opportunity to question the minister and then others will seek to have an opportunity. Should I get another opportunity, I would like to question the minister about the Australian National Audit Office report which found that the $540 million Smarter Schools National Partnership for Literacy has been a complete failure— (Time expired)

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:12):  I wish that the shadow spokesperson for education in the coalition was better informed about education matters and policies. In putting this question to me, he has conveniently ignored the fact that the coalition has on the record some $2.8 billion of cuts to education funding. That $2.8 billion cut to education funding is something that the shadow minister himself has confirmed. On Meet the Presson 14 August last year he was asked by Paul Bongiorno: 


To be clear, you'll look for savings in your portfolio of education?


And Mr Pyne responded:


Well, we need to have savings across the budget.



I do not think it can be any clearer that it is specifically the goal of the coalition, in order to meet their savings target of some $70 billion, that nearly $3 billion of that will come from education, and the shadow minster is now on the record on that very matter.




Mr Pyne:
  On a point of order: the minister is talking about cuts to the education budget, but I specifically asked him about cuts to the Computers in Schools program.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  The member for Sturt will resume his seat. The minister is answering the question and he will continue with his response.




Mr GARRETT:
  This particular issue of cuts that have been promised by the coalition is germane to the Digital Education Revolution because the coalition themselves have a commitment to cut over $600 million from that program. The government is very proud of the delivery of Computers in Schools. Not only did we set ourselves the goal of a one to one ratio of delivery for students between years 9 to 12 but we have achieved that goal. More than 950,000 devices are being supplied to students, which is well above the national target of some 786,000.


The fact is that we promised we would bring schools into the digital age by providing enough computers for every senior high school student in the country and we have delivered on that promise. The current agreements end on 30 June, as the shadow minister should know, and we have made provisions in the budget to support new arrangements following consultations with states and territories and the non-government sector. That is entirely appropriate and the right way for us to go about managing the ongoing issues of computer access for kids in schools around Australia. I think the fact is that we have achieved a historic goal. We have put a computer in the hands of every Australian senior high school student. It is important now to recognise that the scheme was not intended to replace existing investments that were made by education authorities in new technologies; it was to provide a significant funding injection to level the playing field and bring all Australian schools into the 21st century and it is up to those who run the schools to keep them there.


I have established the Digital Education Advisory Group, a group of leading education and IT experts. They will provide us with advice on the next steps towards transforming teaching and learning through technology and I expect their strategy soon.


The shadow minister asked me about the Gonski review and the government's approach to the recommendations of Mr Gonski. We have said consistently that no school will lose a single dollar as a consequence of any recommendations that emerge from Mr Gonski and also that indexation will be part of any future model. I will make just one point to the shadow minister and the opposition: they have walked away from this important review. For the first time in nearly 40 years we have had an eminent panel consider closely the extremely critical question of funding for school education, and Mr Pyne, the shadow education spokesman, has completely walked away from it.


I am pleased to say that the remaining stakeholders in the education community have not walked away from it. We have participation by state governments and their officials, by the independent school sector and by a range of organisations with a genuine interest in the potential for funding reform in education, including the Australian Education Union, the Independent Education Union, the principals' councils and the parent councils. All of these organisations recognise it is in the best interests of our students that we have a funding model in this country that is fair, effective, transparent and does the job it is intended to do. We will continue to pursue the work that is underway on Gonski and there will be more to say about this later. (Time expired)

"Symon, Mike, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Mr SYMON
 (Deakin) (10:17):  Minister, with regard to funding for education in the budget, I am interested in building on the great work that the federal Labor government has done over the last four budgets. In my electorate of Deakin and also across Australia the federal Labor government has made a significant investment in local schools. Of course, by far the bulk of this investment has been in primary schools. Every primary school has had the opportunity to add a new building or refurbish their facilities to make them better places to teach and learn.


Every single member of the opposition voted against any of our schools getting money under the Building the Education Revolution program. They did not want it to happen. But in my electorate of Deakin every single school I have been to thinks it is a fantastic program. I would invite anyone who is listening to contact those schools and come out and talk to them about what they have got from the program. And it is still going on; they are not quite finished yet; there are more to be opened next year. These are especially the ones that have taken time to consult and to argue the point and actually get what they want out of the program. We have had some fantastic results with funding for our schools locally, particularly schools that broke out of the state government template and decided they wanted to do something different—and in the end they did. They got bigger and better buildings and, in many cases, had money left over to do extra building or extra refurbishments at the end of the job. We still have some of those going on right now. Schools such as Warranwood Primary, just out of my electorate, Heathmont East Primary and Antonio Park Primary got two major projects instead of one and that is great for them.


As I said, there is still more to come on stream but many of these schools in the electorate, although they now have great buildings and are great places to teach, also need ongoing investment because there is no point in just putting money into capital and then not being able to use the new learning spaces and the new technology that comes with them. Many of these schools have not seen a new building since the 1950s and when you go out there today the contrast is huge. Throughout the process I worked closely with schools. As I said, that is the way it worked best. Rather than just having the state government direct how federal government funds were spent, the local member was involved right down to that level. And it certainly shows. I congratulate each and every member of the Labor side of the House who went out and did that during the rollout. It shows now and it will show for decades to come.


Secondary schools, of course, have been the beneficiaries of the Digital Education Revolution, which the member for Sturt does not seem impressed with. Again, I invite people to come out to secondary schools in my electorate and ask them what they think of the 4,000 computers that have gone into secondary schools in the electorate of Deakin. They are very happy because they had nothing but they now have a lot. There are some problems getting data out of the Victorian state government with regard to this, so the best thing to do is go and talk to the schools.


Minister, I am interested in the $54 million you announced in May this year in response to the Chief Scientist's Mathematics, engineering and science in the national interest report. In particular, I am interested in the $16.9 million of the $54 million to deliver programs for Australian students. I note that that included $6½ million for CSIRO to expand the Scientist and Mathematicians in Schools program, taking interesting maths and science lessons to schools across Australia, particularly rural and regional schools. There was $5 million for Science Connections, to support the Science by Doing and Primary Connections projects, providing extra online teaching resources with leadership from the Australian Academy of Science. There was $3 million to fund National Support and Advice for Teachers, a new service for maths and science teachers to help them deliver stimulating and safe lessons. There was also an amount of $2.4 million to support the participation of Australia's most talented science and maths secondary students in the International Mathematics and Science Olympiad.


As I said, the important part about providing funding to schools is not only what is done on the outside but what we keep doing on the inside. Minister, can you provide me with further advice on the implementation of these programs and how they will improve the teaching of maths and science not only at schools in Deakin but right across Australia?

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:22):  I thank the member for Deakin for his question and also for his role as chair of the caucus education and skills committee. It is a very good question because it comes about at a time when we recognise there are additional needs in education to ensure that we have enough kids at school in maths and science and enough people to teach maths and science as well. But I just want to address one matter before I answer his question. Regrettably, the coalition spokesperson for education, the member for Sturt, has now fled the Federation Chamber. He is nowhere to be seen. He came in here and asked one question and had a typical spray and now he has departed again. If anything says to the public how seriously this shadow minister takes education it is the fact that he can only turn up to the Federation Chamber for 10 minutes and ask one question of me, the Minister for School Education, when he has the opportunity to be here for a full hour. The best that Mr Pyne could manage was 10 minutes and one question. It reminds me of his contribution when the Gonski report was released. Within 15 minutes of the report being released, the member for Sturt had condemned it. Apparently he was able to speed read the work that Mr Gonski and his eminent panel had undertaken. There were hundreds of pages of findings and recommendations in that report—deliberations in which the public and the education community had been involved—but the shadow minister for education, the member for Sturt, spent about 15 minutes musing and then dismissed it out of hand.


I want to respond to a question that the member for Sturt put as he fled the Federation Chamber, and that concerns the Literacy and Numeracy National Partnership. The fact is that the Literacy and Numeracy National Partnership is making a difference for the students it was intended to benefit. Yes, the ANAO report came out, but it compared the average results of all students in those schools to the average results in other schools. But the focus of this national partnership was on the students struggling in literacy and numeracy, those students who were below the national minimum standard. The fact is that we have seen improvements in moving those kids who are at that level. For example, between 2008 and 2011, 70 per cent of schools in this national partnership have reduced the proportion of their students who were below the minimum standard for year 3 reading and, between 2008 and 2011, 80 per cent of schools reduced the proportion of students who were below the minimum standard for year 5 maths. It is very important to get that on the record. It is regrettable that the member for Sturt did not hang around long enough to understand what a difference this government's investment is making in relation to this issue. 


The member for Deakin asks me a very important question about the budget commitment to the specific issue of increasing the opportunity for the delivery of improved maths and science teaching in schools. What I can say is this: the chief scientist was asked to investigate this matter by the Prime Minister. When the chief scientist investigated that matter, he came to the view that it was important that we were able to provide additional support across a range of program areas that had already been underway, including the ones that the member for Deakin mentions such as Science by Doing, and we were able to bring forward additional investment of some $54 million in the budget. Around that particular commitment nearly $11 million went to improving the quality of teacher training, especially for prospective teachers. That work now to be considered and under way will lift the opportunity for young students who are interested in graduating and teaching maths and science to have additional support and input, particularly through professional development provision of teaching instruction and the like. There is $3 million for national support and advice for teachers, including a national advisory and linking service. There are online videos, which I think are a particularly useful device to illustrate new funding standards for practical activities for school science laboratories. And, of course, there is the $3 million that the member mentioned for science connections programs. This investment that the Gillard Labor government is making is an especially important one, not only for the teachers and the students in the electorate of the member for Deakin but Australia-wide. We recognise that having high levels of proficiency in maths and science is absolutely central to enabling us to lead in technological advances to continue to build prosperity in the future—something that this government is fully committed to.

Firstly, Minister, your department commissioned a number of reports from Access Economics on workforce modelling and the cost of child care. The reports I specifically refer to are Access Economics's Early childhood education and care modelling unpublished report for the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations in July 2009 and Access Economics's Early childhood education and care workforce study unpublished report for the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations in October 2009. Minister, I ask why these reports have not been made public and I also ask you to undertake to provide me with copies of these Access Economics reports. Secondly, is the government considering directly subsidising the wages of child-care workers?

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:28):  I thank the shadow spokesperson for her questions. On that first question, I am happy to take it on notice and we will provide an appropriate answer once we have sought advice from the department. On the second question, what I would say is this: again, as I was saying in response to the question of the member for Sturt before he fled the Federation Chamber having been in here for all of 10 minutes instead of the one hour that we spend in here for this important consideration in detail, the level of investment that the government has made in early childhood education and care is substantial. In fact, if we look back we can see that there has never been a time when a federal government has provided so much policy rigour, so much lift in terms of effort and so much specific support in terms of ensuring that young children get the appropriate care and sometimes instruction that best suits them before they enter the school years. This is an investment of $22 billion by this government—triple what was spent by the previous government. Attached to that is a National Quality Framework making sure that as a nation we recognise the importance of the quality components of early child care, professionalisation of the workforce and lifting of standards in childcare centres. All of these things are absolutely central to the approach that this government has taken and a great deal of the very good work that has been done by my colleague Minister Ellis.


We are also working very closely with the states in terms of the delivery of a commitment for universal access for kids in the year before school through the delivery of some $990 million to ensure that universal access, the goal we have set ourselves, can be reached.




Ms Ley:
  If you don't answer the question, I'll assume the answer is yes.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Farrer should know it is not question time. The minister has the call.




Mr GARRETT:
  I do wish that those opposite would let sink in the significant scope and reach of the investments that this government has been making in early child care and education. It is a case that there have been people coming into the parliament—and certainly we had United Voice and others in the parliament earlier this week—raising issues around the wages and conditions of those who work in early childhood in the early childhood centres and more broadly. We understand that that is a significant commitment that these people make. But we understand and know that the professionalisation of this workforce means that for everybody who has made a commitment to work in early childhood care and education we have provided the opportunity for them by way of HECS and HELP relief. We have provided the opportunities for them by the recognition of prior learning. We have provided opportunities for them by making sure that the National Quality Framework and those measures that are identified in that framework are fully understood and communicated to them. We acknowledge that there are issues for them and respect the fact that they are able to come into the parliament and put their views to the members on both sides of the House.


What was disappointing to me, though, I have to say, as I respond to the question of the member opposite is that I do not hear anything from the opposition about our commitment to the National Quality Framework. I do not hear anything from the opposition about providing a substantial level of support for early childhood care and education. I do not hear anything from the opposition about encouraging their states, and particularly states that now have a coalition perspective, to get behind this reform and recognise what a profound difference it can make to the lives of kids in early childhood, particularly in that transition period as they go into school.


Minister Ellis and I are constantly visiting these centres and we recognise that these reforms are already starting to bear fruit. We can see the tremendous enthusiasm and support that many in the sector have not only for the National Quality Framework but for making sure that the young people under their care are appropriately and well looked after but additionally are provided with that level of care and some learning that equips them well as they enter school. For parents, this is one of the most significant things that their children can do. We understand how important it is and will continue with this work. (Time expired)

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (10:33):  I am very glad to have the opportunity today to make some inquiries of the minister in relation to matters concerning education in the budget. There is a considerable amount of interest in my electorate in education and recognition of the investments made by this government which have delivered great educational outcomes through great capital investments and display the ongoing commitment of this government to education at a very local and very practical level in the electorate of La Trobe. I take this opportunity to convey to the minister something that was passed on to me with great emphasis last week at Belgrave Heights Christian College. It is pertinent in light of the comments made by the member for Sturt earlier today in relation to computers in schools. I was asked very clearly to convey the thanks of that particular school for the significant investment in computers that have assisted it in delivering education to its students. I have had the opportunity to see at that school some robotics education and other things being provided there that would not have been possible without the computers that we, the government, have committed to that one school in a very large electorate.


I should also say that they were very appreciative of the other considerable capital investments that have been made by this government in the school, not only through the BER program, which has delivered to them a really marvellous stadium, for which they are very appreciative, but also the construction of additional learning centres and a VCE study centre, through a capital grant. Also, there was a commitment to a discovery centre, which I was at the opening of last week. They are also to be the beneficiary of a trades training centre. So that one school alone demonstrates the wealth of commitments in education that we have made, and they are certainly very grateful for it.


Likewise, I was very pleased to be at one of the most recent openings of a BER building, this one in Narre Warren North Primary School. It is one of the oldest schools in my electorate. The school has not had a significant amount of capital expenditure on it in the past and certainly would not have been the beneficiary of capital expenditure had our colleagues opposite been in office. They were most appreciative of the school building, which has enabled them to come together as a school and continue on after more than a century in the local area.


Less positively, Minister—and I am sure it brings some pressure to bear in the context of the appropriations we are considering today—you will no doubt be aware of the Baillieu government's actions in education, which have seen a significant amount of money torn away from the education budget in Victoria, and it is from some of our most disadvantaged schools, it has to be said. For instance, some schools in Victoria will lose up to around $80,000 as a result of the Baillieu government's decision to cut the education maintenance allowance, combined with the scrapping of the $300 School Start Bonus, which has contributed to a $19 million saving for Ted Baillieu and the Victorian government. It is most unfortunate that while we are contributing significant amounts to education, and have done since we came to office, as has been the tradition of Labor, in Victoria we simply see Ted Baillieu not only skimping on education but in fact cutting away at the things that have been delivered. It is a neat contrast that we have been providing a Schoolkids Bonus at the same time as the Baillieu government is pulling away money from schools and from families.


In addition to this, some of my schools have particularly raised with me the issue of the Baillieu government effectively taking away $7 million in federal funding promised to state schools under the National Literacy and Numeracy Partnerships. That has been specifically raised by Kambrya College with me. They are also very appreciative of the significant investments that this federal government has made in education. They contrast it with the actions of the state government.


A number of schools in my electorate have an interest in and a connection with remote communities and Indigenous communities, and have a particular interest in closing the gap in education, and across the board. Upwey High School, St Josephs in Ferntree Gully and Mater Christi have all expressed an interest in those issues, and I am sure there are more schools in the area that take an interest in those issues. I would be grateful, Minister, for some further information about what the budget delivers and what we have delivered overall since coming to office in relation to closing the gap in Indigenous education.

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:38):  I thank the member for La Trobe for that question. It certainly is the case that, for Labor members of parliament, one of the most important things they do is maintain close contact with their school community, because there is such a great deal that has happened in education since we came into government. The fact is that there has never been a period of time when the level of investment by a federal government in education has been so significant and far reaching and the level of attention to policy reform has been so specific and the delivery of support into every school in the country has been so evident. I am absolutely thrilled to hear from the member for La Trobe that, for example, the trades training centre investment this government is making is appreciated in her electorate. Before the member for Sturt, the shadow minister for education, fled the Federation Chamber, having been in here for all of ten minutes and having asked one question, I was making the point that the coalition has on record cuts of $2.8 billion in education—the spirit of which was confirmed by the shadow minister in his interview with Paul Bongiorno last year—including a commitment that would have seen over a billion dollars cut out of the trades training centre program. It is extraordinary when you think about it, because those trades training centres are making an incredible difference in schools that have access to them right around the country.


I know that for members—the member for La Trobe in particular—this is even more important when you consider some of the really difficult issues that are emerging as the Baillieu government starts to make cuts in education, including cuts to TAFE training in Victoria—which, I have to say, I think has always been one of the best TAFE systems in the country. Victoria's economy in the past, under the stewardship of Premier Bracks and Premier Brumby, was in a position to capitalise on the need for well-trained, well-skilled people to come through the school system and into TAFE. Now, of course, that is jeopardised as well. I am particularly concerned to hear that there are threats to the investment that this Commonwealth government—this Labor government—is making across areas like the literacy and numeracy national partnership. I have always said to the states that we want to provide that extra support and investment that we think can make a difference in school systems. It is not intended that states should simply take advantage of the fact that we have a profound commitment to education and seek to defray or reduce their investment as a consequence.


The member for La Trobe asked me a question that would be of interest to her and to some of the schools and her constituents, including St Joseph's in Ferntree Gully, about the commitment to Indigenous education. This is something that I know that everybody in the House recognises as an important and ongoing issue and a challenge for governments, including for the federal government. I am extremely pleased to say that we are starting to see signs of progress in Indigenous communities, including in the areas of education. Even this morning we saw a report in the Australian about the kind of uptake that we are seeing both in employment and last week, under Minister Macklin, in terms of the provision of housing. We are genuinely making progress there, and the budget was very clear that we were going to continue to provide that level of investment.


I was particularly keen that we were able to have substantial delivery through the budget in Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory—some $3.4 billion in the 10-year package—and that goes across a range of areas: primary health care, food security, making sure that we have got access to quality education for Aboriginal kids, and nearly $20 million for 50 additional Working on Country ranger positions. I know that in my previous portfolio I was particularly keen to see that happen, and in the budget we have provided the opportunity for Indigenous ranger cadetships to be applied in pilots around the country as well, and I announced that last week. 


In particular, I want to draw attention to two things of importance. Teach Remote is another investment to attract and retain high calibre teachers in remote areas—some $14 million that we have invested there. That is something that I think students and potential teachers in the member for La Trobe's electorate would be interested in. There is more we can do, but we have already— (Time expired)

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (10:43): I will be brief so that others can have an opportunity to ask questions. My questions are regarding the BER and, specifically, the collapse of the building company Reed Construction. Minister, are you aware that the company Reed Construction went into liquidation last week and that builders across northern New South Wales are owed approximately, to my understanding, $12 million? I would like a response for my constituents, particularly Chris Catterall, a builder in Moree who is owed $642,000; Lachlan Hall from Warialda, who is owed approximately $80,000; and Bill Crawford from Moree, who is owed just over $9,000. Minister, I would like your understanding as to the fact that this was a Commonwealth-funded program and as to what response you will be making to these builders. Also, Minister, I would like you to comment on the fact that a program that was designed to stimulate the economy during the global financial crisis will ultimately lead to the financial ruination of building companies right throughout the north-west—on top of the collapse of TCT Constructions, who were doing work for Laing O'Rourke in Dubbo a couple of years ago, which left subcontractors in Dubbo in my electorate out of pocket by about $2 million.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (10:45):  Earlier this year the new childcare ratios for zero-to-24-month-old children were implemented. This has seen childcare fees increased by an estimated 11 per cent across the board this year, according to surveys undertaken. I know that in my electorate increases of these levels have occurred and it has put enormous strains on the budgets of local families. Over the next few years lower ratios for older children will also be introduced. My question, for either Minister Garrett or Minister Ellis, is: what do you estimate will be the further increase in the costs of operating childcare centres once these new ratios are introduced? It is a very specific question.

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:46):  To the member for Parkes, I am aware that Reed Constructions have entered voluntary administration. I should point out to the member that in fact responsibility for the BER is in Minister Shorten's hands and I will certainly direct your question to his office for an additional answer. What I can say is that we know that Ferrier Hodgson have been appointed as the administrator. We recognise, as I know everybody here would, that it does impose significant and considerable difficulties on builders such as the builder in your electorate that you referred to when a building company of this size enters into these difficulties. We do know that any claims for subcontractors for unpaid moneys are now managed as appropriate by the insolvency practitioner.


But I would make the point in concluding this answer and before I hand over to Minister Ellis that this is a matter that Barry O'Farrell as Premier of New South Wales cannot ignore. These are issues, as I understand it, that in part go to the delivery of projects to the New South Wales government. On that basis, as the New South Wales government has effective on-ground responsibility for the delivery of those projects, it is entirely appropriate that the New South Wales government be held to account for the delivery of the investment that the Commonwealth provided, through the states, for Building the Education Revolution.



Mr Coulton interjecting—




Mr GARRETT:
  There is an interjection from the member opposite, but the fact of the matter is simply this: it is up to those state authorities who are in receipt of the investment that is provided by the Commonwealth to ensure that it is appropriately and properly given effect to. That is what has to happen. If there is a reason why a particular builder finds itself going into liquidation on a matter of delivery through the state entities then clearly it is a responsibility of the state government to be able to answer that question as well. I will conclude my answer there, because I think Minister Ellis is going to take up a question from the member for Aston.

Ms KATE ELLIS
 (Adelaide—Minister for Employment Participation and Minister for Early Childhood and Childcare) (10:48):  Thank you for the question with regard to the government's national quality framework, which we have been pursuing in partnership with every state and territory government of all different political persuasions. The member for Aston asked some questions about affordability in particular. I would like to point out that there is nobody who is more concerned about the affordability of child care than the Gillard government. We do not just talk about that; we showed that we believe it by investing some $19.9 billion over the next four years in directly assisting Australian families with the cost of their child care. That is some triple the amount that the Howard government was investing. So when we talk about affordability I think is very important that we actually recognise that we have increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We have increased the cap on that rebate from $4,354 per child per year to $7,500, and that has had a very real impact on the affordability of child care. We know the analysis shows that a family in 2004 who were spending 13 per cent of their disposable income are now spending 7.5 per cent of that income. That is not to say that this is an ongoing issue. We know that Australian families are struggling with cost of living. That is exactly why we are investing this additional funding, and that is exactly why we have committed to continuing to work to ensure that child care is both affordable and quality.


I would say the figure that the member for Aston referred to, which has been in the media, is not an accurate figure in regard to increases. If we want to have a look at the figures we have, we know that the new national quality standards came into effect from 1 January this year. The only official figures that we have seen since then were the CPI figures. I would say that the CPI increase for child care for the first quarter of 2012 under the National Quality Framework was less than in the same quarter of each of the last two years of the Howard government, when they were doing absolutely nothing to improve the quality of care. So, I think we need to get the facts on the table.


The other thing that I would just like to address is why it is that we are pursuing these changes, because I know the member that asked the question has made some statements which are not accurate in the House.



Honourable members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! This is not question time. It is consideration in detail.




Ms KATE ELLIS:
  I am answering the question. The member opposite might be interested, and I think the families of Aston deserve to have the very best start for their children. The member has stood in the chamber and said that there is no discernible benefit from increasing the quality of care, which is rubbish, frankly. That is absolute rubbish. We now have a body of evidence which shows us that we have more children in care than we have ever had before in this nation's history. We have over 1,321,00 children who will be using care in the next year. We also have all of the evidence that shows that this is when 90 per cent of brain development occurs. What happens in the critical early years will affect children right throughout the course of their lives. It will affect their educational outcomes, it will affect their social outcomes and it will affect their development outcomes. All of the research shows that the best way we can foster the best start in life for these children is by ensuring that they have well-trained and qualified staff who know how to get the best out of their learning and who have the ability to give them supervision and attention. That is why we are proud of these reforms. That is why every government, including his state Liberal government, has signed up because we know it is important to Australia's future that we give kids the best chance.


In terms of what we believe the increase will be, we have done extensive modelling on this. We know that we expect the national average peak increase to be $8.67 per week. Of course we recognise that that varies from centre to centre and it varies from state to state, but that is the best independent economic modelling advice that we have on what the cost of these changes will be. I believe that the children of Aston are worthy of this. I believe that the government has invested triple the investment of the Howard government to ensure that child care can become more affordable. We have committed to continuing to do that, and we have been upfront about the costs of it.


There is a case in terms of child development, there is a case in terms of child safety, but there is also a case in terms of national productivity. We know that if we want the best developed workforce of the future and the best educated children coming through we need to invest early and save money later on, and we are very, very proud to be working in partnership with our states and territories to be delivering just that. I would say that it is about time the member for Aston stood up and told his electorate the truth and also stood up for the families— (Time expired)

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (10:54):  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I have become aware the longer I am the member for Parramatta that how profoundly different the experience of children can be as they approach school years and get in to school. There are almost two completely different worlds. There is the world of Westmead Public School which is one of my best schools. It is a centre for excellence, it has a great cohort of parents who are mainly double professional career families, it has a lot of skilled migrants and a strong commitment to education. You will find it is an incredibly good school with a very active P&C. The children are engaged in extracurricular activity in fine arts and high-level sport as well as their educational activities. These are kids that are in every way being given what they need to fly, regardless of what their capacity is.


There is a child I met a number of years ago when I was up at Telopea Railway Station. She first started wandering down across the train line which, at that point, did not have a gate. She would wander across that train line and across Adderton Road, which is a main road, to get a carton of milk every morning and then go back. She was about four. As the years progressed she started bringing down her younger brother, who was still in nappies, and they would wander across the train line and head down to get a carton of milk every morning. It was in a very short time that, in the only way I can describe it, they started to get the mark of poverty; that slightly grey skin and wariness in their eyes. I watched them over those two years and thought: 'This is a remarkable young girl. She has everything in her that she needs to do well in life: she's committed, she's loyal, she's making things happen, she clearly gets herself out of bed and into school uniform. She does that.' I asked her one day and she said her mum was still asleep. She was a remarkable young girl, but you know that when she reached school age she probably would not have had the parental assistance in learning to read, learning to count and all the things that parents do for you. They walk up the stairs and count and they read to you and show you, before you get to school, how to learn.


These are two completely different experiences of school, and I am well aware that we need to be working at both ends. We need to make sure that a person can stand. We also need to make sure that person can fly if they can. There has been a considerable investment in education by this government—a doubling of investment in education and some great programs that have been rolled out in Parramatta—but I would like to hear from both ministers how we are addressing the needs of both of those groups of children.

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:57):  I thank the member for Parramatta. She is absolutely right. One of the key things about the findings and recommendations of the Gonski review was that where we have concentrated disadvantage existing within schools then, no matter what a student's capacity might be, they will be prevented from realising their full potential unless we ensure that we are providing the necessary support to them in those school years, including early childhood, primary and secondary. I am pleased to know that when it comes to that level of investment this government has invested some $2.5 billion in the Smarter Schools National Partnerships, and that includes investing in schools which are described as having low socioeconomic communities. In particular, in Parramatta there has been a significant investment in those national partnerships that I am particularly pleased to be able to identify for the member.


It is especially pleasing for me to see that we have provided a great deal of support for schools. Catherine McAuley Westmead has received $2 million of support for learning areas and technical applied studies facilities and the like. Schools like Mother Teresa Primary School under the BER received significant investment. In low socioeconomic areas of investment we have provided investment into schools like Arthur Phillip High School, Maryland Public School and Rydalmere Public School. All of these schools have received additional support and investment for their students and over time we expect to continue to see the fruits of this investment start to emerge. We recognise that the high level of support and the great priority that the Gillard government has placed on education is intended to do just that: help these students, including the students that the member for Parramatta referred to.


Remember the context: more transparency than ever for parents in the community with the My School website; a national curriculum, with the implementation now underway around Australia in English, maths, science and history; for the first time, national professional qualifications and standards for teachers; national partnerships, including the ones I have mentioned, on teacher quality and supporting low SES communities; and a national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan to make sure that Indigenous kids around Australia get the support that they need as well. We are absolutely committed to making sure that these students and these schools continue to get the support that they need within the context of understanding what makes a difference, including teacher quality and early intervention for students, particularly those who may have learning difficulties or a disability or who may come from a low socioeconomic background. I was so pleased to visit the Macarthur Girls High School in the member for Parramatta's electorate—we had a fantastic session at that high school—and I could see how well the Macarthur girls were doing. Yes, they have received some support from the federal government; but, when I go to the My School website and look at their NAPLAN tests, I can see that they are achieving a great deal.


I will not ask the minister to jump up for the last minute, unless she is keen to take the call—




Ms Kate Ellis:
  No.




Mr GARRETT:
  I might then provide an additional answer to a question that was put by the member for Farrer. With regard to early childhood education and childcare reports, I am advised that the Productivity Commission report and interim response is on the DEEWR website, and the Access Economics report is on the COAG website. So I think that is evidence enough of the delivery of transparency for these reports—to those who take the time to listen.



During this consideration in detail of the budget appropriation before us, the member for Sturt, the shadow spokesperson for education, came in here for all of 10 minutes, asked one question and then fled the Federation Chamber. All that he said about education was that he wants to cut $2.8 billion out of the sector. All he said about the Gonski review and the important reforms that lie within it—one of the most important and significant pieces of policy discussion that we have had before us as a parliament—was that he has ruled that out of court all together, and he has confirmed that there would be further cuts to education funding. This Labor government is fully committed to continuing its support for education, as evidenced by the appropriations in this budget. (Time expired)

Last year, the government announced the Building Australia's Future Workforce Package, and members of the House will be pleased to know it is already benefiting more than 230,000 people. Protecting jobs has been the No. 1 priority of the Gillard government from day one, and our measures reflect that commitment. Today there are more Australians in work than ever before. This budget delivers on the broader economic goals of the government, delivering on our commitment to return the budget to surplus and with surpluses growing over the forward estimates. We also want to spread the benefits of the resources boom to help families on low and middle incomes make ends meet, with the cost of living.


With regard to employment and workplace relations specifically, the 2012-13 budget delivers on a number of important measures in the Employment and Workplace Relations portfolio. And I must acknowledge the work of the Minister for Employment Participation in developing this package. We recognise that in order to maintain a strong economy we need to have highly skilled and experienced Australians in our workplaces. With a lifetime of work experience, older Australians have skills that make them extremely valuable assets to the workforce. The government will invest over $55 million over four years in additional assistance to harness the potential of mature-age workers. The jobs bonus will help challenge employers to recruit older job seekers, with corporate champions to help employers implement age-friendly work practices. The Mature Age Participation—Job Seeker Assistance Program is extending experience and career advice.


We are going to encourage parents to participate in work. We are also providing more childcare assistance, making it easier for parents of young children in receipt of income support to return to work, by extending the reach of the popular Jobs, Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance program. An extra $225 million over four years will enable 130,000 families to access this assistance. We have new employer initiatives for disadvantaged job seekers, including Wage Connect and the Disability Employment Broker Program. We also have employment advice services for vulnerable workers.


In conclusion, the government are committed to supporting jobs, and the 2012-13 budget continues to build on our investment in skills training and a range of assistance for Australian job seekers.

Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (12:18):  I have a series of questions for the minister. I will go through those questions and those you cannot answer we will put on notice. In relation to the department's incoming government brief, the red book, it states:


The department is already badly resourced.


According to the department's calculations, by what percentage is the department underfunded in the wake of the most recent cuts to the operating budget? How much additional funding will be cut in dollar terms? Did the department advise the government against further funding cuts? Which areas of departmental operations will have the largest redundancies and what will be the reduction across the various levels of seniority within the department?


On the issue of expenses, I ask the minister: what will be the impact of further funding cuts to consular services? Are more Australians travelling overseas and by what amount, and is there an increased consular case workload as a result? Is there sufficient capacity within the department to deal with a major crisis involving large numbers of Australians needing consular support overseas? Is that capacity similar to the past or less? Are Austrade officers in posts being seconded to provide consular support? If so, in which posts and what percentage of their time is being taken up by consular support?


Regarding AusAID, I have a number of questions about the independent review of aid effectiveness. Recommendation 39 of the Australian government's Independent Review of Aid Effectiveness says:


The scale–up of the aid program to 0.5 per cent of GNI should be subject to the progressive achievement of predetermined hurdles. 


Have these hurdles been determined? If so, are they publicly available? If the hurdles or benchmarks have not been imposed, why not? How will AusAID be measured against these benchmarks and who will undertake the assessment?


In relation to salary supplements, does AusAID recruit nationals of the countries in which it operates? How does AusAID determine salaries for nationals so recruited? Does AusAID supplement or top up salaries for some foreign nationals who work for their governments? Does AusAID supplement or top up salaries of public servants in other countries? If so, what measures does AusAID put in place to prevent a conflict of interest? How many public servants are in receipt of AusAID top-up payments? What is the level of the top-up payments as a percentage of their government salary? Is the government of each country notified of all employees in receipt of top-up payments?


On the question of domestic lobbying in the aid budget, how much of taxpayer funds are diverted to domestic awareness raising or lobbying activities? Are organisations in receipt of AusAID funding allowed to use taxpayer funding to lobby for increased funding from AusAID? How does this ban on lobbying for increases reconcile with the vocal and high-profile campaign for an increase in the aid budget to 0.5 per cent or 0.7 per cent of GNI, depending upon the organisation? How does AusAID prevent development organisations from using taxpayer funding to support this lobbying?


I have a number of questions on the campaigns on sexually transmitted diseases. Has Caritas been successful in winning tenders to promote awareness of STI? In particular, is Caritas actively promoting the use of condoms as part of that campaign? If not, was AusAID aware of the fact that Caritas would not promote the use of condoms and why was it awarded that tender?


What is the acceptable level of cost transfer back to headquarters of organisations involved in delivering the aid program? What percentage of a given program is attributed to offshore costs by World Vision, Oxfam and Save the Children, for example?


Is AusAID aware of reports that its funding of PNG police officers has created a virtual private security force that largely protects Malaysian logging interests? What steps has AusAID taken to ensure that its funding is not being used for such purposes?


How much money has been spent to date on the Australian Civilian Corps? How many people have been deployed? How many people have registered to be part of the Civilian Corps? How many of these are Australian public servants? How many people are involved in managing the program in Canberra? What is the cost of administering the program compared with the cost of deployment?

Dr EMERSON
 (Rankin—Minister for Trade and Competitiveness) (12:23):  In respect of the first set of questions relating to the resourcing of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I will seek to provide answers where we reasonably can. But a number of these matters may well be cabinet-in-confidence and we, like all governments of whatever political persuasion, will not breach that confidentiality. Yes, efficiency dividends have been applied to agencies and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is not exempt from those efficiency dividends, nor would it expect to be. In the context of bringing the budget back to surplus, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was able to announce the establishment of a consulate in Chengdu in western China, a city of some eight million people. The establishment of this consulate is a very important part of the Australia in the Asia Century white paper endeavour. We want to increase our presence in China. We already have a presence in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Here is a fourth presence. We will continue to look at our consular presence around the world. But we need to do so understanding the budget constraints that apply as we return the budget to surplus. I can also confirm that we are establishing a presence in Senegal in French-speaking Africa. A lot of Australian mining companies have interests and prospective interests in that part of the world. Even in the context of what is a tough budgetary situation for all, we are able to announce meaningful new policies in that area.


Are more Australians travelling overseas? Yes, they are. That is a reflection, in part, of the strength of the Australian dollar, which is a vote of confidence in the management of this economy. Armed with valuable Australian dollars more people are travelling overseas; therefore, on occasions extra consular assistance is sought. I know in Phuket, Thailand, for example, a lot of work is done by our post to provide consular assistance to tourists there. I will seek to provide information, where we possibly can, to satisfy the questioning of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.


In relation to AusAID and recommendation 39 of the review about predetermined hurdles and GNI, it is now well known that we have pushed out by one year the achievement of 0.5 per cent of GNI. I understood that this did have the support of the coalition. I am able to give the assurance that, where we are reasonably able to do so, we will provide further information to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.


In relation to domestic lobbying by non-government organisations, I make the general point that any expenditure by AusAID in order to qualify as overseas development assistance must be what is called 'ODA-able'. You cannot simply generate spending proposals and then expect that to qualify, otherwise we would be in the situation where all sorts of activities are lumped into the foreign aid budget, and we want to avoid that where it is not warranted. But, again, I will get information. In relation to the broader issue of lobbying for increases in ODA as a proportion of gross national income, of course, non-government organisations have done that and will continue to do so.


On Caritas, yes, we will get information about any contracts with them and the issue of sexually transmitted diseases and the use of condoms. I must say the suggestions or implications by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that AusAID is funding the PNG Police Force in order to protect the illegal lobbying is a long way out there, just the other side of the Milky Way. I will seek to get information on that, but I think that there is a pretty serious allegation there. We will seek to do the right thing and provide information where we reasonably can but within the context of both reasonableness when it come to the burdens of the department and cabinet confidentiality.

Having come to the portfolio of trade in September or so of 2010, it came to my attention that no progress had been made during the period of the previous government from 2005 through to November 2007. A whole series of negotiations or meetings had occurred, but, in fact, no progress had been made.


We have continued to press China on this. There are some terribly vexed issues in any negotiation of this sort between countries such as Australia and China, which has 1.32 billion people. Frankly, in order for this to be progressed successfully it would need a level of bipartisanship, and it does not enjoy that. This is a fundamental problem because the coalition, having initiated these negotiations, is now saying in respect of foreign investment by China in agricultural land that it wants to drop the threshold for private foreign investment from $244 million to as little as $30 million. That would be the end of any discussion on a free trade agreement between Australia and China because China would see that as very discriminatory against it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on 19 October last year, had urged that we accelerate negotiations for the successful completion of an Australia-China free trade agreement and the very next day her leader said no, that it should be put on the backburner and Japan should be prioritised. In order for this agreement ever to materialise, we cannot have Senator Barnaby Joyce and others running around with anti-China rants and then, with the prospect of a discussion paper coming out, suggesting that we drop that threshold, which I am quite sure from discussions with my Chinese counterparts would mean the end of any possibility of a free trade agreement.


What the Chinese have done is approached us about a free trade agreement but with a real emphasis on agriculture. Again, you would think that the coalition would support that, at least the National Party side, because China did give access to New Zealand to the agricultural demand of a massive country and have said to us, 'We would contemplate giving you New Zealand style access.' That would be a huge boost to Australian farmers, particularly beef and dairy farmers.


There are great prospects here, but then we have part of the coalition actually working in the opposite direction. To the credit of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, she has been quite consistent on this, saying, 'Let's do it. It's an important deal.' But other parts of the coalition to which the Leader of the Opposition listens every day—and that includes Senator Barnaby Joyce—are saying, 'We're not very happy about China. We're very anxious about it. We don't necessarily think bringing a free trade agreement to a successful conclusion is a good idea.' So that bipartisanship is lost.


It is not lost upon the Chinese, I must say. They know that there is an alternative government in Australia that is saying that they are not sure about the wisdom of completing free trade negotiations. It would not just be in agriculture, I say to the member for Banks. It would be the diversification that we are seeking in services. We have so many Australian companies looking to diversify. A hundred of them accompanied me to China in August of last year on the biggest delegation to leave Australia's shores, I think. There is no better time, I say to the member for Banks, who has a very great fondness for Gough Whitlam, than the 40th anniversary of the official recognition of the People's Republic of China. It was one of the first steps that Gough Whitlam took when he was elected. He was elected in early December and by 21 December we had recognised officially the People's Republic of China.



Mr Melham interjecting—




Dr EMERSON:
  That is right. There is now this sense that we should use this opportunity. Let's use the fondness that exists between our two countries to complete those negotiations. But I have to say it would be very difficult to complete them when we have a divided coalition. I would urge the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to use her authority within the coalition to bring to heel the Barnaby Joyces, the anti-China rants, and see if we cannot actually get a true level of bipartisanship instead of people of good intent, such as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, saying the right thing but her leader and the aspiring Prime Minister of Australia saying exactly the opposite.

Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (12:33):  Minister, I now turn to the issue of the United Nations Security Council campaign for a temporary seat for 2013-14. What has been the total expenditure on the campaign, including staff seconded to the UNSC campaign? How many staff are working on the campaign? How many countries have pledged their votes in writing to Australia and how many have given verbal pledges? How many have indicated that they will not be voting for Australia? How many have said that they are undecided? Has there been an increase in the number of invitations to Australia to the leaders of other nations? What is the average cost of each visit? Typically what costs are borne by the Australian taxpayer of each visit? Has the department assessed the level of additional resources that will be needed if Australia is successful in its bid for a temporary seat? If so, how much will be required?


I refer the minister to Australia's promotion of its candidature for the UN Security Council. Has the department updated this big booklet or website to reflect the government's revised time frame for expanding overseas development aid? It still says that you are going to deliver five per cent of GNI by 2015. I also note that the member for Griffith is still described as the foreign minister in the booklet. Has this been updated? If not, why not? How much did it cost to produce the booklets? How many booklets were produced? How much would it cost to reprint all the booklets, if that has been done? Will the department remove the booklets with the factual errors from website and from broader circulation?


Was the foreign minister advised by the department to threaten Papua New Guinea that Australia would organise the world to isolate and condemn Papua New Guinea and impose sanctions if elections in Papua New Guinea were delayed?


Has the live cattle trade to Indonesia recovered to its pre-suspension levels? What has been the cost to Australia's cattle industry from the lesser demand from Indonesia for our livestock? Was there any understanding between the Australian government and the Indonesian government to secure a reduction in Schapelle Corby's sentence after the release of Indonesian minors from Australian jails? Was the possibility of juvenile detention for the Indonesian minors considered? Was the Prime Minister advised by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to personally telephone the so-called Bali boy after his arrest?


I note that the minister made mention of the new consulate in China. Did the department recommend a number of possible locations for a new consulate in China? What was the department's preferred location? Did the former foreign minister ever express his preference for the new consulate to be situated in Chongqing? If so, what were his reasons for selecting Chongqing as opposed to Chengdu or other locations?


Has the Australian government implemented all United Nations sanctions on Iran? Are the Australian government's actions in relation to the implementation of UN sanctions consistent with the actions of, for example, the United States and the European Union? What is the Australian government's official position towards Iran? Does the government believe that military action should be 'taken off the table'?


Has the United States embassy or the United States government and its officials raised the question of cuts to the Australian defence budget? If so, when and where did this take place and at what level did this representation occur?


Going to the minister's own portfolio, could the minister provide the current status of the Australia-Gulf Cooperation Council Free Trade Agreement negotiations and the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement? When was the last pre-negotiation consultation with Indonesia held? Have any pre-negotiation consultations been held since the Australian government announced its ban on live cattle exports to Indonesia? Could the minister also provide details of the Australia-Japan Free Trade Agreement, the Australia-South Korea Free Trade Agreement, PACER Plus and the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement? What positions has Australian taken during trade negotiations in relation to tariff reductions? Has Australia sought tariff reductions? What are the scale of those reductions? Has Australia sought zero tariffs during some negotiations? If so, for which commodities, and which countries have been asked to consider zero tariffs on Australian exports?

Dr EMERSON
 (Rankin—Minister for Trade and Competitiveness) (12:39):  In relation to the UN Security Council bid, within the bounds of reasonableness we will seek to provide relevant information. I am not by any means persuaded that it is in Australia's national interest to start articulating to the opposition and, through that process, to the Australian people and the public more generally exactly who has pledged what to whom. I am not sure that those countries would necessarily think that was a good idea. If you want to prejudice the Security Council bid—and maybe the coalition does—that would be a pretty good way of going about it. I imagine that some of these consultations and discussions about arrangements would be fairly confidential. So I am not going to commit that we will provide information about conversations that have been held with each and every country in relation to the UN Security Council bid. I would be interested—I have not caught up with the latest—in knowing whether the coalition has an official position of opposing that bid. Certainly, the request for information that is being sought seems to me to be designed to prejudice it.


I was asked whether Australia issues invitations to leaders of other nations to come to this country. Yes, things have moved on; Fortress Australia has been dismantled. That was through the fifties and sixties, when we in this country were very fearful of foreigners. People like Pauline Hanson still are, but I would hope that the coalition is not. Of course, we invite people from other countries to come to Australia.




Ms Julie Bishop:
  You're better than this, Craig.




Dr EMERSON:
  The deputy opposition leader says, 'You are better than this, Craig.' It is fascinating, when we are in the second decade of the 21st century, that the best question she is able to think up is: 'Do we invite leaders of other countries to this country?'




Ms Julie Bishop:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene. I asked if there had been an increase in the number of invitations and, if so, a whole series of things.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  The minister will allow the question and the member for Curtin will resume her seat.




Dr EMERSON:
  I am not sure that we keep records of the number of people we have asked to visit Australia over the last 20 or 30 years as a basis for providing this information. But I can tell you that if there were an increase it would be a good thing. I actually think it is great that we engage with countries. The coalition seems to have the view that international trade is fine, so long as it does not involve foreigners. We are actually quite keen to continue the internationalisation of the Australian economy.




Ms Julie Bishop:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene. I find that an offensive point by the minister. I am asking a very serious question about whether over the last 12 months there has been an increase in invitations to leaders of other nations. I am asking about the cost of each visit and what costs are borne by the Australian taxpayer. That is a perfectly respectable question to ask. The minister should take it seriously and not be so offensive.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister has the call and I ask him, in the spirit of this chamber, that he take the question, which is part of the standing orders of the Federation Chamber.




Dr EMERSON:
  I accept the question, and I am responding to it in the spirit in which it was asked. I find it one of the most extraordinary questions that I would expect to hear from a Deputy Leader of the Opposition; as if inviting leaders of other countries to this country is a bad thing and that somehow it will be exposed that, yes, we have been at it again—inviting leaders of other countries to this country and then paying some of their expenses. I am quite happy to provide the information wherever we can. I look forward to the comments of the coalition as to whether they think is a good idea of a bad idea to invite leaders, one by one, to this country.


I will now move on. In relation to Papua New Guinea, I cannot cover all of the questions that were raised. Obviously, there are going to be elections—I think they start next week and they will continue for some time—and that is a good thing. That is what Senator Carr wanted; he wanted those elections and they going to happen. I see that as an achievement rather than as a basis of criticism. On the live cattle trade, we are constantly in touch with the Indonesian authorities— (Time expired)

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Dr EMERSON
 (Rankin—Minister for Trade and Competitiveness) (12:44):  We now have the capacity for me to be able to give a full answer on this, rather than jam it in with numerous questions. The answer is that, in the last couple of days, two new countries have been admitted into the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement negotiations: they are Mexico and Canada. With the addition of Mexico and Canada, there are now 11 parties to the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement negotiations.


The concept here, I say to the member for Banks, is a very worthy one. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum was established by Australia on the initiative of, originally, Bob Hawke at the ministerial level, and then Paul Keating elevated it to the leadership level. It has been a very successful forum for trade liberalisation and economic policy cooperation across the Asia-Pacific. The aspiration is a free-trade area for Asia and the Pacific at some stage. Each of the nine parties to the trans-Pacific partnership negotiations is a member of APEC. So nine of the 21 economies are now involved in negotiation, which obviously is going to be a tough one in some areas, as every country has sensitive issues. If we can land this Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, we then have a very solid stepping stone towards a free-trade area for Asia and the Pacific. The addition of Canada and Mexico means that between them the TPP parties constitute 30 per cent of the world's gross domestic product, which is a big number.


The negotiations are going well in relation to what is called the text—that is, all of the legal work that needs to go in. But there will be very challenging negotiations about increased market access to each other's countries. I might even add, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked if we were requesting duty-free access to markets, that we ask for duty-free access to markets wherever we can possibly achieve it. My view is that, even if that involves phasing down tariffs over time, getting to zero is a very worthy objective. That is set out in the trade ministers' trans-Pacific partnership declaration that was issued in Honolulu last year: we are looking for duty-free access to markets. 


We are pragmatic about phasing down tariffs. Why wouldn't we be? In Australia that is exactly what we did previously. We had very high tariffs in the mid- to late-1980s which were inherited from previous coalition governments. Instead of going cold turkey and taking auto industry tariffs, for example, from 57.5 per cent to zero in one fell swoop, we phased them down. Whenever we have been involved in negotiations, such as in the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement, we have offered duty-free access to the Australian market. In the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement we offered duty-free access to the Australian market. We also have done it with other free trade agreements.


Our tariffs generally are around zero or five per cent. It is something we have done unilaterally over the years. Other countries have reduced their tariffs, and APEC has been a very effective forum, not so much for negotiations but for a sense of kindred spirit—that we know this is a community whose future path to prosperity and to a more decent society for people in poverty, so that they can be liberated from poverty, is to give them jobs through market access. Over the years, what has happened in APEC is that countries have voluntarily reduced their tariffs, not through negotiations but in the knowledge that other countries in the region were doing the same thing. So in regard to the Bogor goals, which were set out in 1994—there was a review recently—it is true that we not quite at zero, but tariffs have come down and, as a result, a lot of people who would not otherwise have jobs, including on the land, now have jobs. It has been a great success story. The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement can take that further by providing this important stepping stone to a free-trade area for Asia and the Pacific.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (12:49):  Minister, it has been well documented that the government is proposing to save $2.9 billion by deferring by one year the foreign aid target of 0.5 per cent of GNI. Can the minister advise the Committee of the process or criteria that were used to determine which regions or program line items that were previously projected across have been reduced or deferred? The reason I ask this is that it is not an across-the-board deferral of aid spending on countries and regions; some have been deferred but some have actually had an increase in the appropriation above what was projected in last year's budget. In the context of deferring increases in aid spending, why has this year been chosen as the year in which we need to join the Asia Development Bank? 


I want to also refer to scholarships, particularly those scholarships funded by AusAID that are offered to overseas students in developing countries to study. Can the minister advise whether there is a requirement that these students have to study at Australian universities or educational institutions? If not, why not? Is there a requirement for the students to return and work in their country of origin once they have finished their degree or their qualification? The minister may have to take this on notice, but can he provide a breakdown of intended countries of origin by student for these programs in 2012-13 and the degree courses and a breakdown of the Australian universities and institutions that they attend? Can he also explain the process that AusAID uses for determining which countries and students will be selected? What will the level of scholarships provided to the Palestinian authority be in 2012 and 2013?


On general aid, what will be the total amount of foreign aid funding provided to Libya for 2012-13? Minister Carr recently announced on his trip to Burma that there would be an increase in foreign aid spending in Burma. Will there also be an increase in the current staffing levels in the foreign aid area and, if so, what will those levels be?


Moving onto the $5 million donation that AusAID has given to the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Trust, can the minister advise what measures AusAID will take to ensure that all funds are administered to the trust and that they will be spent according to the AusAID charter?


On the ongoing issue of AusAID funding going to organisations with links to terrorists, even though it appears that nothing illegal has occurred, AusAID admitted during evidence that it is undisputed fact that persons on the board of the UWAC, which receives funding through an NGO from AusAID, are formerly convicted terrorists who have served time in jail for terrorism and have links to the PFLP, which is a well-known terror group. There are also other persons with links to terrorism on the UWAC board. Can the minister advise whether it is the Australian government's view that this situation is acceptable? Has the minister had any concerns raised with him by Labor backbenchers on this specific issue, in particular the member for Melbourne Ports? What does the government consider to be a link to a terrorist organisation? Just because it might be legal does not mean that there is not a link.


I want to also ask about an article that appeared in the Australian yesterday. It refers to an independent review obtained under FOI commissioned by AusAID—and I have that report with me now—into the child protection policy that was implemented in 2008. The article alleges that there has been a surge in abuse complaints. There were 11 last year compared to only four in the first year and authorities expect this trend to continue. Minister, can you advise whether this is correct? The article also states that of the 20 complaints made over the last four years, eight were substantiated—all last year—involving staff of a non-government organisation working with AusAID in another country while five were found to be outside the scope of the policy. Minister, can you advise whether all of the eight complaints were about one single NGO and what investigations the department has initiated? The article alleges that the report also questions why the department appears to put concerns of negative publicity ahead of concerns for alleged victims. This is a very serious allegation, Minister. Can you indicate whether you will release the report publicly? Will you commit to implementing all of the recommendations of the review and indicate a time frame? Will the government be providing an official response to the report and, if so, when?

Dr EMERSON
 (Rankin—Minister for Trade and Competitiveness) (12:53):  It is important that I respond to the last set of questions first. Then I will see if I can get to the others within the five minutes that I have. Without wishing to be unduly combative, the suggestion that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade might put concerns about negative publicity ahead of ensuring that it does everything to wipe out child abuse is an appalling suggestion. I am not saying that the member for Brisbane is making that allegation. I have hardworking and decent departmental officials here, as are AusAID people more generally, who would be mortified at such a suggestion. They are not in a position to answer these questions, so I will answer them on their behalf. It is an appalling question. There is no circumstance in which—




Ms Gambaro:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I was just asking the minister to respond to the report. I was not casting any aspersions on the hardworking members of the department, whom I have had great privilege to work with in the past.




Dr EMERSON:
  I understand that, but it is most unfortunate that in the time that is available the member for Brisbane has decided to transmit that allegation into the chamber. There is every discretion on the part of the member for Brisbane to simply not repeat that allegation or that suggestion. You have not done that. I am not suggesting that you are making it, but I would have put a red line through it, if I were you.


In relation to AusAID more generally, of course, this organisation has zero tolerance for child abuse. It is a pervasive problem—there is no doubt about it—and AusAID is tackling it proactively in setting the international benchmarks for accountability and transparency here. Indeed, Australia was the first international donor government and Commonwealth agency to implement a policy to protect children from abuse. The aid program has no higher priority than the protection of children from any form of abuse. The aid program works every day to promote and protect children's rights, in particular, by increasing children's access to education and to health services. 


The 2011 Independent Child Protection Policy Review, commissioned by this government, describes AusAID's commitment to child protection and the work done to date to develop, implement, support and resource the policy as impressive. AusAID agrees with the 23 substantive recommendations, with four already implemented and the remainder are underway. AusAID's partners are responding and appropriately managing child protection notifications better than ever before. Since the policy was introduced, all complaints made related to personnel of organisations funded by AusAID, not AusAID staff. The increase in notifications is evidence that the policy is working. It required mandatory reporting. Mandatory child protection standards have created safer organisations and awareness of the policy has increased through training NGOs, contractors and AusAID staff. 


There is strong evidence that supports the fact that, when mandatory compliance is introduced and awareness increases, there will be an increase in notifications. 


Going directly to the question, AusAID has received a total of 20 child protection notifications in the three years between March 2008 and December 2011. Of the total reports, eight were substantiated or resulted in dismissal, seven were unsubstantiated and five were outside the scope of the policy—that is, they were not related to Australian aid programs—and each of these cases were referred to the relevant authorities. Since the policy commenced, AusAID has not received any child protection notifications against any of its staff. I will seek to get back to the member for Brisbane on other questions where, again, we reasonably can within the resources of the department in relation to the decisions made on overseas development, assistance and the various scholarships. I am quite sure that AusAID and this government do not go around funding terrorist organisations legally or illegally. That is not the sort of thing that we see as a priority. I think that both sides of the parliament have a policy of doing everything they can to combat terrorism.

I ask whether he would be able to do that by the end of this parliamentary sitting period—that is, by the winter break. I also have a couple of questions on the Australia Network. Have any department officials been interviewed by the Australian Federal Police in its investigation of the leaks related to the Australia Network tender? Has the department undertaken any market research on, or surveys of, the Australia Network as to its coverage? If so, does the department know how many people are actually watching the network; how many are Australian citizens and how many are foreign nationals, and have those watching the network been asked to rate the quality of the current service delivery?

Dr EMERSON
 (Rankin—Minister for Trade and Competitiveness) (13:00):  I cannot reasonably give a commitment that, by the end of this parliamentary session, answers to all questions will be provided. There are constraints here on the available resources of the department. I have said in good faith that we would seek to provide answers where it is reasonable. Where there are questions that involve matters of cabinet-in-confidence or that cannot be answered for reasons of national security and such, answers will not be provided—and that would be the response that I would get if the coalition were in government.


In relation to the Australia Network, again, I will seek to provide some information on that. I would be surprised if the Australia Network were spending a lot of money working out how many people watch the network, but if they happen to have that information I will provide it to you.


There are some other unanswered questions that I would like to deal with. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in the previous bracket of questions, asked about trade negotiations with Japan, Indonesia and so on. What is happening in Indonesia—and I think it is quite a good idea—is that they are, to use their term, 'socialising the idea'. So we have the business communities of both Indonesia and Australia working collaboratively, identifying the opportunities through the negotiations and going to other stakeholders, including members of parliament in Indonesia of all political persuasions, to argue directly to them that this is a good idea. Rather than us negotiating an agreement and then unveiling it to the business community, we actually have the business communities of both countries being champions of the agreement. I think that is a model that is worth considering for the development of trade agreements between countries.


In relation to Japan, the most recent document that our trade relations are based on is the 1957 Australia-Japan Agreement on Commerce—and I give credit to the coalition at that time; Menzies and McEwen negotiated that agreement. But it is now a little dated! I think we can do better than that. The Japanese have shown renewed interest in a free trade agreement with Australia and, obviously, we have been pushing that for a long time. They have a lot on their plate, including the reopening of nuclear power stations and trying to get an increase in the consumption tax through the parliament. However, during my recent visit—and I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, with whom I was paired—the Japanese themselves, voluntarily, before I could even begin to speak about the desirability of completing negotiations for a free trade deal, said that to me. So that is a good development. They see that there is real merit in their engaging more in the region, looking outward. Again, Australia is a top priority for Japan, as it is for China.


So we continue to work hard and to invest in these agreements. The earlier part of the visit to seven countries over 19 days that I just completed included the actual signing of our free trade agreement with Malaysia. We got very strong support from industry generally and—of interest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott—from rural industries in particular. 


We are in the business of opening up markets. The 'Asian century' can provide enormous opportunities not only to our traditional minerals and energy exports; I think we can also make agriculture a new economy. With an expansion in the number of people on earth from seven billion to nine billion by 2030 and the rising middle classes of Asia, I think our beef producers, our dairy producers and our horticultural producers have great prospects. 


I can also confirm that, just yesterday, it was announced that Australian horticultural produce will continue to flow through Tanjung Priok, which is the main port in Jakarta. There was an announcement of a suspension and a termination that would come into effect on 19 June; that does not apply to Australia because we negotiated hard and well with the Indonesian government. We have a country recognition agreement in place and as a result Australia will be exempt from that suspension, which is good news for our horticultural producers. It is an example of the good personal relationships between ministers and a good, warm relationship between Indonesia and Australia.

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:00):  Before making remarks specifically on this appropriation bill, I think it is worth reflecting in general on a budget that returns to surplus at a time when global markets are in a doubtful condition and a time when caution and prudence in our budget management are important parts and hallmarks of the Australian way of managing budgets. But it is also important that we look at our budget in detail and see that spending as a share of GDP falls to 23.5 per cent in 2012-13 and remains below 24 per cent over the forward estimates. It is the longest sustained period below 24 per cent since the 1980s. The tax to GDP ratio in 2012-13 is 22.1 per cent and forecast to remain below 23 per cent across the forward estimates—again, sustainably low and substantially below the rates of the former government.


You cannot achieve this without a fantastic finance department. I thank the Department of Finance and Deregulation and in particular Secretary David Tune for the outstanding work that they have done in helping to support ministers and to frame this budget.


In 2012-13, the Finance and Deregulation portfolio will receive appropriations of $655.9 million from Appropriation Bill (No. 1) for the ordinary annual services of the government. This will include departmental capital budget funding of $18.9 million, $7.6 million in departmental supplementation and administered capital funding of $3.2 million. A number of new measures were announced in the 2012-13 budget for the finance portfolio. Further information on these is, of course, contained in Budget Paper No. 2. The government will provide $4 million over two years for finance to develop a second-pass business case for the remediation of sections 32, 34 and 41 of the Cox Peninsula in the Northern Territory and, in so doing, assist the Northern Territory in the resolution of a long-outstanding land claim and provide a fantastic business opportunity for the Larrakia people in developing that land outside of Darwin.


The government will also provide $6.9 million over four years to support the government's deregulation agenda, including oversight of the Seamless National Economy reforms and establishing and supporting COAG cross-jurisdictional task forces. Importantly, the government is delivering again on cross-jurisdictional issues, making life simpler, making cross-jurisdictional accreditations simpler and, of course, dealing with complex matters such as occupational health and safety.


The government will provide savings from a reduction to the fire services levy payments made to state and territory governments. Savings from this measure will be directed to support substantial other government priorities. The government will also find an additional $8 million over two years to undertake work related to the transfer of parts of the Malabar Headland to the government of New South Wales for the creation of a permanent national park in Malabar Head for the benefit of the people of Sydney, New South Wales and Australia. The government will provide $7.4 million in 2011-12 to meet legal and other costs associated with the Commonwealth's legislation against the stamp duty assessment issued by the New South Wales Office of State Revenue on the sale of the Commonwealth share of Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd.


The Commonwealth will provide $26.4 over five years to allow the Moorebank Project Office to progress the development of the Moorebank site as an intermodal terminal. This is a particularly substantial measure, as it will provide a logistics hub at Moorebank for container traffic flow from Port Botany through Sydney, creating an interstate connection but also better managing traffic and container flows through the greater Sydney area, benefiting the East Coast in general, Sydney specifically and delivering substantial productivity benefits for Australia.


The government will provide $559.4 million over four years to the Department of Finance and Deregulation for the relocation of the Department of Defence facilities at the Moorebank site to a modern and purpose-built facility through the development of the Holsworthy Barracks site. That is important to creating the land opportunity at Moorebank in order to create the terminal for the intermodal capacity at Moorebank. The government will also provide $339 million over seven years to construct a new Commonwealth operated post-entry quarantine facility.


The government will also provide nearly $1 million over four years to establish a whole-of-Australian government information management system for parliamentary workflow. I know the shadow minister appreciates the complexity that comes from differential systems operating across different ministers' offices and portfolios. This workflow program is designed to improve that. (Time expired)

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (16:06):  I think both sides of the House agree that productivity improvements are critical in realising opportunities in the years ahead and in weatherproofing the Australian economy as best we can against overseas events over which we have no control. Within this budget there are many measures which go to the issue of productivity. One that the minister himself referred to in his opening comments is the intermodal terminal at Moorebank in western Sydney. Given the importance of living within our means and ensuring the productivity opportunities are realised from this intermodal terminal—and the opposition supports this initiative—I would like to refer the minister to the Department of Finance and Deregulation capital measures outlined in Budget Paper No. 2 on pages 301 and 302. 


I have a number of questions and I would be very grateful if the minister could shed some light on these issues. Firstly, what is the rationale for establishing a GBE to develop the Moorebank site, considering that there is a strong private sector willingness, through Qube Logistics which has undoubted capability in this area, to deliver the same outcome on adjacent privately owned land? The land is currently owned by the Sydney Intermodal Terminal Alliance and developing that site would be at no cost to taxpayers. The land has open access, a port shuttle and an interstate rail terminal, as is planned by the government. As I understand it, the process will cost the Commonwealth nearly $1 billion, as spelt out in the budget papers: $559.4 million outlined on pages 302 as well as $332 million from the defence department.


Secondly, Minister, how pressing is the need for the relocation of the defence engineering facilities at Moorebank to Holsworthy? Thirdly, can you confirm that the interstate rail component may not be required until 2029? Would it be possible to spend a more modest sum of money on upgrading the defence facilities, which we do accept are in poor shape? Finally, considering the Commonwealth's very tight fiscal position, can you advise whether this proposal has been subjected to a cost-benefit study? Has comparative analysis been conducted between the government proposal and the private sector options, especially considering the very strong support from many quarters for the private sector proposal—the New South Wales government, the Business Council of Australia and many other groups, and financial reporters including editorials in the Australian FinancialReview?


Has it been assessed by Infrastructure Australia as a key priority? Is it true that the private sector proposal could be up and running three years sooner than the government proposal?

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:10):  I thank the shadow minister for his question and his focus on this critical issue. This is not simply a matter of an alternative use for a Commonwealth site; this is a matter of the construction of a significant piece of east coast infrastructure whose impact will be felt throughout the greater Sydney area and New South Wales as well as in freight movements into, around and out of our country.


The government formed the view that its broader national policy objectives can be best achieved through the development of an intermodal terminal on the site at Moorebank. It did that through a long consideration. It did seek the advice, the support and the constructive contribution of Infrastructure Australia, and there was a detailed business case which has been reviewed by Greenhill Caliburn. They advised the government that there was a significant uncertainty about the capacity of SIMTA to deliver the first stage of its intermodal terminal in 2014 as published as well as about its capacity to deliver the full intermodal terminal within its published time limits.


I think that all sides of our parliament, and certainly the government of New South Wales, share the concern that we all have to make freight movements in Sydney and New South Wales as efficient as possible. I think it is reasonable to say that everyone has a focus on the specific time lines that are established in the government's proposal. But in coming to the conclusion to spend the very large amounts of money that have been alluded to and enumerated by the shadow minister—the $559 million for the relocation of the defence units to Holsworthy, $332 million for major capital facilities, an additional $2 million for lease and land management and then $26 million to the project development office—we know that we are committing very substantial amounts of money to deliver what the analysis shows to be a very substantial productivity dividend to the people of Australia.


That productivity dividend manifests itself both in more efficient transport movements and more efficient transit movements of containers through the Moorebank facility. Importantly,, the judgement on the private sector involvement is that it will be optimised through the financing development operation of the project through an open tender process run by a commercially-operated government business enterprise. This is a matter that was announced, from recollection, on 23 April—just before Anzac Day. It was announced in the context of the substantial infrastructure investment which the Commonwealth believes needs to be made in a full holistic consideration of the use of the site at Moorebank and then the consequent movement of defence assets and facilities out to Holsworthy. I am very happy to take on notice those questions from the shadow minister that I may not have dealt with in sufficient detail and to come back to him in detail with specific answers. But, in general, the reason we concluded as we did is that we believe that it is the most efficient use of Commonwealth funds to create the most efficient terminal to produce the best possible dividends for the people of New South Wales, Sydney and Australia.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (16:13):  My electorate office is located alongside the Australian Electoral Commission office for the division of Makin, and has been for as long as I can recall. I say from the outset that my office certainly over the years that I have been the member for Makin, has had considerable interaction with that office. In saying that I place on record my gratitude to the staff of that office, who have, I believe, done an exceptional job in looking after the needs, inquiries and interests of the people in the general area. My experience with that office, in fact, goes back to before I was the member for Makin, when I was the mayor of the City of Salisbury. Even in that period in public life, the office oversaw some of the local government elections and, again, I had some interaction with the office. I can say that the service from the staff over all of that time was exemplary.


Almost on a daily basis we go into that office for one reason or another. The office is also particularly well used by elderly people who might be leaving the area for several months at a time and make inquiries about the processes they need to put in place in respect of their absence should an election be called. Those are legitimate queries which we all confront on a regular basis. Most importantly, the office is used during election periods when I can say without a doubt it is inundated with inquiries from people seeking information about how they should enrol in order to vote or how they should vote if they happen to be out of the electorate at the time of the election. I know they are inundated because many of the inquiries initially come through my office and we redirect them next door.


I understand the office will be closing in the near future. Can you advise what arrangements are being put in place to assist people who have relied on the services of the office, being located in the north-eastern suburbs for so long, and in particular what arrangements are being put in place to help people during those critical times when an election is being held?

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:16):  I thank the member for Makin for his question. The Australian Electoral Commission has nearly for 20 years worked on a program of amalgamating regional AEC offices where it sees fit and it is appropriate, in order to create more efficient work environments and to carry out its work, most importantly, as effectively as it can to enrol people and to maintain the roll. With that in mind, in particular in South Australia and with the coincidental timing of leases in the number of AEC offices in individual electorates, the commissioner saw an opportunity to amalgamate the offices in South Australia to create one substantial superoffice in the CBD, one office in the northern regional part of South Australia at Port Augusta and one in the south-eastern regional part of South Australia at Mt Gambier. The purpose of doing this was to create a more efficient and effective AEC, getting people on the roll and managing the roll. It is certainly a requirement that, come an election, the AEC will have a physical presence in every federal division. That physical presence will allow for ballot draws, for nominations and for voting support advice and activity within the division. 


I know the member will realise that in a seat like Makin internal transport routes and the capacity to get to a physical location are much easier than, say, in the electorate of Gray, which includes areas as remote as Port Augusta, Port Lincoln and Ceduna. An office in Port Augusta would struggle to support people in Ceduna. 


As a consequence of these sorts of practicalities, the commissioner has seen fit to continue a process of electoral office rationalisation in order to create a more efficient and effective Electoral Commission. I stress the commission is independent and comes to these decisions based on his view of what an efficient structure can best look like for all states and all jurisdictions. The new office in South Australia, I can inform the member for Makin, is due to be opened in coming weeks. And I can inform the member for Makin that it is absolutely the intention of the government, and the stated intention of the Electoral Commission, to carry out these amalgamations in a way that produces the best jobs and the best work environment to create the most productive Electoral Commission to do the fundamental work which that commission needs to do.


It is necessarily the case that your constituents, if they wish to talk face to face with an official of the Australian Electoral Commission, will need to travel into the CBD to do that. I believe the new office is in King William Street. I believe that that is an accessible location. The commission themselves have worked particularly hard in recent years to make themselves accessible both through telephonic communication and, importantly, through the internet for enrolment purposes and for enrolment advice updates. So I am confident both that the servicing of the needs of your constituents and those of South Australia and all other states where these amalgamations are taking place will be improved and that the jobs and retention of skilled staff at the AEC will be improved as we build an AEC that can better cope with the challenges that a changing society will throw at them in future years.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (16:21):  My questions are to the Special Minister of State. I want to ask a few questions concerning the appropriations for the Australian Electoral Commission. I note that the additional sum of $58 million over four years has the stated purpose of maintaining operating capacity and supporting electoral participation. The first question I ask is: would you confirm that the words 'supporting electoral participation' mean that the extra funding is to support the Labor-Greens policy of automatic enrolment? I say it is their policy because we have opposed it very strenuously as corrupting the integrity of the roll. Could you also tell me how many electors the AEC expect to enrol under this program of automatic enrolment and how long the process is likely to take? Is it true that the AEC has begun in the marginal seat of Petrie, currently held by the Labor Party? What is the estimated total cost of enrolling people from these extraneous rolls?


Does the AEC have a preference for which data sources it uses outside the ones that have been stated already, those mainly being the equivalent of the RTA, school leaver rolls and one other? It is a completely unfettered power that the AEC has—it can choose anything it likes? What safeguards—this is very important—if any, has the government put in place, or the AEC put in place for that matter, to ensure that people are not added to the roll who are not entitled to be there? The reason I ask that question so specifically is that in New South Wales the result of automatic enrolment was that, whereas the normal turnout rate for properly enrolled electors is 92 per cent, from the people added from the automatic enrolment it was only 64 per cent. Also, we had advice in evidence at JSCEM that, of those who were added to the New South Wales roll, the AEC's success rate in getting them to transfer to the federal roll under the old law—not automatic enrolment—was only 20 per cent. That tends to make me think that there were people there who ought not to be there.


Also, having made those comments, I also ask whether or not the AEC has estimated what the error rate will be, what mechanism they have used to measure what they think that error rate will be and whether or not they can at any time hope that they could give a guarantee that 100 per cent of people added to the roll are actually entitled to be there—that the system they put in place would guarantee 100 per cent?

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:24):  I thank the shadow minister for her many questions—and, if there are any questions that I do not deal with here, I will deal with them in detail in writing and get back to you.


The first point is that the bills are currently before the Senate and I would expect their passage to occur some time in the current session. The second point to make is that the bills form part of the advice given to the government through the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, advice which accepts the ABS statistics that there are 15.7 million eligible voters, or Australians eligible to be enrolled, in our country but only 14.2 million are on the electoral roll.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  That was the government majority report. The dissenting report does not accept that.




Mr GRAY:
  I understand that. I understand that the JSCEM report on the 2007 election also contained a number of recommendations to which there were a number of objections. I am not aware of any objection by the coalition at that time to these electoral roll measures.


Importantly, the shadow minister made the suggestion that perhaps the additional funding to the AEC is in order to support this particular policy. The short answer is: no, it is not. The long version is that these particular measures are designed to harmonise the Commonwealth roll with the rolls of the most populous states. The most populous states now have enrolment technologies being actively deployed which, if we do not match them at the Commonwealth level, will create a serious mismatch between our Commonwealth roll and our state rolls. These measures will bring onto the Commonwealth roll about 100,000 electors in New South Wales but only about 10,000 in Victoria because of a differential system operating there which has also been operating over a different time line.


The sources to which we would expect the AEC to turn—bearing in mind, of course, that the AEC is independent and will independently determine the appropriate lists to go to—are the Australian Taxation Office and, yes, RTAs, and some school-leaver rolls have been considered. But, importantly, it will look to rolls that have integrity and that are approved by state electoral commissions. So we are not simply going out to any old list of people. In order to add to the integrity of the roll, the commission is creating a system to track and to support voter enrolments that is consistent with those used in the largest jurisdictions.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  But the legislation does not say that, Minister.




Mr GRAY:
  The Electoral Commissioner has made clear his intention to pursue this enrolment methodology in a way that is consistent with best possible practice and the highest integrity of the roll. We all agree with that. We all agree that, at those times when our country is required to elect a parliament that is representative of the people, we need an electoral roll that is as accurate as possible. We have to concede, in a modern world, that increasing numbers of Australians are not enrolling, and as a parliament we believe we need to respond to that challenge. We need to make our roll as complete as possible so that we have a situation where, as much as possible, a person from Sydney who believes that they are enrolled and entitled to vote in New South Wales ought to be able to reasonably assume that they are eligible to vote in a federal election—and likewise for people in Victoria, Queensland, the Northern Territory, Tasmania, South Australia and my home state of Western Australia. Where that is not the case, we ought to be putting in place the best possible systems to harmonise our rolls.


You had substantial additional questions, Shadow Minister, which I know I have not responded to in my commentary here. I will get back to you in writing on the specific details of those questions you asked.

  Thank you.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:29):  My question also relates to the Australian Electoral Commission. I note the comment you made, Minister Gray, that there are about 1.5 million Australians who are not enrolled to vote. With 150 members in the House of Representatives, we are talking about 10,000 people per electorate, on average, who are not eligible to vote. All of us would have experienced checking the enrolment of people who contact us. Often the people who contact us, particularly if they are transient or if they have to come into a job or who recently have not bothered to vote, are not registered.


My electorate is named after Harold Blair, who was an Aboriginal activist and tenor. He is a very famous person. He grew up in the Purga Mission south of Ipswich. There are a number of important Indigenous institutions in Ipswich. There is an Indigenous school called Hymba Yumba in Springfield. Just before the census, I urged the people there to make sure that their mums, dads and carers fill out census forms. The biggest high school in Ipswich, Bremer State High School, has about 1,500 students. About 30 per cent of those are Indigenous or Polynesian, with most of that 30 per cent being Indigenous. One of the busiest medical centres in Ipswich is Kambu Medical Centre. It has tens of thousands of patients. It is an Indigenous centre.


There are about 86,500 people on the electoral roll in Blair. We are celebrating this year 50 years since Indigenous people achieved the right to vote in federal elections. I understand that it was not compulsory to enrol but once you were enrolled it was compulsory to vote. In 1967, the Constitution was changed to give power to count Indigenous people in the census and for the Commonwealth to be given the power to make special laws for their benefit.


My question relates to the Electoral Commission. I have stood at polling booths in Ipswich for about 30 years handing out Labor Party pamphlets—the opposition side would call them propaganda but I would call them pamphlets—encouraging people to vote for the Australian Labor Party candidate. I recently stood all day at Raceview State School—the biggest state primary school in my electorate in Ipswich—and one of the things that struck me about this suburb, which is fairly typical of Ipswich, was how few Indigenous people came to the polling booth to cast a vote. What steps are the AEC taking to encourage Indigenous people to vote? What are the budgetary implications? Does the AEC require any additional funding to get all Australians, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to participate in the political process?

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:32):  I think the member for Blair for his question. He has a great commitment to ensuring that the rights of Indigenous Australians are translated effectively into electoral action. Indigenous Australians are significantly less likely to enrol to vote than any other Australians. They are less likely to vote and they are more likely to vote informally than non-Indigenous Australians. The AEC has long-established programs to try to deal with this challenge. In 2009-10, to close the gap in Indigenous disadvantage in electoral participation the commission was allocated an additional $13.2 million to establish its Indigenous electoral participation program. There are 25 field officers across the country, with 18 of them being Indigenous Australians. I have one operating out of Mandurah. They particularly operate around schools to ensure that Indigenous people become enrolled. But it is not as easy as that.


Some of the measures that the shadow minister has interrogated me upon in a previous question are measures that become troublesome in terms of encouraging and maintaining Indigenous voters. Among the lists that will be considered are road transport department lists—lists of people with drivers' licences. Indigenous people are less likely to have a driver's licence and so are less likely to be accurately identified through that mechanism. Then there is the ATO system. To be in the ATO system, it is likely that you will need to be in a period of full-time employment. As such, some of the lists that we will try to use to maintain enrolments will not work effectively in Indigenous communities. The AEC needs to continually apply itself to the task of ensuring that Indigenous electoral participation is what we as a parliament and we as a country aspire to.


There was a fantastic effort when the AEC sponsored its National Indigenous Youth Parliament to be in Canberra over the weekend of the last sitting. Members from all sides of the parliament attended a fantastic lunch and a series of events attached to the youth parliament. It was an event put on by the AEC designed to encourage real time, real life, active participation in our political process in order to get a willing and supporting cadre of Indigenous people who understand the importance of getting members of their community on the roll and getting them out to vote.


We see through our IEPP processes the continuing growth of enrolments of Indigenous citizens—but it is not happening quickly enough. We are seeing the strengthening of the integrity of the roll particularly in remote communities, but we can do a lot more. We are seeing an increase in the number of Indigenous people working as polling officials on mobile and static polling facilities in Indigenous communities, but we can always do better. We are seeing an increased number in requests for fee-for-service elections by Indigenous organisations. That is building a strong culture of familiarity with our electoral processes—processes of getting on the roll and getting out to vote.


Can we do more? Yes, we can. Should we do more? Yes, we should. Is it expensive? Yes, it is. I will get back to the member for Blair with a specific set of answers from the electoral commission to those issues that he has raised which I have not addressed in my answer.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (16:36):  I have a series of further questions if the minister would please respond. The government took a step yesterday on one of the measures—that is, the departure tax, which is now known as the people movement charge for some reason—in the budget. The government chose to remove the proposed indexation of the people movement charge at a cost to the budget over four years of an estimated $157 million. In addition to that, this morning we saw the government withdraw a major bill which had proposed to increase the tax on proceeds of investments in managed investment funds from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. This measure was estimated in the budget papers to deliver savings of around $256 million.


I ask the minister: how does the government intend to meet its budget commitment to a budget surplus of $1.5 billion by 30 June 2013 given that these two measures alone over the last 24 hours come at a total cost of $413 million? Or has the government, alternatively, decided to revise downwards its budget surplus forecast to $1 billion and $77 million?


The second area of questioning concerns the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Currently the government plans to allocate $2 billion per year over five years commencing in the 2013-14 financial year. Minister, can you guarantee that under no circumstances this funding profile will change? For example, will we possibly find that as an election approaches these borrowed funds are not brought forward to enable costly contracts to be locked in prior to the next election? Can you explain why there is a funding program almost identical in purpose to the CEFC which is both outlined as a budget measure and factored into the budget bottom line where, as you know, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is off-budget and the expenditure associated with it does not go to the bottom line?


That existing program, the Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund, is in the 2011-12 budget, page 304, budget paper No. 2. In explaining it, the paper says:


The Government will provide $108.7 million over 14 years to support the development and commercialisation of renewable energy technologies by making early-stage equity investments that leverage private funds. 


Minister, this would seem to us to provide a clear precedent and I ask you: does it not provide a clear precedent as to why the CEFC and its $10 billion in funding should be treated on budget. I cannot distinguish any feature between the Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation which separates the purpose, in many ways the execution, and one is treated on budget and the other one is treated off budget. Finally can you provide any information about planned staffing arrangements for the CEFC, and can you confirm that key senior appointments will not be made by multiple-year contract, whether they be two, three or four? Finally, can the minister may please explain a matter in today's Financial Review report of the RBA minutes. One of the key claims of the government has been that its budget management, including its commitment to bring back the budget to surplus, has somehow been a factor in interest rate reductions, yet we have seen in the paper today the minutes of the RBA. I ask the Minister how can they be reconciled with what the RBA have said at their recent board meeting? (Time expired)

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:42):  I thank the shadow minister for his question. He has asked me questions about the departure tax and about the management of investment funds. I will seek advice from my department and get back to the shadow minister with answers. He has asked me about the staffing of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Again, I will come back to him specifically on those measures. He has asked me about minutes of the last RBA meeting and the references made to budget surpluses and the necessary interaction between budget surpluses and interest rate levels. It is undeniably the case that prudent budget management, as we see from the Commonwealth government, will deliver a budget surplus not in the current financial year, for which this budget is constructed, but in out years as well. There is no doubt that, in taking pressure off financial markets by delivering a budget surplus, the government is more than doing its part in helping deliver an environment conducive to low interest rates, conducive to supporting families who are under their own domestic budget pressures, but also, importantly, continuing to deliver a budget and a fiscal environment envied by the world, supported by good public policy. 


I say this about the conversations around the departure tax and the managed investment funds measures. The Commonwealth put in place a budget which had been carefully thought through, supported by expert advice and consideration from the Department of Finance and Deregulation. One of the fundamental things that an opposition can do at a time of global financial market uncertainty is to support the Commonwealth budget and to support the government in its measures, both on the revenue side and on the expenditure side. But we are realists; we operate in the real world. I will come back to the shadow minister with specific answers to the questions he has asked  which I have not answered specifically here now.

Mr MELHAM
 (Banks) (16:44):  My questions to the minister involve the earlier question I asked him in the parliament today in question time—how amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which are currently before the Senate, would improve participation by Australians in our electoral system. I note the member for Warringah earlier labelled them as Labor-Green amendments, as if there was a conspiracy by the Labor and the Greens in relation to the legislation. In his earlier answer, he indicated that part of the mindset of the Commonwealth was to have uniform systems and that these systems currently operate in New South Wales and Victoria. Can the minister confirm that the Liberal administrations of New South Wales and Victoria have not moved towards repealing automatic enrolment legislation that currently exists in their states, that they have accepted it? Indeed, that is the basis upon which the Commonwealth is proceeding, that in effect they are going to be long-term provisions in those states? The nub of it is that Liberal administrations in those two states are not seeking to wind back automatic enrolment that currently exists. 


In relation to the Electoral Commission's financial position, I understand there has been an additional $58 million over four years to maintain the commission's operating capacity in support of electoral participation. In terms of departmental resourcing over forward estimates, it goes from $125.1 million in 2012-13 to $239.6 million in 2013-14, which I assume is as a result of an anticipated electoral event occurring in that year. Can the minister outline to the House strategies that he is aware of that the commission is undertaking in relation to improving electoral participation as a result of funding that has been provided? Are there any figures that he can enlighten the parliament on and are there any targets that have been set or any benchmarking?


Finally, Senator Carol Brown and I met with representatives from Blind Citizens Australia and Vision Australia yesterday. That was a very fruitful meeting. As I understand it, there has been collaboration with those groups and the Australian Electoral Commission to build on improvements to the electoral system that would assist those groups. I understand that there are some differences of opinion. I am interested as to the cost, because in their submission to me they say that the iVote system that was used in the last New South Wales election is one that they were very happy with. They are not particularly happy with going back to a human call centre operation. I wonder what the funding implications would be, if the minister has figures, in relation to that, if the Commonwealth were to adopt an iVote system, which would pick up blind and visually impaired but I assume could be extended to other people.

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:48):  I thank the member for Banks for his question. I will answer the last part first which is in the context of the blind voting and initiatives that were in place for the last federal election and are being considered for the future. It is the case that the Electoral Commissioner is substantially of the view that the Commonwealth systems can be improved and that support for people with disabilities can be extended. One of the great values of the extension of that voting facility for blind or visually impaired voters is that it can also be used to assist mobility impaired voters. That agenda of encouraging and supporting people with disabilities to exercise their rights in our electoral process is alive and is being considered. 


In the context of the particular New South Wales iVote initiative, I will need to get advice from the commissioner. I am aware of the iVote system. I think Linda Hornsey from the particular association involved is in the building this week. I look forward to catching up with her, I think tomorrow, to discuss this matter further. But I look forward to getting back to the member on the detail of the commissioner's view of iVote and the extension of those measures which are designed to improve voter participation amongst people with disabilities. The additional funding for the Electoral Commission is, of course, funding that presumes an electoral event in 2013. It presumes an electoral event at some point in the third quarter of 2013, but the funding is not created explicitly in the expectation that that is the only time at which an electoral event can take place. So prudent measures have been put in place by the commission to ensure that it can support the needs of our parliamentary democracy should that be required at any time.


The Commonwealth Electoral Act amendments that are currently before the Senate effectively work to harmonise elector data management systems in the Commonwealth roll with those of our two most popular states. I cannot understate the importance of harmonising the Commonwealth roll with the state jurisdictions. The member for Banks specifically asked the view of the New South Wales government on these measures. The New South Wales government and the New South Wales Electoral Commission are significantly in advance of the rest of the country on these measures. That commission has, we believe, in the order of 100,000 New South Wales electors alone that it can bring into the Commonwealth roll as a consequence of these measures. To simply try to extrapolate that across the rest of the country with the successful operation of these techniques might mean that we could be looking at repairing the enrolments of up to half a million people. What a fantastic thing that would be. But, importantly, I am not aware of any moves by either the New South Wales government, the New South Wales commission, the New South Wales parliament or the Victorian commission, government or parliament to wind back those measures which are directed towards electoral roll maintenance.


In our Commonwealth system we, of course, do not refer to it as 'automatic enrolment'. This is an automated system of maintaining enrolment. We maintain the integrity of the system by requiring that new enrollees properly complete documentation, properly sign documentation and properly lodge that documentation. The methodologies that we seek to introduce through these amendments are methodologies to better track individuals as they become mobile through the course of their life cycle and allow them to exercise their right and their obligation to vote wherever they are domiciled, where we can confirm through high-integrity sources and data matches that that is the person who has been identified as owning the enrolment.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (16:52):  I want to revert for a moment to the answers that the minister gave me previously relating to automatic enrolment. I confirm the opposition's opposition as it was expressed in the dissenting report. It was a very political report. It was a bit down party lines, with Labor and Greens on one side and opposition members on the other. I just wanted to mention specifically the minister's reference to the AEC using ATO information.


I think it is relevant to go back and look at various reports. For instance, a 1999 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration found that tax file numbers that had been issued were 3.2 million more than there were people in Australia. I do not think those records are very good for utilising to put people on the roll. It found that there were 185,000 potential duplicate tax records of individuals and it found that 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in a sample match.


A further report on the integrity of Medicare enrolment data found that up to half a million active Medicare enrolment records were probably for people who were deceased. In other words, rolls that are created for another purpose are not a valid or safe source of information for the electoral roll. The fact that it is so vital that the integrity of the roll is maintained is highlighted by the judgment in the case of Perkins v Cusack, where the judge refused to go behind the roll, saying that the roll is a total acceptance that those people who are on the roll are entitled to vote. Quite clearly, by utilising lists from sources other than people who are honouring their obligation under the Electoral Act, it is the obligation of every citizen, once they turn 18 or become a citizen, to enrol to vote. That is compulsory, it is strict liability and there is a fine, yet the Electoral Commission have not imposed or attempted to have imposed one fine—not one. They do not pursue people for multiple voting. They send out letters to people saying, 'It appears there was multiple voting in your name. Did you do it?' The people say, 'No,' and that is the end of it. In other words, there is not too much scrutiny going on with the Electoral Commission, so I am doubly concerned about the carte blanche that the commission has been given to choose any list it likes. I know you said in your answer that there is an undertaking that they will stick only to these three, but there is nothing in the law, anywhere, to prevent any list being chosen at any time. I know you said that you are trying to harmonise the biggest states, Victoria and New South Wales. The information to me is that the commission has started in the electorate of Petrie. I would like you to answer that question.


Also, harmonising state rolls with the federal roll is a major target that has been formed. I do not think it should be; I think the integrity of the roll must always take precedence. Secondly, it is not a very sensible argument because there is no harmonisation between the states and the Commonwealth as to the method of voting. The reason we get such a high percentage of informal votes is that in Queensland and New South Wales we have first-past-the-post voting or, rather, optional preferential voting, which is the closest thing we have to that, whereas in other states it is full preferential voting. That does not follow either.


The last point I would like you to respond to is on the legislation which allows the Auditor-General to automatically audit private contractors with the Commonwealth and yet will protect the NBN from the Auditor-General's automatic right to audit government business enterprises. I ask: was it simply done because the original legislation was to give the Auditor-General that power? It was taken away at the last moment. Mr Oakeshott, the person who introduced it, said he was given no good reason but, as is his wont, he simply agreed with the government at the time. Was it done deliberately to protect the NBN or is there some other reason?

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:57):  I can assure the shadow minister that those questions which I do not answer in my remarks to follow will be answered directly to her in a documentary form. Specifically, you asked about the use of the electoral roll update mechanisms in Petrie. I am not aware of that. The bills are yet to go through the Senate and may not pass through the Senate, so I cannot see how the Electoral Commission would have done that, but I am certainly prepared to seek that advice because, as I say, I expect that debate to be brought on this evening and dealt with in the course of the next few days of Senate sitting time.


Specifically, you asked about the integrity of lists and referred to the tax file numbers. The issue which the Electoral Commissioner grapples with is the identified fact that there are, we believe, 1.5 million or thereabouts Australians not on the roll who should be on the roll. We would have a simple difference of opinion, I believe. My view and, I hope, the parliament's view is an inclusive view that means we should use all of those methods available to us as a parliament to support people getting onto the roll. I accept the view which the coalition has that those people who are on the roll should be those who enrol specifically by electorate and at the time when they reach the qualifying points. It is a simple difference of opinion. But the philosophical difference which the government has is a difference which is fundamentally about inclusion and fundamentally about ensuring that our roll best represents those Australians who are eligible to vote. That difference of opinion will play itself out in the parliament in the course of the next few days and weeks.


We are, of course, hoping for a system that will deliver as best it can a harmonised enrolment system across our two most populous states, and encourage the smaller states to opt into that better, more developed system. We hope that will place our Electoral Commission on a track to deal with the 1.5 million, although I accept that that task is more complex than the measures that we put in place—if we do get them in place through the parliament in the course of the next few days.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (17:01):  The government is returning the budget to surplus in 2012-13, and we will build growing surpluses over the forward estimates while also spreading the benefits of the mining boom to help families on lower and middle incomes and small business.


A return to surplus, which will be achieved ahead of any major advanced economy, will sustain confidence in the strength of Australia's public finances by demonstrating the government's commitment to fiscal discipline and by providing a buffer at a time when the global economy remains fragile. A return to surplus is appropriate, given domestic economic conditions, and will provide ongoing scope for monetary policy to respond to economic developments. The economy is forecast to grow around trend over the next two years, with low unemployment, contained inflation and record levels of mining investment.


The Australian economy continues to be affected by the fragile and changing nature of the global economy. However, Australia's success in supporting the economy and jobs during the global financial crisis means that the economy faces these transitions from a position of strength. Strong growth in the resources sector will directly and indirectly support growth in other parts of the economy. However, conditions in some parts of the economy are likely to remain challenging, with unsettled global conditions, a high Australian dollar, ongoing consumer caution and changes in expenditure patterns all expected to weigh heavily on some sectors. While these forces are placing considerable pressures on some businesses, many are successfully adapting to the changing economic landscape and identifying and exploiting opportunities to grow and to prosper.


I now turn to some of the key initiatives of the 2012-13 budget. This budget spreads the benefits of the mining boom to help families on low and middle incomes with the cost of living, and provides much-needed help to small business while still returning the budget to surplus, as is appropriate given domestic and global economic conditions. Support to families on low and middle incomes is being provided through measures including increases to family payments, more timely and accessible education payments and a new supplementary allowance for eligible income support recipients.


Key initiatives announced in this year's budget include returning the budget to surplus on time and as promised; spreading the benefits of the mining boom; the first steps towards a National Disability Insurance Scheme; helping business to invest by allowing companies to carry back tax losses and delivering tax breaks for small business; investing in key health services; building an aged care system for the future; building a more productive workforce by investing in jobs, education and training; and building productivity by investing in nation-building infrastructure—by investing in roads, rail and ports.


The government's fiscal strategy is designed to ensure fiscal sustainability while providing the necessary flexibility for the budget position to vary in line with economic conditions. The medium-term fiscal strategy, which has remained unchanged since the government's first budget in 2008-09, is to achieve budget surpluses on average over the medium term; to keep taxation as a share of GDP on average below the level for 2007-08—that was 23.7 per cent; and to improve the government's net financial worth over the medium term.


To ensure a timely return to surplus and recovery in the fiscal position, since the beginning of the global financial crisis the government has further committed to allowing the level of tax receipts to recover naturally as the economy improves, while maintaining the government's commitment to keep taxation as a share of GDP below the 2007-08 level on average and building growing surpluses by holding real growth in spending to two per cent a year on average until the budget surplus is at least one per cent of GDP and while the economy is growing at or above trend.


Returning the budget to surplus in 2012-13 remains appropriate given domestic economic conditions. The economy is forecast to grow around trend over the next two years, the unemployment rate is expected to remain low and mining investment is expected to reach record highs. A return to surplus also recognises that fiscal policy should be set in a medium-term framework. In normal circumstances, monetary policy should play the primary role in managing demand to keep the economy growing at close to capacity, consistent with achieving its medium-term inflation target.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:06):  I have some questions following up questions I asked you on the last occasion concerning the appointment and work program of Dr Ken Henry. I notice that since you and I had questions and answers that there has been information given to the Senate estimates committee. Mr Leon said that at the moment—




Mr Dreyfus:
  Sorry to interrupt; it is Ms Leon. That might be of assistance.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  In that case Ms Leon has informed the Senate that Dr Henry is now employed on the basis of 2½ days a week, but it has not been 2½ days a week for the entire time since he commenced work. I think I flagged with you at the last estimates that it was expected that the nature of the Asian century task force would have some ebbs and flows, with peak periods in the middle and probably slower periods at the end. And this has been the experience. Could the parliamentary secretary provide the Federation Chamber with a complete week-by-week breakdown of the number of days worked by Dr Ken Henry, showing which weeks if he ever worked 40 hours a week whereby he would be paid at the full rate. I do not think I have ever met a departmental secretary who has only worked 40 hours a week. But if Dr Henry works 40 hours a week, he gets paid at the full rate. I also notice that since we last met in this chamber there has been about $100,000 increase for the position of head of Treasury. It is now up to some $615,000 a year—the rate that Dr Henry is to be paid—and it will go up a further $100,000, I think. Dr Henry under the terms under which he was appointed will enjoy those rises. I am sorry; it goes up to $653,000 on 1 July 2012.


We would like to know for that sort of money precisely what Dr Henry is doing. I know he has been doing the Asian paper, which is due to be delivered in the middle of the year, and that Dr de Brouwer has confirmed that there are discussions with Dr Henry that he will be continuing after that, but he describes that as a 'live' discussion. I wonder if the parliamentary secretary could tell us what precisely Dr Henry might be doing for either the full amount of $615,000 a year or pro rata on whatever number of days he is doing and what that work might be. I think we need to know a little more than it being a 'live' discussion. It was confirmed again that Dr Henry will continue as a special adviser, but there has been a project to which there has not been an agreement yet. Could you confirm that to date there is no agreement as to what his future work might be?

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (17:09):  There were a lot of questions last year in the consideration in detail of the appropriations for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet about Dr Henry's work for the Commonwealth. I am pleased that since last year some information has been provided to the member for Mackellar. It is apparent from the material that the member for Mackellar just read that this matter has been raised in Senate estimates and that a range of further information has been provided about some of the excellent work that Dr Henry has been carrying out on behalf of the Commonwealth since this was raised in this very place in this same session in relation to the appropriations for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet last year.


I can confirm that Dr Henry has been working on the Australia in the Asian century white paper, providing advice in that context and assisting with the drafting of that white paper. Indeed, he has travelled to consult with people and governments in a range of our Asian neighbouring countries, as is appropriate. As the member for Mackellar has indicated, the Australia in the Asian century white paper is going to be published in the middle of 2012.


Her further questioning went to what further projects Dr Henry may be working on after the work on the Australia in the Asian century white paper is completed. I am happy to take on notice the request. I obviously do not have with me the details of Dr Henry's employment—I do not mean by that the salary rates, which were canvassed last year. Rather, these questions go to the actual work that has been performed by Dr Henry since last year, since his appointment and since the commencement of the Australia in the Asian century white paper process. We will provide such details as are possible in due course.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:12):  The parliamentary secretary did not confirm that he would provide the House with the details of precisely how many days or hours Dr Henry has worked each week since 5 January 2012, which was confirmed in the Senate as the day on which he began to be paid as a special adviser. We are entitled to know precisely how many days he has worked each week and whether or not at any time he has worked 40 hours. I would also like to know what safeguards have been put in place to prevent there being a conflict of interest between Dr Henry's position as special adviser to the Prime Minister on these matters and his position as a director of the NAB. This is a matter which is of grave concern to many people and I would like to know what provisions have been taken—what chinese walls have been erected—to prevent those conflict of interest situations arising.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (17:13):  The first matter would seem to be a request for confirmation of the level of detail that we will be able to provide. I can confirm to the member for Mackellar that we will provide such detail as is available. I cannot not say exactly what the precise terms and the fine details of the arrangement with Dr Henry are. I can say as Cabinet Secretary that I know of his work on the Australia in the Asian century white paper process. He had quite a gruelling schedule of travel in the two-week period that he travelled to a number of Asian countries. Then there was the work that he did on the discussion paper, which was published early in the process for this white paper. I do not think the member for Mackellar would be surprised to hear that Dr Henry, as one might expect from one of Australia's more eminent economists and longstanding, hardworking public servants, has worked exceptionally hard and put in some very long hours on the Australia in the Asian Century white paper process, but we will endeavour to provide detail of the hours worked, if indeed that detail is available—because that is what is being sought—or at least some detail that gives the member for Mackellar some indication of the work that is being done not just in general sense but in a detailed sense by Dr Henry.


The other point raised by the member for Mackellar went to the suggestion that there might be some conflict of interest between Dr Henry's position as a director of the National Australia Bank and the work that he is doing for the Commonwealth of Australia. As the member for Mackellar would be aware, it is quite common for service to be provided to the Commonwealth by people who hold directorships, who hold a range of positions with other bodies. They are not of course in the same position as ministers; nor are they in the same position as secretaries of departments or full-time Australian public servants. I think the nation would be the poorer if it were decided that the mere holding of a directorship in a listed corporation meant that such a person could not provide services to the Commonwealth.


In general terms, conflicts of interest are very often dealt with in Australia by declaration—by the disclosure of an apprehended conflict. That gets over a large part of the problem, in so far as there are particular arrangements that parties have come to. In the case of Dr Henry, formal arrangements have been struck in relation to the conflict that could arise, potentially, between his work as a director of the National Australia Bank and the work that he is doing for the Commonwealth. I am happy to provide that also to the member for Mackellar.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:16):  Perhaps I can assist the Parliamentary Secretary by reading to him the terms of Dr Henry's employment as Special Adviser. Of course, it is the most unusual appointment under section 67 of the Constitution—by Her Excellency's command, signed by the Governor-General and the Prime Minister—and I do not accept that it is usual practice to have directors of public companies, who are also appointed under section 67 of the Constitution, working directly to the Prime Minister. It says in this agreement, under clause (c):


iii. for any period that the Special Adviser performs the duties of that office on a full-time basis (40 hours per week), the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment for the Special Adviser be the same as those that apply to the person who holds the position of Secretary of the Department of the Treasury at the relevant time—


—who, I am sure, works more than 40 hours a week. It continues:




iv. 
t
he Prime Minister may agree that the duties of


the Special Adviser are to be
 performed on a part-time basis …





We have never seen any evidence that the Prime Minister has so agreed. Finally, it says:





v. 
for any period that the Special Adviser performs the duties on a part-time basis, the remuneration referred to in clause (c)(iii) above be payable, and other entitlements accrue, on a pro-rata basis.





However, I take it from the answer that you previously gave me that, if Dr Henry is travelling overseas and is away for a week, then that presumably will be deemed to be 40 hours a week and he will be paid a week's salary from the $615,000 a year that is attracted by this agreement because that is now the salary paid. I would like those things confirmed.





You mentioned that you thought the conflict-of-interest situation could be dealt with by declaration. I would like you to inform the parliament whether or not there have been any such declarations made or, indeed, any such declarations sought.





I go back to the question of the actual time that Dr Henry has spent on the white paper. I do not think it is unreasonable, when dealing with the amounts of money we are talking about, to ask that the parliament be informed of precisely the number of days per week that have been worked by Dr Henry since 5 January. 




I also note from other answers given that work on the white paper was only one of a number of vague discussions that took place, and then suddenly this was the job of work. But I am really quite alarmed that we are now coming up to 30 June—the reporting time for the Asian century white paper is the middle of the year—but there has been confirmation that Dr Henry's position will continue at this hugely expensive salary, yet there is no apparent work for him. So, I again ask the parliamentary secretary if he could tell the House precisely what discussions have taken place on what work he may or may not be doing and whether there is a break in the period between finishing this job and beginning a next assignment, and will he continue to be paid? It would seem that under this agreement he will be. But I would think that the people of Australia would think that was totally unreasonable.


Thirdly—I do not know the answer to this—does a section 67 appointment affect Dr Henry's entitlement to draw his pension, which from memory I think would be two-thirds of his previous salary, or of the current salary? If it is not affected, that means he would be getting his retirement pay, a pension, plus his entitlement to whatever proportion of $615,000, plus his NAB director's salary. He is indeed a very well-endowed former public servant. I would be pleased if you would answer the specific question: does an appointment under section 67 disqualify him from taking his pension that is payable under the defined scheme?

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (17:21):  I am happy to take that fairly technical question on notice, but I would resist the suggestion that seems to be being made by the member for Mackellar, at least by implication, that there is anything in the slightest out of the ordinary about this appointment under section 67 of the Constitution. The member for Mackellar would be well aware that all governments since Federation have used section 67 of the Constitution, perhaps sparingly—




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Not for this purpose.




Mr DREYFUS:
  Well, there we have it: the implication from the member for Mackellar that there is something unusual about the use of section 67.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Correct.




Mr DREYFUS:
  I would invite her to examine the history of section 67 appointments by both the former government, which used the provision quite frequently, and previous governments since Federation that have also used this as an appropriate method of providing services, often at a very high level, to the Commonwealth. There is nothing inappropriate about the way in which section 67 is being used to secure the continuing services to the Commonwealth, to the great benefit of the Commonwealth, of Dr Henry.


I can make it clear to the member for Mackellar that we will provide such details of the work done by Dr Henry under the terms of this employment arrangement under section 67. I and the government accept wholly that the parliament is entitled to some details, as it is entitled to the details of work done by other servants on behalf of the Commonwealth. But I will have to take on notice the particular question, which probably turns on Dr Henry's individual circumstances—that is, as to the question of whether or not the appointment under 67 has some bearing on such retirement benefits as he is receiving from the Commonwealth. I do not accept the correctness of the characterisation of what are Dr Henry's superannuation, pension or retirement benefits from the Commonwealth. The suggestion has been made by the member for Mackellar, but I do not know what basis there is for it and I certainly would not want to be taken to be confirming in any way that the member for Mackellar has correctly described Dr Henry's retirement benefits from the Commonwealth.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:23):  To assist the parliament secretary, Dr Henry is under the scheme, which has been a closed scheme for some years, where if he retires at under 54 years and 11 months of age he maximises that pension entitlement under the scheme, which has now closed. I think it is very important to know what the implications of that section 67 appointment are on his pension entitlements to be paid now.


Also, to assist the parliamentary secretary, believe me, I have done a thorough analysis of all appointments made pursuant to section 67 and there are none—not one—that is analogous to this one. It is one that is extraordinarily generous, it is one that is unique, and it is one concerning someone who obviously the government regarded as a valued servant to the government of the day. He has had a very successful appointment for him, and I think we are entitled to know the details.

 (Mackellar) (17:25):  I wish to ask a question about the Ombudsman's task now that there are so many illegal boat arrivals. The Ombudsman was charged originally with responsibility for looking into many of those issues. When the funding was provided for the Ombudsman for the irregular maritime arrivals, as they are euphemistically called—it was agreed in 2008—there were expected to be 100 arrivals a year. Currently, there are 4,762 arrivals in immigration detention and more than 3,200 of those detainees have been in immigration detention for more than six months, making a case-by-case assessment increasingly impossible. The budget has really not been increased. I know we went through the procedures when a previous Ombudsman went to a Greens senator to complain and subsequently had his services terminated. Nonetheless, the current Ombudsman is still operating under the same funding arrangements, and I want to know why there has been no increase in that funding.

Mr DREYFUS

He is charged with receiving complaints and investigating various matters, and he has certain functions conferred on him by a range of different Commonwealth statutes. In so far as the question is directed to the sufficiency of the resources as a whole that the Commonwealth Ombudsman has been given to carry out the various roles that he is currently charged with in his activities generally and his discretionary activities in particular, the Ombudsman's brief is to look at various matters on a self-starting basis and he has been given overall supervisory responsibility for a range of areas in the Commonwealth's jurisdiction. In so far as those discretionary activities are conducted by him, they must be done in a way that can be managed within the budget that his office has been given. There is a degree of discretion available to him as to what tasks he decides to undertake and there is a degree of discretion vested in him as to what resources and funding he devotes to particular activities.


In so far as this question is directed to the particular role that the Commonwealth Ombudsman has in relation to immigration detainees—I took the question to be particularly referring to that—questions about specific measures affecting those immigration detainees need to be raised with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:28):  Just to help the parliamentary secretary, the Ombudsman comes from PM&C. In the 2011-12 budget, $900,000 over two years was set aside for the Commonwealth Ombudsman to monitor irregular maritime arrivals. This was to be met through the existing resources of the office of the Ombudsman. But, unfortunately for him, in the 2012-13 budget there has been a cut in his funding. His budget has gone from $27,286,000 down to $26,952,000. Does that indicate that you do not expect any more boat arrivals? Is the Ombudsman simply to forget about this task that he was given or does the government stand by the $900,000 over two years to be utilised for that purpose?

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (17:29):  I am not sure that the member for Mackellar has fully understood what the budget papers say about the funding of the Ombudsman. The total revenue of the Ombudsman is set out in the forward estimates. The budget papers in fact have figures for the total revenue of the Ombudsman. His revenue consists of both appropriations from the government and income that he receives from the sale of services.


To look at this, in 2007-08 the total revenue of the Ombudsman was $19,394,000, continuing to rise through to 2012. I will just read out the figures. In 2008-09 it was $20,756,000, in 2009-10 it was $20,309,000, in 2010-11 it was $21,277,000, and in 2011-12 it was $21,766,000. In the current year there is a drop to $20,115,000, but projections for the remaining three years of the forward estimates all have the Ombudsman's revenue remaining in the vicinity of $20 million. So it is projected to be $20,183,000 next year, $19,885,000 the following year and $19,930,000 in 2015-16.


The Commonwealth Ombudsman's staffing has been reduced. There has been a reduction in the estimated average staffing level from around 159 for 2011-12 down to 136 for 2012-13. Part of the reason for the reduction is the termination of measures relating to the oversight role that the Ombudsman was given in relation to the Northern Territory emergency response. There has also been something of a reduction specifically in the oversight role that the Ombudsman plays for Christmas Island processing. There is also a reduction because of the efficiency dividend that has been required of Commonwealth government agencies across the board.


I think it is important when one is looking at the functions of the Ombudsman to reflect upon the very broad range of functions that the Ombudsman is given, not only by the Ombudsman's own legislation but by other government programs and sometimes by other legislation. It is not really appropriate just to pick out one part of what might have been the Commonwealth Ombudsman's activities in part of some previous year and suggest that an overall conclusion can be drawn about the current year's activities. I would repeat: the Commonwealth Ombudsman has a very independent role. He has a very large discretion, and appropriately so, to determine how he would best use the resources that are provided to him by the government.


The implication in the member for Mackellar's question, that he must devote a certain level of resources to any particular thing, is wrong. It is a discretionary matter for him and I have identified, at least in part, that the reduction in role—notably in the oversight role that he had for the Northern Territory emergency response—is the reason why there has been some reduction in the Ombudsman's staffing.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:33):  The reduction from $27,286,000 to $26,952,000, and going south in the parliamentary secretary's answer, brings me to the fact that the Ombudsman is not a government department but is an independent statutory officer set up by an act. This has been described by a previous Ombudsman—a very fine Australian, Dennis Pearce—as being both a blessing and a curse. Whilst it frees him from undue pressures of government, it also means that there is no ready access to departmental or ministerial support. I know there is a practice whereby people are seconded from government departments to the Ombudsman's service for the purposes of a particular investigation, but that too can have its downside. So I wanted to ask whether or not there was any consideration of what ombudsmen have said over time about either creating a parliamentary committee to have oversight of the Ombudsman's office, which would give it a direct connection to the parliament, or making the Ombudsman an officer of the parliament so that there is greater recognition of the way in which he can be answerable to the parliament and, indeed, can seek direct access to departments when he needs it—so the issue is twofold.


I hear that the main reason for the drop in funding for the office is that they have been relieved of responsibility in the Territory, but we still have not come to the nub of the question about the rising numbers of illegal boat people coming to Australia and the fact that a policy of having $900,000 over two years was set aside to look into the questions that arose from that—yet the number is so large that it seems an impossible task. So has the government abandoned that policy?

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (17:36):  I think it is very important that the parliament focus on what the role of the Ombudsman actually is. As the member for Mackellar has pointed out, the Ombudsman is charged with a review role. He is a statutory officer with quite a high degree of independence; as such, and under the terms of his legislation, he is able to report directly to the parliament and indeed has done so on occasion. He also of course has an annual report in which he describes the work that he has engaged in over the previous year.


The Commonwealth has many dozens of statutory officers—obviously, all in roles different from the role the Ombudsman performs—but not all of those officers, many of whom have a statutory degree of independence conferred on them, have their own parliamentary committee. I do not think it would be workable for every statutory officer to have their own parliamentary committee. The member for Mackellar, quoting Dennis Pearce, made the point that the Ombudsman has for many years proved the value of having an Ombudsman—having independence, review processes and somewhere that members of the public can go to make their complaints, and indeed having someone who has a general oversight role and a discretion to go and look at various matters on his own motion, without waiting to be charged with an inquiry, without waiting even for a complaint to be made.


The nature of the Ombudsman's work means that it is difficult to forecast demand. Resourcing from year to year, to some extent, is going to on a best-guess basis. Just looking at the number of complaints received over the last four years might give you some indication of the degree of difficulty involved in making estimates in advance. For instance—and this is just the number of complaints and approaches to the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman; he has this other, separate, self-starting jurisdiction altogether—we read in the Ombudsman's reports that there were a total of 39,932 in 2007-08, but they leapt to 45,719 in 2008-09, went down again to 37,468 in 2009-10 and then rose slightly in 2010-11. That gives you an idea of the elasticity of the numbers of complaints, and the irregularity of the numbers gives you an indication of the difficulty of forecasting year-on-year what work the Ombudsman will have to carry out, what he is going to have to do. Obviously, where there is an increase in demand that can be estimated and clearly linked to some particular initiative or some new jurisdiction that has been conferred on the Ombudsman, then consideration of resourcing is possible. But, at a very general level, the Ombudsman's is one of those statutory offices where it is fairly difficult to make an accurate estimate from year to year as to what the work is going to be. I have no doubt that the Ombudsman will draw it to the government's attention if the staffing level as presently estimated for 2012-13, of 136 officers, is found to be inadequate. That is what the Ombudsman has done in the past, and I have no doubt that the present occupant of this statutory office will do that in the future.

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:01):  The fact is that there is no clearer sign of a strong economy than a surplus. I know that the shadow minister standing opposite me would be well aware of that. 




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The consideration in detail is an opportunity for the opposition to further examine the budget. If the minister is simply going to make a rhetorical statement to the chamber—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  I understand that the member for Sturt did jump—




Mr Pyne:
  I am surprised that the call was not given to me. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The procedure in this place is that the minister makes an opening statement and then we open up for the different calls. That is the pattern that has been happening in this place and I will—



Mr Pyne interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Sturt will sit in silence and wait for his call. 




Ms Hall:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would like to correct the record. This is also an opportunity for members, not just the opposition—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I will correct the record. The record is that the minister has the call to make an opening statement, and the minister has the call. 




Mr GARRETT:
  As I was saying before I was interrupted by the shadow minister, there is no clearer sign of a strong economy than a surplus. This government delivered a surplus in the budget and, not only that, it means that we have a buffer in case the global economy gets worse. It means that we can protect jobs. It builds on the successful economic management of this government in steering the country through the global final crisis, without Australia going into recession and without the really significant and very serious job losses that many other nations have faced. 


In particular in this budget we have secured our key education spending areas while making responsible savings wherever possible. The fact is that the Gillard Labor government continues to make record investments in school education and in early childhood—and my colleague Minister Kate Ellis is here as well—in comparison to the previous Howard government, of which the shadow minister was a member. The fact is that in this budget, in this financial year, the government will investment $13.6 billion in our schools compared to the $8.5 billion spent by the Howard government in its last budget. Over the next four years we will spend an estimated $59.9 billion on our schools. Nearly $60 billion will be spent by the Labor government because we recognise that substantial investment in education is absolutely central to our prospects as a nation in the future and we are prepared to show by the decisions we have made in this budget—by this financial commitment—how important education is for the Labor government. Of course, over the next four years we will spend about $22.3 billion on early childhood education and care measures as well, again highlighting the fact that this Labor government has a specific understanding of the need to invest right across the learning years from early childhood into primary school, high school and beyond.


In particular, I draw your attention to some of the commitments that were specifically made in the budget when it came through earlier this year. In Indigenous education, some $583 million will be provided in the Northern Territory's through the Stronger Futures package—a really significant commitment on our part. There will be significant additional investments for maths and science in schools as part of an overall $54 million joint announcement that I made with Minister Evans. As well as that, there will be two other further measures which I think are particularly important: $55.7 million will be provided to expand the HIPPY program, which was a joint announcement with my colleague Minister Ellis; and, of course, we will be continuing the critical funding for literacy and numeracy schemes which we announced on 5 May. A commitment of some $243 million has been made to literacy and numeracy. This recognises that literacy and numeracy are the building blocks of any child's school education and, in particular, it recognises the existing investment that we have made in national partnerships in the states not only in literacy and numeracy but in teacher quality and low SES communities as well. There are significant commitments to education in this budget as part of our overall recognition of how central education is to the future of the nation. (Time expired)

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (10:07):  It is no wonder that the minister would rather talk about the nonexistent surplus—the dodgy surplus—than about education, because the government's record in education, and his as a minister in particular, is so shallow. Unfortunately, in the sector they know that education is no longer at the centre of government policy as it was when Julia Gillard, as the Deputy Prime Minister, was also the Minister for Education. Unfortunately, this minister now holds the portfolio and as a consequence education has moved to the outer reaches of the government—and doesn't it show.


In this consideration in detail stage, I would like to ask a number of questions about the budget papers. The first of those goes to the issue of computers in schools. The minister would know that, at page 58 of the 2011-2012 Budget Paper No. 3, $200 million per year was provided across the forward estimates as payments for the states for the Digital Education Revolution—the computers in schools program. The government previously advised that the $200 million for maintenance and upgrades was to support the states maintain and upgrade the new computers. This year, Budget Paper No. 3 2012-2013 at page 55 now provides $200 million for 2012-2013 only, rather than for each year of the so-called Digital Education Revolution. So across the forward estimates there has been a significant cut to that $200 million a year that was promised last year.


Can the minister explain why the $200 million is no longer provided across the forward estimates annually after 2012-2013? Is this the end of the Commonwealth's involvement in the Digital Education Revolution program? Doesn't this mean that the program now amounts to a one-off investment in computers by the government with the states now left with the cost of maintaining the one-for-one ratio of computers in schools when we know that the states are severely cash-strapped—except for Western Australia—and therefore are highly unlikely to be able to find the resources to maintain the laptops in schools program? They have also, of course, struggled already over the last few years to find the resources necessary to install and maintain the laptops program, leading to very long delays in the computers in schools program and, of course, the significant cost blowout that we have already seen in the laptops program. Turning to the response of the government to the Gonski review, Budget Paper No. 2 also suggested the government is currently working through the reform proposals in consultation with the states and the territories and other education stakeholders. It is also understood that modelling has been released to the sector for the years 2009 and 2010.  TheSydney Morning Herald reported on 22 May:


But the first year-on-year comparison—between 2009 and 2010 funding—generated by the Gonski model, shows indexation in secondary schools falling to only 2.9 per cent and 3.8 per cent for primary schools. The executive director of the association, Geoff Newcombe, said the minister's promise that no school would lose a dollar now looked 'hollow'.


Can the minister confirm that indexation levels under the new model are as low as 2.9 per cent? Have further details been released to the sector on indexations since 22 May? How can the government assure all schools that they will now not lose a dollar under this model, if adopted, when indexation is in the range of two to four per cent rather than the approximately six per cent as is the current funding model—in other words, can the minister assure schools that they will not lose dollars in real terms over the next quadrennium of funding rather than his hollow promise at the moment that they will not lose one dollar. We know it would be a $4.2 billion cut to non-government schools if the indexation is not at six per cent but as low as zero. Will the minister make the policy and technical work being undertaken publicly available to all schools? 



Finally, there are other issues I would like to raise about literacy and numeracy, the Australian National Audit Office report and the paltry response of the government to the Gonski review. If I get another opportunity, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will do that. As you would know, it is a five-minute opportunity to question the minister and then others will seek to have an opportunity. Should I get another opportunity, I would like to question the minister about the Australian National Audit Office report which found that the $540 million Smarter Schools National Partnership for Literacy has been a complete failure— (Time expired)

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:12):  I wish that the shadow spokesperson for education in the coalition was better informed about education matters and policies. In putting this question to me, he has conveniently ignored the fact that the coalition has on the record some $2.8 billion of cuts to education funding. That $2.8 billion cut to education funding is something that the shadow minister himself has confirmed. On Meet the Presson 14 August last year he was asked by Paul Bongiorno: 


To be clear, you'll look for savings in your portfolio of education?


And Mr Pyne responded:


Well, we need to have savings across the budget.



I do not think it can be any clearer that it is specifically the goal of the coalition, in order to meet their savings target of some $70 billion, that nearly $3 billion of that will come from education, and the shadow minster is now on the record on that very matter.




Mr Pyne:
  On a point of order: the minister is talking about cuts to the education budget, but I specifically asked him about cuts to the Computers in Schools program.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  The member for Sturt will resume his seat. The minister is answering the question and he will continue with his response.




Mr GARRETT:
  This particular issue of cuts that have been promised by the coalition is germane to the Digital Education Revolution because the coalition themselves have a commitment to cut over $600 million from that program. The government is very proud of the delivery of Computers in Schools. Not only did we set ourselves the goal of a one to one ratio of delivery for students between years 9 to 12 but we have achieved that goal. More than 950,000 devices are being supplied to students, which is well above the national target of some 786,000.


The fact is that we promised we would bring schools into the digital age by providing enough computers for every senior high school student in the country and we have delivered on that promise. The current agreements end on 30 June, as the shadow minister should know, and we have made provisions in the budget to support new arrangements following consultations with states and territories and the non-government sector. That is entirely appropriate and the right way for us to go about managing the ongoing issues of computer access for kids in schools around Australia. I think the fact is that we have achieved a historic goal. We have put a computer in the hands of every Australian senior high school student. It is important now to recognise that the scheme was not intended to replace existing investments that were made by education authorities in new technologies; it was to provide a significant funding injection to level the playing field and bring all Australian schools into the 21st century and it is up to those who run the schools to keep them there.


I have established the Digital Education Advisory Group, a group of leading education and IT experts. They will provide us with advice on the next steps towards transforming teaching and learning through technology and I expect their strategy soon.


The shadow minister asked me about the Gonski review and the government's approach to the recommendations of Mr Gonski. We have said consistently that no school will lose a single dollar as a consequence of any recommendations that emerge from Mr Gonski and also that indexation will be part of any future model. I will make just one point to the shadow minister and the opposition: they have walked away from this important review. For the first time in nearly 40 years we have had an eminent panel consider closely the extremely critical question of funding for school education, and Mr Pyne, the shadow education spokesman, has completely walked away from it.


I am pleased to say that the remaining stakeholders in the education community have not walked away from it. We have participation by state governments and their officials, by the independent school sector and by a range of organisations with a genuine interest in the potential for funding reform in education, including the Australian Education Union, the Independent Education Union, the principals' councils and the parent councils. All of these organisations recognise it is in the best interests of our students that we have a funding model in this country that is fair, effective, transparent and does the job it is intended to do. We will continue to pursue the work that is underway on Gonski and there will be more to say about this later. (Time expired)

Mr SYMON
 (Deakin) (10:17):  Minister, with regard to funding for education in the budget, I am interested in building on the great work that the federal Labor government has done over the last four budgets. In my electorate of Deakin and also across Australia the federal Labor government has made a significant investment in local schools. Of course, by far the bulk of this investment has been in primary schools. Every primary school has had the opportunity to add a new building or refurbish their facilities to make them better places to teach and learn.


Every single member of the opposition voted against any of our schools getting money under the Building the Education Revolution program. They did not want it to happen. But in my electorate of Deakin every single school I have been to thinks it is a fantastic program. I would invite anyone who is listening to contact those schools and come out and talk to them about what they have got from the program. And it is still going on; they are not quite finished yet; there are more to be opened next year. These are especially the ones that have taken time to consult and to argue the point and actually get what they want out of the program. We have had some fantastic results with funding for our schools locally, particularly schools that broke out of the state government template and decided they wanted to do something different—and in the end they did. They got bigger and better buildings and, in many cases, had money left over to do extra building or extra refurbishments at the end of the job. We still have some of those going on right now. Schools such as Warranwood Primary, just out of my electorate, Heathmont East Primary and Antonio Park Primary got two major projects instead of one and that is great for them.


As I said, there is still more to come on stream but many of these schools in the electorate, although they now have great buildings and are great places to teach, also need ongoing investment because there is no point in just putting money into capital and then not being able to use the new learning spaces and the new technology that comes with them. Many of these schools have not seen a new building since the 1950s and when you go out there today the contrast is huge. Throughout the process I worked closely with schools. As I said, that is the way it worked best. Rather than just having the state government direct how federal government funds were spent, the local member was involved right down to that level. And it certainly shows. I congratulate each and every member of the Labor side of the House who went out and did that during the rollout. It shows now and it will show for decades to come.


Secondary schools, of course, have been the beneficiaries of the Digital Education Revolution, which the member for Sturt does not seem impressed with. Again, I invite people to come out to secondary schools in my electorate and ask them what they think of the 4,000 computers that have gone into secondary schools in the electorate of Deakin. They are very happy because they had nothing but they now have a lot. There are some problems getting data out of the Victorian state government with regard to this, so the best thing to do is go and talk to the schools.


Minister, I am interested in the $54 million you announced in May this year in response to the Chief Scientist's Mathematics, engineering and science in the national interest report. In particular, I am interested in the $16.9 million of the $54 million to deliver programs for Australian students. I note that that included $6½ million for CSIRO to expand the Scientist and Mathematicians in Schools program, taking interesting maths and science lessons to schools across Australia, particularly rural and regional schools. There was $5 million for Science Connections, to support the Science by Doing and Primary Connections projects, providing extra online teaching resources with leadership from the Australian Academy of Science. There was $3 million to fund National Support and Advice for Teachers, a new service for maths and science teachers to help them deliver stimulating and safe lessons. There was also an amount of $2.4 million to support the participation of Australia's most talented science and maths secondary students in the International Mathematics and Science Olympiad.


As I said, the important part about providing funding to schools is not only what is done on the outside but what we keep doing on the inside. Minister, can you provide me with further advice on the implementation of these programs and how they will improve the teaching of maths and science not only at schools in Deakin but right across Australia?

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:22):  I thank the member for Deakin for his question and also for his role as chair of the caucus education and skills committee. It is a very good question because it comes about at a time when we recognise there are additional needs in education to ensure that we have enough kids at school in maths and science and enough people to teach maths and science as well. But I just want to address one matter before I answer his question. Regrettably, the coalition spokesperson for education, the member for Sturt, has now fled the Federation Chamber. He is nowhere to be seen. He came in here and asked one question and had a typical spray and now he has departed again. If anything says to the public how seriously this shadow minister takes education it is the fact that he can only turn up to the Federation Chamber for 10 minutes and ask one question of me, the Minister for School Education, when he has the opportunity to be here for a full hour. The best that Mr Pyne could manage was 10 minutes and one question. It reminds me of his contribution when the Gonski report was released. Within 15 minutes of the report being released, the member for Sturt had condemned it. Apparently he was able to speed read the work that Mr Gonski and his eminent panel had undertaken. There were hundreds of pages of findings and recommendations in that report—deliberations in which the public and the education community had been involved—but the shadow minister for education, the member for Sturt, spent about 15 minutes musing and then dismissed it out of hand.


I want to respond to a question that the member for Sturt put as he fled the Federation Chamber, and that concerns the Literacy and Numeracy National Partnership. The fact is that the Literacy and Numeracy National Partnership is making a difference for the students it was intended to benefit. Yes, the ANAO report came out, but it compared the average results of all students in those schools to the average results in other schools. But the focus of this national partnership was on the students struggling in literacy and numeracy, those students who were below the national minimum standard. The fact is that we have seen improvements in moving those kids who are at that level. For example, between 2008 and 2011, 70 per cent of schools in this national partnership have reduced the proportion of their students who were below the minimum standard for year 3 reading and, between 2008 and 2011, 80 per cent of schools reduced the proportion of students who were below the minimum standard for year 5 maths. It is very important to get that on the record. It is regrettable that the member for Sturt did not hang around long enough to understand what a difference this government's investment is making in relation to this issue. 


The member for Deakin asks me a very important question about the budget commitment to the specific issue of increasing the opportunity for the delivery of improved maths and science teaching in schools. What I can say is this: the chief scientist was asked to investigate this matter by the Prime Minister. When the chief scientist investigated that matter, he came to the view that it was important that we were able to provide additional support across a range of program areas that had already been underway, including the ones that the member for Deakin mentions such as Science by Doing, and we were able to bring forward additional investment of some $54 million in the budget. Around that particular commitment nearly $11 million went to improving the quality of teacher training, especially for prospective teachers. That work now to be considered and under way will lift the opportunity for young students who are interested in graduating and teaching maths and science to have additional support and input, particularly through professional development provision of teaching instruction and the like. There is $3 million for national support and advice for teachers, including a national advisory and linking service. There are online videos, which I think are a particularly useful device to illustrate new funding standards for practical activities for school science laboratories. And, of course, there is the $3 million that the member mentioned for science connections programs. This investment that the Gillard Labor government is making is an especially important one, not only for the teachers and the students in the electorate of the member for Deakin but Australia-wide. We recognise that having high levels of proficiency in maths and science is absolutely central to enabling us to lead in technological advances to continue to build prosperity in the future—something that this government is fully committed to.

Firstly, Minister, your department commissioned a number of reports from Access Economics on workforce modelling and the cost of child care.

 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:28):  I thank the shadow spokesperson for her questions. On that first question, I am happy to take it on notice and we will provide an appropriate answer once we have sought advice from the department. On the second question, what I would say is this: again, as I was saying in response to the question of the member for Sturt before he fled the Federation Chamber having been in here for all of 10 minutes instead of the one hour that we spend in here for this important consideration in detail, the level of investment that the government has made in early childhood education and care is substantial. In fact, if we look back we can see that there has never been a time when a federal government has provided so much policy rigour, so much lift in terms of effort and so much specific support in terms of ensuring that young children get the appropriate care and sometimes instruction that best suits them before they enter the school years. This is an investment of $22 billion by this government—triple what was spent by the previous government. Attached to that is a National Quality Framework making sure that as a nation we recognise the importance of the quality components of early child care, professionalisation of the workforce and lifting of standards in childcare centres. All of these things are absolutely central to the approach that this government has taken and a great deal of the very good work that has been done by my colleague Minister Ellis.


We are also working very closely with the states in terms of the delivery of a commitment for universal access for kids in the year before school through the delivery of some $990 million to ensure that universal access, the goal we have set ourselves, can be reached.




Ms Ley:
  If you don't answer the question, I'll assume the answer is yes.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Farrer should know it is not question time. The minister has the call.




Mr GARRETT:
  I do wish that those opposite would let sink in the significant scope and reach of the investments that this government has been making in early child care and education. It is a case that there have been people coming into the parliament—and certainly we had United Voice and others in the parliament earlier this week—raising issues around the wages and conditions of those who work in early childhood in the early childhood centres and more broadly. We understand that that is a significant commitment that these people make. But we understand and know that the professionalisation of this workforce means that for everybody who has made a commitment to work in early childhood care and education we have provided the opportunity for them by way of HECS and HELP relief. We have provided the opportunities for them by the recognition of prior learning. We have provided opportunities for them by making sure that the National Quality Framework and those measures that are identified in that framework are fully understood and communicated to them. We acknowledge that there are issues for them and respect the fact that they are able to come into the parliament and put their views to the members on both sides of the House.


What was disappointing to me, though, I have to say, as I respond to the question of the member opposite is that I do not hear anything from the opposition about our commitment to the National Quality Framework. I do not hear anything from the opposition about providing a substantial level of support for early childhood care and education. I do not hear anything from the opposition about encouraging their states, and particularly states that now have a coalition perspective, to get behind this reform and recognise what a profound difference it can make to the lives of kids in early childhood, particularly in that transition period as they go into school.


Minister Ellis and I are constantly visiting these centres and we recognise that these reforms are already starting to bear fruit. We can see the tremendous enthusiasm and support that many in the sector have not only for the National Quality Framework but for making sure that the young people under their care are appropriately and well looked after but additionally are provided with that level of care and some learning that equips them well as they enter school. For parents, this is one of the most significant things that their children can do. We understand how important it is and will continue with this work. (Time expired)

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (10:33):  I am very glad to have the opportunity today to make some inquiries of the minister in relation to matters concerning education in the budget. There is a considerable amount of interest in my electorate in education and recognition of the investments made by this government which have delivered great educational outcomes through great capital investments and display the ongoing commitment of this government to education at a very local and very practical level in the electorate of La Trobe. I take this opportunity to convey to the minister something that was passed on to me with great emphasis last week at Belgrave Heights Christian College. It is pertinent in light of the comments made by the member for Sturt earlier today in relation to computers in schools. I was asked very clearly to convey the thanks of that particular school for the significant investment in computers that have assisted it in delivering education to its students. I have had the opportunity to see at that school some robotics education and other things being provided there that would not have been possible without the computers that we, the government, have committed to that one school in a very large electorate.


I should also say that they were very appreciative of the other considerable capital investments that have been made by this government in the school, not only through the BER program, which has delivered to them a really marvellous stadium, for which they are very appreciative, but also the construction of additional learning centres and a VCE study centre, through a capital grant. Also, there was a commitment to a discovery centre, which I was at the opening of last week. They are also to be the beneficiary of a trades training centre. So that one school alone demonstrates the wealth of commitments in education that we have made, and they are certainly very grateful for it.


Likewise, I was very pleased to be at one of the most recent openings of a BER building, this one in Narre Warren North Primary School. It is one of the oldest schools in my electorate. The school has not had a significant amount of capital expenditure on it in the past and certainly would not have been the beneficiary of capital expenditure had our colleagues opposite been in office. They were most appreciative of the school building, which has enabled them to come together as a school and continue on after more than a century in the local area.


Less positively, Minister—and I am sure it brings some pressure to bear in the context of the appropriations we are considering today—you will no doubt be aware of the Baillieu government's actions in education, which have seen a significant amount of money torn away from the education budget in Victoria, and it is from some of our most disadvantaged schools, it has to be said. For instance, some schools in Victoria will lose up to around $80,000 as a result of the Baillieu government's decision to cut the education maintenance allowance, combined with the scrapping of the $300 School Start Bonus, which has contributed to a $19 million saving for Ted Baillieu and the Victorian government. It is most unfortunate that while we are contributing significant amounts to education, and have done since we came to office, as has been the tradition of Labor, in Victoria we simply see Ted Baillieu not only skimping on education but in fact cutting away at the things that have been delivered. It is a neat contrast that we have been providing a Schoolkids Bonus at the same time as the Baillieu government is pulling away money from schools and from families.


In addition to this, some of my schools have particularly raised with me the issue of the Baillieu government effectively taking away $7 million in federal funding promised to state schools under the National Literacy and Numeracy Partnerships. That has been specifically raised by Kambrya College with me. They are also very appreciative of the significant investments that this federal government has made in education. They contrast it with the actions of the state government.


A number of schools in my electorate have an interest in and a connection with remote communities and Indigenous communities, and have a particular interest in closing the gap in education, and across the board. Upwey High School, St Josephs in Ferntree Gully and Mater Christi have all expressed an interest in those issues, and I am sure there are more schools in the area that take an interest in those issues. I would be grateful, Minister, for some further information about what the budget delivers and what we have delivered overall since coming to office in relation to closing the gap in Indigenous education.

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:38):  I thank the member for La Trobe for that question. It certainly is the case that, for Labor members of parliament, one of the most important things they do is maintain close contact with their school community, because there is such a great deal that has happened in education since we came into government. The fact is that there has never been a period of time when the level of investment by a federal government in education has been so significant and far reaching and the level of attention to policy reform has been so specific and the delivery of support into every school in the country has been so evident. I am absolutely thrilled to hear from the member for La Trobe that, for example, the trades training centre investment this government is making is appreciated in her electorate. Before the member for Sturt, the shadow minister for education, fled the Federation Chamber, having been in here for all of ten minutes and having asked one question, I was making the point that the coalition has on record cuts of $2.8 billion in education—the spirit of which was confirmed by the shadow minister in his interview with Paul Bongiorno last year—including a commitment that would have seen over a billion dollars cut out of the trades training centre program. It is extraordinary when you think about it, because those trades training centres are making an incredible difference in schools that have access to them right around the country.


I know that for members—the member for La Trobe in particular—this is even more important when you consider some of the really difficult issues that are emerging as the Baillieu government starts to make cuts in education, including cuts to TAFE training in Victoria—which, I have to say, I think has always been one of the best TAFE systems in the country. Victoria's economy in the past, under the stewardship of Premier Bracks and Premier Brumby, was in a position to capitalise on the need for well-trained, well-skilled people to come through the school system and into TAFE. Now, of course, that is jeopardised as well. I am particularly concerned to hear that there are threats to the investment that this Commonwealth government—this Labor government—is making across areas like the literacy and numeracy national partnership. I have always said to the states that we want to provide that extra support and investment that we think can make a difference in school systems. It is not intended that states should simply take advantage of the fact that we have a profound commitment to education and seek to defray or reduce their investment as a consequence.


The member for La Trobe asked me a question that would be of interest to her and to some of the schools and her constituents, including St Joseph's in Ferntree Gully, about the commitment to Indigenous education. This is something that I know that everybody in the House recognises as an important and ongoing issue and a challenge for governments, including for the federal government. I am extremely pleased to say that we are starting to see signs of progress in Indigenous communities, including in the areas of education. Even this morning we saw a report in the Australian about the kind of uptake that we are seeing both in employment and last week, under Minister Macklin, in terms of the provision of housing. We are genuinely making progress there, and the budget was very clear that we were going to continue to provide that level of investment.


I was particularly keen that we were able to have substantial delivery through the budget in Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory—some $3.4 billion in the 10-year package—and that goes across a range of areas: primary health care, food security, making sure that we have got access to quality education for Aboriginal kids, and nearly $20 million for 50 additional Working on Country ranger positions. I know that in my previous portfolio I was particularly keen to see that happen, and in the budget we have provided the opportunity for Indigenous ranger cadetships to be applied in pilots around the country as well, and I announced that last week. 


In particular, I want to draw attention to two things of importance. Teach Remote is another investment to attract and retain high calibre teachers in remote areas—some $14 million that we have invested there. That is something that I think students and potential teachers in the member for La Trobe's electorate would be interested in. There is more we can do, but we have already— (Time expired)

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (10:43): I will be brief so that others can have an opportunity to ask questions. My questions are regarding the BER and, specifically, the collapse of the building company Reed Construction. Minister, are you aware that the company Reed Construction went into liquidation last week and that builders across northern New South Wales are owed approximately, to my understanding, $12 million? I would like a response for my constituents, particularly Chris Catterall, a builder in Moree who is owed $642,000; Lachlan Hall from Warialda, who is owed approximately $80,000; and Bill Crawford from Moree, who is owed just over $9,000. Minister, I would like your understanding as to the fact that this was a Commonwealth-funded program and as to what response you will be making to these builders. Also, Minister, I would like you to comment on the fact that a program that was designed to stimulate the economy during the global financial crisis will ultimately lead to the financial ruination of building companies right throughout the north-west—on top of the collapse of TCT Constructions, who were doing work for Laing O'Rourke in Dubbo a couple of years ago, which left subcontractors in Dubbo in my electorate out of pocket by about $2 million.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (10:45):  Earlier this year the new childcare ratios for zero-to-24-month-old children were implemented. This has seen childcare fees increased by an estimated 11 per cent across the board this year, according to surveys undertaken. I know that in my electorate increases of these levels have occurred and it has put enormous strains on the budgets of local families. Over the next few years lower ratios for older children will also be introduced. My question, for either Minister Garrett or Minister Ellis, is: what do you estimate will be the further increase in the costs of operating childcare centres once these new ratios are introduced? It is a very specific question.

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:46):  To the member for Parkes, I am aware that Reed Constructions have entered voluntary administration. I should point out to the member that in fact responsibility for the BER is in Minister Shorten's hands and I will certainly direct your question to his office for an additional answer. What I can say is that we know that Ferrier Hodgson have been appointed as the administrator. We recognise, as I know everybody here would, that it does impose significant and considerable difficulties on builders such as the builder in your electorate that you referred to when a building company of this size enters into these difficulties. We do know that any claims for subcontractors for unpaid moneys are now managed as appropriate by the insolvency practitioner.


But I would make the point in concluding this answer and before I hand over to Minister Ellis that this is a matter that Barry O'Farrell as Premier of New South Wales cannot ignore. These are issues, as I understand it, that in part go to the delivery of projects to the New South Wales government. On that basis, as the New South Wales government has effective on-ground responsibility for the delivery of those projects, it is entirely appropriate that the New South Wales government be held to account for the delivery of the investment that the Commonwealth provided, through the states, for Building the Education Revolution.



Mr Coulton interjecting—




Mr GARRETT:
  There is an interjection from the member opposite, but the fact of the matter is simply this: it is up to those state authorities who are in receipt of the investment that is provided by the Commonwealth to ensure that it is appropriately and properly given effect to. That is what has to happen. If there is a reason why a particular builder finds itself going into liquidation on a matter of delivery through the state entities then clearly it is a responsibility of the state government to be able to answer that question as well. I will conclude my answer there, because I think Minister Ellis is going to take up a question from the member for Aston.

Ms KATE ELLIS
 (Adelaide—Minister for Employment Participation and Minister for Early Childhood and Childcare) (10:48):  Thank you for the question with regard to the government's national quality framework, which we have been pursuing in partnership with every state and territory government of all different political persuasions. The member for Aston asked some questions about affordability in particular. I would like to point out that there is nobody who is more concerned about the affordability of child care than the Gillard government. We do not just talk about that; we showed that we believe it by investing some $19.9 billion over the next four years in directly assisting Australian families with the cost of their child care. That is some triple the amount that the Howard government was investing. So when we talk about affordability I think is very important that we actually recognise that we have increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We have increased the cap on that rebate from $4,354 per child per year to $7,500, and that has had a very real impact on the affordability of child care. We know the analysis shows that a family in 2004 who were spending 13 per cent of their disposable income are now spending 7.5 per cent of that income. That is not to say that this is an ongoing issue. We know that Australian families are struggling with cost of living. That is exactly why we are investing this additional funding, and that is exactly why we have committed to continuing to work to ensure that child care is both affordable and quality.


I would say the figure that the member for Aston referred to, which has been in the media, is not an accurate figure in regard to increases. If we want to have a look at the figures we have, we know that the new national quality standards came into effect from 1 January this year. The only official figures that we have seen since then were the CPI figures. I would say that the CPI increase for child care for the first quarter of 2012 under the National Quality Framework was less than in the same quarter of each of the last two years of the Howard government, when they were doing absolutely nothing to improve the quality of care. So, I think we need to get the facts on the table.


The other thing that I would just like to address is why it is that we are pursuing these changes, because I know the member that asked the question has made some statements which are not accurate in the House.



Honourable members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! This is not question time. It is consideration in detail.




Ms KATE ELLIS:
  I am answering the question. The member opposite might be interested, and I think the families of Aston deserve to have the very best start for their children. The member has stood in the chamber and said that there is no discernible benefit from increasing the quality of care, which is rubbish, frankly. That is absolute rubbish. We now have a body of evidence which shows us that we have more children in care than we have ever had before in this nation's history. We have over 1,321,00 children who will be using care in the next year. We also have all of the evidence that shows that this is when 90 per cent of brain development occurs. What happens in the critical early years will affect children right throughout the course of their lives. It will affect their educational outcomes, it will affect their social outcomes and it will affect their development outcomes. All of the research shows that the best way we can foster the best start in life for these children is by ensuring that they have well-trained and qualified staff who know how to get the best out of their learning and who have the ability to give them supervision and attention. That is why we are proud of these reforms. That is why every government, including his state Liberal government, has signed up because we know it is important to Australia's future that we give kids the best chance.


In terms of what we believe the increase will be, we have done extensive modelling on this. We know that we expect the national average peak increase to be $8.67 per week. Of course we recognise that that varies from centre to centre and it varies from state to state, but that is the best independent economic modelling advice that we have on what the cost of these changes will be. I believe that the children of Aston are worthy of this. I believe that the government has invested triple the investment of the Howard government to ensure that child care can become more affordable. We have committed to continuing to do that, and we have been upfront about the costs of it.


There is a case in terms of child development, there is a case in terms of child safety, but there is also a case in terms of national productivity. We know that if we want the best developed workforce of the future and the best educated children coming through we need to invest early and save money later on, and we are very, very proud to be working in partnership with our states and territories to be delivering just that. I would say that it is about time the member for Aston stood up and told his electorate the truth and also stood up for the families— (Time expired)

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (10:54):  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I have become aware the longer I am the member for Parramatta that how profoundly different the experience of children can be as they approach school years and get in to school. There are almost two completely different worlds. There is the world of Westmead Public School which is one of my best schools. It is a centre for excellence, it has a great cohort of parents who are mainly double professional career families, it has a lot of skilled migrants and a strong commitment to education. You will find it is an incredibly good school with a very active P&C. The children are engaged in extracurricular activity in fine arts and high-level sport as well as their educational activities. These are kids that are in every way being given what they need to fly, regardless of what their capacity is.


There is a child I met a number of years ago when I was up at Telopea Railway Station. She first started wandering down across the train line which, at that point, did not have a gate. She would wander across that train line and across Adderton Road, which is a main road, to get a carton of milk every morning and then go back. She was about four. As the years progressed she started bringing down her younger brother, who was still in nappies, and they would wander across the train line and head down to get a carton of milk every morning. It was in a very short time that, in the only way I can describe it, they started to get the mark of poverty; that slightly grey skin and wariness in their eyes. I watched them over those two years and thought: 'This is a remarkable young girl. She has everything in her that she needs to do well in life: she's committed, she's loyal, she's making things happen, she clearly gets herself out of bed and into school uniform. She does that.' I asked her one day and she said her mum was still asleep. She was a remarkable young girl, but you know that when she reached school age she probably would not have had the parental assistance in learning to read, learning to count and all the things that parents do for you. They walk up the stairs and count and they read to you and show you, before you get to school, how to learn.


These are two completely different experiences of school, and I am well aware that we need to be working at both ends. We need to make sure that a person can stand. We also need to make sure that person can fly if they can. There has been a considerable investment in education by this government—a doubling of investment in education and some great programs that have been rolled out in Parramatta—but I would like to hear from both ministers how we are addressing the needs of both of those groups of children.

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:57):  I thank the member for Parramatta. She is absolutely right. One of the key things about the findings and recommendations of the Gonski review was that where we have concentrated disadvantage existing within schools then, no matter what a student's capacity might be, they will be prevented from realising their full potential unless we ensure that we are providing the necessary support to them in those school years, including early childhood, primary and secondary. I am pleased to know that when it comes to that level of investment this government has invested some $2.5 billion in the Smarter Schools National Partnerships, and that includes investing in schools which are described as having low socioeconomic communities. In particular, in Parramatta there has been a significant investment in those national partnerships that I am particularly pleased to be able to identify for the member.


It is especially pleasing for me to see that we have provided a great deal of support for schools. Catherine McAuley Westmead has received $2 million of support for learning areas and technical applied studies facilities and the like. Schools like Mother Teresa Primary School under the BER received significant investment. In low socioeconomic areas of investment we have provided investment into schools like Arthur Phillip High School, Maryland Public School and Rydalmere Public School. All of these schools have received additional support and investment for their students and over time we expect to continue to see the fruits of this investment start to emerge. We recognise that the high level of support and the great priority that the Gillard government has placed on education is intended to do just that: help these students, including the students that the member for Parramatta referred to.


Remember the context: more transparency than ever for parents in the community with the My School website; a national curriculum, with the implementation now underway around Australia in English, maths, science and history; for the first time, national professional qualifications and standards for teachers; national partnerships, including the ones I have mentioned, on teacher quality and supporting low SES communities; and a national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan to make sure that Indigenous kids around Australia get the support that they need as well. We are absolutely committed to making sure that these students and these schools continue to get the support that they need within the context of understanding what makes a difference, including teacher quality and early intervention for students, particularly those who may have learning difficulties or a disability or who may come from a low socioeconomic background. I was so pleased to visit the Macarthur Girls High School in the member for Parramatta's electorate—we had a fantastic session at that high school—and I could see how well the Macarthur girls were doing. Yes, they have received some support from the federal government; but, when I go to the My School website and look at their NAPLAN tests, I can see that they are achieving a great deal.


I will not ask the minister to jump up for the last minute, unless she is keen to take the call—




Ms Kate Ellis:
  No.




Mr GARRETT:
  I might then provide an additional answer to a question that was put by the member for Farrer. With regard to early childhood education and childcare reports, I am advised that the Productivity Commission report and interim response is on the DEEWR website, and the Access Economics report is on the COAG website. So I think that is evidence enough of the delivery of transparency for these reports—to those who take the time to listen.



During this consideration in detail of the budget appropriation before us, the member for Sturt, the shadow spokesperson for education, came in here for all of 10 minutes, asked one question and then fled the Federation Chamber. All that he said about education was that he wants to cut $2.8 billion out of the sector. All he said about the Gonski review and the important reforms that lie within it—one of the most important and significant pieces of policy discussion that we have had before us as a parliament—was that he has ruled that out of court all together, and he has confirmed that there would be further cuts to education funding. This Labor government is fully committed to continuing its support for education, as evidenced by the appropriations in this budget. (Time expired)

Last year, the government announced the Building Australia's Future Workforce Package, and members of the House will be pleased to know it is already benefiting more than 230,000 people. Protecting jobs has been the No. 1 priority of the Gillard government from day one, and our measures reflect that commitment. Today there are more Australians in work than ever before. This budget delivers on the broader economic goals of the government, delivering on our commitment to return the budget to surplus and with surpluses growing over the forward estimates. We also want to spread the benefits of the resources boom to help families on low and middle incomes make ends meet, with the cost of living.


With regard to employment and workplace relations specifically, the 2012-13 budget delivers on a number of important measures in the Employment and Workplace Relations portfolio. And I must acknowledge the work of the Minister for Employment Participation in developing this package. We recognise that in order to maintain a strong economy we need to have highly skilled and experienced Australians in our workplaces. With a lifetime of work experience, older Australians have skills that make them extremely valuable assets to the workforce. The government will invest over $55 million over four years in additional assistance to harness the potential of mature-age workers. The jobs bonus will help challenge employers to recruit older job seekers, with corporate champions to help employers implement age-friendly work practices. The Mature Age Participation—Job Seeker Assistance Program is extending experience and career advice.


We are going to encourage parents to participate in work. We are also providing more childcare assistance, making it easier for parents of young children in receipt of income support to return to work, by extending the reach of the popular Jobs, Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance program. An extra $225 million over four years will enable 130,000 families to access this assistance. We have new employer initiatives for disadvantaged job seekers, including Wage Connect and the Disability Employment Broker Program. We also have employment advice services for vulnerable workers.


In conclusion, the government are committed to supporting jobs, and the 2012-13 budget continues to build on our investment in skills training and a range of assistance for Australian job seekers.

Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (12:18):  I have a series of questions for the minister. I will go through those questions and those you cannot answer we will put on notice. In relation to the department's incoming government brief, the red book, it states:


The department is already badly resourced.


According to the department's calculations, by what percentage is the department underfunded in the wake of the most recent cuts to the operating budget? How much additional funding will be cut in dollar terms? Did the department advise the government against further funding cuts? Which areas of departmental operations will have the largest redundancies and what will be the reduction across the various levels of seniority within the department?


On the issue of expenses, I ask the minister: what will be the impact of further funding cuts to consular services? Are more Australians travelling overseas and by what amount, and is there an increased consular case workload as a result? Is there sufficient capacity within the department to deal with a major crisis involving large numbers of Australians needing consular support overseas? Is that capacity similar to the past or less? Are Austrade officers in posts being seconded to provide consular support? If so, in which posts and what percentage of their time is being taken up by consular support?


Regarding AusAID, I have a number of questions about the independent review of aid effectiveness. Recommendation 39 of the Australian government's Independent Review of Aid Effectiveness says:


The scale–up of the aid program to 0.5 per cent of GNI should be subject to the progressive achievement of predetermined hurdles. 


Have these hurdles been determined? If so, are they publicly available? If the hurdles or benchmarks have not been imposed, why not? How will AusAID be measured against these benchmarks and who will undertake the assessment?


In relation to salary supplements, does AusAID recruit nationals of the countries in which it operates? How does AusAID determine salaries for nationals so recruited? Does AusAID supplement or top up salaries for some foreign nationals who work for their governments? Does AusAID supplement or top up salaries of public servants in other countries? If so, what measures does AusAID put in place to prevent a conflict of interest? How many public servants are in receipt of AusAID top-up payments? What is the level of the top-up payments as a percentage of their government salary? Is the government of each country notified of all employees in receipt of top-up payments?


On the question of domestic lobbying in the aid budget, how much of taxpayer funds are diverted to domestic awareness raising or lobbying activities? Are organisations in receipt of AusAID funding allowed to use taxpayer funding to lobby for increased funding from AusAID? How does this ban on lobbying for increases reconcile with the vocal and high-profile campaign for an increase in the aid budget to 0.5 per cent or 0.7 per cent of GNI, depending upon the organisation? How does AusAID prevent development organisations from using taxpayer funding to support this lobbying?


I have a number of questions on the campaigns on sexually transmitted diseases. Has Caritas been successful in winning tenders to promote awareness of STI? In particular, is Caritas actively promoting the use of condoms as part of that campaign? If not, was AusAID aware of the fact that Caritas would not promote the use of condoms and why was it awarded that tender?


What is the acceptable level of cost transfer back to headquarters of organisations involved in delivering the aid program? What percentage of a given program is attributed to offshore costs by World Vision, Oxfam and Save the Children, for example?


Is AusAID aware of reports that its funding of PNG police officers has created a virtual private security force that largely protects Malaysian logging interests? What steps has AusAID taken to ensure that its funding is not being used for such purposes?


How much money has been spent to date on the Australian Civilian Corps? How many people have been deployed? How many people have registered to be part of the Civilian Corps? How many of these are Australian public servants? How many people are involved in managing the program in Canberra? What is the cost of administering the program compared with the cost of deployment?

Dr EMERSON
 (Rankin—Minister for Trade and Competitiveness) (12:23):  In respect of the first set of questions relating to the resourcing of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I will seek to provide answers where we reasonably can. But a number of these matters may well be cabinet-in-confidence and we, like all governments of whatever political persuasion, will not breach that confidentiality. Yes, efficiency dividends have been applied to agencies and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is not exempt from those efficiency dividends, nor would it expect to be. In the context of bringing the budget back to surplus, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was able to announce the establishment of a consulate in Chengdu in western China, a city of some eight million people. The establishment of this consulate is a very important part of the Australia in the Asia Century white paper endeavour. We want to increase our presence in China. We already have a presence in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Here is a fourth presence. We will continue to look at our consular presence around the world. But we need to do so understanding the budget constraints that apply as we return the budget to surplus. I can also confirm that we are establishing a presence in Senegal in French-speaking Africa. A lot of Australian mining companies have interests and prospective interests in that part of the world. Even in the context of what is a tough budgetary situation for all, we are able to announce meaningful new policies in that area.


Are more Australians travelling overseas? Yes, they are. That is a reflection, in part, of the strength of the Australian dollar, which is a vote of confidence in the management of this economy. Armed with valuable Australian dollars more people are travelling overseas; therefore, on occasions extra consular assistance is sought. I know in Phuket, Thailand, for example, a lot of work is done by our post to provide consular assistance to tourists there. I will seek to provide information, where we possibly can, to satisfy the questioning of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.


In relation to AusAID and recommendation 39 of the review about predetermined hurdles and GNI, it is now well known that we have pushed out by one year the achievement of 0.5 per cent of GNI. I understood that this did have the support of the coalition. I am able to give the assurance that, where we are reasonably able to do so, we will provide further information to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.


In relation to domestic lobbying by non-government organisations, I make the general point that any expenditure by AusAID in order to qualify as overseas development assistance must be what is called 'ODA-able'. You cannot simply generate spending proposals and then expect that to qualify, otherwise we would be in the situation where all sorts of activities are lumped into the foreign aid budget, and we want to avoid that where it is not warranted. But, again, I will get information. In relation to the broader issue of lobbying for increases in ODA as a proportion of gross national income, of course, non-government organisations have done that and will continue to do so.


On Caritas, yes, we will get information about any contracts with them and the issue of sexually transmitted diseases and the use of condoms. I must say the suggestions or implications by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that AusAID is funding the PNG Police Force in order to protect the illegal lobbying is a long way out there, just the other side of the Milky Way. I will seek to get information on that, but I think that there is a pretty serious allegation there. We will seek to do the right thing and provide information where we reasonably can but within the context of both reasonableness when it come to the burdens of the department and cabinet confidentiality.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Dr EMERSON
 (Rankin—Minister for Trade and Competitiveness) (12:28):  I thank the member for Banks for the questions. This is a negotiation that was initiated by the previous government in 2005. Having come to the portfolio of trade in September or so of 2010, it came to my attention that no progress had been made during the period of the previous government from 2005 through to November 2007. A whole series of negotiations or meetings had occurred, but, in fact, no progress had been made.


We have continued to press China on this. There are some terribly vexed issues in any negotiation of this sort between countries such as Australia and China, which has 1.32 billion people. Frankly, in order for this to be progressed successfully it would need a level of bipartisanship, and it does not enjoy that. This is a fundamental problem because the coalition, having initiated these negotiations, is now saying in respect of foreign investment by China in agricultural land that it wants to drop the threshold for private foreign investment from $244 million to as little as $30 million. That would be the end of any discussion on a free trade agreement between Australia and China because China would see that as very discriminatory against it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on 19 October last year, had urged that we accelerate negotiations for the successful completion of an Australia-China free trade agreement and the very next day her leader said no, that it should be put on the backburner and Japan should be prioritised. In order for this agreement ever to materialise, we cannot have Senator Barnaby Joyce and others running around with anti-China rants and then, with the prospect of a discussion paper coming out, suggesting that we drop that threshold, which I am quite sure from discussions with my Chinese counterparts would mean the end of any possibility of a free trade agreement.


What the Chinese have done is approached us about a free trade agreement but with a real emphasis on agriculture. Again, you would think that the coalition would support that, at least the National Party side, because China did give access to New Zealand to the agricultural demand of a massive country and have said to us, 'We would contemplate giving you New Zealand style access.' That would be a huge boost to Australian farmers, particularly beef and dairy farmers.


There are great prospects here, but then we have part of the coalition actually working in the opposite direction. To the credit of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, she has been quite consistent on this, saying, 'Let's do it. It's an important deal.' But other parts of the coalition to which the Leader of the Opposition listens every day—and that includes Senator Barnaby Joyce—are saying, 'We're not very happy about China. We're very anxious about it. We don't necessarily think bringing a free trade agreement to a successful conclusion is a good idea.' So that bipartisanship is lost.


It is not lost upon the Chinese, I must say. They know that there is an alternative government in Australia that is saying that they are not sure about the wisdom of completing free trade negotiations. It would not just be in agriculture, I say to the member for Banks. It would be the diversification that we are seeking in services. We have so many Australian companies looking to diversify. A hundred of them accompanied me to China in August of last year on the biggest delegation to leave Australia's shores, I think. There is no better time, I say to the member for Banks, who has a very great fondness for Gough Whitlam, than the 40th anniversary of the official recognition of the People's Republic of China. It was one of the first steps that Gough Whitlam took when he was elected. He was elected in early December and by 21 December we had recognised officially the People's Republic of China.



Mr Melham interjecting—




Dr EMERSON:
  That is right. There is now this sense that we should use this opportunity. Let's use the fondness that exists between our two countries to complete those negotiations. But I have to say it would be very difficult to complete them when we have a divided coalition. I would urge the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to use her authority within the coalition to bring to heel the Barnaby Joyces, the anti-China rants, and see if we cannot actually get a true level of bipartisanship instead of people of good intent, such as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, saying the right thing but her leader and the aspiring Prime Minister of Australia saying exactly the opposite.

Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (12:33):  Minister, I now turn to the issue of the United Nations Security Council campaign for a temporary seat for 2013-14. What has been the total expenditure on the campaign, including staff seconded to the UNSC campaign? How many staff are working on the campaign? How many countries have pledged their votes in writing to Australia and how many have given verbal pledges? How many have indicated that they will not be voting for Australia? How many have said that they are undecided? Has there been an increase in the number of invitations to Australia to the leaders of other nations? What is the average cost of each visit? Typically what costs are borne by the Australian taxpayer of each visit? Has the department assessed the level of additional resources that will be needed if Australia is successful in its bid for a temporary seat? If so, how much will be required?


I refer the minister to Australia's promotion of its candidature for the UN Security Council. Has the department updated this big booklet or website to reflect the government's revised time frame for expanding overseas development aid? It still says that you are going to deliver five per cent of GNI by 2015. I also note that the member for Griffith is still described as the foreign minister in the booklet. Has this been updated? If not, why not? How much did it cost to produce the booklets? How many booklets were produced? How much would it cost to reprint all the booklets, if that has been done? Will the department remove the booklets with the factual errors from website and from broader circulation?


Was the foreign minister advised by the department to threaten Papua New Guinea that Australia would organise the world to isolate and condemn Papua New Guinea and impose sanctions if elections in Papua New Guinea were delayed?


Has the live cattle trade to Indonesia recovered to its pre-suspension levels? What has been the cost to Australia's cattle industry from the lesser demand from Indonesia for our livestock? Was there any understanding between the Australian government and the Indonesian government to secure a reduction in Schapelle Corby's sentence after the release of Indonesian minors from Australian jails? Was the possibility of juvenile detention for the Indonesian minors considered? Was the Prime Minister advised by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to personally telephone the so-called Bali boy after his arrest?


I note that the minister made mention of the new consulate in China. Did the department recommend a number of possible locations for a new consulate in China? What was the department's preferred location? Did the former foreign minister ever express his preference for the new consulate to be situated in Chongqing? If so, what were his reasons for selecting Chongqing as opposed to Chengdu or other locations?


Has the Australian government implemented all United Nations sanctions on Iran? Are the Australian government's actions in relation to the implementation of UN sanctions consistent with the actions of, for example, the United States and the European Union? What is the Australian government's official position towards Iran? Does the government believe that military action should be 'taken off the table'?


Has the United States embassy or the United States government and its officials raised the question of cuts to the Australian defence budget? If so, when and where did this take place and at what level did this representation occur?


Going to the minister's own portfolio, could the minister provide the current status of the Australia-Gulf Cooperation Council Free Trade Agreement negotiations and the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement? When was the last pre-negotiation consultation with Indonesia held? Have any pre-negotiation consultations been held since the Australian government announced its ban on live cattle exports to Indonesia? Could the minister also provide details of the Australia-Japan Free Trade Agreement, the Australia-South Korea Free Trade Agreement, PACER Plus and the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement? What positions has Australian taken during trade negotiations in relation to tariff reductions? Has Australia sought tariff reductions? What are the scale of those reductions? Has Australia sought zero tariffs during some negotiations? If so, for which commodities, and which countries have been asked to consider zero tariffs on Australian exports?

Dr EMERSON
 (Rankin—Minister for Trade and Competitiveness) (12:39):  In relation to the UN Security Council bid, within the bounds of reasonableness we will seek to provide relevant information. I am not by any means persuaded that it is in Australia's national interest to start articulating to the opposition and, through that process, to the Australian people and the public more generally exactly who has pledged what to whom. I am not sure that those countries would necessarily think that was a good idea. If you want to prejudice the Security Council bid—and maybe the coalition does—that would be a pretty good way of going about it. I imagine that some of these consultations and discussions about arrangements would be fairly confidential. So I am not going to commit that we will provide information about conversations that have been held with each and every country in relation to the UN Security Council bid. I would be interested—I have not caught up with the latest—in knowing whether the coalition has an official position of opposing that bid. Certainly, the request for information that is being sought seems to me to be designed to prejudice it.


I was asked whether Australia issues invitations to leaders of other nations to come to this country. Yes, things have moved on; Fortress Australia has been dismantled. That was through the fifties and sixties, when we in this country were very fearful of foreigners. People like Pauline Hanson still are, but I would hope that the coalition is not. Of course, we invite people from other countries to come to Australia.




Ms Julie Bishop:
  You're better than this, Craig.




Dr EMERSON:
  The deputy opposition leader says, 'You are better than this, Craig.' It is fascinating, when we are in the second decade of the 21st century, that the best question she is able to think up is: 'Do we invite leaders of other countries to this country?'




Ms Julie Bishop:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene. I asked if there had been an increase in the number of invitations and, if so, a whole series of things.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  The minister will allow the question and the member for Curtin will resume her seat.




Dr EMERSON:
  I am not sure that we keep records of the number of people we have asked to visit Australia over the last 20 or 30 years as a basis for providing this information. But I can tell you that if there were an increase it would be a good thing. I actually think it is great that we engage with countries. The coalition seems to have the view that international trade is fine, so long as it does not involve foreigners. We are actually quite keen to continue the internationalisation of the Australian economy.




Ms Julie Bishop:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene. I find that an offensive point by the minister. I am asking a very serious question about whether over the last 12 months there has been an increase in invitations to leaders of other nations. I am asking about the cost of each visit and what costs are borne by the Australian taxpayer. That is a perfectly respectable question to ask. The minister should take it seriously and not be so offensive.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister has the call and I ask him, in the spirit of this chamber, that he take the question, which is part of the standing orders of the Federation Chamber.




Dr EMERSON:
  I accept the question, and I am responding to it in the spirit in which it was asked. I find it one of the most extraordinary questions that I would expect to hear from a Deputy Leader of the Opposition; as if inviting leaders of other countries to this country is a bad thing and that somehow it will be exposed that, yes, we have been at it again—inviting leaders of other countries to this country and then paying some of their expenses. I am quite happy to provide the information wherever we can. I look forward to the comments of the coalition as to whether they think is a good idea of a bad idea to invite leaders, one by one, to this country.


I will now move on. In relation to Papua New Guinea, I cannot cover all of the questions that were raised. Obviously, there are going to be elections—I think they start next week and they will continue for some time—and that is a good thing. That is what Senator Carr wanted; he wanted those elections and they going to happen. I see that as an achievement rather than as a basis of criticism. On the live cattle trade, we are constantly in touch with the Indonesian authorities— (Time expired)

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,BILLS,26,2
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Dr EMERSON
 (Rankin—Minister for Trade and Competitiveness) (12:44):  We now have the capacity for me to be able to give a full answer on this, rather than jam it in with numerous questions. The answer is that, in the last couple of days, two new countries have been admitted into the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement negotiations: they are Mexico and Canada. With the addition of Mexico and Canada, there are now 11 parties to the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement negotiations.


The concept here, I say to the member for Banks, is a very worthy one. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum was established by Australia on the initiative of, originally, Bob Hawke at the ministerial level, and then Paul Keating elevated it to the leadership level. It has been a very successful forum for trade liberalisation and economic policy cooperation across the Asia-Pacific. The aspiration is a free-trade area for Asia and the Pacific at some stage. Each of the nine parties to the trans-Pacific partnership negotiations is a member of APEC. So nine of the 21 economies are now involved in negotiation, which obviously is going to be a tough one in some areas, as every country has sensitive issues. If we can land this Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, we then have a very solid stepping stone towards a free-trade area for Asia and the Pacific. The addition of Canada and Mexico means that between them the TPP parties constitute 30 per cent of the world's gross domestic product, which is a big number.


The negotiations are going well in relation to what is called the text—that is, all of the legal work that needs to go in. But there will be very challenging negotiations about increased market access to each other's countries. I might even add, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked if we were requesting duty-free access to markets, that we ask for duty-free access to markets wherever we can possibly achieve it. My view is that, even if that involves phasing down tariffs over time, getting to zero is a very worthy objective. That is set out in the trade ministers' trans-Pacific partnership declaration that was issued in Honolulu last year: we are looking for duty-free access to markets. 


We are pragmatic about phasing down tariffs. Why wouldn't we be? In Australia that is exactly what we did previously. We had very high tariffs in the mid- to late-1980s which were inherited from previous coalition governments. Instead of going cold turkey and taking auto industry tariffs, for example, from 57.5 per cent to zero in one fell swoop, we phased them down. Whenever we have been involved in negotiations, such as in the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement, we have offered duty-free access to the Australian market. In the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement we offered duty-free access to the Australian market. We also have done it with other free trade agreements.


Our tariffs generally are around zero or five per cent. It is something we have done unilaterally over the years. Other countries have reduced their tariffs, and APEC has been a very effective forum, not so much for negotiations but for a sense of kindred spirit—that we know this is a community whose future path to prosperity and to a more decent society for people in poverty, so that they can be liberated from poverty, is to give them jobs through market access. Over the years, what has happened in APEC is that countries have voluntarily reduced their tariffs, not through negotiations but in the knowledge that other countries in the region were doing the same thing. So in regard to the Bogor goals, which were set out in 1994—there was a review recently—it is true that we not quite at zero, but tariffs have come down and, as a result, a lot of people who would not otherwise have jobs, including on the land, now have jobs. It has been a great success story. The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement can take that further by providing this important stepping stone to a free-trade area for Asia and the Pacific.

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (12:49):  Minister, it has been well documented that the government is proposing to save $2.9 billion by deferring by one year the foreign aid target of 0.5 per cent of GNI. Can the minister advise the Committee of the process or criteria that were used to determine which regions or program line items that were previously projected across have been reduced or deferred? The reason I ask this is that it is not an across-the-board deferral of aid spending on countries and regions; some have been deferred but some have actually had an increase in the appropriation above what was projected in last year's budget. In the context of deferring increases in aid spending, why has this year been chosen as the year in which we need to join the Asia Development Bank? 


I want to also refer to scholarships, particularly those scholarships funded by AusAID that are offered to overseas students in developing countries to study. Can the minister advise whether there is a requirement that these students have to study at Australian universities or educational institutions? If not, why not? Is there a requirement for the students to return and work in their country of origin once they have finished their degree or their qualification? The minister may have to take this on notice, but can he provide a breakdown of intended countries of origin by student for these programs in 2012-13 and the degree courses and a breakdown of the Australian universities and institutions that they attend? Can he also explain the process that AusAID uses for determining which countries and students will be selected? What will the level of scholarships provided to the Palestinian authority be in 2012 and 2013?


On general aid, what will be the total amount of foreign aid funding provided to Libya for 2012-13? Minister Carr recently announced on his trip to Burma that there would be an increase in foreign aid spending in Burma. Will there also be an increase in the current staffing levels in the foreign aid area and, if so, what will those levels be?


Moving onto the $5 million donation that AusAID has given to the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Trust, can the minister advise what measures AusAID will take to ensure that all funds are administered to the trust and that they will be spent according to the AusAID charter?


On the ongoing issue of AusAID funding going to organisations with links to terrorists, even though it appears that nothing illegal has occurred, AusAID admitted during evidence that it is undisputed fact that persons on the board of the UWAC, which receives funding through an NGO from AusAID, are formerly convicted terrorists who have served time in jail for terrorism and have links to the PFLP, which is a well-known terror group. There are also other persons with links to terrorism on the UWAC board. Can the minister advise whether it is the Australian government's view that this situation is acceptable? Has the minister had any concerns raised with him by Labor backbenchers on this specific issue, in particular the member for Melbourne Ports? What does the government consider to be a link to a terrorist organisation? Just because it might be legal does not mean that there is not a link.


I want to also ask about an article that appeared in the Australian yesterday. It refers to an independent review obtained under FOI commissioned by AusAID—and I have that report with me now—into the child protection policy that was implemented in 2008. The article alleges that there has been a surge in abuse complaints. There were 11 last year compared to only four in the first year and authorities expect this trend to continue. Minister, can you advise whether this is correct? The article also states that of the 20 complaints made over the last four years, eight were substantiated—all last year—involving staff of a non-government organisation working with AusAID in another country while five were found to be outside the scope of the policy. Minister, can you advise whether all of the eight complaints were about one single NGO and what investigations the department has initiated? The article alleges that the report also questions why the department appears to put concerns of negative publicity ahead of concerns for alleged victims. This is a very serious allegation, Minister. Can you indicate whether you will release the report publicly? Will you commit to implementing all of the recommendations of the review and indicate a time frame? Will the government be providing an official response to the report and, if so, when?

 (Rankin—Minister for Trade and Competitiveness) (12:53):  It is important that I respond to the last set of questions first. Then I will see if I can get to the others within the five minutes that I have. Without wishing to be unduly combative, the suggestion that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade might put concerns about negative publicity ahead of ensuring that it does everything to wipe out child abuse is an appalling suggestion. I am not saying that the member for Brisbane is making that allegation. I have hardworking and decent departmental officials here, as are AusAID people more generally, who would be mortified at such a suggestion. They are not in a position to answer these questions, so I will answer them on their behalf. It is an appalling question. There is no circumstance in which—




Ms Gambaro:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I was just asking the minister to respond to the report. I was not casting any aspersions on the hardworking members of the department, whom I have had great privilege to work with in the past.




Dr EMERSON:
  I understand that, but it is most unfortunate that in the time that is available the member for Brisbane has decided to transmit that allegation into the chamber. There is every discretion on the part of the member for Brisbane to simply not repeat that allegation or that suggestion. You have not done that. I am not suggesting that you are making it, but I would have put a red line through it, if I were you.


In relation to AusAID more generally, of course, this organisation has zero tolerance for child abuse. It is a pervasive problem—there is no doubt about it—and AusAID is tackling it proactively in setting the international benchmarks for accountability and transparency here. Indeed, Australia was the first international donor government and Commonwealth agency to implement a policy to protect children from abuse. The aid program has no higher priority than the protection of children from any form of abuse. The aid program works every day to promote and protect children's rights, in particular, by increasing children's access to education and to health services. 


The 2011 Independent Child Protection Policy Review, commissioned by this government, describes AusAID's commitment to child protection and the work done to date to develop, implement, support and resource the policy as impressive. AusAID agrees with the 23 substantive recommendations, with four already implemented and the remainder are underway. AusAID's partners are responding and appropriately managing child protection notifications better than ever before. Since the policy was introduced, all complaints made related to personnel of organisations funded by AusAID, not AusAID staff. The increase in notifications is evidence that the policy is working. It required mandatory reporting. Mandatory child protection standards have created safer organisations and awareness of the policy has increased through training NGOs, contractors and AusAID staff. 


There is strong evidence that supports the fact that, when mandatory compliance is introduced and awareness increases, there will be an increase in notifications. 


Going directly to the question, AusAID has received a total of 20 child protection notifications in the three years between March 2008 and December 2011. Of the total reports, eight were substantiated or resulted in dismissal, seven were unsubstantiated and five were outside the scope of the policy—that is, they were not related to Australian aid programs—and each of these cases were referred to the relevant authorities. Since the policy commenced, AusAID has not received any child protection notifications against any of its staff. I will seek to get back to the member for Brisbane on other questions where, again, we reasonably can within the resources of the department in relation to the decisions made on overseas development, assistance and the various scholarships. I am quite sure that AusAID and this government do not go around funding terrorist organisations legally or illegally. That is not the sort of thing that we see as a priority. I think that both sides of the parliament have a policy of doing everything they can to combat terrorism.

Has the department undertaken any market research on, or surveys of, the Australia Network as to its coverage?

Dr EMERSON
 (Rankin—Minister for Trade and Competitiveness) (13:00):  I cannot reasonably give a commitment that, by the end of this parliamentary session, answers to all questions will be provided. There are constraints here on the available resources of the department. I have said in good faith that we would seek to provide answers where it is reasonable. Where there are questions that involve matters of cabinet-in-confidence or that cannot be answered for reasons of national security and such, answers will not be provided—and that would be the response that I would get if the coalition were in government.


In relation to the Australia Network, again, I will seek to provide some information on that. I would be surprised if the Australia Network were spending a lot of money working out how many people watch the network, but if they happen to have that information I will provide it to you.


There are some other unanswered questions that I would like to deal with. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in the previous bracket of questions, asked about trade negotiations with Japan, Indonesia and so on. What is happening in Indonesia—and I think it is quite a good idea—is that they are, to use their term, 'socialising the idea'. So we have the business communities of both Indonesia and Australia working collaboratively, identifying the opportunities through the negotiations and going to other stakeholders, including members of parliament in Indonesia of all political persuasions, to argue directly to them that this is a good idea. Rather than us negotiating an agreement and then unveiling it to the business community, we actually have the business communities of both countries being champions of the agreement. I think that is a model that is worth considering for the development of trade agreements between countries.


In relation to Japan, the most recent document that our trade relations are based on is the 1957 Australia-Japan Agreement on Commerce—and I give credit to the coalition at that time; Menzies and McEwen negotiated that agreement. But it is now a little dated! I think we can do better than that. The Japanese have shown renewed interest in a free trade agreement with Australia and, obviously, we have been pushing that for a long time. They have a lot on their plate, including the reopening of nuclear power stations and trying to get an increase in the consumption tax through the parliament. However, during my recent visit—and I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, with whom I was paired—the Japanese themselves, voluntarily, before I could even begin to speak about the desirability of completing negotiations for a free trade deal, said that to me. So that is a good development. They see that there is real merit in their engaging more in the region, looking outward. Again, Australia is a top priority for Japan, as it is for China.


So we continue to work hard and to invest in these agreements. The earlier part of the visit to seven countries over 19 days that I just completed included the actual signing of our free trade agreement with Malaysia. We got very strong support from industry generally and—of interest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott—from rural industries in particular. 


We are in the business of opening up markets. The 'Asian century' can provide enormous opportunities not only to our traditional minerals and energy exports; I think we can also make agriculture a new economy. With an expansion in the number of people on earth from seven billion to nine billion by 2030 and the rising middle classes of Asia, I think our beef producers, our dairy producers and our horticultural producers have great prospects. 


I can also confirm that, just yesterday, it was announced that Australian horticultural produce will continue to flow through Tanjung Priok, which is the main port in Jakarta. There was an announcement of a suspension and a termination that would come into effect on 19 June; that does not apply to Australia because we negotiated hard and well with the Indonesian government. We have a country recognition agreement in place and as a result Australia will be exempt from that suspension, which is good news for our horticultural producers. It is an example of the good personal relationships between ministers and a good, warm relationship between Indonesia and Australia.

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:00):  Before making remarks specifically on this appropriation bill, I think it is worth reflecting in general on a budget that returns to surplus at a time when global markets are in a doubtful condition and a time when caution and prudence in our budget management are important parts and hallmarks of the Australian way of managing budgets. But it is also important that we look at our budget in detail and see that spending as a share of GDP falls to 23.5 per cent in 2012-13 and remains below 24 per cent over the forward estimates. It is the longest sustained period below 24 per cent since the 1980s. The tax to GDP ratio in 2012-13 is 22.1 per cent and forecast to remain below 23 per cent across the forward estimates—again, sustainably low and substantially below the rates of the former government.


You cannot achieve this without a fantastic finance department. I thank the Department of Finance and Deregulation and in particular Secretary David Tune for the outstanding work that they have done in helping to support ministers and to frame this budget.


In 2012-13, the Finance and Deregulation portfolio will receive appropriations of $655.9 million from Appropriation Bill (No. 1) for the ordinary annual services of the government. This will include departmental capital budget funding of $18.9 million, $7.6 million in departmental supplementation and administered capital funding of $3.2 million. A number of new measures were announced in the 2012-13 budget for the finance portfolio. Further information on these is, of course, contained in Budget Paper No. 2. The government will provide $4 million over two years for finance to develop a second-pass business case for the remediation of sections 32, 34 and 41 of the Cox Peninsula in the Northern Territory and, in so doing, assist the Northern Territory in the resolution of a long-outstanding land claim and provide a fantastic business opportunity for the Larrakia people in developing that land outside of Darwin.


The government will also provide $6.9 million over four years to support the government's deregulation agenda, including oversight of the Seamless National Economy reforms and establishing and supporting COAG cross-jurisdictional task forces. Importantly, the government is delivering again on cross-jurisdictional issues, making life simpler, making cross-jurisdictional accreditations simpler and, of course, dealing with complex matters such as occupational health and safety.


The government will provide savings from a reduction to the fire services levy payments made to state and territory governments. Savings from this measure will be directed to support substantial other government priorities. The government will also find an additional $8 million over two years to undertake work related to the transfer of parts of the Malabar Headland to the government of New South Wales for the creation of a permanent national park in Malabar Head for the benefit of the people of Sydney, New South Wales and Australia. The government will provide $7.4 million in 2011-12 to meet legal and other costs associated with the Commonwealth's legislation against the stamp duty assessment issued by the New South Wales Office of State Revenue on the sale of the Commonwealth share of Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd.


The Commonwealth will provide $26.4 over five years to allow the Moorebank Project Office to progress the development of the Moorebank site as an intermodal terminal. This is a particularly substantial measure, as it will provide a logistics hub at Moorebank for container traffic flow from Port Botany through Sydney, creating an interstate connection but also better managing traffic and container flows through the greater Sydney area, benefiting the East Coast in general, Sydney specifically and delivering substantial productivity benefits for Australia.


The government will provide $559.4 million over four years to the Department of Finance and Deregulation for the relocation of the Department of Defence facilities at the Moorebank site to a modern and purpose-built facility through the development of the Holsworthy Barracks site. That is important to creating the land opportunity at Moorebank in order to create the terminal for the intermodal capacity at Moorebank. The government will also provide $339 million over seven years to construct a new Commonwealth operated post-entry quarantine facility.


The government will also provide nearly $1 million over four years to establish a whole-of-Australian government information management system for parliamentary workflow. I know the shadow minister appreciates the complexity that comes from differential systems operating across different ministers' offices and portfolios. This workflow program is designed to improve that. (Time expired)

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (16:06):  I think both sides of the House agree that productivity improvements are critical in realising opportunities in the years ahead and in weatherproofing the Australian economy as best we can against overseas events over which we have no control. Within this budget there are many measures which go to the issue of productivity. One that the minister himself referred to in his opening comments is the intermodal terminal at Moorebank in western Sydney. Given the importance of living within our means and ensuring the productivity opportunities are realised from this intermodal terminal—and the opposition supports this initiative—I would like to refer the minister to the Department of Finance and Deregulation capital measures outlined in Budget Paper No. 2 on pages 301 and 302. 


I have a number of questions and I would be very grateful if the minister could shed some light on these issues. Firstly, what is the rationale for establishing a GBE to develop the Moorebank site, considering that there is a strong private sector willingness, through Qube Logistics which has undoubted capability in this area, to deliver the same outcome on adjacent privately owned land? The land is currently owned by the Sydney Intermodal Terminal Alliance and developing that site would be at no cost to taxpayers. The land has open access, a port shuttle and an interstate rail terminal, as is planned by the government. As I understand it, the process will cost the Commonwealth nearly $1 billion, as spelt out in the budget papers: $559.4 million outlined on pages 302 as well as $332 million from the defence department.


Secondly, Minister, how pressing is the need for the relocation of the defence engineering facilities at Moorebank to Holsworthy? Thirdly, can you confirm that the interstate rail component may not be required until 2029? Would it be possible to spend a more modest sum of money on upgrading the defence facilities, which we do accept are in poor shape? Finally, considering the Commonwealth's very tight fiscal position, can you advise whether this proposal has been subjected to a cost-benefit study? Has comparative analysis been conducted between the government proposal and the private sector options, especially considering the very strong support from many quarters for the private sector proposal—the New South Wales government, the Business Council of Australia and many other groups, and financial reporters including editorials in the Australian FinancialReview?


Has it been assessed by Infrastructure Australia as a key priority? Is it true that the private sector proposal could be up and running three years sooner than the government proposal?

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:10):  I thank the shadow minister for his question and his focus on this critical issue. This is not simply a matter of an alternative use for a Commonwealth site; this is a matter of the construction of a significant piece of east coast infrastructure whose impact will be felt throughout the greater Sydney area and New South Wales as well as in freight movements into, around and out of our country.


The government formed the view that its broader national policy objectives can be best achieved through the development of an intermodal terminal on the site at Moorebank. It did that through a long consideration. It did seek the advice, the support and the constructive contribution of Infrastructure Australia, and there was a detailed business case which has been reviewed by Greenhill Caliburn. They advised the government that there was a significant uncertainty about the capacity of SIMTA to deliver the first stage of its intermodal terminal in 2014 as published as well as about its capacity to deliver the full intermodal terminal within its published time limits.


I think that all sides of our parliament, and certainly the government of New South Wales, share the concern that we all have to make freight movements in Sydney and New South Wales as efficient as possible. I think it is reasonable to say that everyone has a focus on the specific time lines that are established in the government's proposal. But in coming to the conclusion to spend the very large amounts of money that have been alluded to and enumerated by the shadow minister—the $559 million for the relocation of the defence units to Holsworthy, $332 million for major capital facilities, an additional $2 million for lease and land management and then $26 million to the project development office—we know that we are committing very substantial amounts of money to deliver what the analysis shows to be a very substantial productivity dividend to the people of Australia.


That productivity dividend manifests itself both in more efficient transport movements and more efficient transit movements of containers through the Moorebank facility. Importantly,, the judgement on the private sector involvement is that it will be optimised through the financing development operation of the project through an open tender process run by a commercially-operated government business enterprise. This is a matter that was announced, from recollection, on 23 April—just before Anzac Day. It was announced in the context of the substantial infrastructure investment which the Commonwealth believes needs to be made in a full holistic consideration of the use of the site at Moorebank and then the consequent movement of defence assets and facilities out to Holsworthy. I am very happy to take on notice those questions from the shadow minister that I may not have dealt with in sufficient detail and to come back to him in detail with specific answers. But, in general, the reason we concluded as we did is that we believe that it is the most efficient use of Commonwealth funds to create the most efficient terminal to produce the best possible dividends for the people of New South Wales, Sydney and Australia.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (16:13):  My electorate office is located alongside the Australian Electoral Commission office for the division of Makin, and has been for as long as I can recall. I say from the outset that my office certainly over the years that I have been the member for Makin, has had considerable interaction with that office. In saying that I place on record my gratitude to the staff of that office, who have, I believe, done an exceptional job in looking after the needs, inquiries and interests of the people in the general area. My experience with that office, in fact, goes back to before I was the member for Makin, when I was the mayor of the City of Salisbury. Even in that period in public life, the office oversaw some of the local government elections and, again, I had some interaction with the office. I can say that the service from the staff over all of that time was exemplary.


Almost on a daily basis we go into that office for one reason or another. The office is also particularly well used by elderly people who might be leaving the area for several months at a time and make inquiries about the processes they need to put in place in respect of their absence should an election be called. Those are legitimate queries which we all confront on a regular basis. Most importantly, the office is used during election periods when I can say without a doubt it is inundated with inquiries from people seeking information about how they should enrol in order to vote or how they should vote if they happen to be out of the electorate at the time of the election. I know they are inundated because many of the inquiries initially come through my office and we redirect them next door.


I understand the office will be closing in the near future. Can you advise what arrangements are being put in place to assist people who have relied on the services of the office, being located in the north-eastern suburbs for so long, and in particular what arrangements are being put in place to help people during those critical times when an election is being held?

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:16):  I thank the member for Makin for his question. The Australian Electoral Commission has nearly for 20 years worked on a program of amalgamating regional AEC offices where it sees fit and it is appropriate, in order to create more efficient work environments and to carry out its work, most importantly, as effectively as it can to enrol people and to maintain the roll. With that in mind, in particular in South Australia and with the coincidental timing of leases in the number of AEC offices in individual electorates, the commissioner saw an opportunity to amalgamate the offices in South Australia to create one substantial superoffice in the CBD, one office in the northern regional part of South Australia at Port Augusta and one in the south-eastern regional part of South Australia at Mt Gambier. The purpose of doing this was to create a more efficient and effective AEC, getting people on the roll and managing the roll. It is certainly a requirement that, come an election, the AEC will have a physical presence in every federal division. That physical presence will allow for ballot draws, for nominations and for voting support advice and activity within the division. 


I know the member will realise that in a seat like Makin internal transport routes and the capacity to get to a physical location are much easier than, say, in the electorate of Gray, which includes areas as remote as Port Augusta, Port Lincoln and Ceduna. An office in Port Augusta would struggle to support people in Ceduna. 


As a consequence of these sorts of practicalities, the commissioner has seen fit to continue a process of electoral office rationalisation in order to create a more efficient and effective Electoral Commission. I stress the commission is independent and comes to these decisions based on his view of what an efficient structure can best look like for all states and all jurisdictions. The new office in South Australia, I can inform the member for Makin, is due to be opened in coming weeks. And I can inform the member for Makin that it is absolutely the intention of the government, and the stated intention of the Electoral Commission, to carry out these amalgamations in a way that produces the best jobs and the best work environment to create the most productive Electoral Commission to do the fundamental work which that commission needs to do.


It is necessarily the case that your constituents, if they wish to talk face to face with an official of the Australian Electoral Commission, will need to travel into the CBD to do that. I believe the new office is in King William Street. I believe that that is an accessible location. The commission themselves have worked particularly hard in recent years to make themselves accessible both through telephonic communication and, importantly, through the internet for enrolment purposes and for enrolment advice updates. So I am confident both that the servicing of the needs of your constituents and those of South Australia and all other states where these amalgamations are taking place will be improved and that the jobs and retention of skilled staff at the AEC will be improved as we build an AEC that can better cope with the challenges that a changing society will throw at them in future years.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (16:21):  My questions are to the Special Minister of State. I want to ask a few questions concerning the appropriations for the Australian Electoral Commission. I note that the additional sum of $58 million over four years has the stated purpose of maintaining operating capacity and supporting electoral participation. The first question I ask is: would you confirm that the words 'supporting electoral participation' mean that the extra funding is to support the Labor-Greens policy of automatic enrolment? I say it is their policy because we have opposed it very strenuously as corrupting the integrity of the roll. Could you also tell me how many electors the AEC expect to enrol under this program of automatic enrolment and how long the process is likely to take? Is it true that the AEC has begun in the marginal seat of Petrie, currently held by the Labor Party? What is the estimated total cost of enrolling people from these extraneous rolls?


Does the AEC have a preference for which data sources it uses outside the ones that have been stated already, those mainly being the equivalent of the RTA, school leaver rolls and one other? It is a completely unfettered power that the AEC has—it can choose anything it likes? What safeguards—this is very important—if any, has the government put in place, or the AEC put in place for that matter, to ensure that people are not added to the roll who are not entitled to be there? The reason I ask that question so specifically is that in New South Wales the result of automatic enrolment was that, whereas the normal turnout rate for properly enrolled electors is 92 per cent, from the people added from the automatic enrolment it was only 64 per cent. Also, we had advice in evidence at JSCEM that, of those who were added to the New South Wales roll, the AEC's success rate in getting them to transfer to the federal roll under the old law—not automatic enrolment—was only 20 per cent. That tends to make me think that there were people there who ought not to be there.


Also, having made those comments, I also ask whether or not the AEC has estimated what the error rate will be, what mechanism they have used to measure what they think that error rate will be and whether or not they can at any time hope that they could give a guarantee that 100 per cent of people added to the roll are actually entitled to be there—that the system they put in place would guarantee 100 per cent?

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:24):  I thank the shadow minister for her many questions—and, if there are any questions that I do not deal with here, I will deal with them in detail in writing and get back to you.


The first point is that the bills are currently before the Senate and I would expect their passage to occur some time in the current session. The second point to make is that the bills form part of the advice given to the government through the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, advice which accepts the ABS statistics that there are 15.7 million eligible voters, or Australians eligible to be enrolled, in our country but only 14.2 million are on the electoral roll.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  That was the government majority report. The dissenting report does not accept that.




Mr GRAY:
  I understand that. I understand that the JSCEM report on the 2007 election also contained a number of recommendations to which there were a number of objections. I am not aware of any objection by the coalition at that time to these electoral roll measures.


Importantly, the shadow minister made the suggestion that perhaps the additional funding to the AEC is in order to support this particular policy. The short answer is: no, it is not. The long version is that these particular measures are designed to harmonise the Commonwealth roll with the rolls of the most populous states. The most populous states now have enrolment technologies being actively deployed which, if we do not match them at the Commonwealth level, will create a serious mismatch between our Commonwealth roll and our state rolls. These measures will bring onto the Commonwealth roll about 100,000 electors in New South Wales but only about 10,000 in Victoria because of a differential system operating there which has also been operating over a different time line.


The sources to which we would expect the AEC to turn—bearing in mind, of course, that the AEC is independent and will independently determine the appropriate lists to go to—are the Australian Taxation Office and, yes, RTAs, and some school-leaver rolls have been considered. But, importantly, it will look to rolls that have integrity and that are approved by state electoral commissions. So we are not simply going out to any old list of people. In order to add to the integrity of the roll, the commission is creating a system to track and to support voter enrolments that is consistent with those used in the largest jurisdictions.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  But the legislation does not say that, Minister.




Mr GRAY:
  The Electoral Commissioner has made clear his intention to pursue this enrolment methodology in a way that is consistent with best possible practice and the highest integrity of the roll. We all agree with that. We all agree that, at those times when our country is required to elect a parliament that is representative of the people, we need an electoral roll that is as accurate as possible. We have to concede, in a modern world, that increasing numbers of Australians are not enrolling, and as a parliament we believe we need to respond to that challenge. We need to make our roll as complete as possible so that we have a situation where, as much as possible, a person from Sydney who believes that they are enrolled and entitled to vote in New South Wales ought to be able to reasonably assume that they are eligible to vote in a federal election—and likewise for people in Victoria, Queensland, the Northern Territory, Tasmania, South Australia and my home state of Western Australia. Where that is not the case, we ought to be putting in place the best possible systems to harmonise our rolls.


You had substantial additional questions, Shadow Minister, which I know I have not responded to in my commentary here. I will get back to you in writing on the specific details of those questions you asked.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:29):  My question also relates to the Australian Electoral Commission. I note the comment you made, Minister Gray, that there are about 1.5 million Australians who are not enrolled to vote. With 150 members in the House of Representatives, we are talking about 10,000 people per electorate, on average, who are not eligible to vote. All of us would have experienced checking the enrolment of people who contact us. Often the people who contact us, particularly if they are transient or if they have to come into a job or who recently have not bothered to vote, are not registered.


My electorate is named after Harold Blair, who was an Aboriginal activist and tenor. He is a very famous person. He grew up in the Purga Mission south of Ipswich. There are a number of important Indigenous institutions in Ipswich. There is an Indigenous school called Hymba Yumba in Springfield. Just before the census, I urged the people there to make sure that their mums, dads and carers fill out census forms. The biggest high school in Ipswich, Bremer State High School, has about 1,500 students. About 30 per cent of those are Indigenous or Polynesian, with most of that 30 per cent being Indigenous. One of the busiest medical centres in Ipswich is Kambu Medical Centre. It has tens of thousands of patients. It is an Indigenous centre.


There are about 86,500 people on the electoral roll in Blair. We are celebrating this year 50 years since Indigenous people achieved the right to vote in federal elections. I understand that it was not compulsory to enrol but once you were enrolled it was compulsory to vote. In 1967, the Constitution was changed to give power to count Indigenous people in the census and for the Commonwealth to be given the power to make special laws for their benefit.


My question relates to the Electoral Commission. I have stood at polling booths in Ipswich for about 30 years handing out Labor Party pamphlets—the opposition side would call them propaganda but I would call them pamphlets—encouraging people to vote for the Australian Labor Party candidate. I recently stood all day at Raceview State School—the biggest state primary school in my electorate in Ipswich—and one of the things that struck me about this suburb, which is fairly typical of Ipswich, was how few Indigenous people came to the polling booth to cast a vote. What steps are the AEC taking to encourage Indigenous people to vote? What are the budgetary implications? Does the AEC require any additional funding to get all Australians, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to participate in the political process?

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:32):  I think the member for Blair for his question. He has a great commitment to ensuring that the rights of Indigenous Australians are translated effectively into electoral action. Indigenous Australians are significantly less likely to enrol to vote than any other Australians. They are less likely to vote and they are more likely to vote informally than non-Indigenous Australians. The AEC has long-established programs to try to deal with this challenge. In 2009-10, to close the gap in Indigenous disadvantage in electoral participation the commission was allocated an additional $13.2 million to establish its Indigenous electoral participation program. There are 25 field officers across the country, with 18 of them being Indigenous Australians. I have one operating out of Mandurah. They particularly operate around schools to ensure that Indigenous people become enrolled. But it is not as easy as that.


Some of the measures that the shadow minister has interrogated me upon in a previous question are measures that become troublesome in terms of encouraging and maintaining Indigenous voters. Among the lists that will be considered are road transport department lists—lists of people with drivers' licences. Indigenous people are less likely to have a driver's licence and so are less likely to be accurately identified through that mechanism. Then there is the ATO system. To be in the ATO system, it is likely that you will need to be in a period of full-time employment. As such, some of the lists that we will try to use to maintain enrolments will not work effectively in Indigenous communities. The AEC needs to continually apply itself to the task of ensuring that Indigenous electoral participation is what we as a parliament and we as a country aspire to.


There was a fantastic effort when the AEC sponsored its National Indigenous Youth Parliament to be in Canberra over the weekend of the last sitting. Members from all sides of the parliament attended a fantastic lunch and a series of events attached to the youth parliament. It was an event put on by the AEC designed to encourage real time, real life, active participation in our political process in order to get a willing and supporting cadre of Indigenous people who understand the importance of getting members of their community on the roll and getting them out to vote.


We see through our IEPP processes the continuing growth of enrolments of Indigenous citizens—but it is not happening quickly enough. We are seeing the strengthening of the integrity of the roll particularly in remote communities, but we can do a lot more. We are seeing an increase in the number of Indigenous people working as polling officials on mobile and static polling facilities in Indigenous communities, but we can always do better. We are seeing an increased number in requests for fee-for-service elections by Indigenous organisations. That is building a strong culture of familiarity with our electoral processes—processes of getting on the roll and getting out to vote.


Can we do more? Yes, we can. Should we do more? Yes, we should. Is it expensive? Yes, it is. I will get back to the member for Blair with a specific set of answers from the electoral commission to those issues that he has raised which I have not addressed in my answer.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (16:36):  I have a series of further questions if the minister would please respond. The government took a step yesterday on one of the measures—that is, the departure tax, which is now known as the people movement charge for some reason—in the budget. The government chose to remove the proposed indexation of the people movement charge at a cost to the budget over four years of an estimated $157 million. In addition to that, this morning we saw the government withdraw a major bill which had proposed to increase the tax on proceeds of investments in managed investment funds from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. This measure was estimated in the budget papers to deliver savings of around $256 million.


I ask the minister: how does the government intend to meet its budget commitment to a budget surplus of $1.5 billion by 30 June 2013 given that these two measures alone over the last 24 hours come at a total cost of $413 million? Or has the government, alternatively, decided to revise downwards its budget surplus forecast to $1 billion and $77 million?


The second area of questioning concerns the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Currently the government plans to allocate $2 billion per year over five years commencing in the 2013-14 financial year. Minister, can you guarantee that under no circumstances this funding profile will change? For example, will we possibly find that as an election approaches these borrowed funds are not brought forward to enable costly contracts to be locked in prior to the next election? Can you explain why there is a funding program almost identical in purpose to the CEFC which is both outlined as a budget measure and factored into the budget bottom line where, as you know, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is off-budget and the expenditure associated with it does not go to the bottom line?


That existing program, the Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund, is in the 2011-12 budget, page 304, budget paper No. 2. In explaining it, the paper says:


The Government will provide $108.7 million over 14 years to support the development and commercialisation of renewable energy technologies by making early-stage equity investments that leverage private funds. 


Minister, this would seem to us to provide a clear precedent and I ask you: does it not provide a clear precedent as to why the CEFC and its $10 billion in funding should be treated on budget. I cannot distinguish any feature between the Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation which separates the purpose, in many ways the execution, and one is treated on budget and the other one is treated off budget. Finally can you provide any information about planned staffing arrangements for the CEFC, and can you confirm that key senior appointments will not be made by multiple-year contract, whether they be two, three or four? Finally, can the minister may please explain a matter in today's Financial Review report of the RBA minutes. One of the key claims of the government has been that its budget management, including its commitment to bring back the budget to surplus, has somehow been a factor in interest rate reductions, yet we have seen in the paper today the minutes of the RBA. I ask the Minister how can they be reconciled with what the RBA have said at their recent board meeting? (Time expired)

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:42):  I thank the shadow minister for his question. He has asked me questions about the departure tax and about the management of investment funds. I will seek advice from my department and get back to the shadow minister with answers. He has asked me about the staffing of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Again, I will come back to him specifically on those measures. He has asked me about minutes of the last RBA meeting and the references made to budget surpluses and the necessary interaction between budget surpluses and interest rate levels. It is undeniably the case that prudent budget management, as we see from the Commonwealth government, will deliver a budget surplus not in the current financial year, for which this budget is constructed, but in out years as well. There is no doubt that, in taking pressure off financial markets by delivering a budget surplus, the government is more than doing its part in helping deliver an environment conducive to low interest rates, conducive to supporting families who are under their own domestic budget pressures, but also, importantly, continuing to deliver a budget and a fiscal environment envied by the world, supported by good public policy. 


I say this about the conversations around the departure tax and the managed investment funds measures. The Commonwealth put in place a budget which had been carefully thought through, supported by expert advice and consideration from the Department of Finance and Deregulation. One of the fundamental things that an opposition can do at a time of global financial market uncertainty is to support the Commonwealth budget and to support the government in its measures, both on the revenue side and on the expenditure side. But we are realists; we operate in the real world. I will come back to the shadow minister with specific answers to the questions he has asked  which I have not answered specifically here now.

Mr MELHAM
 (Banks) (16:44):  My questions to the minister involve the earlier question I asked him in the parliament today in question time—how amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which are currently before the Senate, would improve participation by Australians in our electoral system. I note the member for Warringah earlier labelled them as Labor-Green amendments, as if there was a conspiracy by the Labor and the Greens in relation to the legislation. In his earlier answer, he indicated that part of the mindset of the Commonwealth was to have uniform systems and that these systems currently operate in New South Wales and Victoria. Can the minister confirm that the Liberal administrations of New South Wales and Victoria have not moved towards repealing automatic enrolment legislation that currently exists in their states, that they have accepted it? Indeed, that is the basis upon which the Commonwealth is proceeding, that in effect they are going to be long-term provisions in those states? The nub of it is that Liberal administrations in those two states are not seeking to wind back automatic enrolment that currently exists. 


In relation to the Electoral Commission's financial position, I understand there has been an additional $58 million over four years to maintain the commission's operating capacity in support of electoral participation. In terms of departmental resourcing over forward estimates, it goes from $125.1 million in 2012-13 to $239.6 million in 2013-14, which I assume is as a result of an anticipated electoral event occurring in that year. Can the minister outline to the House strategies that he is aware of that the commission is undertaking in relation to improving electoral participation as a result of funding that has been provided? Are there any figures that he can enlighten the parliament on and are there any targets that have been set or any benchmarking?


Finally, Senator Carol Brown and I met with representatives from Blind Citizens Australia and Vision Australia yesterday. That was a very fruitful meeting. As I understand it, there has been collaboration with those groups and the Australian Electoral Commission to build on improvements to the electoral system that would assist those groups. I understand that there are some differences of opinion. I am interested as to the cost, because in their submission to me they say that the iVote system that was used in the last New South Wales election is one that they were very happy with. They are not particularly happy with going back to a human call centre operation. I wonder what the funding implications would be, if the minister has figures, in relation to that, if the Commonwealth were to adopt an iVote system, which would pick up blind and visually impaired but I assume could be extended to other people.

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:48):  I thank the member for Banks for his question. I will answer the last part first which is in the context of the blind voting and initiatives that were in place for the last federal election and are being considered for the future. It is the case that the Electoral Commissioner is substantially of the view that the Commonwealth systems can be improved and that support for people with disabilities can be extended. One of the great values of the extension of that voting facility for blind or visually impaired voters is that it can also be used to assist mobility impaired voters. That agenda of encouraging and supporting people with disabilities to exercise their rights in our electoral process is alive and is being considered. 


In the context of the particular New South Wales iVote initiative, I will need to get advice from the commissioner. I am aware of the iVote system. I think Linda Hornsey from the particular association involved is in the building this week. I look forward to catching up with her, I think tomorrow, to discuss this matter further. But I look forward to getting back to the member on the detail of the commissioner's view of iVote and the extension of those measures which are designed to improve voter participation amongst people with disabilities. The additional funding for the Electoral Commission is, of course, funding that presumes an electoral event in 2013. It presumes an electoral event at some point in the third quarter of 2013, but the funding is not created explicitly in the expectation that that is the only time at which an electoral event can take place. So prudent measures have been put in place by the commission to ensure that it can support the needs of our parliamentary democracy should that be required at any time.


The Commonwealth Electoral Act amendments that are currently before the Senate effectively work to harmonise elector data management systems in the Commonwealth roll with those of our two most popular states. I cannot understate the importance of harmonising the Commonwealth roll with the state jurisdictions. The member for Banks specifically asked the view of the New South Wales government on these measures. The New South Wales government and the New South Wales Electoral Commission are significantly in advance of the rest of the country on these measures. That commission has, we believe, in the order of 100,000 New South Wales electors alone that it can bring into the Commonwealth roll as a consequence of these measures. To simply try to extrapolate that across the rest of the country with the successful operation of these techniques might mean that we could be looking at repairing the enrolments of up to half a million people. What a fantastic thing that would be. But, importantly, I am not aware of any moves by either the New South Wales government, the New South Wales commission, the New South Wales parliament or the Victorian commission, government or parliament to wind back those measures which are directed towards electoral roll maintenance.


In our Commonwealth system we, of course, do not refer to it as 'automatic enrolment'. This is an automated system of maintaining enrolment. We maintain the integrity of the system by requiring that new enrollees properly complete documentation, properly sign documentation and properly lodge that documentation. The methodologies that we seek to introduce through these amendments are methodologies to better track individuals as they become mobile through the course of their life cycle and allow them to exercise their right and their obligation to vote wherever they are domiciled, where we can confirm through high-integrity sources and data matches that that is the person who has been identified as owning the enrolment.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (16:52):  I want to revert for a moment to the answers that the minister gave me previously relating to automatic enrolment. I confirm the opposition's opposition as it was expressed in the dissenting report. It was a very political report. It was a bit down party lines, with Labor and Greens on one side and opposition members on the other. I just wanted to mention specifically the minister's reference to the AEC using ATO information.


I think it is relevant to go back and look at various reports. For instance, a 1999 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration found that tax file numbers that had been issued were 3.2 million more than there were people in Australia. I do not think those records are very good for utilising to put people on the roll. It found that there were 185,000 potential duplicate tax records of individuals and it found that 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in a sample match.


A further report on the integrity of Medicare enrolment data found that up to half a million active Medicare enrolment records were probably for people who were deceased. In other words, rolls that are created for another purpose are not a valid or safe source of information for the electoral roll. The fact that it is so vital that the integrity of the roll is maintained is highlighted by the judgment in the case of Perkins v Cusack, where the judge refused to go behind the roll, saying that the roll is a total acceptance that those people who are on the roll are entitled to vote. Quite clearly, by utilising lists from sources other than people who are honouring their obligation under the Electoral Act, it is the obligation of every citizen, once they turn 18 or become a citizen, to enrol to vote. That is compulsory, it is strict liability and there is a fine, yet the Electoral Commission have not imposed or attempted to have imposed one fine—not one. They do not pursue people for multiple voting. They send out letters to people saying, 'It appears there was multiple voting in your name. Did you do it?' The people say, 'No,' and that is the end of it. In other words, there is not too much scrutiny going on with the Electoral Commission, so I am doubly concerned about the carte blanche that the commission has been given to choose any list it likes. I know you said in your answer that there is an undertaking that they will stick only to these three, but there is nothing in the law, anywhere, to prevent any list being chosen at any time. I know you said that you are trying to harmonise the biggest states, Victoria and New South Wales. The information to me is that the commission has started in the electorate of Petrie. I would like you to answer that question.


Also, harmonising state rolls with the federal roll is a major target that has been formed. I do not think it should be; I think the integrity of the roll must always take precedence. Secondly, it is not a very sensible argument because there is no harmonisation between the states and the Commonwealth as to the method of voting. The reason we get such a high percentage of informal votes is that in Queensland and New South Wales we have first-past-the-post voting or, rather, optional preferential voting, which is the closest thing we have to that, whereas in other states it is full preferential voting. That does not follow either.


The last point I would like you to respond to is on the legislation which allows the Auditor-General to automatically audit private contractors with the Commonwealth and yet will protect the NBN from the Auditor-General's automatic right to audit government business enterprises. I ask: was it simply done because the original legislation was to give the Auditor-General that power? It was taken away at the last moment. Mr Oakeshott, the person who introduced it, said he was given no good reason but, as is his wont, he simply agreed with the government at the time. Was it done deliberately to protect the NBN or is there some other reason?

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (16:57):  I can assure the shadow minister that those questions which I do not answer in my remarks to follow will be answered directly to her in a documentary form. Specifically, you asked about the use of the electoral roll update mechanisms in Petrie. I am not aware of that. The bills are yet to go through the Senate and may not pass through the Senate, so I cannot see how the Electoral Commission would have done that, but I am certainly prepared to seek that advice because, as I say, I expect that debate to be brought on this evening and dealt with in the course of the next few days of Senate sitting time.


Specifically, you asked about the integrity of lists and referred to the tax file numbers. The issue which the Electoral Commissioner grapples with is the identified fact that there are, we believe, 1.5 million or thereabouts Australians not on the roll who should be on the roll. We would have a simple difference of opinion, I believe. My view and, I hope, the parliament's view is an inclusive view that means we should use all of those methods available to us as a parliament to support people getting onto the roll. I accept the view which the coalition has that those people who are on the roll should be those who enrol specifically by electorate and at the time when they reach the qualifying points. It is a simple difference of opinion. But the philosophical difference which the government has is a difference which is fundamentally about inclusion and fundamentally about ensuring that our roll best represents those Australians who are eligible to vote. That difference of opinion will play itself out in the parliament in the course of the next few days and weeks.


We are, of course, hoping for a system that will deliver as best it can a harmonised enrolment system across our two most populous states, and encourage the smaller states to opt into that better, more developed system. We hope that will place our Electoral Commission on a track to deal with the 1.5 million, although I accept that that task is more complex than the measures that we put in place—if we do get them in place through the parliament in the course of the next few days.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (17:01):  The government is returning the budget to surplus in 2012-13, and we will build growing surpluses over the forward estimates while also spreading the benefits of the mining boom to help families on lower and middle incomes and small business.


A return to surplus, which will be achieved ahead of any major advanced economy, will sustain confidence in the strength of Australia's public finances by demonstrating the government's commitment to fiscal discipline and by providing a buffer at a time when the global economy remains fragile. A return to surplus is appropriate, given domestic economic conditions, and will provide ongoing scope for monetary policy to respond to economic developments. The economy is forecast to grow around trend over the next two years, with low unemployment, contained inflation and record levels of mining investment.


The Australian economy continues to be affected by the fragile and changing nature of the global economy. However, Australia's success in supporting the economy and jobs during the global financial crisis means that the economy faces these transitions from a position of strength. Strong growth in the resources sector will directly and indirectly support growth in other parts of the economy. However, conditions in some parts of the economy are likely to remain challenging, with unsettled global conditions, a high Australian dollar, ongoing consumer caution and changes in expenditure patterns all expected to weigh heavily on some sectors. While these forces are placing considerable pressures on some businesses, many are successfully adapting to the changing economic landscape and identifying and exploiting opportunities to grow and to prosper.


I now turn to some of the key initiatives of the 2012-13 budget. This budget spreads the benefits of the mining boom to help families on low and middle incomes with the cost of living, and provides much-needed help to small business while still returning the budget to surplus, as is appropriate given domestic and global economic conditions. Support to families on low and middle incomes is being provided through measures including increases to family payments, more timely and accessible education payments and a new supplementary allowance for eligible income support recipients.


Key initiatives announced in this year's budget include returning the budget to surplus on time and as promised; spreading the benefits of the mining boom; the first steps towards a National Disability Insurance Scheme; helping business to invest by allowing companies to carry back tax losses and delivering tax breaks for small business; investing in key health services; building an aged care system for the future; building a more productive workforce by investing in jobs, education and training; and building productivity by investing in nation-building infrastructure—by investing in roads, rail and ports.


The government's fiscal strategy is designed to ensure fiscal sustainability while providing the necessary flexibility for the budget position to vary in line with economic conditions. The medium-term fiscal strategy, which has remained unchanged since the government's first budget in 2008-09, is to achieve budget surpluses on average over the medium term; to keep taxation as a share of GDP on average below the level for 2007-08—that was 23.7 per cent; and to improve the government's net financial worth over the medium term.


To ensure a timely return to surplus and recovery in the fiscal position, since the beginning of the global financial crisis the government has further committed to allowing the level of tax receipts to recover naturally as the economy improves, while maintaining the government's commitment to keep taxation as a share of GDP below the 2007-08 level on average and building growing surpluses by holding real growth in spending to two per cent a year on average until the budget surplus is at least one per cent of GDP and while the economy is growing at or above trend.


Returning the budget to surplus in 2012-13 remains appropriate given domestic economic conditions. The economy is forecast to grow around trend over the next two years, the unemployment rate is expected to remain low and mining investment is expected to reach record highs. A return to surplus also recognises that fiscal policy should be set in a medium-term framework. In normal circumstances, monetary policy should play the primary role in managing demand to keep the economy growing at close to capacity, consistent with achieving its medium-term inflation target.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:06):  I have some questions following up questions I asked you on the last occasion concerning the appointment and work program of Dr Ken Henry. I notice that since you and I had questions and answers that there has been information given to the Senate estimates committee. Mr Leon said that at the moment—




Mr Dreyfus:
  Sorry to interrupt; it is Ms Leon. That might be of assistance.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  In that case Ms Leon has informed the Senate that Dr Henry is now employed on the basis of 2½ days a week, but it has not been 2½ days a week for the entire time since he commenced work. I think I flagged with you at the last estimates that it was expected that the nature of the Asian century task force would have some ebbs and flows, with peak periods in the middle and probably slower periods at the end. And this has been the experience. Could the parliamentary secretary provide the Federation Chamber with a complete week-by-week breakdown of the number of days worked by Dr Ken Henry, showing which weeks if he ever worked 40 hours a week whereby he would be paid at the full rate. I do not think I have ever met a departmental secretary who has only worked 40 hours a week. But if Dr Henry works 40 hours a week, he gets paid at the full rate. I also notice that since we last met in this chamber there has been about $100,000 increase for the position of head of Treasury. It is now up to some $615,000 a year—the rate that Dr Henry is to be paid—and it will go up a further $100,000, I think. Dr Henry under the terms under which he was appointed will enjoy those rises. I am sorry; it goes up to $653,000 on 1 July 2012.


We would like to know for that sort of money precisely what Dr Henry is doing. I know he has been doing the Asian paper, which is due to be delivered in the middle of the year, and that Dr de Brouwer has confirmed that there are discussions with Dr Henry that he will be continuing after that, but he describes that as a 'live' discussion. I wonder if the parliamentary secretary could tell us what precisely Dr Henry might be doing for either the full amount of $615,000 a year or pro rata on whatever number of days he is doing and what that work might be. I think we need to know a little more than it being a 'live' discussion. It was confirmed again that Dr Henry will continue as a special adviser, but there has been a project to which there has not been an agreement yet. Could you confirm that to date there is no agreement as to what his future work might be?

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (17:09):  There were a lot of questions last year in the consideration in detail of the appropriations for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet about Dr Henry's work for the Commonwealth. I am pleased that since last year some information has been provided to the member for Mackellar. It is apparent from the material that the member for Mackellar just read that this matter has been raised in Senate estimates and that a range of further information has been provided about some of the excellent work that Dr Henry has been carrying out on behalf of the Commonwealth since this was raised in this very place in this same session in relation to the appropriations for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet last year.


I can confirm that Dr Henry has been working on the Australia in the Asian century white paper, providing advice in that context and assisting with the drafting of that white paper. Indeed, he has travelled to consult with people and governments in a range of our Asian neighbouring countries, as is appropriate. As the member for Mackellar has indicated, the Australia in the Asian century white paper is going to be published in the middle of 2012.


Her further questioning went to what further projects Dr Henry may be working on after the work on the Australia in the Asian century white paper is completed. I am happy to take on notice the request. I obviously do not have with me the details of Dr Henry's employment—I do not mean by that the salary rates, which were canvassed last year. Rather, these questions go to the actual work that has been performed by Dr Henry since last year, since his appointment and since the commencement of the Australia in the Asian century white paper process. We will provide such details as are possible in due course.

We are entitled to know precisely how many days he has worked each week and whether or not at any time he has worked 40 hours. I would also like to know what safeguards have been put in place to prevent there being a conflict of interest between Dr Henry's position as special adviser to the Prime Minister on these matters and his position as a director of the NAB. This is a matter which is of grave concern to many people and I would like to know what provisions have been taken—what chinese walls have been erected—to prevent those conflict of interest situations arising.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2012-06-20,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (17:13):  The first matter would seem to be a request for confirmation of the level of detail that we will be able to provide. I can confirm to the member for Mackellar that we will provide such detail as is available. I cannot not say exactly what the precise terms and the fine details of the arrangement with Dr Henry are. I can say as Cabinet Secretary that I know of his work on the Australia in the Asian century white paper process. He had quite a gruelling schedule of travel in the two-week period that he travelled to a number of Asian countries. Then there was the work that he did on the discussion paper, which was published early in the process for this white paper. I do not think the member for Mackellar would be surprised to hear that Dr Henry, as one might expect from one of Australia's more eminent economists and longstanding, hardworking public servants, has worked exceptionally hard and put in some very long hours on the Australia in the Asian Century white paper process, but we will endeavour to provide detail of the hours worked, if indeed that detail is available—because that is what is being sought—or at least some detail that gives the member for Mackellar some indication of the work that is being done not just in general sense but in a detailed sense by Dr Henry.


The other point raised by the member for Mackellar went to the suggestion that there might be some conflict of interest between Dr Henry's position as a director of the National Australia Bank and the work that he is doing for the Commonwealth of Australia. As the member for Mackellar would be aware, it is quite common for service to be provided to the Commonwealth by people who hold directorships, who hold a range of positions with other bodies. They are not of course in the same position as ministers; nor are they in the same position as secretaries of departments or full-time Australian public servants. I think the nation would be the poorer if it were decided that the mere holding of a directorship in a listed corporation meant that such a person could not provide services to the Commonwealth.


In general terms, conflicts of interest are very often dealt with in Australia by declaration—by the disclosure of an apprehended conflict. That gets over a large part of the problem, in so far as there are particular arrangements that parties have come to. In the case of Dr Henry, formal arrangements have been struck in relation to the conflict that could arise, potentially, between his work as a director of the National Australia Bank and the work that he is doing for the Commonwealth. I am happy to provide that also to the member for Mackellar.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2012-06-20,"



Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:16):  Perhaps I can assist the Parliamentary Secretary by reading to him the terms of Dr Henry's employment as Special Adviser. Of course, it is the most unusual appointment under section 67 of the Constitution—by Her Excellency's command, signed by the Governor-General and the Prime Minister—and I do not accept that it is usual practice to have directors of public companies, who are also appointed under section 67 of the Constitution, working directly to the Prime Minister. It says in this agreement, under clause (c):


iii. for any period that the Special Adviser performs the duties of that office on a full-time basis (40 hours per week), the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment for the Special Adviser be the same as those that apply to the person who holds the position of Secretary of the Department of the Treasury at the relevant time—


—who, I am sure, works more than 40 hours a week. It continues:




iv. 
t
he Prime Minister may agree that the duties of


the Special Adviser are to be
 performed on a part-time basis …





We have never seen any evidence that the Prime Minister has so agreed. Finally, it says:





v. 
for any period that the Special Adviser performs the duties on a part-time basis, the remuneration referred to in clause (c)(iii) above be payable, and other entitlements accrue, on a pro-rata basis.





However, I take it from the answer that you previously gave me that, if Dr Henry is travelling overseas and is away for a week, then that presumably will be deemed to be 40 hours a week and he will be paid a week's salary from the $615,000 a year that is attracted by this agreement because that is now the salary paid. I would like those things confirmed.





You mentioned that you thought the conflict-of-interest situation could be dealt with by declaration. I would like you to inform the parliament whether or not there have been any such declarations made or, indeed, any such declarations sought.





I go back to the question of the actual time that Dr Henry has spent on the white paper. I do not think it is unreasonable, when dealing with the amounts of money we are talking about, to ask that the parliament be informed of precisely the number of days per week that have been worked by Dr Henry since 5 January. 




I also note from other answers given that work on the white paper was only one of a number of vague discussions that took place, and then suddenly this was the job of work. But I am really quite alarmed that we are now coming up to 30 June—the reporting time for the Asian century white paper is the middle of the year—but there has been confirmation that Dr Henry's position will continue at this hugely expensive salary, yet there is no apparent work for him. So, I again ask the parliamentary secretary if he could tell the House precisely what discussions have taken place on what work he may or may not be doing and whether there is a break in the period between finishing this job and beginning a next assignment, and will he continue to be paid? It would seem that under this agreement he will be. But I would think that the people of Australia would think that was totally unreasonable.


Thirdly—I do not know the answer to this—does a section 67 appointment affect Dr Henry's entitlement to draw his pension, which from memory I think would be two-thirds of his previous salary, or of the current salary? If it is not affected, that means he would be getting his retirement pay, a pension, plus his entitlement to whatever proportion of $615,000, plus his NAB director's salary. He is indeed a very well-endowed former public servant. I would be pleased if you would answer the specific question: does an appointment under section 67 disqualify him from taking his pension that is payable under the defined scheme?

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (17:21):  I am happy to take that fairly technical question on notice, but I would resist the suggestion that seems to be being made by the member for Mackellar, at least by implication, that there is anything in the slightest out of the ordinary about this appointment under section 67 of the Constitution. The member for Mackellar would be well aware that all governments since Federation have used section 67 of the Constitution, perhaps sparingly—




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Not for this purpose.




Mr DREYFUS:
  Well, there we have it: the implication from the member for Mackellar that there is something unusual about the use of section 67.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Correct.




Mr DREYFUS:
  I would invite her to examine the history of section 67 appointments by both the former government, which used the provision quite frequently, and previous governments since Federation that have also used this as an appropriate method of providing services, often at a very high level, to the Commonwealth. There is nothing inappropriate about the way in which section 67 is being used to secure the continuing services to the Commonwealth, to the great benefit of the Commonwealth, of Dr Henry.


I can make it clear to the member for Mackellar that we will provide such details of the work done by Dr Henry under the terms of this employment arrangement under section 67. I and the government accept wholly that the parliament is entitled to some details, as it is entitled to the details of work done by other servants on behalf of the Commonwealth. But I will have to take on notice the particular question, which probably turns on Dr Henry's individual circumstances—that is, as to the question of whether or not the appointment under 67 has some bearing on such retirement benefits as he is receiving from the Commonwealth. I do not accept the correctness of the characterisation of what are Dr Henry's superannuation, pension or retirement benefits from the Commonwealth. The suggestion has been made by the member for Mackellar, but I do not know what basis there is for it and I certainly would not want to be taken to be confirming in any way that the member for Mackellar has correctly described Dr Henry's retirement benefits from the Commonwealth.

I think it is very important to know what the implications of that section 67 appointment are on his pension entitlements to be paid now.


Also, to assist the parliamentary secretary, believe me, I have done a thorough analysis of all appointments made pursuant to section 67 and there are none—not one—that is analogous to this one. It is one that is extraordinarily generous, it is one that is unique, and it is one concerning someone who obviously the government regarded as a valued servant to the government of the day.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:25):  I wish to ask a question about the Ombudsman's task now that there are so many illegal boat arrivals. The Ombudsman was charged originally with responsibility for looking into many of those issues. When the funding was provided for the Ombudsman for the irregular maritime arrivals, as they are euphemistically called—it was agreed in 2008—there were expected to be 100 arrivals a year. Currently, there are 4,762 arrivals in immigration detention and more than 3,200 of those detainees have been in immigration detention for more than six months, making a case-by-case assessment increasingly impossible. The budget has really not been increased. I know we went through the procedures when a previous Ombudsman went to a Greens senator to complain and subsequently had his services terminated. Nonetheless, the current Ombudsman is still operating under the same funding arrangements, and I want to know why there has been no increase in that funding.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (17:26):  The Ombudsman has a broad range of activities. He is charged with receiving complaints and investigating various matters, and he has certain functions conferred on him by a range of different Commonwealth statutes. In so far as the question is directed to the sufficiency of the resources as a whole that the Commonwealth Ombudsman has been given to carry out the various roles that he is currently charged with in his activities generally and his discretionary activities in particular, the Ombudsman's brief is to look at various matters on a self-starting basis and he has been given overall supervisory responsibility for a range of areas in the Commonwealth's jurisdiction. In so far as those discretionary activities are conducted by him, they must be done in a way that can be managed within the budget that his office has been given. There is a degree of discretion available to him as to what tasks he decides to undertake and there is a degree of discretion vested in him as to what resources and funding he devotes to particular activities.


In so far as this question is directed to the particular role that the Commonwealth Ombudsman has in relation to immigration detainees—I took the question to be particularly referring to that—questions about specific measures affecting those immigration detainees need to be raised with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:28):  Just to help the parliamentary secretary, the Ombudsman comes from PM&C. In the 2011-12 budget, $900,000 over two years was set aside for the Commonwealth Ombudsman to monitor irregular maritime arrivals. This was to be met through the existing resources of the office of the Ombudsman. But, unfortunately for him, in the 2012-13 budget there has been a cut in his funding. His budget has gone from $27,286,000 down to $26,952,000. Does that indicate that you do not expect any more boat arrivals? Is the Ombudsman simply to forget about this task that he was given or does the government stand by the $900,000 over two years to be utilised for that purpose?

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (17:29):  I am not sure that the member for Mackellar has fully understood what the budget papers say about the funding of the Ombudsman. The total revenue of the Ombudsman is set out in the forward estimates. The budget papers in fact have figures for the total revenue of the Ombudsman. His revenue consists of both appropriations from the government and income that he receives from the sale of services.


To look at this, in 2007-08 the total revenue of the Ombudsman was $19,394,000, continuing to rise through to 2012. I will just read out the figures. In 2008-09 it was $20,756,000, in 2009-10 it was $20,309,000, in 2010-11 it was $21,277,000, and in 2011-12 it was $21,766,000. In the current year there is a drop to $20,115,000, but projections for the remaining three years of the forward estimates all have the Ombudsman's revenue remaining in the vicinity of $20 million. So it is projected to be $20,183,000 next year, $19,885,000 the following year and $19,930,000 in 2015-16.


The Commonwealth Ombudsman's staffing has been reduced. There has been a reduction in the estimated average staffing level from around 159 for 2011-12 down to 136 for 2012-13. Part of the reason for the reduction is the termination of measures relating to the oversight role that the Ombudsman was given in relation to the Northern Territory emergency response. There has also been something of a reduction specifically in the oversight role that the Ombudsman plays for Christmas Island processing. There is also a reduction because of the efficiency dividend that has been required of Commonwealth government agencies across the board.


I think it is important when one is looking at the functions of the Ombudsman to reflect upon the very broad range of functions that the Ombudsman is given, not only by the Ombudsman's own legislation but by other government programs and sometimes by other legislation. It is not really appropriate just to pick out one part of what might have been the Commonwealth Ombudsman's activities in part of some previous year and suggest that an overall conclusion can be drawn about the current year's activities. I would repeat: the Commonwealth Ombudsman has a very independent role. He has a very large discretion, and appropriately so, to determine how he would best use the resources that are provided to him by the government.


The implication in the member for Mackellar's question, that he must devote a certain level of resources to any particular thing, is wrong. It is a discretionary matter for him and I have identified, at least in part, that the reduction in role—notably in the oversight role that he had for the Northern Territory emergency response—is the reason why there has been some reduction in the Ombudsman's staffing.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:33):  The reduction from $27,286,000 to $26,952,000, and going south in the parliamentary secretary's answer, brings me to the fact that the Ombudsman is not a government department but is an independent statutory officer set up by an act. This has been described by a previous Ombudsman—a very fine Australian, Dennis Pearce—as being both a blessing and a curse. Whilst it frees him from undue pressures of government, it also means that there is no ready access to departmental or ministerial support. I know there is a practice whereby people are seconded from government departments to the Ombudsman's service for the purposes of a particular investigation, but that too can have its downside. So I wanted to ask whether or not there was any consideration of what ombudsmen have said over time about either creating a parliamentary committee to have oversight of the Ombudsman's office, which would give it a direct connection to the parliament, or making the Ombudsman an officer of the parliament so that there is greater recognition of the way in which he can be answerable to the parliament and, indeed, can seek direct access to departments when he needs it—so the issue is twofold.


I hear that the main reason for the drop in funding for the office is that they have been relieved of responsibility in the Territory, but we still have not come to the nub of the question about the rising numbers of illegal boat people coming to Australia and the fact that a policy of having $900,000 over two years was set aside to look into the questions that arose from that—yet the number is so large that it seems an impossible task. So has the government abandoned that policy?

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (17:36):  I think it is very important that the parliament focus on what the role of the Ombudsman actually is. As the member for Mackellar has pointed out, the Ombudsman is charged with a review role. He is a statutory officer with quite a high degree of independence; as such, and under the terms of his legislation, he is able to report directly to the parliament and indeed has done so on occasion. He also of course has an annual report in which he describes the work that he has engaged in over the previous year.


The Commonwealth has many dozens of statutory officers—obviously, all in roles different from the role the Ombudsman performs—but not all of those officers, many of whom have a statutory degree of independence conferred on them, have their own parliamentary committee. I do not think it would be workable for every statutory officer to have their own parliamentary committee. The member for Mackellar, quoting Dennis Pearce, made the point that the Ombudsman has for many years proved the value of having an Ombudsman—having independence, review processes and somewhere that members of the public can go to make their complaints, and indeed having someone who has a general oversight role and a discretion to go and look at various matters on his own motion, without waiting to be charged with an inquiry, without waiting even for a complaint to be made.


The nature of the Ombudsman's work means that it is difficult to forecast demand. Resourcing from year to year, to some extent, is going to on a best-guess basis. Just looking at the number of complaints received over the last four years might give you some indication of the degree of difficulty involved in making estimates in advance. For instance—and this is just the number of complaints and approaches to the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman; he has this other, separate, self-starting jurisdiction altogether—we read in the Ombudsman's reports that there were a total of 39,932 in 2007-08, but they leapt to 45,719 in 2008-09, went down again to 37,468 in 2009-10 and then rose slightly in 2010-11. That gives you an idea of the elasticity of the numbers of complaints, and the irregularity of the numbers gives you an indication of the difficulty of forecasting year-on-year what work the Ombudsman will have to carry out, what he is going to have to do. Obviously, where there is an increase in demand that can be estimated and clearly linked to some particular initiative or some new jurisdiction that has been conferred on the Ombudsman, then consideration of resourcing is possible. But, at a very general level, the Ombudsman's is one of those statutory offices where it is fairly difficult to make an accurate estimate from year to year as to what the work is going to be. I have no doubt that the Ombudsman will draw it to the government's attention if the staffing level as presently estimated for 2012-13, of 136 officers, is found to be inadequate. That is what the Ombudsman has done in the past, and I have no doubt that the present occupant of this statutory office will do that in the future.


Proposed expenditure agreed to.
