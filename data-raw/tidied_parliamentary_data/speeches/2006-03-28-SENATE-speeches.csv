"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2006-03-28,"—Last night I concluded my comments about this suite of bills—the Aged Care (Bond Security) Bill 2005, the Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Bill 2005 and the Aged Care Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005—by making the point that this government has missed a number of opportunities. It has been provided with plenty of advice to date about the necessary reforms that need to happen urgently in aged care. I made the point that the Senate Community Affairs References Committee report was received by this government some 10 months ago. In that report, there were a number of recommendations that, finally, after the debacle, after the horrific stories that we have heard in the last few weeks, this government seems to have adopted. But it is too little too late.
I take this opportunity to make the point that the ministerial advisory committee that met was an existing committee. Whilst it had representation of considerable value, it did not have representation from advocates of residents who live in aged care homes or from people with absolute expertise on elder abuse, and that was a huge oversight and a missed opportunity from the Minister for Ageing.
Now we have to wait for a cabinet submission. It has been announced with great fanfare, but let us get on with it, Minister. There is a lot to be done; we have to restore confidence in residential aged care in this country. I concur with the words of Paul Sadler, the well-respected Chief Executive Officer of the Aged and Community Services Association of NSW and ACT. He said in a letter to the editor in the Sydney Morning Herald:
So I believe the minister’s committee made a good start, but much more needs to happen.
He went on to say:
It is imperative that this happens as soon as possible, because we need to protect our older citizens before they and their families lose faith in the aged-care system.
We are very close to that point, and I suggest that the response by the minister to date has fallen well short of restoring confidence in residential aged care.
In the time that I have left, I take the opportunity to remind the Senate that it is this government that has presided over a diminution in the number of aged care beds that are currently provided per 1,000 people over 70 in Australia. In 1995 there were 92 operational aged care beds for every 1,000 people aged over 70 years. In 2005 there were only 85 residential aged care beds. That is a drop of seven beds for every 1,000 people over 70 in Australia, and I am afraid to say that the graph is going downhill. After 10 years, this government has not faced up to the aged care bed crisis in Australia. Every week I hear from families—and I know my colleagues hear from families, because they tell me, and I know that government senators and members hear from families—complaining about the inability to get their loved one the appropriate care they want in residential aged care.
When the Howard government came into office, there was a target of 90 beds for every 1,000 people aged over 70. Labor had exceeded that target. We were up to 92, but what is the case now? We are down to 85. Against the target of 90 beds per 1,000 people over 70, there is a shortage now of 9,275 beds. But, instead of fixing the problem, they quietly lowered the target. Now the target reads at 88 residential aged care beds for every 1,000 people over 70. Even against their own reduced target, there is still a shortage in this country of 5,500 aged care beds. There are thousands of frail, elderly Australians desperate for support and desperate to get into residential aged care so that their care needs can be delivered.
I know that the government will say, ‘We’ve increased the number of community aged care packages.’ Yes, that is good. We accept that. We think that is a great idea, but you cannot deny that people are looking for residential aged care beds, especially high-care beds. That is a truth that the government cannot hide behind. They cannot say that they will continue to increase the number of community aged care packages. That is well received but not enough. The Productivity Commission reported in 2005 that 30 per cent of people needing nursing home care have to wait more than three months to get a bed, which is up from a figure of 15 per cent in 2000. There are significant shortages of beds in Australia and that issue has to be dealt with.
In conclusion, Labor will support this proposal. It goes some way towards protecting the accommodation bonds that are held in Australia. But, as part of my contribution, I will move a second reading amendment that has been circulated in the chamber, which identifies the lack of action of this government. I move:
At the end of the motion add:
“but the Senate:
         (1)    notes:
              (a)    there have been allegations of sexual abuse in five aged care facilities in Australia.
              (b)    the only response, to date, from the Minister for Ageing to call together an existing aged care committee, which whilst contains people with expertise in aged care, did not include advocates of residents in aged care nor people with specific experience in elder abuse.
         (2)    Condemns the Government for failing to:
              (a)    conduct an independent inquiry to determine if there has been an increase in sexual abuse of residents in aged care facilities;
              (b)    respond to, for nearly 10 months since the tabling of the Senate Committee Report of the Community Affairs References Committee, Quality and Equity in Aged Care, which recommended in part:
12: That the Agency ensure that all facilities be subject to a minimum of one annual random or targeted spot check and at least one site visit with notification over its accredited period.
16: That the Commonwealth review the operations of the Aged Care Complaints Resolution Scheme to ensure that the Scheme:
is accessible and responsive to complainants;
provides for a relaxation of the strict eligibility criteria for accepting complaints;
registers all complaints as a complaint, with the complaints being categorised by their degree of severity, such as moderate level of complaint, complaints where mediation is required or where more significant levels of intervention are required; and
provides that the mediation process is responsive and open and that sufficient support for complainants is provided in this process.
17: That the Commonwealth examine the feasibility of introducing whistleblower legislation to provide protection for people, especially staff of aged care facilities, disclosing allegations of inadequate standards of care or other deficiencies in aged care facilities.
18: That the Commissioner for Complaints conduct an investigation into the nature and extent of retribution and intimidation of residents in aged care facilities and their families, including the need for a national strategy to address this issue.
              (c)    answer, on 2 March 2006, the Senate question on whether there were any other aged care facilities in Australia being investigated for sexual abuse allegations.
         (3)    Calls on the Federal Government to urgently restore community confidence in residential aged care in Australia”.

",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE (BOND SECURITY) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2006-03-28,"—I also want to speak on the Aged Care (Bond Security) Bill 2005 and related bills—but at a little less length than Senator McLucas did, mainly because I will actually address the bills rather than the extraneous issues that Senator McLucas raised. First, I want to make it clear that the government deserves to be commended for a quite extraordinary achievement with this package of legislation.
These bills address the potential for a very serious crisis in aged accommodation in Australia. With hundreds of millions of dollars of accommodation bonds being held by thousands of providers across the country, the potential for those providers to default in their obligations to their residents’ estates is quite significant. There are some providers who operate a large number of homes in this country, and if one of them were to enter into serious financial difficulty—heaven forbid—and a default occurred, there would be a very significant loss to perhaps tens of thousands of people. It is true to say that that has not occurred before. In fact, the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee heard that there was no evidence of any default in the obligation to repay accommodation bonds in Australia. Nonetheless, the potential remains.
With these bills, the government has put in place a scheme which will, for the first time, address that potential disaster in the industry. The scheme has obtained more or less unanimous support from the industry, notwithstanding the fact that the proposed regime will potentially place a significant obligation on providers in the industry to foot the bill in the event that there is a default by one or more other providers in the industry. Given the complexity of the arrangements that might have been entered into, to design a scheme which has the support of industry is a major achievement. We should not underplay that in the course of this debate. I congratulate the Minister for Ageing and I congratulate the Department of Health and Ageing for having steered such a major reform through the process of consultation with industry so as to achieve this very significant outcome.
As has been summarised already, these bills put in place an arrangement where, in the event that there is a default by a particular provider in the repayment of accommodation bonds to residents, there is the capacity to levy other providers in the industry—either as a whole or on a selective basis—to recover the costs that the Commonwealth incurs in taking on the responsibility of repaying those bonds to individuals or to their estates. That is a very important piece of security which we confer on residents of aged care facilities in this country. Very often, the product of residents’ life work is in those bonds which are placed in the care of those homes. At the present time there is no protection at all for those bonds. If a home becomes insolvent, for example, there is nothing to prevent those bonds being lost. This package represents a very significant step towards ensuring that those sorts of dangers are averted in the future.
In order to avoid, at all costs, a situation where a provider cannot repay bonds, the industry will need to exercise great vigilance over the standards of accountability and transparency that they use in administering not only the bonds but also the other government funding which those establishments receive. With other developments in the industry in recent years, such as the conditional adjustment payments, which the government has been making in exchange for greater transparency and accountability, these are steps towards ensuring that the likelihood of a default is reduced.
I want to make it clear that the attack that Senator McLucas has made on the government’s general administration of aged care in this country is deeply unwarranted. There is, quite frankly, a distortion of the facts being executed here in order to prove some other broader political point. This does not do anything to enhance the sense of security of people in aged care facilities in this country, and they ought to have a sense of security because Australia does have a high-quality aged care sector. The vast majority of providers do a good job, and the standard of care that they provide is of a high order. People who live in residential aged care facilities in this country can attest to that fact, and most of them do—notwithstanding the fact that there are some conspicuous cases where those standards have not been met.
The suggestion by Senator McLucas that the government is somehow dudding the elderly of Australia by reducing the proportion of aged care beds which are operational is simply without foundation. The fact is that this government has more than doubled expenditure on aged care in the last 10 years, at a time when, clearly, the population of Australia aged over 70 has not doubled. It has doubled that expenditure in real terms because it wants to provide greater opportunity and choice for people in their retirement years.
The government has succeeded in increasing choice by greatly increasing support for home based accommodation packages. That is, people today who wish to remain in their own homes have the option of doing so much more often than was the case under the former Labor government. Those options have been vastly increased, and of course we all know that nine out of 10 Australians—probably 99 out of 100 Australians—would prefer to continue to live in their own homes and to have support in those homes for as long as possible than to move into a residential facility, no matter how attractive those options might ultimately become.
That is what the government has been focusing on and why the number of aged care beds is a less significant factor than the range of choice available to people who are ageing and need assistance to continue to live in their own homes. That is the choice the government has provided with its package and that is what Senator McLucas so comprehensively failed to address.
If you were looking at the situation of aged care provision in this country, the range of choice available to you, the range of support available to you in residential facilities, the quality of those facilities and the support provided by the community to those facilities, you would not exchange for quids the situation that existed 10 or 12 years ago with the situation today. You would be absolutely better off under today’s regime and that is a tribute to this minister and to his predecessors.
I commend the government again on having engineered a quite significant reform in aged care provision in this country with its package. It amounts to a very important set of changes. I do not recall an occasion when as a member of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee I have had the opportunity to be part of a report which has had unanimous support among members. I think that every other bill referred to the legislation committee in this area in the past has had dissenting reports or at least additional comments. This is the first report I can recall which has not had those sorts of comments and it reflects the fact that the government has got it right with its package. I commend the minister on having taken the trouble to ensure that that is the case.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE (BOND SECURITY) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2006-03-28,"—I rise to speak on the three bills relating to aged care: the Aged Care (Bond Security) Bill 2005, the Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Bill 2005 and the Aged Care Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005. The first two bills are designed to protect accommodation bonds held by residential aged care providers in the case of a provider becoming insolvent. The third bill will serve to amend the Aged Care Act 1997 to establish new prudential regulatory arrangements to improve the management of residents’ accommodation bonds and entry contributions. The trio of bills will together strengthen the protection of residents’ accommodation bonds, enhance requirements of aged care providers and guarantee the repayment of bond balances to residents. The Aged Care Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill also includes consequential amendments to the act to ensure that all rules relating to the bonds apply to all services holding bonds, whether they are residential care services or flexible care services.
Labor has already indicated that it will support these bills but I would like to reiterate comments that have already been made by several of my colleagues. We are concerned with the way in which the Howard government has managed aged care. Many of us are already familiar with Professor Warren Hogan’s comments about aged care in Australia. He has called for a comprehensive review of the aged care system. But we are still to see the minister make a move towards fixing the problems which are growing by the day and we are still to see any planning for the future.
The sector, the community and Labor are all sick of the government’s quick fixes when it comes to the aged care system. Recently we have seen sickening reports of alleged physical and sexual abuse of elderly women in aged care homes. I am hopeful that these reports relate to isolated incidents, as I am sure that the majority of workers in the sector are respected, totally dedicated to what they do and do a fantastic job in circumstances which, in most situations, are probably not the ideal. However, the Minister for Ageing needs to take further steps to ensure that such abuses are not able to occur.
A meeting the minister held this month with the Aged Care Advisory Committee agreed to several proposals which were, in fact, recommendations from the Senate inquiry into aged care that was tabled in June last year. That the government had failed to respond to those recommendations is barely surprising. It has illustrated again and again the contempt it holds for the parliamentary process in its failure to answer questions on notice until the last minute, or not at all, so it is not surprising that the government failed to respond to the report and is still to do so. The mere fact that it has taken such terrible incidents to spur it to act is shameful. It is time for the minister to stop the talk and take action. The revelations of reported sexual assaults in our aged care homes are unfortunately just the latest in a sector that has been plagued by problems for many years.
The Howard government is still failing when it comes to delivering aged care beds. There is a shortage of almost 10,000 beds across the country. Waiting lists, particularly for high-care places, are growing. When we look at the issue of aged care, what is at the core of the system? Our elderly deserve the right to an efficient, safe, and high-level quality of care should living in their own homes become too much for them. The government has a responsibility to ensure that this service is available to all who need it, while the community has a right to know and be confident that their loved ones are being properly cared for by qualified staff.
The problem facing aged care is not a small one. To put it into perspective, it is projected that spending on aged care will more than double in the next 40 years. It is also projected that the number of Australians requiring high-care residential aged care will increase from fewer than 100,000 in 2003 to 337,000 in those 40 years. The size of the challenge is phenomenal. But is the government doing everything it can to prepare for that challenge? The answer is clearly no.
A testament to the Howard government’s failure in aged care is evident in my home state of Tasmania. It was Kevin Andrews, who was the then Minister for Ageing, way back in 2003, who worked with the Tasmanian Minister for Health and Human Services, David Llewellyn, and the Local Government Association of Tasmania. Mr Andrews was the first to announce a tripartite agreement between the federal, state and local governments in Tasmania to work together to improve aged care services. But, unfortunately, it seems that is about all that the minister did. The tripartite agreement was supposed to promote and further aged care in Tasmania. The Tasmanian government, along with the Local Government Association of Tasmania, has been and remains committed to the tripartite agreement. Both the Tasmanian government and the Local Government Association of Tasmania have signed-off on the agreement and it is presumably now with Senator Santoro awaiting the same treatment.
In his media release announcing the agreement, dated 20 August 2003, Mr Andrews stated:
The aim is to improve aged care services for older Tasmanians by three levels of government working together ... This is a major step forward in cooperation between government for the benefit of older Tasmanians particularly, but the whole Tasmanian community.
The failure so far to progress the agreement sadly seems to sum up the Howard government’s approach to aged care. The advice I have is that, since the recent state election—and I take the opportunity to congratulate Premier Lennon and his team on the wonderful result—the Tasmanian government has contacted the Department of Health and Ageing and remains committed to the agreement. I urge Senator Santoro to expedite the signing of this agreement so that older Tasmanians can begin to benefit from a more streamlined approach to delivery of aged care services across the state.
Coming back to the package of bills that we are looking at today, these bills will ensure that, in the event that a nursing home was to become insolvent, the Commonwealth will step in and ensure that accommodation deposits are refunded to the residents or the families of residents. Of course, this is a welcome change that has been long overdue and it is one which Labor supports. However, the burden is now on Senator Santoro to reverse the years of Howard government neglect of aged care. Senator Santoro faces the challenge of fixing the shortage of beds, cutting waiting times, guaranteeing our aged care centres are safe and efficient, and ensuring that those requiring high care places are not forced to stay in hospital acute care beds. The bills we are currently looking at will serve to assure our elderly that their accommodation bonds are protected. But what reassurance is it for people to know that their money is safe while wondering at the same time whether the same is true of them?",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE (BOND SECURITY) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-03-28,"—I rise to speak to the Aged Care (Bond Security) Bill 2005, the Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Bill 2005 and the Aged Care Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005. Labor supports these bills but is underwhelmed by the Howard government’s approach to dealing with the very real and growing problems in the aged care sector.
The Aged Care (Bond Security) Bill 2005 and cognate bills, when enacted, will create a process through which, in the unfortunate event that a nursing home were to become insolvent, the Commonwealth would step in and ensure that the accommodation deposits were refunded to residents and their families. While this package of bills will provide greater security for those deposits and picks up one of the recommendations of the Hogan report on aged care, it fails to address the rest. However, the one recommendation these bills do address, recommendation 9, covers an issue that is not the most pressing area of concern. As far as I know, there has not been one single instance of a bond not being repaid due to bankruptcy or insolvency of an aged care service provider. It is prudent that we act to close off the possibility of someone losing a bond at some time in the future, but with these bills the Howard government has shown that it is not serious about addressing more immediate problems, like the shortages of aged care beds, regional distortions in the allocation of aged care beds and growing waiting lists.
You might well ask why the government has ignored the more substantial recommendations of the Hogan review and has chosen instead to solve a problem that does not yet exist. It is because it gives government backbenchers the opportunity to trot out some key lines in a speech to make it appear as though these bills address the real and growing problems in the aged care sector. They do not. On 8 February 2006, Mr Stuart Henry, the marginal member for Hasluck, made a very enthusiastic speech on these bills in the other place. In that speech, Mr Henry describes these bills as ‘a striking example of the Howard government’s commitment to the welfare and dignity of senior Australians’. Mr Henry went on to trot out a range of government key lines—straight from the government media office script—such as:
This new legislation demonstrates the Howard government’s commitment to provide Australians with a world-class aged care system.
He also said:
Providing high quality, affordable and accessible services which meet the individual needs and choices—
and blah blah blah—I am sure you get the idea. You have to give it the member for Hasluck. He is trying his hardest to make these very meagre reforms sound impressive. I suggest that the reason he is being so over the top in his praise of these bills is that he is embarrassed by the Howard government’s continued inaction to address the real problems in the aged care sector.
If government senators will not take my word for it, they might be interested in what their former leader, Mr John Hewson, had to say. In an article in the Australian Financial Review on 20 January 2006, Mr Hewson wrote:
... commonwealth/state financial relations and the division of responsibilities is the single most festering sore on our national aspirations and capacities.
Mr Hewson then went on to list a range of key structural expenditure issues which he believes are consistently ignored by the Howard government before writing:
... aged care is a significantly bigger issue that the government cannot afford to keep avoiding. The Hogan report should not be left on the shelf.
So, according to the Liberal Party’s former leader, Mr John Hewson, aged care is a festering sore on our national aspirations. That might have been a more accurate key line for the member for Hasluck’s speech, but the truth rarely makes for good propaganda.
If we look at the first recommendation of the Hogan report, we can see why Mr Hewson says the Howard government has left it on the shelf. Recommendation 1 calls on the Howard government to come good on its 2001 commitment to provide 108 places for every 1,000 Australians over the age of 70. The failure to provide an adequate number of residential aged care beds is a continuing indictment of the Howard government’s inability to address the problems in the aged care sector.
In the last full year of the Labor government in 1995, there were 92 residential aged care beds for every 1,000 Australians aged over 70 years. The Howard government immediately lowered the standard and set itself a benchmark of providing only 90 residential aged care beds for every 1,000 Australians aged over 70 years. Yet, after 10 long years of Howard government mismanagement, there were only 85 residential aged care beds for every 1,000 Australians aged over 70 years by June 2005. This is a shortfall of over 9,000 beds.
Instead of working to meet its own lowered target, the Howard government is going backwards. On top of that, there are now over 20,000 phantom beds in the system for which residential aged care places have been allocated but no beds have been built. Is this a demonstration of the world-class system the member for Hasluck would have us believe the Howard government is committed to delivering? I think not.
In my home state of Western Australia, there is a shortage of some 787 beds against the Howard government’s lowered benchmark of 90 beds per 1,000. This is unacceptable. But the reason the Howard government thinks it can get away with this continued failure is that the Western Australian state government is forced to pick up the Howard government’s slack. On any given day there are over 100 Western Australians stuck in the state health system’s metropolitan hospitals, with a further 120 Western Australians stuck in rural hospitals who have been assessed as requiring a residential aged care bed but for whom no beds are available. The Western Australian state government has to divert considerable resources to provide care for people who are being forced to wait too long for a Commonwealth funded aged care bed to become available.
In 2005-06, the Western Australian state government budgeted $49 million of state government money to provide its care awaiting placement program in metropolitan hospitals and beds for nursing home type patients in rural hospitals where there is no nursing home in the area. The evidence shows that waiting times are getting worse. When the Howard government came to power in 1996, the average waiting time was less than a month. By 2001, the average waiting time had blown out to 55 days. After 10 years of Howard government mismanagement, the Productivity Commission reported that, by 2005, 30 per cent of people assessed as requiring a residential aged care bed were being forced to wait more than three months for a bed to become available. The cost of these waiting times created by the lack of Commonwealth provided aged care beds in my home state is being borne by the Western Australian taxpayers and, in turn, causing shortages in the number of hospital beds available to Western Australians. Is this a demonstration of the accessible services the member for Hasluck would have us believe the Howard government is committed to delivering? I think not.
While the number of residential aged care beds has decreased under the Howard government, the average cost of a bond has increased dramatically. When the Howard government came to office in 1996, the average cost of a new bond was only $26,000. After 10 years, the average cost of a new bond has increased to over $127,000. That is a massive increase and represents a significant proportion of the life savings of the average Australian. Is this a demonstration of the affordable aged care system the member for Hasluck would have us believe the Howard government is committed to delivering? I think not.
In May 2005, the member for Hasluck, Mr Stuart Henry, published an article in his community newsletter titled ‘Federal minister on visit to Amaroo retirement village’. In the article Mr Henry said that he wanted the minister to visit Amaroo Village because he had been impressed by the sense of community he had found amongst the residents and by the quality of the facilities provided. Senator McLucas, Labor’s shadow minister for ageing, disabilities and carers, and I have also been to Amaroo Village. We were also impressed by the sense of community and quality of care provided there. Amaroo Village is a credit to the dedicated staff and volunteers who work there. All the residents we spoke to were glowing in their praise of the care they received.
Mr Henry’s article did not mention that there is a two-year waiting list for a bed in Amaroo Village. Mr Henry’s article did not mention that, with a turnover of fewer than 10 residents a year, there is little prospect of the waiting list shortening in the near future. Mr Henry also failed to mention that the management of Amaroo Village had estimated that the value of the labour contributed by volunteers is over $750,000 a year, without which the centre would not be able to afford to operate. If Mr Henry’s idea of a world-class aged care system is one with a two-year waiting list kept afloat by the unpaid work of volunteers then he is doing his constituents a disservice. After 10 long years, the legacy of the Howard government has been fewer beds, longer waitlists and higher bonds. The people of Hasluck, the people of Western Australia and the people of Australia deserve better.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE (BOND SECURITY) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2006-03-28,"—First of all, I would like to thank all senators for their support of the Aged Care (Bond Security) Bill 2005 and related legislation. Right from the word go, I would like to say that it is testimony to the hard work of many people that these bills have been going through the Senate and the lower house in such an orderly and bipartisan manner. It is the hard work of many people, not the least being the Hon. Julie Bishop MP, who preceded me in this role and is now the Minister for Education, Science and Training.
I am also very pleased to have this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of many others that have been involved in the development of this important legislation. Yesterday, you may recall, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, that the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, chaired by Senator Gary Humphries, tabled its report on these three bills. I am very pleased to note that, following the committee’s deliberations and consideration of expert evidence, the unanimous committee report recommended the bills be passed without amendment. I think that that is a tribute to the very good orderly and bipartisan processes in this place that are not recognised often enough.
I will also take the opportunity to comment on a few matters that have been raised by senators in this debate. In particular, I want to respond to Senator McLucas, who acts as the shadow minister for my area of portfolio responsibility in this place. I have not yet seen Senator McLucas’s proposed amendment in terms of the abuse issue but I hope that it is coming—it has not been circulated yet. I will not talk about the issues in relation to abuse, but I want to talk at length in response to some of the more political points that she made and which were unrelated to this bill. I will refrain from taking up too much of my 20 minutes, which I intend to use, in replying to Senator McLucas, other opposition senators and Senator Humphries.
First of all, Senator McLucas—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—I would like to welcome the Labor Party’s support for the bills. Unfortunately, that support has been marred by some of the political comments that have been made by senators opposite. I wish that sometimes people could be gracious in their support for something like this. Let us have questions without notice and questions on notice. I notice that yesterday I was not asked a question. That is how front of mind this issue was yesterday. I hope that I get two or three questions from you today on all the issues that you have expressed concern about. I would like to invite Senator McLucas to ask me questions without notice, particularly the political questions which have marred the debate that we are having.
Senator McLucas expressed some concern relating to my department’s response to her queries during the Senate committee hearing. In particular, she asked who was liable to pay a levy in the event of a default. I am sorry that Senator McLucas considered that there was some inconsistency in the advice provided by the department. However, it is my firm belief that the Hansard and my department’s submissions reflect a very consistent position. When appearing before the Senate inquiry, my department made it clear that newcomers to the industry are not liable—I stress that they are not liable—for a levy for an event that occurred before they began operating in the sector.
This is also the position that was explained in the department’s supplementary submission to the inquiry. The submission makes it clear that only those providers who hold bond balances 10 days before the default event declaration and who are still operational when the levy is imposed will be liable to pay. It was made clear that it is not the government’s intent that new entrants will have to pay as a result of an event that occurred prior to their entering the sector. The key principle of the new guarantee system is that providers holding bonds at the time of the default event share the risk and the cost of that event, as they have benefited from the guarantee of their bond liabilities up to that point. The department’s submission provided further clarification of who was considered to be a newcomer to the industry. I believe that this information has provided some reassurance to Senator McLucas, and for that I am grateful to Senator McLucas.
The submission makes it clear that when the ownership of a corporation that is an approved provider changes hands there is no change to the legal entity. As such, a corporation is not a newcomer to the industry. If a corporation holds bonds 10 days before the day on which a default event declaration is made and continues to be an approved provider on the day a levy is imposed, the corporation will be liable to pay the levy, even if in the intervening period the corporation changes hands. The corporation in this situation would not escape any eventual liability to pay a levy. I believe this approach is entirely reasonable and, based on Senator McLucas’s comments last night, I understand that she has accepted the appropriateness of this approach as reflected in the legislation.
Contrary to Senator McLucas’s and Senator Polley’s comments on aged care places, the government has every right to be proud of its aged care achievements over the last 10 years and expects to meet its 2001 commitment to provide 200,000 operational—200,000 operational—aged care places by June 2006. I repeated that for the sake of Hansard because I wish to have recorded my emphasis of that achievement. At the end of 2005 there were over 197,000 residential aged care places, with more coming online all the time. In partnership with the sector, the government has created and planned for the release of a record number of new aged care places—over 95,200 new places since 1996. That is a matter of technical and historical record.
We are also on track with our ratio of places to people. In 2004 the Australian government made a commitment to increase the ratio from 100 aged care places per 100,000 people aged 70 or over to 108 aged care places per 1,000 people aged 70 or older. I respectfully submit to Senator McLucas that we are on track with this. In 2005, 12,093 places were made available, and there will be a further 14,559 places in 2006 and 2007. The 2005 increment alone required an additional public commitment of $296 million, which is certainly not an insubstantial amount. This is designed to address diverse demand in the aged care marketplace. Consequently, this funding is directed towards 5,274 residential care places, 4,352 community aged care packages, 915 extended aged care at home packages and 667 new specialist dementia places. The government have allocated a further 885 places for multipurpose services, innovative pilots and transition care, which will assist the integration between health and aged care services. These will be further augmented by over 1,400 places over the next two years.
The allocation of places is a critical thing to get right. Places must be positioned where they are needed and allocated to those best able to provide sustainable quality care into the future. There must be confidence across the sector that we will get this process right. I have already signalled to the sector that I am willing to listen to any concerns they have about transparency or accountability for the allocation of places and to act to address legitimate deficiencies. In many of the industry forums that I have already addressed and taken feedback from I am on the record as saying that I am aware of some complaints from individual providers and from the sector generally. I have asked them to provide me with specific details on where they think the system may have lapsed. I have promised them that we will get specific debriefings in relation to their concerns. I have told them that if they are not happy I will take a personal interest. If Senator McLucas or any other senator has any specific instances of where dissatisfaction exists with the allocation process, I am very—
—Just make it more transparent.
—I hear what Senator McLucas says. She is aware, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that commercial-in-confidence situations apply to the process. To the maximum possible extent that the process can be transparent, of course this government is committed to that principle.
Around the country, people have told me that they would like support to live in their own homes for as long as practically possible, and the government has listened and responded. We have increased funding to home and community care services—up 103 per cent since 1995-96—and community aged care packages, which are up more than 1,012 per cent since 1995-96, as well as introducing the extended aged care at home packages, equivalent to residential nursing home care, to deliver high care to older Australians in their own homes.
As members opposite have alluded to, on 14 March 2006 I convened a meeting of the Aged Care Advisory Committee, which included representatives from across the industry. As I said, I will speak a lot more about the political points that Senator McLucas and others have raised when we debate their amendment in the committee stage. Basically, the legislation that we are debating focuses on the three principles that guide my activities and those of the government in terms of the provision of aged care. Those three principles are choice, quality and financial sustainability.
Choice means three things: focusing on individual needs and providing the care when and where it is needed; giving residents’ families, friends and carers a greater voice in the system; and adopting a flexible approach to meeting personal needs—in other words, to continue the transition away from a system in which the government pays providers for the kinds of services that they want to provide to one in which the government pays providers for the kinds of services that individual service users want.
The bills before parliament reflect this principle. By establishing a cast-iron guarantee that every resident that pays an accommodation bond will have the bond returned to them in the event that their provider becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the government is clearly focusing on the needs of the resident. The timely repayment of what may be a person’s life savings without question or unnecessary delay will remove worry from residents and their families. Without this new government guarantee, a resident would continue to rank as an unsecured creditor to an insolvent or bankrupt provider. People may have to wait months or even years to have their bond balance repaid and still not be sure of recovering all of the money owed to them.
The new system set out in the bills also gives residents and their families a greater voice in the system. New prudential standards to be established under the measures bill will give residents and their representatives access to up-to-date information relevant to the financial standing of the home in which the resident lives. Access to information empowers residents and their families to ask questions and make informed choices. I am proud that these new measures will enable residents to make better judgments about the financial viability of the provider.
Quality of care is the second of the three principles that I just mentioned. Quality is an essential aspect of aged care provision. In my view, the high road to improved quality is the road of competition and innovation, with regulation playing a very important supporting role. One of my predecessors, the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop MP, was passionate about improving the quality of care given to residents in aged care services. Mrs Bishop, as minister for aged care, oversaw the improvements to the responsiveness of the aged care accreditation agency and expanded the complaints resolution scheme.
The new regulatory arrangements set out in these three bills will further improve quality by assisting homes to manage their financial affairs and their ability to provide care into the future. We have worked very closely with industry to ensure the nature and degree of regulation is reasonable. I would like to acknowledge the residential aged care industry groups for their cooperation and assistance in the development of this legislation. In particular, Greg Mundy from Aged and Community Services Australia, Rod Young from the Aged Care Association of Australia and Mr Richard Gray from Catholic Health Australia have worked closely with government to ensure that this legislation meets the needs of both residents and industry.
Returning to the three principles for aged care, the third principle—financial sustainability—is closely linked to the principle of quality. The residential care system in Australia must be affordable to taxpayers, to service users and to providers. This requires a focus on productivity and efficiency so that the cost of providing world-class and innovative care to our elderly can be met. As Minister for Ageing, the Hon. Kevin Andrews MP understood this implicitly and instigated a number of strategic reviews of the system. I commend Minister Andrews particularly for his foresight in initiating the paperwork review, which has so well informed our current work on developing a more streamlined and efficient funding model.
I just want to particularly mention my predecessors Julie Bishop, Bronwyn Bishop and Kevin Andrews, because they did so much pioneering work in this area for which these days I have the privilege of enjoying ministerial responsibility. I heard those ministers invariably criticised in contributions by senators opposite, but they did much work to bring the aged care system of this country into the 21st century, which it certainly was not in when the Labor Party relinquished office in 1996.
The new prudential regulations to be made under the measures bill before the Senate also support the objective of financial sustainability by minimising the cost of industry and by focusing on improving the efficiency and viability of industry. I am acutely aware that the ongoing delivery of quality care is dependent on a financial, robust and vibrant industry. While the care and welfare of residents is paramount in every provider’s mind, each provider must also be conscious of the importance of running their business in a financially sustainable way. Good accounting practices, strong governance, risk assessment and management processes, and clear and up-to-date records and systems should be the backbone of any soundly run business. This point was strongly made by Professor Hogan in his excellent report Review of pricing arrangements in residential aged care, which has contributed significantly to the policy underpinning this new legislation for government thinking on longer term aged care reform. I am grateful to Professor Hogan for his significant contribution.

Senator McLucas interjecting—

—While good business practices are critical, it is not, however, the government’s intention that the government run the business of each provider for them. Nor will the government bear the risk of or responsibility for market success or failure. It is my philosophy that each provider must understand and manage their business themselves. The government will provide the appropriate support and guidance to assist providers, but providers must at the end of the day be responsible for the market success or failure of their own venture. This point was very effectively championed by my predecessor, the Hon. Julie Bishop MP, and was a recurring theme of the government’s response to Professor Hogan’s review. Ms Bishop, through successive federal budgets, secured over $3 billion additional funding for aged care programs, much of which were designed to improve the sustainability and quality of residential aged care in this country and answers very substantially the interjection that was made very quietly by senators opposite a minute or so ago.
The philosophical approach of financial sustainability is an important context for the new prudential standards that will be set by the measures bill before parliament. The liquidity standard, for example, will require providers to develop their own mechanisms to ensure that they have sufficient liquidity to repay bonds as they fall due. Providers will each be required to develop their own liquidity management strategy, cognisant of their individual business risks and operation. The new standard will not abrogate their responsibilities to the government. The strength of prudential arrangements will also reduce the risk of failure and activation of the guarantee scheme, another central component of the legislation before parliament.
My approach to financial sustainability is also reflected in the levy bill. This enables the government to levy all aged care providers who hold bonds to recover any amount paid out to residents by the government which are not recovered from the defaulting provider. The government will have the flexibility to ensure that the structure of the levy does not impact on the financial sustainability of approved providers nor, more importantly, compromise the quality of care being delivered.
Existing protections under the Aged Care Act 1997 have worked well to date, as shown by the fact that there has not been an incident where a resident’s bond balance has not been repaid because of the bankruptcy or insolvency of a provider. The government believes however that these additional protections are timely. The average new bond has increased in value from $26,000 in 1996-96 to $127,600 in 2004-05. Bonds can represent a significant proportion of a resident’s life savings and understandably residents and their families expect secure arrangements for their bonds and the reassurance that their bond balances will be repaid when the resident leaves home.
This legislation strikes a balance between the added security for residents that is provided by the strengthening of the arrangements and the financial impact of the new arrangements on the sector’s viability and its standing with the capital markets, including its ability to construct and maintain aged care homes. The new arrangements complement the $877.8 million conditional adjustment payment which was implemented in 2004. These government initiatives will assist the aged care industry to become more financially mature and more sustainable. The introduction of these precedents or these protections into the act demonstrates the coalition government’s commitment to a world-class system of aged care that provides high-quality, affordable and accessible services to meet the individual needs and choices of older Australians.
In closing, I want to acknowledge the individual approved providers operating aged care services across the country. I know that they share my commitment to choice, quality and financial sustainability. They have told me that repeatedly during the months I have been minister. I know that many services have made substantial financial commitments to upgrading their existing buildings, a serious investment in the future of the aged care industry in this country. The diversification that many providers are embarking upon, such as branching into community services, is an example of preparedness to provide consumers with greater choice and flexibility in their care options. In terms of quality, I acknowledge the continued high level of compliance across the sector with our accreditation standards.
I believe in the sector’s clear commitment to continuous improvement and its dedication to provide high standards of care now and into the future for the good of the Australian community. I thank all of those who have been involved in the development of this legislation and acknowledge the broad support of senators within this chamber, including the support of the opposition.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2006-03-28,"—As you pointed out, Mr Chairman, the amendment is co-sponsored by the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party. In my second reading contribution on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005, I did outline the findings of the Australian National Audit Office in Audit report No. 28—Management of net appropriations and the serious deficiencies that were highlighted in respect of special appropriations. The amendment I have co-sponsored on behalf of the Australian Labor Party with the Australian Democrats requires a register of special appropriations to be tabled in the house of parliament not later than 31 August. The amendment lists the particular appropriations that we believe, for the public record, should be made available and detailed. I would urge the Senate to support a very wise amendment that enhances accountability and openness with respect to the appropriations that the parliament in this case does not deal with.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-03-28,"—My question is to Senator Abetz, representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Is the minister aware of comments from the minister for workplace relations on Lateline last night that anyone working in a business with fewer than 100 employees can be sacked simply because the boss does not like them? Under the government’s new system, wouldn’t the employee have no entitlement to redundancy pay and no right to appeal the termination? What is to stop an employer simply sacking someone and then offering them the same job on a significantly lower wage? Can the minister explain how this complete loss of employment security benefits the four million Australians working in small businesses, many of whom are struggling to pay off mortgages and raise children?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-03-28,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. We will try again and see whether we can get a straightforward answer from the minister. Can the minister confirm that under the regulations for the industrial changes an employee can be paid below the minimum wage if, over a 12-month period, they are on average paid the minimum rate? Won’t this allow employers with seasonal workloads to significantly cut wages in the off season, which may last six months? How does the government expect these employees, whose living expenses do not vary, to survive on less than the minimum wage?
—That sounds like another question to me.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-03-28,"—To assist the honourable senator and those who may be listening to the question that has been asked, I indicate that the minister said, ‘You can sack somebody provided it is not unlawful.’ Then he went on to make the other comment. So there is a legislative protection against unlawful sacking, which those opposite continually refuse to acknowledge. They refuse to acknowledge that important fact because they are concerned about running a campaign of political opportunism against Work Choices rather than engaging in the exercise of nation building that we are.
For the past decade, we have been engaged in the exercise of nation building and have seen more and more of our fellow Australians getting jobs and higher wages. What we are doing as a government is increasing and ramping that up even further so that more of our fellow Australians can get employment whilst being protected against unlawful dismissals. The reasons for unlawful dismissal include sex, race and sexual preference. Interestingly enough, I think one of the reasons it would be unlawful is if you happen to belong or not to belong to a particular trade union. But we know that is the offence that many people in the Labor Party get sacked for, because they happen to belong to the wrong trade union and therefore they are disendorsed. Just ask the deputy leader in this place, Senator Conroy, about the unfair dismissal attempts aimed at the member for Hotham and Mr Gavan O’Connor, the member for Corio—
—Former.
—You are quite right, Senator McGauran.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senators on my left, shouting across the chamber is disorderly.
—Mr Sercombe, the former member for Maribyrnong, was also disendorsed. Most interestingly, when the Labor Party introduced their unfair dismissal law experiment, do you know, Mr President, who the first parliamentarian was who fell foul of that law? Was it a coalition member or senator? No. They know who it was. It was none other than the then member for Bowman, Con Sciacca. What you have is the Labor Party preaching for political opportunism but not practising it themselves with their own staff or their own members and senators, who they regularly seek to disendorse simply because they happen to belong to the wrong trade union or the wrong faction.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-03-28,"—The reason it was another question was that he had to concede ground after I exposed his misrepresentation of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, and that is exactly what the Australian Labor Party do in this place and in public. They assert something. When they are knocked down, they know they can no longer stand their ground. Do you know what they do? They shift ground.
—Minister, I remind you of the supplementary question.
—In relation to the supplementary question, when they are debunked in relation to one scare campaign, they simply move to the next false assertion. That is exactly what those opposite did in relation to the goods and services tax. It was so evil, according to Mr Beazley, that he was going to roll it back. He now of course fully embraces it. I suggest to those opposite that they fully embrace Work Choices and save themselves the embarrassment. (Time expired)

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-03-28,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Ellison) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ludwig today relating to border protection and the unmanned tanker Jian Seng.
The answer from the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, was another miserable explanation for the appalling performance of his agency in relation to the ghost ship Jian Seng. I am indebted to Senator Ludwig because he really belled the cat on the incompetence of this minister and his agency in relation to border protection and, just as importantly, in relation to the protection of seafarers and fishermen who were in the area at the time where a vessel was uncontrolled and unlit—a navigation hazard at the very least—for about 17 days in Australian waters.
It has become clear that this vessel had been drifting aimlessly in the Gulf of Carpentaria for about 17 days. It was first known about by Coastwatch, apparently, and perhaps even earlier by the barge, on 8 March. The ship breached Australia’s porous borders sometime prior to that date. Its activities before that date are apparently not known, although the government concedes now that it was probably used as part of organised illegal fishing operations predating on the limited fishing stocks in Australian waters. It met no resistance from Australian authorities until 25 March. It certainly was a marine hazard. It was apparently unmanned, though we are not certain about that—we know that when it was boarded it was unmanned—it was certainly unlit and it was drifting aimlessly in the Gulf of Carpentaria. There are other vessels which sail in those waters—there are prawn trawlers, which work at night—and this vessel was unlit and a hazard to navigation.
It posed and possibly still poses unknown environmental and quarantine risks. I understand it has been refused admission to Weipa harbour and will be anchored outside of the harbour because of concerns of port authorities. It could have been carrying anything. It could have been carrying chemicals. It could have been carrying guns. It could have been carrying drugs. Did the department care? Apparently it did not care for 17 days. Here we have a government which, for its own purposes, knew that this is a vessel that it was not concerned about. It was not something it could use to put on the TV screens for Australians and make some more dog-whistle noises about protecting our borders. It was not concerned at all. It let it drift for 17 days. This was no Tampa ripe for exploitation, however. It was just a job that needed to be done—a job that the minister and his officers were not competent to do.
This is a vessel which the government now concedes was probably engaged in the dirty business of illegal fishing in Australian waters. Addressing that activity is obviously a low priority to this government. It is an activity the Howard government cannot or will not stamp out. As a result, Australian fishing stocks are being pillaged at unsustainable levels. For reasons unknown, the government took no action to arrest this vessel until it had been floating around in the gulf for 17 days. To use the language that the Prime Minister’s seal of approval has been given to, where the bloody hell was the government?
The attempt by the Minister for Justice and Customs to justify the government’s incompetence in this matter is absolutely breathtaking. He has now stonewalled Labor’s questions for two days. But the government cannot run away from its responsibility to explain its behaviour. It has some serious questions to answer: where did the vessel come from, what was it doing in Australian waters, who made the decision to let it drift free for 17 days, when was the Australian Maritime Safety Authority alerted to its existence, when were other seafarers warned of the hazard it posed, can the government explain how it plans to deal with the ship now and will it accept full responsibility for this fiasco or is it expecting the state of Queensland to take possession of the vessel and clean up the mess?
I am not surprised that the port of Weipa does not want the vessel there because, given the performance of this federal government, it is likely it would wash its hands of responsibility and say to the state government, ‘You’ve got it now; you deal with it.’ I am not surprised that the port of Weipa does not want the vessel in its harbour. I believe this government has a responsibility. It has failed to date. It has to pick up the challenge, deal with this vessel and get it out of Australian waters. As regards this ghost ship, what about Warren Truss? (Time expired)

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2006-03-28,"—These are matters of great moment before the Australian parliament as brought to us by the opposition. Here is an abandoned vessel floating quite harmlessly off the vast coast of northern Australia. For those of you who do not know, there are no shipping lanes in this area. It has been used by fishermen, but there are no shipping lanes. It is floating off the vast coast of Australia. A Customs Coastwatch helicopter reported the vessel at a very early point, around 8 March, as being derelict and with no apparent sign of life.
The opposition fails to understand that, in the practical operation of Coastwatch and the management of vessels in apprehending illegal fishermen, when you divert vessels to apprehend a vessel that is unmanned and floating harmlessly and aimlessly, you obviously leave a gap in the surveillance area. People who understand what happens on Australian patrol boats know that a patrol boat is deployed to apprehend illegal fishermen and then to deal with their boats. Whilst one goes and deals with a fishing vessel that is unmanned and floating, as I say, quite harmlessly, other areas are left exposed. What happened here, quite obviously—you do not need to be an Einstein to work it out—was that Coastwatch management rationalised the deployment of vessels as a matter of priority. The vessel has now of course been taken into tow and removed from the theatre, as it were.
I find it absolutely astounding that in the face of a whole lot of public interest matters occurring in Australia today this is the issue that the opposition would bring to question time—a vessel floating quite harmlessly in the vast oceans off the northern coast of Australia. What does that say about the political acumen of the opposition? The only policy that I can think of that the Labor Party has brought to the table in the last 10 years with respect to our northern coastline is that of a coastguard. The utter lack of understanding that the opposition brings to the table when it comes to the surveillance and management of the security of our northern shores never ceases to amaze me.
At one point the opposition actually suggested, and even to this day I find this one of the most remarkable pieces of political policy making in the history of the nation, that helicopters should be deployed with armed gunmen on board strapped to the side to shoot out the motors of illegal fishermen. This was actually opposition policy. Mr Deputy President, can your mind’s eye actually envisage this—a helicopter flying low over a manned foreign fishing vessel with a person strapped to the side firing live rounds into the vessel? I must say that goes down as the gold medal winner for the most reckless, impractical and ridiculous policy initiative I have ever heard. It was coastguard mark 3, if my memory serves me correctly. What does that tell me about the quality of the opposition’s nous, knowledge and ability when it comes to the protection of our northern shores? Obviously it is a very adverse reflection on their ability and capability.
Currently Australia is maintaining a very large force of patrol boats from Cairns to Broome. Indeed, I have had experience in the apprehension of seven Indonesian fishermen. These waters are vast, and the small wooden boats are not detectable on radar. This is a major problem for current apprehension techniques. When one does apprehend a foreign vessel inside our economic zone and our fishing grounds, communications have to go back to Canberra with respect to the processing of the apprehended individuals. I was fortunate enough to be on an Armidale class patrol boat that apprehended seven Indonesian fishermen. They were dealt with very efficiently and properly. Indeed, they seemed to quite enjoy the experience of getting off these very small boats. (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-03-28,"—It is interesting that this government talk about what we should not talk about. Let us talk about what they have failed miserably in—protecting our northern shores. If Senator Johnston wants to find out what they think, he should go up and talk to some of the fishermen in the northern parts of Australia. They think it is critical. They are worried and concerned that this government is not acting at all. That is the critical issue. Yes, Senator Johnston, we do need a national coastguard. That is a must. You fail to appreciate that this is a serious issue that is affecting our northern shores and needs to be taken seriously and addressed. This government is nothing but short and soft on border protection.
From Broome to Bamaga, there is a plague of plundering that threatens our national fish stocks and the sustainability of our large commercial fishing industry. It is a real threat of national significance, yet there is no doubt that illegal fishers do their prime damage to the families of those who work on Australian fishing fleets and in allied industries. That is where the real damage is done. But does this government seem to care? From what Senator Johnston said, it does not seem to care about it at all. Think about the environmental cost as well, in terms of the pillage that occurs. These pirates—because they are nothing else but pirates—who are stealing our fish do not respect quotas, size limits, laws on netting and by-catch, and so on, that we have put in place and that have made our commercial fishing industry a sustainable industry.
As well, think of the massive quarantine risk that can occur. These illegal fishers can land and are landing on the shores of our Australian mainland. Aboard these vessels are dogs, and animals for food such as chickens, pigs and goats. There are also plants and vegetable matter. But, instead of that, what Senator Ellison argues today and what Senator Johnston says is that the tanker was an unmanned vessel. You do not know that until you find out—until you actually go near it to see that it is unmanned. One of the first things that you would expect a good border protection agency to do is to not only say, ‘We’ve got some intelligence that there is a wandering 80-metre tanker,’ but to say who is on board, what is on board, what are they doing and where are they going—some basics that this government seems to have completely failed on getting right in this instance.
Of course, the risk is not only to our fish stocks; an obvious risk is also to our agricultural industries. If you think about it, if there is one chicken with the bird flu on board from Indonesia, you can say goodbye to both the chicken and the egg for Australia. There is a clear and present danger to both our economy and our environment. The Howard government’s response to this has been abysmal—even laughable. The problem is that the families of our commercial fishers are not laughing at all about this. They think it is very serious. They have raised it time and time again with their state governments; their state governments are doing as much as they can do about it. It requires a national response. This government is not meeting the challenge. The fishers and their families do not find it very funny that an 80-metre tanker can penetrate our so-called sophisticated border security, all the while unmanned and adrift.
We are all used to the fact that the system often cannot detect the smaller vessels that hide in mangroves and estuaries during the day to emerge only at night to continue their voracious attack on Australian fish stocks—that is one of the challenges that you have to meet—but it is truly pathetic if the system cannot detect an 80-metre tanker drifting in our waters on an erratic course dictated by wind and current. Far from being border control, this system has a hole that you could drive a tanker through. That seems to be what our border security system is now: it is that porous.
That is not the only outrage. My office has received details from the Queensland Gulf Fishermen’s Association of illegal fishers wandering ashore and even fishing upstream in the many rivers that empty into the Gulf of Carpentaria. We have all seen wells that have been dug in the Northern Territory and camps in Western Australia, and still this government maintains that it has an adequate border security system. It is just laughable.
The latest outrage is not illegal fishing but illegal hunting. There is hunting of our green sea turtles—an endangered species. These harmless creatures want nothing more than to be left alone but they typically end up being flipped on their backs and cut open along the seam where the top and bottom halves of their shell join while the creatures are still alive, and this government does nothing.

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2006-03-28,"—As a member of the government, I take exception to this being referred to as a laughing  matter. The government have demonstrated over many years that we take border protection and the protection of our fisheries in a very serious manner. To suggest that it is a laughing matter from this perspective is totally incorrect, and I reject that from Senator Ludwig in his address a moment ago.
I would like to take us back to when Senator O’Brien raised a few issues. He at least acknowledged that the vessel was not confirmed as being totally unmanned for the entire duration that it was in Australian waters. The Hansard will reflect that Senator O’Brien said: ‘We don’t know that. It was probably unmanned, but we do not know that.’ That is correct and that was correct at the time of the first sighting of that vessel. Senator O’Brien also indicated that the minister had stonewalled answers over the last two days. That is totally incorrect. Again, the Hansard will reflect that the minister has answered these questions adequately, honestly and in a manner that the Australian public would expect.
This minister, along with previous ministers, and also the policies of this government reflect that our concern is deep and very sincere and that we want to protect our borders. If we look at the record in recent years of border security in northern Australia, there has been very limited penetration. We are looking at a huge water mass—one of the largest water borders in the world—and we are doing a fantastic job with the conditions that we face and with the length of travel for vessels. The vessel was, after all, detected. It would be a different matter if it had come in and had gone. The vessel was detected and located and is now secure.
The other matter concerns the potential danger or threat. Senator Ludwig highlighted issues like animals, vegetables or other forms of contamination. The preliminary inspection of the vessel revealed that that was not the case. All necessary precautions were taken to ensure that, once the vessel was taken into our protection, Australia was not in any way compromised by way of biodiversity hazards or, in particular, any other forms of material that may infringe our particular quarantine standards.
Looking at the particular facts—and we must use facts, not speculation; some of the words that have been used have been a little bit alarming—they are that this vessel, after being discovered, was monitored and then taken into protective custody, if I can use that phrase for a vessel. This vessel has proven to be of no threat to Australia.
Yes, there will be gaps from time to time in any border security; in any border protection anywhere in the world there will have to be gaps. But I am very proud to be a member of a government that has addressed most, if not all, of the issues. This government is moving forward with a definitive policy to protect northern Australian borders and indeed all our fisheries. We have a combination of policies that complement each other, and those policies address all of the issues required to protect the northern parts of Australia and indeed other parts of our border.
The Australian Customs Service have acted extremely well in this and, together with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, took immediate action—not delayed action but immediate action—when the alert about the vessel was apparent. Also, Customs acted in such a way that they did not endanger any members of the service who went to apprehend that vessel. Their actions were undertaken in a very appropriate manner. In particular, the guiding of the vessel during the night-time hours after the authorities first intercepted that vessel, not boarding until daylight hours, was a very sensible measure, not a delayed measure.
This government is just superb in its handling of these matters and to suggest otherwise beggars belief. I just cannot understand how, when we have such a secure arrangement in northern Australia, the opposition can concentrate on an issue like this. It must be a matter of the opposition not being able to find attack points on the government on any other issue, so they pick something that is very minor but give it a sense of alarm by the language they use. This government is protecting Australia in every way, shape and form and will continue to do so. This government has a fine record in that regard.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>The Jian Seng</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,5,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-03-28,"—I also rise to take note of the answer given by the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, in question time today in relation to the ghost ship that has been drifting in the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Jian Seng. I have to say in response to the previous speaker in this chamber that this is not a superb example of how this government is handling the illegal fishing situation in this country. In fact, this is another example in a string of incidents in the last year or so of the total incompetence of this government.
I note that Minister Bailey is roaming around the world trying to defend the Tourism Australia slogan ‘where the bloody hell are you’. Let me tell you that people in the north of this country, particularly people in the Northern Territory, are wondering exactly where this government is. Where the bloody hell is this government when it comes to protecting our coastline, when it comes to protecting our fishing stocks and, today, when it comes to protecting our turtles? Today on the front page of the Northern Territory News there is a large headline and a graphic photograph of a group of illegal fishers dragging their net up an Australian beach which contains two green turtles, as my colleague Senator Ludwig mentioned before. So we have not only illegal fishing but also illegal hunting happening in the north of Australia, and the government is nowhere to be seen in terms of trying to tackle the situation.
Let us have a look at what we have here. We have a minister who says that an abandoned tanker floating in the Gulf of Carpentaria was actually doing nothing illegal. How would you know that? How do you know that unless you actually respond to a warning, get on board and find out exactly what is going on? We have a tanker that we believe was probably a resupply ship for foreign fishing boats, so the question is: was that the case? Was this in fact a boat that contained rice, other food supplies and stock to replenish the mother ship in an illegal fishing chain, one of many that are operating in the north of Australia? And, if that is the case, why don’t we know what it was doing? Why don’t we know where it came from? Why don’t we know what it was doing floating aimlessly around the Gulf of Carpentaria, only 40 kilometres from the coast? So much for this government’s claim that it is strong on border protection. What a joke. This government is extremely weak on border protection—very weak, in fact—and the holes in this particular policy position are slowly being uncovered, incident by incident.
The ship was in the zone for two weeks, nearly 17 days, before the authorities even intercepted it. Senator Ellison said yesterday that it was spotted by Coastwatch on 8 March. We now know that that was not true. It was actually spotted by a barge captain. So we now have barge companies in northern Australia playing the role of protectors and keepers of our coastline. A barge captain tips off this government that there is some ship floating around there in the Gulf of Carpentaria on 8 March; that was when Coastwatch were first alerted to this and first knew about it. But then it takes them until last Thursday or Friday to get out there and have a really good look at what this tanker or ship is supposed to be. Is it in fact the same vessel? We still do not know the answer to that. Is the vessel that the barge captain saw back in early March the same vessel that Coastwatch spotted last Friday and then bothered to board on Saturday?
The truth of the matter is that under this government our coastline is extremely vulnerable. The policy that this government has is not working. Authorities are unable to track illegal vessels. Last year alone, we had 13,000 illegal vessels sighted in Australian waters—and only 609 of those were apprehended or detained—let alone those that get right in close to our shores, in the mangroves and up the rivers, or, as in the case of this ship and its people, park on a beach near Milingimbi, actually slashing and killing turtles for their own game. So when is this government going to get serious about tackling the invasion of our coastline and the pilfering of our fishing stocks and step on board and do something about it? One hundred thousand dollars to the Amateur Fishermen’s Association of the Northern Territory might be a start, but it is a very meagre contribution to tackling this situation. The government needs to put together a policy that coordinates all of the agencies concerned—(Time expired)

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>The Jian Seng</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,5,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2006-03-28,"—The ABC is one of Australia’s most important national institutions. Millions of Australians across the length and breadth of this country rely on the ABC to keep them informed and entertained. It also has a vital role in developing Australian culture and our national identity. The ABC is a national asset that belongs to all Australians. It should not be a plaything of the government. It is no secret, however, that senior members of the Liberal Party take a very different view. Earlier this month the Bulletin catalogued the deep and abiding hatred that this government has towards the ABC. A senior Liberal was quoted as saying that the Chairman of the ABC, Mr Donald McDonald, is ‘hated and detested’ by most members of cabinet. By all accounts, his crime is that he believes that his role is to protect the integrity and independence of the ABC.
The last decade must have been difficult for Mr McDonald. Since 1996 the Howard government has been waging war on our national broadcaster in a determined effort to silence the ABC’s independent voice. The ABC has been starved of adequate funding. Last October, the ABC told Senate estimates that in real terms it has $51 million less per annum to make programs than it did when John Howard came to office. The former ABC managing director, Russell Balding, has warned that the ABC is ‘seriously under threat’ and has stated that he is concerned ‘about the ABC having the financial capacity to continue to develop, produce and deliver content’.
The funding cuts experienced by the ABC have had a real impact on the ABC’s ability to fulfil its charter obligations. The most obvious area to have suffered is the ABC’s production of Australian drama. Last year the ABC broadcast only 13 hours of locally produced drama. Five years ago it produced more than 100 hours. Inadequate funding is also stifling the ABC’s ability to fully exploit the possibilities of digital broadcasting. ABC2, the national broadcaster’s digital channel, runs on a budget of just over $2 million. As a consequence, little in the way of new content is available on ABC2 and the potential of the channel to drive digital take-up is not being realised.
The viewing public and the Australian production industry are being forced to pay the price for the Prime Minister’s ideological obsession with crushing the ABC. There are few signs that the May budget will bring the ABC any relief from the ideologically motivated funding squeeze that it is experiencing. During the 2004 election campaign the government promised to review the adequacy of the ABC’s funding and the efficiencies of its operations. This was an election commitment. Senator Coonan appointed KPMG to carry out this task. The minister has now received this report but she refuses to release it. She claims that the report is a budget input. There was no mention in the government’s election policy announcement that the report would be kept secret. Indeed, the context of the commitment was that the government would give the public an independent benchmark to assess the adequacy of the ABC’s funding.
Despite the minister’s moves to sweep the KPMG report under the carpet, it has been widely reported that the KPMG report found that the ABC is chronically underfunded and is efficient. This is a finding that would not surprise most reasonable observers. Senator Coonan should immediately release the KPMG report so that we can have a proper debate about the level of funding required to ensure that the ABC is the world-class public broadcaster that Australians deserve. The fact that the outcome of the review did not vindicate the government’s prejudices is no excuse for not releasing the report. Australians are entitled to ask what the government has got to hide. Taxpayers have paid $417,000 for this KPMG report. They are entitled to see its results and to make their own judgments. The Bulletin report on the ABC earlier this month shows a government that will not be diverted from its goal of destroying the ABC by the KPMG review. They will not let the facts get in the way of their blind prejudice. The Bulletin reported:
Despite some recent optimism, sources told The Bulletin that the ABC’s funding submission was doomed. Asked if there was a chance the ABC would receive more funding ... a reliable government source said flatly: “No. None.”
So we have this pretence of a public review, but the issue has already been prejudged. This is a government that is sitting on a massive budget surplus. Reports are of $14 billion worth of surplus. That is billion, not million. The government should invest some of this money to restore adequate funding to the ABC so that it is able to deliver the high-quality news and current affairs and the entertainment that Australians expect.
In recent weeks the government has made it clear that armed with its Senate majority it is about to launch a new offensive against the ABC. The minister told the Bulletin:
... it won’t be the same ABC it is today in a year’s time; we are in for some very exciting changes.
Well, we are now starting to see what these changes are going to be. They may be exciting for the ideological zealots in the Liberal Party, but they are cause for concern for all Australians who value a strong and independent ABC. The government has begun softening up the public for introduction of advertising on the ABC. The minister went on radio and misled the Australian public, stating that the introduction of advertising was a matter for the ABC board to consider. The minister should have been aware that this is not the case. Section 31 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act states clearly:
The Corporation shall not broadcast advertisements.
It is black and white in the legislation. It is not a matter for the board, Minister; it is the law.
At the last election, the government promised to maintain this prohibition. It was a government election commitment: ‘We will not put advertising on the ABC.’ Do not worry about your election commitments! Despite this the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have called for the matter to be examined. The government should immediately make clear whether it intends to honour its election commitment or not. Let me be clear about this: Labor is completely opposed to any move to introduce advertising on the ABC. Advertising would take the ABC down the American road, where public broadcasters have to beg for corporate sponsorship to remain viable. Advertising would undermine the ABC’s editorial independence, which has been built up over 70 years. ABC program makers must be free to take on powerful vested interests. Current affairs producers should not have to worry about offending the sponsors of the 7.30 Report.
The introduction of advertising would mean that decisions about what programs are broadcast would be dictated by needs of advertisers rather than the ABC’s charter. In such an environment, programming decisions are likely to become more conservative and less innovative. Government members like Senator Humphries have been championing advertising as the solution to the ABC’s funding crisis. A few weeks ago he said:
… the fact is the ABC needs the money and could make great things happen with that money, such as restoring services in regional Australia…
He went on:
We can sit back and wait for the wonderful day when money comes from government but it’s unlikely to happen in sufficient quantities into the future.
The fact is that advertising will not save the ABC; it will destroy it. If Senator Humphries is really interested in strengthening the ABC he should start lobbying his colleague the Treasurer to stop the funding squeeze.
The latest instalment in the government’s attempt to undermine the independence of the ABC was the minister’s announcement last week of a plan to restructure the ABC board. The announced restructure consists of just one measure: the abolition of the position of the staff-elected director. For 10 years the government has tried to stack the ABC board with its political mates to try to control the ABC. People like Michael Kroger, Ron Brunton and Janet Albrechtsen have been dispatched to the board with orders to bring the ABC to heel. There is a clear conservative bias amongst the current board. This bias has undermined the confidence of many Australians in the independence of the ABC. The staff-elected position is the one appointment that the Prime Minister cannot control. That is why it has been targeted for termination.
Under the current arrangements, the staff-elected director makes an important contribution to the ABC’s corporate governance. The staff-elected director is able to give the board an important insight into ABC operations. Particularly with the current board, they are sometimes the only person with the expertise to question the advice coming from the ABC’s executive. The Prime Minister is not appointing mates who understand anything about public broadcasting; he is just appointing his ideological mates. They have not got a clue about public broadcasting. The elected representative on the ABC board is the only person with, in many instances over the last 10 years, any experience or understanding of public broadcasting.
It is not just the Labor Party that has complained about this. In 2001 government senators unanimously—and I am willing to bet, Senator Eggleston, you were one of them—endorsed a Senate committee recommendation to retain the staff-elected director’s position. Nothing has changed except that the government now has a Senate majority. This is an arrogant, out of control government that is determined to undermine one of our most important national institutions. If the government was really serious about improving the ABC’s corporate governance it would end the practice of stacking the board with coalition cronies.
Since 2003, Labor has argued that there should be an open and transparent process for making appointments to the ABC board. Vacancies should be advertised and there should be clear merit based selection criteria. Labor’s policy provides for an independent selection panel to undertake a proper shortlist selection process. Most importantly, the selection of the shortlist would be independent of the minister. If the minister does not appoint a short-listed candidate he or she will have to table in parliament a formal statement of the reasons for departing from the short list. Labor’s policy will enhance our democracy by making the ABC independent of government. It will foster an environment where the ABC can be fearless in its approach to news and current affairs and critical of both sides of politics whenever necessary. These are the changes Labor will be arguing for when the government introduces its bill into the parliament.
It is about time this government realised that the overwhelming majority of Australians do not share their warped views about the ABC. According to research conducted by Newspoll, 82 per cent of people believe that the ABC is balanced and even handed when reporting news and current affairs; 84 per cent regard the ABC as distinctively Australian and contributing to Australia’s national identity; 80 per cent believe that ABC TV provides quality programming; 70 per cent believe that the ABC is efficient and well managed; and 90 per of the public value the ABC and its services to the community.
Just today, the Treasurer received a petition organised by the community organisation GetUp and endorsed by 42,000 Australians, calling on the government to properly fund the ABC. This is an extraordinary figure considering the petition was only launched last Thursday. Nobody would pretend that the ABC is perfect. Like any media organisation, the ABC makes mistakes.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2006-03-28,"—Senator Conroy failed to make his case in any way whatsoever that the Howard government is seeking to undermine the ABC. In fact, the Howard government is a very strong supporter of the ABC and recognises the value of its services to the community. Amongst a significant section of the population, the national broadcaster is regarded as a cherished institution. This is particularly so in rural and regional areas. It is cherished for its commitment to local news and current affairs, the quality of its news services and the general quality of its programs, particularly in country areas but also throughout this country.
This government, like its predecessors, is committed to a vibrant and independent ABC. The government has no intention of compromising this independence. Indeed, the editorial independence of the ABC is guaranteed by the ABC Act, which is something that Senator Conroy seems to have overlooked. Its fact sheet, ‘The ABC’s charter, independence and accountability’, states:
By law and convention, neither the Government nor Parliament seeks to intervene in editorial and program decisions.
The ABC Act explicitly states:
Except as provided by this section—
relating to the minister’s power to direct the broadcast of matters in the national interest—
or as expressly provided by a provision of another Act, the Corporation is not subject to direction by or on behalf of the Government of the Commonwealth.
The ABC Act charges the board of the national broadcaster with the duty of ‘maintaining the independence and integrity of the corporation’. With public funding, however, come certain obligations. Just as with any other media organisation, the government does not expect nor does it demand favourable reporting from the ABC. Nevertheless, it does expect—and it is by no means an unreasonable expectation in the context of the very significant public funding that the organisation receives—the ABC to take a fair, balanced and objective approach to its news and current affairs coverage.
In order for the ABC to meet its functions and duties under its charter, since 1997 the government has maintained its funding in real terms; whereas, by way of contrast, when Labor was last in office it continually reduced the ABC’s funding, and the ABC’s current levels of funding exceed those it had under the Labor government prior to the 1996 election. In 2005-06, the ABC will receive funding of $792.1 million, and during the 2003-06 triennium it will receive almost $2.3 billion from the Commonwealth government. In the 2004-05 budget, $4.2 million per year was also directed to the ABC in ongoing and indexed funding in order to help it meet the increasing costs of purchasing television programs.
In 2004-05, the government announced an additional $54.4 million for the ABC’s regional and local programming initiative, on top of the $71.2 million provided to the ABC in the 2001-02 budget for the National Interest Initiatives program. To assist both the ABC and the SBS to meet the additional costs associated with digital broadcasting, the coalition is continuing to deliver on its commitment to fully fund their digital transmission and distribution expenses, at a cost of over $1 billion.
Labor failed to provide the ABC with additional funding for local and regional programming. Sitting here listening to Senator Conroy one could be forgiven for thinking that this government does not have regard for the ABC. The fact is that this government has funded the significant expansion of ABC television and radio services so that more Australians have access to the ABC then ever before—hardly the actions of a government antagonistic to the ABC.
The government made an election commitment for a funding adequacy and efficiency review, following a request from the ABC board. KPMG Australia has conducted this review and its results will be considered by the government in the context of future decisions relating to the funding of the ABC. The minister has consistently stated that the ABC will not lose funding as a result of this process.
Turning to the recent announcement in relation to the restructuring of the ABC board, it certainly should not be characterised as an attack on the independence of the ABC. The decision to abolish the staff-elected director position on the ABC board represents an initiative to improve the national broadcaster’s corporate governance. The government believes that the concept of a board director elected by a particular group is an anachronism that does not accord with modern requirements for corporate governance, and is certainly not common on other Commonwealth government agency boards.
The position of a staff-elected director on the ABC board creates undue uncertainty about accountability when you bear in mind that directors are required to act in the best interests of the ABC as a whole, not just in the interests of a particular constituency. There is an inherent conflict of interest between the clear legal duty of a director to act in good faith and in the interests of the ABC, and being elected by staff who may primarily expect the staff-elected director to represent their interests rather than the interests of the ABC as a whole.
On a practical level, this has led to difficulties in respect of board confidentiality and lack of commitment to a revised board protocol that deals with handling of confidential information. The difficulties arising out of the staff-elected director position have previously been raised by departing board members and in 2004 led to the resignation from the board of Mr Maurice Newman. The abolition of the position certainly does not mean that the board and management of the ABC will not take employee interests into account, but there are ways of doing this without having a specific staff-elected position on the board. In particular, the Managing Director of the ABC, who is a full member of the board, is more than capable of making employee interests known to the board.
The government does not support advertising on the ABC in the 2006-09 triennium. It will be up to the ABC board in the future to consider whether to approach the government about advertising on the ABC, and the government would need to be persuaded to make the necessary legislative amendments that would permit this. In doing this, the government would need to consider if advertising would be consistent with the ABC’s charter, as well as its impact on commercial broadcasters. I have to say that I do not think Senator Conroy has made his case at all that the Howard government has sought to undermine the ABC. To the contrary, I think the case has been made that the government has consistently supported the ABC and will continue to do so in recognition of the great service it provides to the Australian community.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,18,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-03-28,"—We need to turn our minds back to the reason the ABC was established in the first place. It was established for two prime reasons. The first was that the commercial media could not be relied on to make the full and proper investment that was necessary to deliver services to much of Australia. That is still a problem today, despite the improvement in technology. The second reason, of course, was to ensure, as far as possible, that there was an independent voice which was not governed by commercial imperatives and which would not carry on the biased and somewhat superficial approach to news and current affairs that was and is a characteristic of some of the commercial media.
The ABC is not just an important part of our telecommunications and media network—the information gathering and disseminating network—it is a very important social and political counterpoint to the big business attitudes that often determine how our main commercial media report. It is therefore an important part of our democracy. The ABC provides a lifeline to, in particular, regional Australia, with informed current affairs reporting, vital contributions to Australian culture and the provision of Australian content. It also makes a contribution to a proud Australian nationalism and the expression of the Australian character.
However, ABC operational funding has declined by 30 per cent since 1985-86 under both Labor and coalition governments. In 1996, the coalition cut funding by 12 per cent. This has never been restored. ABC funding has been cut far more in relative terms than any other major area of government expenditure. The ABC is finding it difficult to maintain core services like news and current affairs at the level and to the depth required. Cheaper programs therefore end up replacing quality and more expensive, long-term programs. Australian content ends up falling and repeats become increasingly common. Those sorts of results directly attack the ABC charter and its basis of operation.
Many Australians are concerned that current affairs shows such as Four Corners and iconic children’s programs such as Play School might go without adequate funding. Already the ABC production of local drama has fallen from 102 hours in 2001 to just 20 hours in 2005 as a result of underfunding. A recent KPMG audit of the ABC, commissioned by the government, has found that the ABC is efficient but severely underfunded. Rather than spend a small part of the estimated $14 billion surplus on adequately funding the ABC and providing a service that Australians do value, the government is talking about allowing advertising on the ABC—not in the immediate future but in the long-term future. That would be a mistake because it would introduce commercial imperatives and suppress a fully independent operation. That is a government view which should not prevail in the future. Public funding means that the ABC does not have the commercial pressures of other broadcasters, allowing the ABC to provide diverse programming and maintain independence and journalistic integrity without fear or favour. The ABC should not be in the business of selling junk food to kids or motor cars to adults.
Last Thursday, GetUp and the MEAA launched a petition calling on the Treasurer and finance minister to grant the moderate funding requested by the ABC in their triennial budget submission. They set a target of 10,000 signatures. Within 12 hours they smashed their target, and within four working days they had received 41,270 signatures. The overwhelming response to the petition demonstrates the sense in the community—ordinary Australians—of how committed people are to this cherished institution and to it remaining independent and well funded. We are also concerned about Minister Coonan’s decision to remove the staff elected ABC board member. We think this decision is bad politics, bad public policy and bad corporate governance.

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2006-03-28,"—I rise to speak about a matter of public importance which affects one of the great public institutions of Australia—the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the ABC, the people’s ABC. It is now an endangered species and has been since the election of the Howard government. The ABC as we have known it is moving closer and closer towards extinction in the hands of this government. Since 1996, the government has starved the national broadcaster of funding. In real terms today, the ABC has $51 million less for making programs than it did when the Howard government came to office. The ABC is so starved of funds that it now rates as the second most underfunded public broadcaster in the OECD. Despite this, the ABC provides two television stations, four national and 60 local radio stations, two digital radio stations, ABC Online and Radio Australia—all of these public broadcasting activities on a budget about two-thirds of the average Australian commercial television network.
On 2003-04 numbers, the ABC’s annual budget for television alone is less than a third of Channel Nine’s, 40 per cent of Seven’s and 58 per cent of Ten’s. These figures speak volumes about the desperate situation facing the ABC today. The filtration effect on programming is startling. In recent years, the development of first-run Australian drama has dropped from 103 hours to just 13. Last year, the Australian content on the ABC was around 43 hours—nowhere near the 200 hour mark which is the obligation of television broadcasters in Australia. There would no doubt be people in this country who have been listening to and watching the ABC for over 70 years. When the programming slips to such critical levels, people notice. People notice these things. Those who work at the ABC notice these changes too. Given the seriousness of these facts, it would come as no surprise that even the members of the board are very concerned about this issue.
In the board of directors’ statement in the ABC’s annual report of 2005 under the ‘financial sustainability’ heading it reads:
A growing gap now exists between the funding provided and that which is needed to maximise the potential of ABC programs ... in the new digital environment.
It goes on to say in the closing section of the board’s statement:
A critical point has been reached. Unless adequate funding is secured for the coming triennium, the Board will be faced with a range of fundamental questions about the extent and quality of ABC programming and services.
The board’s statement almost reads like an extract from what we could have expected from Burke and Wills’ diary: ‘Save us, and save us now, before it is too late!’ Last year the minister was generous enough to throw a small lifeline to the ABC when she commissioned KPMG to investigate and review funding adequacy and efficiency at the ABC. So the minister is obviously conscious of the problem. We now hear that the report did not exactly tell the minister what she wanted to hear. And, though the minister has had the report for some weeks, it still has not been released. I ask the government: when will you be prepared to release the report, or does the minister intend sitting on the report indefinitely?
Given the $417,000 of taxpayers’ money that the KPMG report cost, we can only presume that the government intends to use its findings in conjunction with the ABC’s submission in the May budget. This is the opportunity for the government to restore adequate funding to the ABC so that our ABC is able to deliver the high-quality news, current affairs and entertainment that the Australian public not only expect but deserve. The Australian public will be waiting for the outcome of that May budget.
It would, however, be unfair to suggest that the Howard government and Senator Coonan have not brainstormed some solutions to the funding crisis of the ABC. I refer to an interview in the Bulletin where Minister Coonan said she was considering including commercial advertising. The minister said when asked about advertising on the ABC:
... these are some of the things that I mean the board might like to look at—as to just what they want to do with advertising, what they want to do about commercialising ...
I would like to now refer you to the ABC Act, where in section 31 it states, ‘The corporation shall not broadcast advertisements.’ This suggestion that the board consider a change, which is clearly contradictory to the act, must be of concern to the Australian public.
At the last election the government promised to maintain its position on advertising prohibition for our national broadcaster. Is the Howard government going to honour this election promise, or is it a case of ‘Senate majority so we’ll push this one through too’? That is the first thing I would say about advertising. The second is, and this should be pretty obvious, the ABC has built its reputation as a unique, innovative, independent and diverse broadcaster largely due to the absence of commercial influence. Diversity and independence of institutions such as the ABC are critical elements in maintaining our culture, in maintaining our traditions and in showing newcomers to our land about the great features that make us a great society.
The ABC also has a significant role in observing the operation of government and reporting on this to the Australian public. This is an essential part of the main democratic principles that built our society. Without doubt, advertising on the ABC would eventually compromise its editorial independence. The mums and dads are already asking questions about what it would mean for ABC children’s television. How long would it be before we would find advertising sneaking into children’s programming? Our ABC with Coke and McDonald’s interrupting Play School and Bananas in Pyjamas every 10 minutes—not our ABC, Minister!
Only last Friday, the minister announced another move by the government to impose its influence on our ABC. Senator Coonan announced during the Commonwealth Games that the Howard government intended to abolish the position of staff-elected director on the board of the ABC. This position gives the staff at the ABC a presence within the board’s corporate governance. This position of staff-elected director gives the ABC board a vital insight into the operations of the day-to-day employees. Interestingly enough, in the 2001 report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee entitled Methods of appointment to the ABC board, in response to a recommendation, government senators stated:
There has been no suggestion that the position of the staff-elected director will be abolished.
Now the government have changed their mind. It changed with the Senate majority. And, let us be clear, this is the one position left on the ABC board that the government cannot control. So if you cannot control it, what do you do if you are the Howard government? Answer: you get rid of it.
Labor believes that there should be an open and transparent process for making appointments to the ABC board. At the present time, the staff-elected position is the one position that fulfils this criterion. Today, Sydney performer and Alliance New South Wales secretary Penny Cook presented the minister with a 40,000-person petition seeking greater funding for the ABC. So great is the support from the public for increased funding for the ABC that it took only four days to acquire this significant response.
There is no doubt that community support for the ABC exists. Senator Eggleston told us that the ABC’s independence is guaranteed by the act. This is a fact. I have already stated the act also prohibits broadcast advertisements, but Senator Coonan has cast serious doubt on this continuing to be the case. Adequate funding would enable the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to deliver sufficient first-release Australian television drama, documentaries and children’s programming.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2006-03-28,"—I will just make an initial remark on some of the comments from the other side: again we are seeing an example of the Australian Labor Party bowing to their political masters. But I am not going to spend the next eight minutes confirming what is an obvious fact.
I read with interest today the editorial from the Age. It said, talking about the ABC:
It must be free to scrutinise critically government and civil society. It must be able to produce drama that expresses Australian life and should be able to cater for a broader range of interests than is covered by commercial networks.
Those are sentiments that I do not disagree with, but the words that I think should be in that editorial are ‘objectivity’ and ‘without bias’.
I noted with some interest comments from Senator Conroy in relation to people’s views of the ABC. I thought I would quickly advise the Senate of the obvious bias that is involved in the ABC—a matter that I have raised at Senate estimates before. It is clearly an ingrained and systemic problem at the ABC. Exemplifying this are the views of a former ABC TV Four Corners producer who, in a letter to the Age newspaper recently, wrote:
It is necessary and essential for the ABC to always be left of centre—whichever government is in power.
Those are undoubtedly views held by those within the ABC.
But I thought it would be of more interest, in the limited time available to me, to talk about a recent publication of the Melbourne University Press which included an independent study by the RMIT, Roy Morgan and the Reader on how journalists view the Australian media in terms of bias. In answer to the question ‘Which media outlet is the most biased?’ 25 per cent nominated the ABC. Twenty-five per cent of Australian journalists think that the ABC is the most biased media outlet in Australia, and, as a whole, Australian journalists rate the ABC as the second most biased media outlet.
The real issue today is about corporate governance and whether the Australian Labor Party is prepared to admit that the ABC should accept, as every other organisation and company throughout this country has accepted—quite rightly in my view and, I assume, in that of the Australian Labor Party—that good corporate governance underpins any organisation, whether it be a state owned organisation such as the ABC or whether it be a publicly listed or private company. Under this government, this country has insisted that we as a nation have appropriate corporate governance requirements, and a lot of this has come through the CLERP legislation. In fact we are now emphatic about it and, in my view, quite rightly so. It is not good corporate governance to argue that you should have a director on the ABC board who is representing sectional interests only. It is not appropriate and, under legislation passed by both chambers, that has been confirmed.
I am sure that one of my colleagues referred to the Uhrig review of 2003, which dealt with the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders and concluded:
… representational appointments can fail to produce … objective views. There is the potential for these appointments to be primarily concerned with the interests of those they represent, rather than the success of the entity they are responsible for governing.
Regrettably there is no greater example of that than one of the now retiring board members of the ABC who refused to sign a confidentiality agreement. Under the laws of this land, that particular board member actually had no choice about whether they maintained the confidentiality of the board. That was not an option. They were required to. What had happened was that this particular board member—who, quite frankly, I think had probably exposed herself to other matters—went out and breached board confidentiality, acknowledged the fact and refused point blank to tell that board that she would in the future maintain that confidentiality.
That is what corporate governance surely is about. Presumably—I do not know; I was not in the Senate at that stage—all the corporate governance legislation and the CLERP legislation under which some of it falls was supported by the Australian Labor Party. Are they turning around and telling us today that it is appropriate everywhere else except the ABC—that the ABC is quarantined from good corporate governance? That seriously cannot be the argument, but that is what it is. In a passionate desire to again support those who support them financially, they are prepared to throw out any requirements for good corporate governance, to support the ABC unions.
—You’re just making this up.
—If that is where you want to go, why don’t you just acknowledge it? Why do you think Maurice Newman resigned from the board? Maurice Newman resigned from the board because Maurice Newman could not be satisfied and was not confident that the matters that were discussed at that board would remain within that board.
I rather suspect there would be very few on the other side of the chamber who have actually sat on the board of a publicly listed company. I have. I sat on the corporate governance subcommittee of that company and I saw first hand, month after month, the corporate governance requirements of that publicly listed company.
—Which one was it?
—It was Berklee mufflers in Ballarat. That is on the public record and there are a lot of photos of me in directors’ reports, so I am not hiding anything. I was on that corporate governance committee and I can tell you now that the corporate governance requirements for that company and for companies throughout this country do not entitle you to have a sectional interest representative. It begs the question: if it is so important for the ABC, why wasn’t it so important for SBS? Why didn’t you insist on it with SBS? (Time expired)

"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-03-28,"—I rise today to support the motion moved by Senator Conroy concerning the independence of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. For all the shouting of Senator Ronaldson I hardly think someone with broadcast experience being on the board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation can be described as a sectional interest. It is a novel idea that the only person left on the board with broadcasting experience should be determined to be a person with a sectional interest.
It is very clear that under this government—under the Howard government—the ABC has been seen as one of the last stalwarts of our democracy. That is because the ABC does reflect some sort of critical assessment of our democracy and civil society, and for that crime—for being a bulwark for public service values, for being a bulwark for the community and for the values that Australia holds dear: freedom of speech, independent opinion, fairness, tolerance and justice—it is deemed to be biased. It is because the Howard government regards the ABC as being biased—because it does not share the values of the Howard government—that there has been this attack on the ABC and the removal of the staff representative from the board.
This has been a systemic attack since the Howard government came to power, beginning with reducing funding which has meant that there has been a retreat from the regions. We have lost the capacity for the ABC to broadcast news from the regions, especially at weekends. There has been a move which has resulted in the reduction of hours of Australian drama on the ABC, and the reduction in funding has meant the removal of the last independent person on the board. This will make way for the government to introduce advertising to the ABC which, in turn, will lead to the advertising and promotion of junk food, big car advertisements and all the advertisements of corporate Australia, which will undermine the capacity of the ABC to do its job, which is, in fact, to provide some independent journalism in Australia.
The abhorrent thing with the Howard government is that the very people who stand with the flag, who wear the wattle and who swear that they are the one and true upholders of the nation are the ones who have systemically undermined the independence and the traditions of every single institution from the judiciary through to the ABC. That is precisely what is going on here with this government attack on the ABC. We all know that in the new digital environment the capacity to broadcast and multichannel is going to be very expensive and so, by giving the ABC the right to do it and then taking away the funding capacity to do it, this is the Howard government’s way of undermining the capacity of the ABC to cover the media landscape that is required to give effect to its charter—to inform the country and be a national broadcaster for all Australians.
The ABC is our ABC. It belongs to the people. It does not belong to the Howard government but worse still, it does not belong to the radical philosophy of the Howard government which has led to this huge gap between the rich and the poor in this country, which has seen a bias in favour of privatisation and individualism, a loss of interest in the public interest and of acting in the public interest. The ABC acts in the public interest. The independent board member—the staff representative—should remain on that board and the government should desist from badgering and intimidating people associated with the ABC and accusing them of bias.
If there is a bias in this country it is the bias that the Howard government brings to all our national institutions and undermines our strength in terms of freedom of speech and freedom of association in this country. I want the ABC to stay independent. I want it to stay as our national broadcaster reflecting this whole country and not be forced into commercial advertising like other commercial television in this country. I want it to be what the Australian community wants it to be, and that is the voice of Australia, not the voice of the narrow values of the Howard government.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,18,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2006-03-28,"—I must say I have been absolutely astonished by some of the submissions from the other side and from the crossbenches. I understand that they are trying to make the argument that this government is continuing its attempts to undermine the independence of the ABC. We have had phrases like ‘deep and abiding hatred,’ and ‘Donald McDonald is hated by cabinet’. A federal cabinet minister, Amanda Vanstone, was sitting right here and she said, ‘Not by me.’ Of course there is no evidence to support this. This is just conjecture—the normal rubbish of those people who are just trying to wage some pathetic, desperate attempt to undermine the Howard government’s excellent record in most areas.
People talk generally about significant taxpayer funding. I remind this place that in the triennium 2003-06, $2.3 billion was provided, and $793 million was provided this year. We provided an extra $4.2 million over and above what we extended—a bonus. We have assisted the ABC in every way, particularly with the increase in program purchasing funding which actually went up to $54 million over the last three years. It is ironic that those on the other side should stand in this place and somehow make the tie between removing the independence of the ABC and a lack of funding. The single largest drop in the funding for the ABC was in the late eighties and nineties and that happened under Labor.
I would have to concede that, if you look closely at the history, in 1996 there was a drop in funding for the ABC under this government—as there was across every single agency to try to deal effectively with the black hole, economically, that was left by the Labor government. I concede that. But from that point, historically, the funding for the ABC has continued to grow and in fact, right at the moment, it enjoys a level that it never enjoyed under the Labor Party.
We talked about a review. People have been spinning these reviews around the place here today. We have had a review. We constantly review particularly the efficiency and adequacy of funding. It is interesting to note statements about independence. We actually ensured that the terms of reference were drafted in consultation with the ABC. We ensured that we consulted with this particular broadcaster and that the terms of reference were what they considered appropriate to consider the adequacy and efficiency of that funding. We engaged an external consultant from KPMG. Again, we have propriety, transparency and facts rather than silly and fatuous conjecture from the other side.
—It’s secret! When are we going to see it?
—The review will be announced in time. Of course, this will take into account ABC’s 2006-07 funding. Those on the other side may notice the date—it is not around the time that one would normally make those announcements, which is towards the end of June, but watch this space. The minister has said time and time again—and he has proved to be correct—and, since 1996, this government has said time and time again that the ABC will not lose funding.
We have from the other side this very poor argument, I have to say, that somehow getting rid of a staff-elected director undermines the independence of the ABC. There have been a number of independent reviews. We have already heard about the Uhrig review from my colleague Senator Ronaldson. I will quote from it. This is an independent review about good governance. It says:
... representational appointments can fail to produce ... objective views. There is the potential for these appointments to be primarily concerned with the interests of those they represent, rather than the success of the entity they are responsible for governing.
I have no problems with that at all. In fact, I can see the difficulty. If I were elected to represent the staff, that is what I should be doing there. Clearly, there would be a conflict of interest. If I were elected to represent the staff of the ABC, my view would be that I should represent their interests and not those of the body I should be representing—that is, the entire board of the ABC. That is why we have such governance arrangements in place. We can ensure that this conflict of interest cannot continue.
Of course, in that environment we had people like Maurice Newman. Mr Newman has resigned. Mr Newman, I would have thought, had a fair bit of credibility in terms of good corporate governance. At the time I understand that he was chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange. That is not something that you would say was just a small organisation which turned over the odd buck. You would have to be very cognisant of the propriety of those processes. Of course, he had to resign simply because he will not be associated with an organisation that cannot show that transparency and good governance. He has a reputation to uphold. So he got out. I can tell you now and I can advise those on the other side that you cannot come by people of that calibre every day. People on the other side are saying that somehow someone of that calibre is a government crony or someone we ring in. Decrying the good name of those sorts of people does neither them nor the people they accuse of poor behaviour any good.
This whole notion that you actually need an elected board member is just absolute nonsense. The managing director of the ABC is the managing director. We have had Senator Conroy on the other side say that the elected director is the only person who can have any clue about broadcasting or the ABC and how it runs. Of course, the facts of the matter are deliberately ignored. I think this is completely misleading. On the ABC board in fact we do have the managing director. The managing director has full knowledge of those matters. He is always a conduit between staff, management and the board.
I think that this line of debate, which has somehow tried to put forward this notion that the government has undermined the independence of the ABC, has fallen absolutely flat on its face. We have ensured that we have maintained the independence of the ABC by ensuring that there are no sectoral interests there to control it. Those people who are on that board are not there to look after the interests of a sectoral group. They are paid by the Australian people to look after their interests and that is what they should do. In terms of the commercialisation of the ABC, all I would say is that you should not look to this side; you should look to history. The Labor Party is on very shaky ground. In 1991, with the SBS Act, they were the ones to introduce limited advertising on SBS.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-03-28,"—As chair of the committee, I present the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee entitled Living with salinity—a report on progress: the extent and economic impact of salinity in Australia, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Firstly, I would like to note that this report is the result of a motion agreed to by the Senate on 17 March last year, so it is just over one year ago. In that period of time, there has been a significant amount of change in the membership of the committee. That has meant that more senators have had experience and had their eyes opened to the issues of salinity and the ongoing issues that need to be addressed. It has also created extra challenges for the secretariat in ensuring the continuity of understanding of the issues raised. I would particularly like to thank the workers in the secretariat, as always, for their professionalism and their ability in getting this report together. I would also like to note the work of the senators who came along, particularly in the second half of the inquiry, and really pulled together a lot of information from submissions and public hearings. It is important to emphasise up-front that this is a unanimous inquiry. The point is made from time to time by government ministers in dismissing reports that they are partisan, that they are point-scoring and that they are just seeking to take political advantage. I hope that there is genuine seriousness from the government in absorbing this report and responding promptly and positively to the recommendations within it, because it is unanimous.
The committee consisted not just of me as a Democrat in the chair but also of Labor, Liberal and Greens senators all working together to try to produce a strong report that will build on the positive work that has been done in this area to date. I believe we have done that. I would like to thank the other senators involved in the committee, particularly the deputy chair, Liberal Senator Judith Adams, a Western Australian from the wheatbelt who therefore knows a lot about salinity, at least how it affects wheat growers in Western Australia. We had the opportunity to inspect part of that region. I would also like to extend the thanks of the committee to all those who helped in the field visits and organising hearings, because that certainly contributed to the value of the experience. One of the things that became clear to me and the committee over the course of the inquiry was that the nature of salinity and the ways to address it vary significantly from region to region and that the ability to tailor research and solutions to different regions is something we need to do better.
If I had to summarise in my own words or give a very brief snapshot of progress in dealing with salinity I would say: we are doing okay but we can certainly do better. We need to get more value from the dollars that are spent. We need to get more certainty about that funding and continuity of funding. We need better coordination of the research, better sharing of the knowledge and the ability to apply it in different ways at the regional level. We also need to do more to ensure we do not keep maintaining some of the behaviours that are exacerbating the problem. The report is titled Living with salinity precisely because we need to acknowledge more clearly that salinity is part of the Australian environment and something that we have to learn to live with much better than we have. There has been improvement but there is room for more. One thing I believe we certainly have to do is to not keep repeating the mistakes of the past.
The committee has produced 23 recommendations aimed at ensuring that further strong progress is made in addressing the economic and environmental consequences of salinity. One of those recommendations is to seek greater assurance, through the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council, that the states and territories are doing better at effectively regulating land clearing and that extensions to the national action plan funding be conditional on the states and territories meeting more rigorous accountability measures in this and other areas. There is no point in taxpayers putting up significant amounts of money or, for that matter, industries or local councils or in everybody contributing their voluntary labour to try and address the issue of salinity if people are allowed to continue the sorts of behaviours that keep maintaining the problem.
This also applies to another area where the committee believes more attention is needed than has occurred to date, and that is the issue of urban salinity. The committee has described urban salinity as ‘a sleeping giant’ in the title of the chapter relating to that issue, or a potential sleeping giant—there is a question mark in the title: ‘Urban salinity: a sleeping giant?’ It is clear that the programs that have been developed to date, whilst mentioning urban salinity, do not give it sufficient priority. Perhaps more importantly, it is also clear that many authorities are simply not aware of or not fully informed of the issues of urban salinity, some of the reasons behind it and the enormous costs that it can cause. This is something we need to do more about now, for the reason I have just mentioned—that we do not want to be putting money into addressing salinity if activities are still occurring that exacerbate the problem.
We have recommended that the very effective salinity mapping that has been occurring in recent times needs to be conducted in areas where salinity is known to be a potential hazard before further urban development is approved in those areas. Decisions made today will affect the next generation. The cost of repairing the damage from urban salinity, whether it is to housing or, more immediately, to infrastructure such as roads, pipes and other underground and aboveground infrastructure, can be quite enormous. It is a cost that will be borne by the next generation—by local councils and state and federal governments in 20 or 30 years time, by the taxpayer and the public more broadly—if decisions are allowed to be made today that ignore those potential consequences. That is a key area where more action is needed.
In all the recommendations by the committee there is no suggestion that this is all brand new, that we have discovered all this for ourselves or that nothing has happened to date. The report is specifically and deliberately called A report on progress. Under its terms of reference the inquiry was set up to look at progress made to date, including what had happened since the House of Representatives committee inquiry into this area in 2004. There has been progress, but there certainly needs to be improvement.
The other areas that the committee emphasised included the need to extend funding for the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and the Natural Heritage Trust to ensure that people can do the long-term planning that is needed. As with many areas, this is as much about government’s role of enabling the community to address the problems. They can best do that, because in the end it will be up to the community—whether it is agricultural producers, local government authorities, landholders or the community more widely—to address this issue and to do the work that needs to be done. The role of government is to provide the resources, to ensure that coordination occurs effectively and to assist people to be able to do that. Something that needs to be done in that area is to ensure continuity, certainty and adequacy of funding. But it is also important to do more to try and provide ways for private investment to occur in these areas, and we recommend that examination be given to opening that up further.
There was a lot of comment during the inquiry about the need for an independent body to coordinate salinity research, to maintain a focus on dryland irrigation and urban salinity, to identify and prioritise gaps in research and leverage research from existing providers, to provide a sort of one-stop shop for salinity research and information and to have a website that provides a gateway for all relevant research. There is a lot of great science being done out there, but it is not necessarily all getting through to the people who need to know about it. So there are still lots of areas for improvement. I recommend this report to anybody interested in this issue. I particularly urge the minister and the government to respond to it positively and promptly. The committee put a lot of effort into trying to ensure that this was a unanimous report that focused on what things could be done quickly to produce strong results for the community. It would be very disappointing for the Senate and, I would suggest, a slap in the face for all those people who put their time into providing evidence and submissions—in some cases, driving very long distances to make sure their expertise was provided—if the government does not respond quickly.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee</title>",Committees,26,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-03-28,"—I would also like to comment on the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. I was a participating and active member of this committee, and I must say it was refreshing to work on a committee where there was a bipartisan commitment to solving this important issue. I also should note that there were three very active Western Australian senators on this committee, which I think indicates the depth of interest and concern about this issue in Western Australia. Of course, it is an important issue around Australia. It is a huge challenge, and the report outlines the extent of the problem. It is a problem where there are no easy answers and no quick fixes. It requires cooperation and coordination on a huge scale over a very long time to slowly turn this problem around. It impacts on many aspects of the daily lives of Australians: our water resources, the production of food and fibre, how long our water heaters and washing machines last, how often we have to fix our roads and rails, and the biodiversity of our rivers, wetlands and low-lying bushland.
In recent months we have heard stories about how the extent of areas at risk of salinity now seems smaller than we were once told, which implies that maybe there is less cause for concern. As more detailed mapping of areas potentially threatened by rising saline watertables is undertaken, our knowledge of which parts of the landscape are likely to be damaged by salinity has improved and the extent of land at risk has been revised down. However, at the same time, a better understanding of the hydrological processes of these landscapes and better data on the impacts of different interventions on ground water recharge have led us to revise up the amount of intervention required and the time it will take to have a measurable effect.
So, while the area has been revised down somewhat, we have come to appreciate that the level of intervention required to address salinity is much higher in many places. We now have a much better understanding of where in the landscape we need to target our efforts, and we can work out how long it takes the water to move through the landscape in local, intermediate and regional ground water systems. In some cases we are talking about 20, 50 or 100 years between the rain falling on the slopes and the salty water discharging into the streams at the bottom of a catchment. What we can do now is prioritise the investment of our limited resources in those areas that will make the biggest difference. This targeted investment is now one of our biggest challenges through the national salinity action plan, NHT2, and hopefully NHT3 in the future. It is important that we do not do what in WA we call the ‘vegemite approach’, which is to just spread our limited resources very thinly over the landscape without targeting them properly.
We heard in the hearings of the Salinity Investment Framework, and it is listed in the report. We are now up to the third version of that. I am very proud to say that the Salinity Investment Framework came out of Western Australia. It talks about identifying priority assets, whether they are biodiversity, our towns, our infrastructure, our water resources or, of course, our agricultural land. What are the community values and what intervention tools do we have? What solutions do we have, and what is the likelihood of their success? In other words, how can we get the most bang for our buck?
So the targeting and prioritisation of limited resources is one of our biggest challenges. However, we have an even greater challenge, and that is that in many parts of these landscapes we do not have the answers yet. This is a critical point. For many of our problem areas we do not yet have the kind of large-scale economically viable solutions that we need to make a difference. This has been one of the major concerns we have heard about through the national action plan, which we call the NAP. For all the good work that has been done in developing a regional approach and identifying priority catchments, there has been an underlying assumption that all we needed to do was get the money out there effectively on the ground and that would do the job. Unfortunately, it does not. We need national coordination of research and ways of getting the research into national decision making. Most importantly, we need research into developing new industries.
There is very good ongoing work to make existing industries more sustainable. The Sustainable Grazing on Saline Lands project is an excellent example, and there are many more. All existing work on existing systems is very important, but this is only part of the solution. There is only so far we can go in making existing industries be sustainable and use water efficiently. We need new industries. We need to develop new systems for large areas of Australia where we have a pressing problem with unused rainfall contributing to rising watertables with no real solution at hand. This is why it is absolutely critical that we put effort into developing new landscape scale sustainable industries. Unfortunately, this is a very big ask and it is not something that is fitted easily into the current framework of NAP or NHT2. What is required to develop new industries from the ground up are big, clearly focused research and development programs to develop new technologies and land use systems, support and incentives for land managers to try out and adopt new production techniques, and then serious partnerships with venture capital to develop these industries.
I would like to draw your attention to the best example of this we have to date, which is the integrated mallee processing plant in Narrogin in Western Australia. Based on oil mallees planted for salinity control, it produces such things as eucalyptus oil and chips for wood products. It puts trees in the ground and then the biomass of plant residue produces energy. Many groups in Western Australia have put a lot of effort into developing this plant. They have supported it and lobbied for it over a long period of time. This is particularly timely for at this stage, as I understand it, if no urgent action is taken on this issue this week it is likely that 15 years of research and development and over $20 million of public money will be wasted when Western Power pulls the plug—sorry to use a pun—on this project a few months short of the finalisation of the economic feasibility study currently being completed. As I understand it, it was always known that this was only a trial plant, but, because of delays in starting and getting the equipment working properly, the feasibility study has not been adequately completed to provide the results to assess this proposal. I am extremely worried that conclusions will be reached about the success of this project without putting in the additional funding that is required to do this properly.
I believe that, if we are truly to develop new industries in this country for sustainable agriculture and to deal with sustainable natural resource management problems, we need to commit to long-term funding and see through the things that we start. This is particularly important for this plant, given that so many of our hopes and dreams for a sustainable landscape ride on this plant.
I am also deeply concerned that people try to pick winners in the salinity issue. As I said before, there are no easy answers to this. I am deeply concerned that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage was recently quoted in the paper as heavily supporting drainage as a solution to salinity. I have absolutely no doubt that engineering solutions, as they are more commonly referred to now, play a part in dealing with salinity. I was not on that particular tour in WA but many times in WA I have seen effective drainage programs. I have also seen those that contribute negatively to the environment and the landscape. I believe that engineering solutions have an important part to play but they are not the be-all and end-all. I would hate to see millions of dollars wasted on unsustainable solutions.
I commend this report to the parliament. As I said, it was a pleasure to work on a committee where so many people were committed to a bipartisan outcome to an issue that we know affects millions of Australians and, if unchecked, will destroy biodiversity across this country.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee</title>",Committees,26,1,speech
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2006-03-28,"—This report is based on an inquiry into the extent and economic impact of salinity and the long-term success of federal programs dealing with the issue. In my first speech to the Senate I highlighted the issue of salinity, which is a major concern to many areas in the Western Australian wheat belt. Living in the great southern region of Western Australia, an area which is being continually threatened by salinity and a rising watertable, has given me a first-hand knowledge of the severity of these issues.
I was delighted to be given the opportunity to become a member of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee, ECITA, inquiry to look into the impact of salinity throughout Australia. The committee received 50 written submissions and a large number of tabled documents and additional information. Two hearings were held in Canberra and the committee travelled to Sydney, Adelaide, Wagga Wagga, Perth and the Avon Catchment situated in the Western Australian wheat belt. I believe this unanimous report containing 23 recommendations will be of great benefit in ensuring that further strong progress is made in addressing the economic and environmental consequences of salinity.
As I said in my first speech, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when dealing with salinity over such a large and diverse area. The costs imposed on landholders, governments and residents of rural towns as a result of the effects of salinity on infrastructure, water quality, productive land, biodiversity, remnant vegetation and conservation reserves was identified as significant. The loss in profits for the agricultural sector in Western Australia was estimated at between $80 million and $260 million per year. The cost of dryland salinity in eight tributary valleys of the Murray-Darling Basin is approximately $247 million per year. The cost of salinity to consumptive users of Murray River water totals $47 million per year. In Wagga Wagga, the damage to infrastructure in the town would amount to $180 million over 30 years, with some residents already spending up to $20,000 to repair their homes.
Turning now to salinity management in Australia, the measures the Australian government is applying to the salinity problem include research and development, making direct on-ground interventions and developing timely information on salinity. By building capacity in collaboration with the states and territories the Australian government is dealing with salinity through a wide range of initiatives and a range of research and development bodies.
The three main programs administered at the Commonwealth level to tackle salinity and other national resource management issues are the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, NAP; the Natural Heritage Trust, NHT; and the National Landcare Program, NLP. The NAP is directed at improving salinity and water quality conditions in the Australian environment whilst the NHT is focused on the protection and sustainable use of Australia’s land, water and marine resources. The NLP focus is on ensuring sustainable agricultural practices and providing support to landholders at a local level. The Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council oversees the development and implementation of these national natural resource management programs.
I am convinced that communities and committees right across Australia will need to work cooperatively to overcome this problem. In many communities this could mean adopting a new approach and a new mind set and putting aside differences of opinion about funding issues and how salinity can be tackled to find a consensus about these things. I believe local government also has a pivotal role to play in bringing this consensus about.
As we moved around the different states, it seemed that urban salinity had been forgotten. I think it is important, and I and other members of the committee raised this issue. I have an example of urban salinity and some projects in Western Australia. In Western Australia, salinity affects a large number of rural towns and there are 38 towns involved in the state’s Rural Towns Program. Katanning and Wagin are two of these towns and they are close to where I live.
The committee heard that a program to manage urban or townsite salinity had been underway in Western Australia for a number of years. The Rural Towns Program was established in 1997 and it is administered by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture. The program is supported by a 12-member management committee comprised of six government representatives and six local government/rural sector representatives. The purpose of the program is to assist communities in managing town site salinity. A total of 38 towns and communities are involved in the project.
There is also another project: the Rural Towns Liquid Assets project is being run over three years. This is a partnership between the Department of Agriculture, local government, the CSIRO and regional catchment councils. The project aims to demonstrate how to control town site salinity and produce returns from saline ground water production.
The objectives of the project are: to protect town site infrastructure from salinity; to protect remaining biodiversity areas in or adjacent to towns; to produce a model for integrated town water management; to develop alternative new supplies plus recycled water schemes; to reduce reliance on scheme water in towns; to foster high-value industries using new water supplies; and to promote local ownership of water resource management issues.
The total cost of the project is $6 million. The Department of Agriculture has committed $1.5 million in cash and $500,000 in in-kind contributions. A total of $1.5 million through regional catchment councils’ NAP funds will be sought. A total of $1.5 million will be sought from local governments. Other partners will make in-kind contributions.
In closing I would like to thank the secretariat, all the witnesses who came forward and my fellow committee members. I know it has been said that it was such a bipartisan committee. We all worked very well together. There was no problem insofar as which party we belonged to. I think that this was an example of how many other committees can work to achieve a result, as we have. In commending the committee report I hope that it will be taken up and some of our recommendations will be implemented, because it is the only way forward to deal with this severe issue.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee</title>",Committees,26,1,speech

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-03-28,"—As chair of the committee, I present the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee entitled Living with salinity—a report on progress: the extent and economic impact of salinity in Australia, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Firstly, I would like to note that this report is the result of a motion agreed to by the Senate on 17 March last year, so it is just over one year ago. In that period of time, there has been a significant amount of change in the membership of the committee. That has meant that more senators have had experience and had their eyes opened to the issues of salinity and the ongoing issues that need to be addressed. It has also created extra challenges for the secretariat in ensuring the continuity of understanding of the issues raised. I would particularly like to thank the workers in the secretariat, as always, for their professionalism and their ability in getting this report together. I would also like to note the work of the senators who came along, particularly in the second half of the inquiry, and really pulled together a lot of information from submissions and public hearings. It is important to emphasise up-front that this is a unanimous inquiry. The point is made from time to time by government ministers in dismissing reports that they are partisan, that they are point-scoring and that they are just seeking to take political advantage. I hope that there is genuine seriousness from the government in absorbing this report and responding promptly and positively to the recommendations within it, because it is unanimous.
The committee consisted not just of me as a Democrat in the chair but also of Labor, Liberal and Greens senators all working together to try to produce a strong report that will build on the positive work that has been done in this area to date. I believe we have done that. I would like to thank the other senators involved in the committee, particularly the deputy chair, Liberal Senator Judith Adams, a Western Australian from the wheatbelt who therefore knows a lot about salinity, at least how it affects wheat growers in Western Australia. We had the opportunity to inspect part of that region. I would also like to extend the thanks of the committee to all those who helped in the field visits and organising hearings, because that certainly contributed to the value of the experience. One of the things that became clear to me and the committee over the course of the inquiry was that the nature of salinity and the ways to address it vary significantly from region to region and that the ability to tailor research and solutions to different regions is something we need to do better.
If I had to summarise in my own words or give a very brief snapshot of progress in dealing with salinity I would say: we are doing okay but we can certainly do better. We need to get more value from the dollars that are spent. We need to get more certainty about that funding and continuity of funding. We need better coordination of the research, better sharing of the knowledge and the ability to apply it in different ways at the regional level. We also need to do more to ensure we do not keep maintaining some of the behaviours that are exacerbating the problem. The report is titled Living with salinity precisely because we need to acknowledge more clearly that salinity is part of the Australian environment and something that we have to learn to live with much better than we have. There has been improvement but there is room for more. One thing I believe we certainly have to do is to not keep repeating the mistakes of the past.
The committee has produced 23 recommendations aimed at ensuring that further strong progress is made in addressing the economic and environmental consequences of salinity. One of those recommendations is to seek greater assurance, through the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council, that the states and territories are doing better at effectively regulating land clearing and that extensions to the national action plan funding be conditional on the states and territories meeting more rigorous accountability measures in this and other areas. There is no point in taxpayers putting up significant amounts of money or, for that matter, industries or local councils or in everybody contributing their voluntary labour to try and address the issue of salinity if people are allowed to continue the sorts of behaviours that keep maintaining the problem.
This also applies to another area where the committee believes more attention is needed than has occurred to date, and that is the issue of urban salinity. The committee has described urban salinity as ‘a sleeping giant’ in the title of the chapter relating to that issue, or a potential sleeping giant—there is a question mark in the title: ‘Urban salinity: a sleeping giant?’ It is clear that the programs that have been developed to date, whilst mentioning urban salinity, do not give it sufficient priority. Perhaps more importantly, it is also clear that many authorities are simply not aware of or not fully informed of the issues of urban salinity, some of the reasons behind it and the enormous costs that it can cause. This is something we need to do more about now, for the reason I have just mentioned—that we do not want to be putting money into addressing salinity if activities are still occurring that exacerbate the problem.
We have recommended that the very effective salinity mapping that has been occurring in recent times needs to be conducted in areas where salinity is known to be a potential hazard before further urban development is approved in those areas. Decisions made today will affect the next generation. The cost of repairing the damage from urban salinity, whether it is to housing or, more immediately, to infrastructure such as roads, pipes and other underground and aboveground infrastructure, can be quite enormous. It is a cost that will be borne by the next generation—by local councils and state and federal governments in 20 or 30 years time, by the taxpayer and the public more broadly—if decisions are allowed to be made today that ignore those potential consequences. That is a key area where more action is needed.
In all the recommendations by the committee there is no suggestion that this is all brand new, that we have discovered all this for ourselves or that nothing has happened to date. The report is specifically and deliberately called A report on progress. Under its terms of reference the inquiry was set up to look at progress made to date, including what had happened since the House of Representatives committee inquiry into this area in 2004. There has been progress, but there certainly needs to be improvement.
The other areas that the committee emphasised included the need to extend funding for the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and the Natural Heritage Trust to ensure that people can do the long-term planning that is needed. As with many areas, this is as much about government’s role of enabling the community to address the problems. They can best do that, because in the end it will be up to the community—whether it is agricultural producers, local government authorities, landholders or the community more widely—to address this issue and to do the work that needs to be done. The role of government is to provide the resources, to ensure that coordination occurs effectively and to assist people to be able to do that. Something that needs to be done in that area is to ensure continuity, certainty and adequacy of funding. But it is also important to do more to try and provide ways for private investment to occur in these areas, and we recommend that examination be given to opening that up further.
There was a lot of comment during the inquiry about the need for an independent body to coordinate salinity research, to maintain a focus on dryland irrigation and urban salinity, to identify and prioritise gaps in research and leverage research from existing providers, to provide a sort of one-stop shop for salinity research and information and to have a website that provides a gateway for all relevant research. There is a lot of great science being done out there, but it is not necessarily all getting through to the people who need to know about it. So there are still lots of areas for improvement. I recommend this report to anybody interested in this issue. I particularly urge the minister and the government to respond to it positively and promptly. The committee put a lot of effort into trying to ensure that this was a unanimous report that focused on what things could be done quickly to produce strong results for the community. It would be very disappointing for the Senate and, I would suggest, a slap in the face for all those people who put their time into providing evidence and submissions—in some cases, driving very long distances to make sure their expertise was provided—if the government does not respond quickly.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,26,2,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-03-28,"—I would also like to comment on the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. I was a participating and active member of this committee, and I must say it was refreshing to work on a committee where there was a bipartisan commitment to solving this important issue. I also should note that there were three very active Western Australian senators on this committee, which I think indicates the depth of interest and concern about this issue in Western Australia. Of course, it is an important issue around Australia. It is a huge challenge, and the report outlines the extent of the problem. It is a problem where there are no easy answers and no quick fixes. It requires cooperation and coordination on a huge scale over a very long time to slowly turn this problem around. It impacts on many aspects of the daily lives of Australians: our water resources, the production of food and fibre, how long our water heaters and washing machines last, how often we have to fix our roads and rails, and the biodiversity of our rivers, wetlands and low-lying bushland.
In recent months we have heard stories about how the extent of areas at risk of salinity now seems smaller than we were once told, which implies that maybe there is less cause for concern. As more detailed mapping of areas potentially threatened by rising saline watertables is undertaken, our knowledge of which parts of the landscape are likely to be damaged by salinity has improved and the extent of land at risk has been revised down. However, at the same time, a better understanding of the hydrological processes of these landscapes and better data on the impacts of different interventions on ground water recharge have led us to revise up the amount of intervention required and the time it will take to have a measurable effect.
So, while the area has been revised down somewhat, we have come to appreciate that the level of intervention required to address salinity is much higher in many places. We now have a much better understanding of where in the landscape we need to target our efforts, and we can work out how long it takes the water to move through the landscape in local, intermediate and regional ground water systems. In some cases we are talking about 20, 50 or 100 years between the rain falling on the slopes and the salty water discharging into the streams at the bottom of a catchment. What we can do now is prioritise the investment of our limited resources in those areas that will make the biggest difference. This targeted investment is now one of our biggest challenges through the national salinity action plan, NHT2, and hopefully NHT3 in the future. It is important that we do not do what in WA we call the ‘vegemite approach’, which is to just spread our limited resources very thinly over the landscape without targeting them properly.
We heard in the hearings of the Salinity Investment Framework, and it is listed in the report. We are now up to the third version of that. I am very proud to say that the Salinity Investment Framework came out of Western Australia. It talks about identifying priority assets, whether they are biodiversity, our towns, our infrastructure, our water resources or, of course, our agricultural land. What are the community values and what intervention tools do we have? What solutions do we have, and what is the likelihood of their success? In other words, how can we get the most bang for our buck?
So the targeting and prioritisation of limited resources is one of our biggest challenges. However, we have an even greater challenge, and that is that in many parts of these landscapes we do not have the answers yet. This is a critical point. For many of our problem areas we do not yet have the kind of large-scale economically viable solutions that we need to make a difference. This has been one of the major concerns we have heard about through the national action plan, which we call the NAP. For all the good work that has been done in developing a regional approach and identifying priority catchments, there has been an underlying assumption that all we needed to do was get the money out there effectively on the ground and that would do the job. Unfortunately, it does not. We need national coordination of research and ways of getting the research into national decision making. Most importantly, we need research into developing new industries.
There is very good ongoing work to make existing industries more sustainable. The Sustainable Grazing on Saline Lands project is an excellent example, and there are many more. All existing work on existing systems is very important, but this is only part of the solution. There is only so far we can go in making existing industries be sustainable and use water efficiently. We need new industries. We need to develop new systems for large areas of Australia where we have a pressing problem with unused rainfall contributing to rising watertables with no real solution at hand. This is why it is absolutely critical that we put effort into developing new landscape scale sustainable industries. Unfortunately, this is a very big ask and it is not something that is fitted easily into the current framework of NAP or NHT2. What is required to develop new industries from the ground up are big, clearly focused research and development programs to develop new technologies and land use systems, support and incentives for land managers to try out and adopt new production techniques, and then serious partnerships with venture capital to develop these industries.
I would like to draw your attention to the best example of this we have to date, which is the integrated mallee processing plant in Narrogin in Western Australia. Based on oil mallees planted for salinity control, it produces such things as eucalyptus oil and chips for wood products. It puts trees in the ground and then the biomass of plant residue produces energy. Many groups in Western Australia have put a lot of effort into developing this plant. They have supported it and lobbied for it over a long period of time. This is particularly timely for at this stage, as I understand it, if no urgent action is taken on this issue this week it is likely that 15 years of research and development and over $20 million of public money will be wasted when Western Power pulls the plug—sorry to use a pun—on this project a few months short of the finalisation of the economic feasibility study currently being completed. As I understand it, it was always known that this was only a trial plant, but, because of delays in starting and getting the equipment working properly, the feasibility study has not been adequately completed to provide the results to assess this proposal. I am extremely worried that conclusions will be reached about the success of this project without putting in the additional funding that is required to do this properly.
I believe that, if we are truly to develop new industries in this country for sustainable agriculture and to deal with sustainable natural resource management problems, we need to commit to long-term funding and see through the things that we start. This is particularly important for this plant, given that so many of our hopes and dreams for a sustainable landscape ride on this plant.
I am also deeply concerned that people try to pick winners in the salinity issue. As I said before, there are no easy answers to this. I am deeply concerned that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage was recently quoted in the paper as heavily supporting drainage as a solution to salinity. I have absolutely no doubt that engineering solutions, as they are more commonly referred to now, play a part in dealing with salinity. I was not on that particular tour in WA but many times in WA I have seen effective drainage programs. I have also seen those that contribute negatively to the environment and the landscape. I believe that engineering solutions have an important part to play but they are not the be-all and end-all. I would hate to see millions of dollars wasted on unsustainable solutions.
I commend this report to the parliament. As I said, it was a pleasure to work on a committee where so many people were committed to a bipartisan outcome to an issue that we know affects millions of Australians and, if unchecked, will destroy biodiversity across this country.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,26,2,speech
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2006-03-28,"—This report is based on an inquiry into the extent and economic impact of salinity and the long-term success of federal programs dealing with the issue. In my first speech to the Senate I highlighted the issue of salinity, which is a major concern to many areas in the Western Australian wheat belt. Living in the great southern region of Western Australia, an area which is being continually threatened by salinity and a rising watertable, has given me a first-hand knowledge of the severity of these issues.
I was delighted to be given the opportunity to become a member of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee, ECITA, inquiry to look into the impact of salinity throughout Australia. The committee received 50 written submissions and a large number of tabled documents and additional information. Two hearings were held in Canberra and the committee travelled to Sydney, Adelaide, Wagga Wagga, Perth and the Avon Catchment situated in the Western Australian wheat belt. I believe this unanimous report containing 23 recommendations will be of great benefit in ensuring that further strong progress is made in addressing the economic and environmental consequences of salinity.
As I said in my first speech, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when dealing with salinity over such a large and diverse area. The costs imposed on landholders, governments and residents of rural towns as a result of the effects of salinity on infrastructure, water quality, productive land, biodiversity, remnant vegetation and conservation reserves was identified as significant. The loss in profits for the agricultural sector in Western Australia was estimated at between $80 million and $260 million per year. The cost of dryland salinity in eight tributary valleys of the Murray-Darling Basin is approximately $247 million per year. The cost of salinity to consumptive users of Murray River water totals $47 million per year. In Wagga Wagga, the damage to infrastructure in the town would amount to $180 million over 30 years, with some residents already spending up to $20,000 to repair their homes.
Turning now to salinity management in Australia, the measures the Australian government is applying to the salinity problem include research and development, making direct on-ground interventions and developing timely information on salinity. By building capacity in collaboration with the states and territories the Australian government is dealing with salinity through a wide range of initiatives and a range of research and development bodies.
The three main programs administered at the Commonwealth level to tackle salinity and other national resource management issues are the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, NAP; the Natural Heritage Trust, NHT; and the National Landcare Program, NLP. The NAP is directed at improving salinity and water quality conditions in the Australian environment whilst the NHT is focused on the protection and sustainable use of Australia’s land, water and marine resources. The NLP focus is on ensuring sustainable agricultural practices and providing support to landholders at a local level. The Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council oversees the development and implementation of these national natural resource management programs.
I am convinced that communities and committees right across Australia will need to work cooperatively to overcome this problem. In many communities this could mean adopting a new approach and a new mind set and putting aside differences of opinion about funding issues and how salinity can be tackled to find a consensus about these things. I believe local government also has a pivotal role to play in bringing this consensus about.
As we moved around the different states, it seemed that urban salinity had been forgotten. I think it is important, and I and other members of the committee raised this issue. I have an example of urban salinity and some projects in Western Australia. In Western Australia, salinity affects a large number of rural towns and there are 38 towns involved in the state’s Rural Towns Program. Katanning and Wagin are two of these towns and they are close to where I live.
The committee heard that a program to manage urban or townsite salinity had been underway in Western Australia for a number of years. The Rural Towns Program was established in 1997 and it is administered by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture. The program is supported by a 12-member management committee comprised of six government representatives and six local government/rural sector representatives. The purpose of the program is to assist communities in managing town site salinity. A total of 38 towns and communities are involved in the project.
There is also another project: the Rural Towns Liquid Assets project is being run over three years. This is a partnership between the Department of Agriculture, local government, the CSIRO and regional catchment councils. The project aims to demonstrate how to control town site salinity and produce returns from saline ground water production.
The objectives of the project are: to protect town site infrastructure from salinity; to protect remaining biodiversity areas in or adjacent to towns; to produce a model for integrated town water management; to develop alternative new supplies plus recycled water schemes; to reduce reliance on scheme water in towns; to foster high-value industries using new water supplies; and to promote local ownership of water resource management issues.
The total cost of the project is $6 million. The Department of Agriculture has committed $1.5 million in cash and $500,000 in in-kind contributions. A total of $1.5 million through regional catchment councils’ NAP funds will be sought. A total of $1.5 million will be sought from local governments. Other partners will make in-kind contributions.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-03-28,"—I rise to speak on the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006. The bill currently before us introduces a range of amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and the bill aims in part to implement the recommendations arising from the Blunn review into the telecommunications interception regime. Perhaps it is worth providing a recent snapshot of how it got to this place. I might make some preliminary remarks on the history of the bill for the benefit of the record.
Since 2002, the parliament has struggled four times with the issue of stored communication—that is, emails and the like. The contentious provisions in the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 were withdrawn after the Senate legal and constitutional committee recommended against their inclusion. In 2004, some two years later, the contentious provisions of the 2002 bill made a return, and during the committee hearing on this bill it became apparent that the Australian Federal Police were using, surprisingly, section 3L of the Crimes Act for warrants to intercept stored communication material from internet service providers—or ISPs. Such was the difference of opinion between the AFP and the Attorney-General’s Department on this matter that the committee recommended the stored communication regime be deferred until there was some ‘joint ticket’ from the government in respect of how stored communications would be dealt with.
The final result was that the committee recommended that an independent review of the act occur and imposed a sunset clause on the AFP use of general warrants to access stored communication. The original 2004 bill was thus not pursued by the government at that time. But, subsequently, the government came back to parliament with another 2004 bill that implemented in part the committee’s recommendation—that is, that the status quo would remain whilst a review took place.
The 12 months imposed by the sunset clause was long enough for Mr Anthony Blunn AO to conclude his review but not long enough for the government to finalise the subsequent legislation. A further six-month extension was granted by the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2005, which this parliament agreed to. That extension expires in June of this year, and clearly that is why we are having the debate now. The time line is that this bill, as the government claims, needs to be put through parliament this week. There is only the May sitting before we end up in June, when the present sunset clause would kick in. Therefore, at present we have a temporary solution to the issue of stored communication and, perhaps, the status quo—the unsatisfactory status quo regarding the difference of opinion between the AFP and the Attorney-General.
From Labor’s point of view, the present situation of dealing with such communication is unsatisfactory. Email and SMS messages are able to be intercepted by the general Crimes Act warrant under section 3L. Labor strongly believes in tougher safeguards than are presently available. As it stands, we effectively have a stopgap measure that will fall over when this clause expires in mid-June, and clearly this parliament does need to act on this issue before that is reached.
Turning to the Blunn review, it provided a review of not only the telecommunications interception regime but also the range of circumstances around it. The bill before us today therefore seeks to implement a number of the recommendations of the Blunn review—but not all of them, because this bill does not represent the total sum of the reform recommended by Blunn. Clearly, this will be an issue that will need to be revisited in the future, and perhaps the not too distant future. What is before us today is, it seems, as much as the Attorney-General could put together, given the deadline to have this bill passed, assented to and proclaimed before the sunset provision kicks in.
Blunn’s main findings included:
the protection of privacy should continue to be a fundamental consideration in, and the starting point for, any legislation providing access to telecommunications for security and law enforcement purposes;
access to telecommunications data is, and for the foreseeable future will remain, fundamental to effective security and law enforcement;
That was the prime starting point when Labor considered this bill—privacy and law enforcement access.
One of the more problematic areas, perhaps the most problematic in terms of the comments on this bill, is B-party intercepts—that is, an intercept of an innocent party or a nonsuspect who is in regular communication with a person of interest. It seems that B-party intercepts are permitted under the current law. It seems their validity under the existing Telecommunications (Interception) Act was established in the full Federal Court decision of John Flanagan v Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. There are of course arguments as to whether that might be good or bad law or whether this case might be followed by another full Federal Court or a High Court decision at some later point. However, until that happens, it remains conjecture, and I am not going to give my view on that. Although B-party interceptions have not been used since the Flanagan case in 1995, that has been a matter of policy and not of law. Should the government of the day change that policy, it seems it could rely on that decision.
The independent reviewer of B-party communications, Mr Anthony Blunn, recommended:
... the Interception Act be amended to make it clear that B-Party services may be intercepted in limited and controlled circumstances.
That is what this bill seeks to do and, in making that point, it also ensures the point of last resort to law enforcement agencies for the use of B-party intercepts. This intention must be made clear to the courts, the public and law enforcement agencies, including ASIO. As a responsible party, Labor will take this opportunity to limit the use of B-party intercepts. We have to ensure that the issue is carefully examined. It has had the opportunity of going through the legal and constitutional committee, and a number of recommendations have been made from that.
We will also take the opportunity in committee stage—which it seems will be tonight—to ensure that there are sufficient safeguards to give effect to the Blunn review recommendation that B-party intercepts be utilised in limited and controlled circumstances. Labor is not satisfied that B-party intercepts are currently only used safely and responsibly with the appropriate privacy controls and safeguards. It is important that amendments are moved to ensure that they are used safely and responsibly with the appropriate privacy controls and safeguards, and Labor will ensure this. The bill also contains technical measures, set out in schedules 4 to 6, that will amalgamate two different classes of offences, remove a redundant accountability provision and provide some housekeeping measures ensuring that the act is up to date. Labor generally supports the bill because of its strong emphasis on protecting privacy and the important practical assistance it will give to our law enforcement agencies.
I will now turn to each schedule. The first schedule in the bill before us deals with stored communication—as I said earlier, communications like emails and SMSs. The issue of stored communication was addressed in detail by the Blunn review, which made a number of findings on this matter. Firstly, it recommended that the distinction between real-time and stored communications be maintained. However, despite calling for the retention of this distinction, it also found that the act as it is presently structured is not an appropriate vehicle for accessing communication other than real-time communications and that the provisions governing access to stored communication are inadequate and inappropriate, and Labor certainly agrees with that sentiment. Therefore the review recommended that access to stored communications continue to be authorised by a search warrant and that those warrants be required to meet minimum prescribed standards.
Therefore the bill before us today sets up a new warrant regime for intercepting stored communication. The bill will move the provisions from a general search warrant and implement tougher provisions similar to those for real-time communications. In effect, the bill will toughen privacy protections, making it harder to get a warrant. This schedule introduces a new regime for access to stored communication. This includes a general prohibition on access to stored communications, the regime for access to stored communications by law enforcement agencies, the process and regime for issuing, executing and revoking stored communication warrants, provisions of technical assistance to a law enforcement agency by staff or a carrier, a regime of evidentiary certificates by carriers and law enforcement agencies and an offence to criminalise unauthorised use or communication of accessed information or stored warrant information. It also includes a regime of permitted dealings with accessed information, admissibility of evidence, destruction of records unlikely to be used for the purposes of the investigation, the regime for keeping of records, including access to same by the Ombudsman and, more importantly, the regime for reporting to the minister and parliament about these matters and, of course, civil remedies.
The new regime, which will be brought in by the bill, generally acts to apply the same protections afforded to telecommunications to stored communications. So the first schedule of the bill not only acts to clarify the status of access to stored communication—which, it seems, has bedevilled this department for some time—but at the same time ensures that there are sufficiently tough privacy provisions that have to be met and maintained before you can obtain a stored communication warrant.
The second schedule in this bill clarifies the position of the act on B-party intercepts. As I said, a B-party intercept occurs when a law enforcement agency seeks to monitor person A for criminal activity. Now, say that a person is in regular contact with another party, a B party, who is not the subject of an investigation. Under the present law it is permissible to obtain a warrant to subject the second person, the B person, to an interception. It is not permissible, at least as far as policy is concerned, to intercept in order to obtain information regarding person A. But, of course, B-party intercepts effectively then target nonsuspects. We keep coming back to the issue that is of concern—to ensure that there is an appropriate balance struck between the privacy of individuals and the use of B-party intercepts.
Perhaps it is a good time to thank not only the members of the committee but also the secretariat for the work in such a short time to provide a report, given that there were significant constraints placed upon us by this government which I will complain about. If you look at the position that the government put the committee in, you will see that it gave not only the committee but also submitters a very limited time to provide submissions. I will also take the opportunity to say on record that I appreciate the submissions that were made in such a limited time. They were invaluable to the committee for coming to a conclusion and making recommendations. Again, the time provided for the committee to finalise its report to parliament was very limited. It was only reported on Monday. It is now Tuesday. I think dealing with the bill in such a short time also means the ability of this government to digest the recommendations is questionable.
Certainly the government will have to be able to tell this parliament that they have looked at all those recommendations in the time available, considered them and ensured that the bill meets those recommendations—and, if it does not, why it does not. They will also have to provide the opposition with sufficient time to be able to meet those recommendations by way of amendments if the government fail to adopt any of those recommendations. I can leave that to the committee stage. But it is worth indicating that we have been working under time constraints that have been imposed by this government and which I think are unreasonable and, I have to say, create the look that the government are seeking to move in haste when leaving more time might create a much better response.
The committee really summed it up when it said that it is important, if this bill—through B-party intercepts—seeks to override people’s rights to privacy, that it does so no more than is necessary. The law enforcement agencies have submitted that there is a need for B-party intercepts in limited and controlled circumstances and the Blunn review highlighted that they should only be used in limited and controlled circumstances.
The key question therefore is the extent to which this bill provides a framework of controls over the proposed intercepts that balances privacy with effective law enforcement. The committee went on to identify a range of issues that would need to be looked at: the controls on the dissemination of information, the implications for the protection of privileged communications, and the reporting and accountability requirements. It came up with substantive recommendations to improve the position of this bill to ensure that it address those issues.
The third area in which this bill imposes changes is equipment based interception, which is dealt with in schedule 3. This is arguably a technical change to allow law enforcement agencies to apply for warrants for communications from a specific device rather than communications from a person. What happens, as mentioned in the explanatory memoranda, is that a person of interest will buy a mobile phone and use potentially any number of SIM cards, at low cost or no cost, which they then switch through their phone. Naturally this makes it very difficult for a law enforcement agency to identify and intercept communications belonging to that person based on a SIM card. The person might also use multiple handsets. The amendments would, as I earlier stated, allow for a law enforcement agency to target the phone and intercept communications arising out of that phone or other device. This would serve to make it less practical and less economic for a person of interest to evade interception through their exploitation of technology. It would also enhance law enforcement’s chances of interception.
The three schedules I have mentioned are the main schedules to the bill. There are another three schedules which are designed to enact largely technical changes to the bill. Schedule 4 removes the distinction between class 1 and class 2 offences. Previously the act divided offences into these two classes and required only class 2 offences to be subject to privacy considerations by the issuing authority. However, the Blunn review questioned this distinction, finding that it produced no meaningful difference in terms of outcomes, and recommended its removal. The current bill accomplishes this, abolishing the two definitions and placing both of them under a new definition of ‘serious offence’. Both types of offences are now subject to privacy considerations. Essentially this enhances the privacy provisions of this bill. Under the previous regime, only class 2 offences were subject to privacy considerations. Under the regime presented in this bill, all requests for warrants of telecommunications interceptions will be subject to these considerations. Again, Labor will support these amendments, subject to any recommendations arising out of the committee process.
Schedule 5 operates to remove the Telecommunications Interception Remote Authority Connection from the act. The Blunn review found that the TIRAC regime was costly but had  a very low rate of detecting warrant errors. The review recommended that the powers of TIRAC be removed to the Attorney-General’s Department. Schedule 6 of the bill introduces a number of technical amendments to the act and these are largely housekeeping.
In conclusion: the bill before us is a necessary update of the somewhat antiquated legislation that currently covers telecommunications interceptions. Significantly, the bill will provide a new regime for the interception of stored communication. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2006-03-28,"—In the short time remaining, I will begin to address some of the concerns and comments of the Australian Democrats in relation to the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006. Senator Ludwig has outlined, in many respects, the intent and content of the schedules of this legislation, which we agree is intended as an amendment to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. It is intended to implement some of the recommendations of the Report of the review of the regulation of access to communications, better known as the Blunn report. It is intended as a necessary update of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act, but it does have some alarming consequences, particularly in relation to privacy rights of Australian citizens. That is something that I will go into in more detail when I address some of the aspects of this legislation.
In the time remaining, however, I want to reinforce some of the comments that Senator Ludwig has made in relation to the process. The process tonight is not good enough. There was a truncated Senate committee process for this complex and significant legislation. Committee members were able to be a part of that process, but there was a shortened time for inquiry and report and we had witnesses that were very up front about the fact that they could have done with more time. In some cases—equipment based warrants et cetera—some of the complexities of those debates could have been covered more satisfactorily with extra time.
As for today, I understand the government has pulled off a bill—for a variety of reasons, but particularly because of the absence of a senator—but this is a piece of legislation on which the committee inquiry has only just reported, as Senator Ludwig has stated. The report came down yesterday. I acknowledge the government amendments have been circulated. I have to say, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, that that is because you have more access to resources than some of us may have in preparing our amendments. I think it was about 9.56 am that the government amendments were circulated—so on the day of this debate. Senator Ludwig and I have not had an opportunity to circulate our amendments, because our amendments are still—
—I’m getting there!
—We are getting there. I thought mine had been circulated, so I apologise to anyone if indeed they have not been. I do think we should do each other the courtesy in this place of allowing each other sufficient time to at least read each other’s amendments. I acknowledge the government may not support ours. Having said that, once again I want to put on record that, even when we disagree on policy, we should commit to some protocol and conventions and process in this place that do justice to this parliament and to the house of review. Once again tonight, our role of scrutinising and analysing law in a timely fashion and a considerable way has been abrogated. I am very upset about that. I hope people will see our amendments over dinner and consider them in detail.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 pm to 7.30 pm

 
(Quorum formed)

—This bill is obviously so important and urgent that I thought we would have had a quorum present anyway. I want to again put on record that amendments from the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have yet to be circulated. We have been working madly over the last two days to get the amendments drafted and circulated and to hopefully give people enough time to respond to those amendments, but we have been focusing on the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2006 for the last 24 hours. Given that that has been pulled, this bill has come up and, although we are in the second reading debate, I implore the government to consider making the committee stage later. But, then again, maybe there is no willingness to even consider the amendments, including those that have arisen out of the Senate committee report.
This bill introduces a stored communications warrant. The regime allows enforcement agencies as well as Commonwealth bodies, such as the Australian Taxation Office, ASIC and Australian Customs, and similar state agencies to have access to stored communications. A stored communication is defined as a communication which is passed over a telecommunications system, is held on equipment operated by a telecommunications carrier at their premises and must be accessible to an intended recipient. The threshold for a stored communications warrant is three years, unlike an interceptions warrant, which is seven years. Stored communications warrants have lower storage, inspection and reporting requirements as compared with interception warrants.
This bill allows for a B-party, or a non-suspect third party, to have their telecommunications services intercepted in order to obtain information about a third party. In addition to B-party warrants and stored communications warrants, this bill introduces the concept of an equipment based warrant. This is where the warrant applies to an individual piece of telecommunications equipment as opposed to a person.
While recognising the importance of the Blunn report’s recommendation that consolidating the warrant regime will make the Telecommunications (Interception) Act more efficient, I and many others are dismayed by the potential impact of this legislation on privacy rights of Australians. We are concerned about the extent to which privacy rights can be affected by this bill. This bill in some cases strips away the privacy rights of some people. Specifically, it strips away the right of some Australians to have their information communicated in confidence. The low threshold that has to be met in order to obtain a stored communications warrant, or the potential that surveilled persons not even suspected of any wrongdoing may have their entire conversation with another nonsuspect intercepted, is an unacceptable invasion.
I accept that, in order to have a secure and safe society, we need to equip our enforcement agencies with appropriate tools. The stored communications warrant and the B-party warrant regimes, as outlined in this bill, are not appropriate tools to give to our enforcement agencies. The operation of these warrants and this regime does not strike a proportioned balance between privacy rights and efficiency in fighting crime.
I note that during the Senate inquiry into this legislation the Attorney-General’s Department submitted to the committee that the difference in the threshold required to obtain a stored communications warrant is significantly lower than that required to obtain an interception warrant because the information obtained under a stored communications warrant is ‘something that definitely involves more consideration of the expression’. The premise that more consideration or thought may be put into an SMS, an email message or a message left on voicemail in comparison to a telephone conversation, in this day and age, is ridiculous. Stored communications warrants are as invasive as an interception warrant and we believe they should be considered as such. Not only does this bill allow stored communications warrants to be obtained more easily, it actually removes safeguards and reduces the level of oversight that is in place for interception warrants.
The destruction provisions in this bill are also a matter of concern. The bill requires that the information obtained under a warrant be destroyed only when the chief officer decides that the information is no longer relevant for an investigation. We believe that this requirement is too arbitrary. What happens if copies of communications are stored and the chief officer does not get around to dealing with them? This information could potentially be stored indefinitely. We believe that measures are required to ensure that accountability is maintained.
To provide the minister with authority under the bill to appoint part-time members of the AAT as issuing authorities is, we believe, not responsible. In their submission, the Australian Privacy Foundation stated:
We suggest that the threshold is far too low—part-time members of the AAT and ordinary state and territory magistrates should not carry this responsibility, even if they are legal practitioners. Restricting warrant-issuing authority to judges, full-time magistrates and full-time senior AAT members would be an important safeguard against it becoming too easy for enforcement agencies to obtain a warrant.
Comparisons between reports released by the Attorney-General’s Department and the administrative office of the US courts have shown that warrants are more readily issued in our country than in the US, with 26 times more warrants per capita being issued in Australia. This indicates that there is probably an argument that it is already too easy for enforcement agencies to obtain warrants. In the reporting year 2003-04, 76 per cent of warrants were issued by members of the AAT rather than by judges. AAT members do not have tenure, are appointed by the government, and work on contract.
The Democrats support the recommendation to review the adequacy of appointing AAT members as issuing authorities for interception warrants. We also reject the appointment of part-time members of the AAT as issuing authorities for stored communication warrants. The reality that more agencies will be able to apply for a stored communications warrant under part 3-3 of the bill is also an issue of concern. We believe that the possibility that numerous state, territory and Commonwealth agencies may all have the authority to contact hundreds of carriers poses a very dangerous scenario for privacy rights. Again, there is a scenario here where a distinction is drawn between stored and live communications. Only enforcement agencies have the ability, under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act, to intercept live communications.
If the parliament decides that a phone call should not be intercepted unless it is for a serious offence, how have we come to the conclusion that where that phone was not answered and a voice message was left, it should be open to a variety of state and Commonwealth agencies? This bill not only provides for a number of agencies to access stored communications warrants; it also reduces their accountability in parts. The explanatory memorandum states:
Reflecting the wider agency access and the lower threshold to be met, the reporting requirements for stored communications warrant are not as burdensome on the agencies as the requirements for interception.
Regardless of the thresholds applied, the covert nature of the warrants and the potential for abuse make reporting obligations fundamental.
I do think it is a little amusing that the government has included in the bill a section for civil remedies when the entire operation of the warrant is covert. How does the government expect an aggrieved person to exercise their right to civil remedies when they are completely unaware that a warrant has been exercised against them? This is clearly the government paying some form of lip service to the idea of accountability but, in fact, flaunting their complete disregard for it.
My amendments have been circulated in the chamber. I am assuming that Senator Ludwig’s amendments are not far away. I am sure this will give the government plenty of time to review our suggestions, our amendments and our ideas. I again make the point that this is not just about us reviewing the government amendments which arrived at 9.56 am this morning; it is about extending courtesy to our colleagues so that they can review these amendments as well.
In relation to B-party warrants, the Democrats are particularly concerned about schedule 2 of the bill, which outlines the existence of B-party warrants. The bill should not be passed in its current format. B-party warrants allow the interception of communications with people not even suspected of a crime: innocent Australians. During the inquiry into the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill 2004, the Victorian Privacy Commissioner stated:
Telecommunications is one of the common means by which many individuals discuss their most private and intimate thoughts, as well as the ordinary daily details of their lives. They may also engage in political discourse, discuss business ventures, seek legal and other professional advice. People have a legitimate and reasonable expectation that the State will not listen surreptitiously to these conversations. Accordingly, any such interception has been subject to strict regulation under law, with oversight.
The arguments put forward by the Attorney-General’s Department and the Australian Federal Police are that, in some circumstances, it is necessary to intercept communications of non-suspected persons in order to obtain information about a person of interest. This does not take into account all other communication between a non-suspect and other non-suspects during the course of their day. Mr Cameron Murphy, who is the spokesperson for the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, stated in an ABC interview:
This is the first time in Australian history that we see the police being given the power to tap the phones of people who are not suspects, who are innocent people and just people who happen to be in contact with someone, likely to be in contact with someone who is a criminal. And it massively expands police surveillance and it is directly targeted against innocent people who are doing nothing wrong.
Mr John North, President of the Law Council of Australia, stated in his evidence to the inquiry:
The Law Council urges the government to abandon proposals to allow telecommunications surveillance of innocent people. Persons not suspected of crime should not be subjected by the state to surveillance. This proposal abrogates fundamental freedoms and human rights of people not suspected of any crime or wrongdoing.
The bill does not have a regard for the privacy of a non-suspect; nor does it have any regard for potential breaches of professional privilege or confidentiality. All conversations between a non-suspected person and their lawyer, their priest, their religious leader, or even their member of parliament are not necessarily protected. The bill does not adequately consider the importance of professional privilege or confidentiality; and, where this privilege is abrogated, we believe it does erode the ability of lawyers, medical officers, MPs, religious leaders, et cetera, to offer their services in confidence. Professional privilege should be protected from interception not only for privacy reasons; it should be protected for reasons of good public policy. It is crucial that Australian citizens are assured that whatever information they give in confidence remains in confidence.
During the inquiry the Attorney-General’s Department referred to the precedent established in Carmody versus MacKellar and Orrs which allows for the abrogation of legal professional privilege. I do not believe that this should be applied by analogy to justify the interception of telecommunications to innocent third parties. Similar to stored communications warrants, we believe the ability of an aggrieved person affected by a B-party warrant to access civil remedies under the Telecommunications Act is ineffective. Where a person has their communications unlawfully invaded or where material used from that interception is unlawfully recorded, they have no ability to seek redress because they will be completely unaware that the warrant has been exercised. Not telling the individual that a warrant has been exercised against them, even when such disclosure would not affect the investigation, prohibits them from exercising their rights to remedy. The accountability measures in this bill are not adequate and through our amendments and through other amendments that have been proposed we seek to strengthen these protections in the bill. That is why we need adequate time to analyse the amendments and their effect and debate this bill in the committee stage.
The bill as it relates to equipment based warrants has led to much confusion particularly in relation to the scope of its operation. During the inquiry I asked the Office of the Privacy Commissioner about the comment in their submission and was told:
The office has not yet been able to fully determine the limits to the scope of the operation of schedule 3.
Mr Timothy Pilgrim, Deputy Privacy Commissioner, replied:
... it is an issue that we have been grappling with and, given our time to be able to devote to issues such as this, have not been able to fully explore ... What we are not able to grapple with—or have not had time to grapple with—is how that might be broadly applied in various scenarios.
Electronic Frontiers Australia in its submission stated:
This proposal appears to have an inappropriately and unjustifiably high potential to result in interception of communications of persons who are not suspects (i.e. are not named in the warrant) because, among other things, the types of device numbers proposed to be used do not necessarily uniquely identify a particular device.
During the inquiry, in response to questioning about the equipment based warrants, the AFP stated that there is the possibility that the unique identifying number for a telephone or computer may get mixed up with other telephones or computers. It was stated by the AFP:
We would make all efforts we could to ascertain that [the unique identifying number] through our inquiries to the telecommunications companies. The concern, of course, is that some of these are fraudulently obtained.
How can the government endorse this legislation if the AFP is not able to guarantee that a piece of telecommunications equipment specified in the warrant is in fact that piece of equipment? The Blunn report, which was the motivator for the changes and for introducing this legislation, did not recommend the introduction of equipment based warrants. Rather, the report recommended that ‘priority be given to developing a unique and indelible identifier of the source of telecommunications and therefore as a basis for access’.
I also asked during the inquiry stage a number of the witnesses for their opinion on how this bill might operate in conjunction with a raft of other legislation that deals with antiterrorism and other such measures when it came to their impact on privacy rights. When you add this to ASIO legislation, the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Bill, the Surveillance Devices Bill, the Australian Passports Bill, the intelligence services legislation and the Anti-Terrorism Bill, the cumulative effect of these laws with other legislation that has been recently passed does remove civil liberties in this country in an unprecedented fashion. We are trying to build in some safeguards to this legislation tonight. All of these bills have an impact, in some cases necessarily, on civil liberties. When they operate together we see a huge cumulative impact that I think is incredibly deleterious to this democracy. We are entering a very new stage in Australian history when government interference in the daily lives of Australian citizens is not only to be expected but almost accepted. We recognise the difficulties in monitoring the security and privacy of the existing regimes but we are not convinced that the bill in its current form should be accepted. It must be amended and I implore the parliament once again to consider the amendments in a timely fashion. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-03-28,"—I congratulate Senator Stott Despoja for that summary of the outrageous aspects of this legislation. Here we are in the Senate with seven senators in attendance dealing with a piece of legislation which egregiously allows snooping into the private affairs of Australians in a way which is unprecedented in the history of this parliament, certainly in peacetime. This Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006 goes way beyond the pale and way beyond what is required for government agencies to effectively check the threat of terrorism.
There is a pattern of misbehaviour by the government which means that almost any incursion on civil liberties can be brought into this parliament. If it has a whiff of terrorism about it—and it does not even have to be stated—the government, with an opposition that is more and more willing and compliant, can have that legislation go through with less and less attention by the media and less and less knowledge by the Australian public of how rapidly time-honoured values in this great democracy of ours are being eroded. We are seeing the rights and prohibitions on the government’s ability to intrude itself into the freedoms of individuals being eroded—and I welcome the minister to the chamber.
This legislation does not have the word ‘terrorism’ in its title but there is no doubt that it is a product of the fear tactic used by the Howard government on a broad scale. It is another one of those things that has come from Attorney-General Ruddock’s thinking. He came into the ministry saying he had in mind new legislation to deal with terrorism as he would have it and, ipso facto, to curb the rights and freedoms of Australians at large. This legislation does that more than perhaps any of the other pieces of legislation we have seen since his ascent to the ministry, to the Attorney-Generalship. In particular, it allows warrants to be issued for a whole range of perceived crimes to allow the interception of communications between Australians. That includes, in this age of cyberspace, stored communications—stored information—that people or entities may have. It does not require that the person or persons that are suspect, and for whom the interception of private information is allowed, be involved in potential terrorism or indeed serious violent crime.
This snoop legislation allows the Howard government to intrude into the telecommunications of people suspected of tax evasion, quarantine breaches and a whole range of matters including, under the new sedition offences, people who might be suspected of urging the overthrow of the Howard government itself. We remember how recently it was that large sections of the community, including the media, were galvanised into fruitless action against the government increasing the penalties for people that could be perceived to be threatening its overthrow. Now we have the government not only having established much more draconian laws for people perceived to be planning a violent overthrow or overthrow of the government—and you can imagine the imagination that goes into information received by agencies of the government on that score—but also, under this legislation, allowing the telecommunications of people who, so far as the agency knows, are thought to be entirely innocent of any such potential to evade taxes or quarantine, for example, to be intercepted. Those communications will be, effectively, processed by and for the government in the name, ostensibly, of the public interest. But that is against the public interest, if you take into account the fact that this country is not a dictatorship but a long established and proud democracy based on the principle of the right of the individual to her or his privacy against unnecessary government intrusion.
This bill is all about the government taking unto itself a whole range of opportunities to intrude into the privacy of average, innocent Australians and other Australians who are suspected of a range of potential criminal behaviours which may not in any way involve violence to persons let alone to the government or to good order in terms of the physical safety of our community. It is quite outrageous, but the government is getting away with it because this is an era of fear. JFK, of course, said we have nothing to fear but fear itself. Now the government has brought in an era in which that dictum is being shown for what it is. We have a great deal to fear from this Howard promoted period of fear. Legislation like this comes before the parliament and the Senate without any proper public debate and ignoring the advice of many important legal thinkers, civil libertarians, philosophers and people concerned for the ethics of this great nation of ours.
Let me quote from one section of the report by the committee to do with the interception of telecommunications of citizens who are known or thought to be entirely innocent of any crime other than that they may be, for example, in phone contact with someone who is thought, potentially, to be implicated. The Gilbert and Tobin Centre of Public Law said:
We believe ... that the Bill abrogates the right to privacy substantially more than is necessary to achieve the Bill’s security purposes. It is important that legislation does not abrogate rights more than is necessary and incidental to achieving the purpose of the legislation. Where legislation does disproportionately abrogate rights, it may have adverse, unintended effects.
It certainly may have. For example, it would give opportunity to government agencies right through to ministers to intrude upon the rights of innocent Australians in a way that is totally contrary to our history and this nation’s proud traditions. The Law Council of Australia said:
Schedule 2 of the Bill if enacted allows certain law enforcement agencies and ASIO to intercept telecommunications of a person who has no knowledge or involvement in a crime, but who may be in contact with someone who does. In other words, people suspected of nothing will be under surveillance ... This is the first time ever in Australia’s history that law enforcement agencies will be given power to intercept telecommunications of people who are not suspects who are innocent people.
Let me repeat that, because this is coming from the Law Council of Australia:
This is the first time ever in Australia’s history that law enforcement agencies will be given power to intercept telecommunications of people who are not suspects who are innocent people.
A pity the chief law officer of this country, the Attorney-General, does not listen to the Law Council of Australia, but in the arrogance of this government—and it is a dangerous arrogance—has taken unto himself to put up legislation like this effectively unaltered by any public submission. Senator Stott Despoja quoted from the New South Wales Council of Civil Liberties. Mr Cameron Murphy from that council had something to say about the Attorney-General’s legislation, which we are going to see put through this Senate a little later this evening—if it is convenient to the government; if not tomorrow—by the sheer weight of numbers, regardless of what debate takes place here and regardless of the warnings from people outside this place who have far more regard, I submit to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, than the Attorney-General or the Prime Minister of the day for this nation’s great traditions.
Let me remark on comments by Senator Milne earlier this afternoon in a debate where she pointed out that it is this very government that purports to uphold the traditions of Australia that uses every opportunity to aggrandise itself before the flag, in front of the symbolism of this country, in this parliament wherever it can, ripping down the great traditions of this country, treading them into the ground—not least the rights of individuals. One would expect a conservative coalition, a government largely made up of members who have the word ‘liberal’ in their job description, to trample time-honoured rights—in particular to immunity from government snooping, which is not in the national interest—into the dust.
Mr Murphy said on behalf of the New South Wales Council of Civil Liberties:
We can accept that, if someone is a suspect in a criminal investigation, it is a matter of balancing the interests of the public in ensuring that that suspected offence is investigated and that the person is prosecuted and dealt with under the law. In this amendment, we are dealing with something that goes much further than that. We are talking about innocent B-parties—
that is, innocent people—
people who are not themselves suspected of any offence. The whole regime of B-party warrants shifts the focus of the investigation from someone who is a suspect to an investigation surrounding the innocent B-party on the off-chance that a suspect might contact them and there might be useful information gleaned that way.
If you can argue that you should intervene on the privacy of somebody who might know somebody who might be suspected of a tax evasion, then you can argue that somebody who might know that somebody who knows that somebody might themselves be investigated. Where do we end up here? It is a very logical progression that nobody is going to be safe from their privacy being intruded upon, invaded, unknown to them, as they go about their innocent life in this democratic nation of ours, by an increasing number of government agencies with less regard to the wellbeing of the country and greater regard to the politics of the government of the day. It is very dangerous legislation. Were it to be conscribed to would-be terrorists and murderers, I would have no difficulty with that. But this is nothing of the sort. This is a broad-reaching intrusion into the private lives of Australians to foster the ever-increasing size of government agencies which this government has promoted and is paying for out of the taxpayers’ pockets in an age of fear.
I saw an essayist on the weekend—I might get that and read it to the committee a little later tonight—talking about the much healthier role government would have if it explained to us all that we live in an age of insecurity and danger. We have to accept a proportion of that and we have to balance keeping our freedoms with that danger, but we do not have a public debate at that level. The fact that there are only two government representatives in this chamber at the moment shows that the government is not going to engage in that sort of debate. It has the numbers. The executive, the Prime Minister’s office, in this case along with the Attorney-General, has control of the parliament, effectively. There is nobody in the House or in the Senate in the coalition who is going to stand up for what were considered until tonight basic human rights in this country.
Nobody is going to stand up against this gross intrusion on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights—Australians are losing out here to international rights recognised right around the world—and make a stand in favour of the individual. No, this is a Liberal government which believes in the all-important ability to legislate for the collective—that being itself—against the interests of the public. It is an extraordinary turnaround in the way we would expect a government to behave but, then again, this is a government that tramples all over states’ rights after a century of conservatives arguing for states’ right. Here we have a government that is trampling all over individual liberties in this country after a century of arguing that it was the champion of civil liberties. That is now left to the Democrats and the Greens in this place because the opposition, the Labor Party—guess what?—is going to go over and support the government on this legislation.
I will be moving some pretty direct amendments on behalf of the Australian Greens. They do not cover the worries, the anxieties, that people have brought to the Senate committee and that other people obviously would have if they knew about this legislation, but they at least test it out. One of the questions I would like the Attorney’s representative in this chamber, the Minister for Justice and Customs, to explain to us—and I will be pursuing it somewhat in the committee stage—is to what degree, for example, Federal Court judges or members of parliament are going to come under secret eavesdropping by government agencies at the behest of the Attorney-General under this legislation.
I have, as part of the amendments here, a prohibition on Federal Court judges, High Court judges and federal and state members of parliament being listened in to under the extraordinary depth, breadth and reach of this legislation. People listening to this would say—and I would be one of them—immediately: ‘Why should they be protected in a way that other citizens aren’t?’ I agree entirely; I think other citizens should be protected. But I would like to know—and I will be questioning the minister on this—what protection members of parliament, and indeed High Court judges and Federal Court judges, have. Are we crossing the line here between the separation of powers? Does this make judges vulnerable to political snooping? Potentially it does. Does it mean that members of parliament will not have the time-honoured protection from snooping by government ministers’ fiat that they have had in the past?
There are other questions that will be asked. The first amendment I will be making will be to ensure that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Australia’s other obligations to democracy, to the freedoms and rights which we espouse and that we are going overseas to protect, be protected here in Australia.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-03-28,"—I will deal with the questions that Senator Brown mentioned at the appropriate stage, when, no doubt, they will be raised. I would like to thank senators for their contributions to the debate, and I thank the members of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for their efforts in inquiring into the provisions of what is a very important bill. The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006 illustrates the government’s commitment to ensuring that security and law enforcement agencies are equipped with appropriate powers to combat and prevent serious crime, including terrorism. At the same time, the bill reflects the government’s consistent efforts to ensure that there are appropriate privacy protections for the users of Australian telecommunications systems. (Quorum formed)

The implementation of the recommendations of the Blunn report and the regulation of access to communications provide greater certainty and clarity for our law enforcement and regulatory agencies, telecommunications industry participants and users of Australian telecommunications systems. The new stored communications warrant regime implements Tony Blunn’s recommendation for overarching legislation regulating access to communications such as email, voicemail and SMS messages. The new regime strikes a careful balance, on the one hand creating a new prima facie protection for stored communications while on the other creating a defined regime to provide law enforcement agencies with appropriate access.
The bill will also make important amendments to the interception regime to assist agencies to counter measures adopted by persons suspected of serious criminal activity to evade telecommunications interception. Interception under these new amendments will be used only as an investigative tool of last resort and will be subject to strict controls. It will be available only for the investigation of the most serious crimes. The bill achieves an appropriate balance between providing for the access needs of law enforcement and security agencies and maintaining the privacy underpinnings of the interception regime. Strong safeguards already contained in the interception regime will continue to apply. These include restrictions on the use of any intercepted material, as well as independent oversight and annual reporting to the parliament.
I note that there will be amendments moved at the committee stage. There are a number from the opposition and the Democrats, I think, and certainly the government will be moving amendments. The government amendments in part relate to the Senate committee’s consideration of the bill as well as some amendments which have been included to ensure the effective operation of the stored communications regime. But we will deal with those during the committee stage.
These amendments, which I will outline in greater detail at the committee stage, are practical adjustments to the measures in the bill to enhance its operation and to add further accountability measures. The government will continue to consider the recommendations made by the Senate committee in its report in the coming months. In the event that further amendments to the measures in the bill are appropriate, the government would anticipate addressing those issues in the spring session of parliament. This bill demonstrates the government’s commitment to providing comprehensive safeguards for the privacy of communications while ensuring appropriate access for the purposes of combating serious crimes and threats to national security. (Quorum formed)

In relation to the contributions by various senators, some questions were alluded to. I think Senator Brown mentioned some. I would raise one aspect. Senator Stott Despoja compared the Australian situation to the US situation. Certainly it is misleading to compare Australian interception rates with US interception rates. We have totally different legal frameworks. Both the Attorney-General and I have commented on this before. The Attorney-General addressed this comprehensively in the second reading speech. I will not go into great detail here, but it is obvious that, where you have different regimes, you will have varying statistics in relation to interception, be they telephone or otherwise, and to compare them is indeed misleading. In fact, it could be argued that, if you have more warrants issued in a judicial system for the interception of telephones, it could mean that you have greater safeguards in that you have to get warrants for those intercepts and that, in those jurisdictions which have a lesser amount of warrants, there was not a requirement that in every case you have a warrant. That is just one perverse conclusion that could be drawn from a comparison between Australia and the United States. I certainly take issue with that point that was made by Senator Stott Despoja.
This is a very important bill indeed. It is vital for the interests of this country that it be passed. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-03-28,"—What later hour are we considering here? The government brought this legislation on. It controls the business of the house. This is very serious legislation. Senators who are focused on this legislation either want the debate to go ahead or want to know when the government is going to get its business in order so that we can proceed with the debate. The government is having trouble getting a quorum in here—it is back to three members in the chamber again. It might treat this lightly but I do not, and I would like to know when the government perceives that this debate is going to resume. We are not here just to have the government turn the tap on or off. It is a serious matter.
If the government wants to now haul off from a debate it set going this afternoon—peremptorily, because it wanted to put off another piece of legislation which was scheduled, because Senator Fielding is not here—that is one matter. But, having brought this legislation on, we should deal with it. I have heard no good argument from the minister at the table as to why we should now abandon it and go on to a third piece of legislation. That is chaotic. Government should get itself into gear. I want to hear some explanation.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,31,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2006-03-28,"—by leave—The situation, I understand, is that Senator Brown’s office was advised of this procedure. It has the support, as I understand it, of the opposition and the Democrats at least. The government proposed that it would give some time for people to look at the running sheet, which is being produced as we speak, and that the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 1) Bill 2006 could be debated in the meantime. I would envisage that that would take no more than an hour or so. We would back to the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006 at a later hour tonight.
Senator Brown’s office was certainly contacted about this proposal. The Democrats indicated their support for it, and were in fact very keen on having a break. It is fair to say that the opposition was agreeable to this procedure, and the government was as well. There is nothing untoward about this. It is just a matter of commonsense—giving people some time to look at the running sheet and prepare for the debate.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,31,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2006-03-28,"—I understand I do not need leave, because the minister has already spoken. I have some sympathy for Senator Bob Brown’s concern. The government is in charge of the program. However, we are in a situation and circumstance where we need to be understanding. This is effectively the ricochet impact of deferring the family law legislation. In the circumstances of Senator Fielding being ill, we have to be reasonable. As a consequence, the running sheet for the legislation is not ready. It would be simply impractical to continue in those circumstances. Consequently, I can confirm that the Labor opposition has agreed to deal with Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 1) Bill 2006.
It is not an ideal situation, Senator Brown. However, we think that in the circumstances it is reasonable. It would be unreasonable for us to pull up stumps now. We have given a commitment to sit through to 11 tonight—or whatever the time is—so we are working overtime for a couple of hours. That is all part of our responsibilities when the circumstances that I have outlined arise. We are prepared to go on with Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 1) Bill 2006 in the circumstances.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,31,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-03-28,"—by leave—Of course the government will have its way and we will wait another hour and then come back to the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006. Just let me make a couple of points here, though. I am not as compliant with the government in these circumstances as the opposition is. We are sitting on a Tuesday night, the hours of which were arranged yesterday, to complete the third or fourth sitting day of this month in a Senate that now is sitting very little—fewer days than I can recollect during my time in the place. The reason for that is that the government does not want to be under scrutiny here but wants to ram through every piece of legislation it can. The opposition might be compliant about this, but the Greens are not.
The government is reducing the number of days on which the Senate sits yet does not want to reduce its ability to get through all the pieces of legislation. There are two mechanisms by which the government will achieve that. One is to have us sit longer hours on the days we are here than the time-honoured hours which are the maximum for the proper functioning of a Senate. We are not functioning at the moment, because the government has brought this legislation on on a Tuesday night when we should not be sitting. I extend my commiserations to those good people behind the scenes who are trying to get together a running sheet under extreme duress and pressure. This is March; it is not December. They never should be put under that pressure. But everybody bows to the Prime Minister’s wish that this Senate simply rubber-stamp everything that comes out of his office with a minimum of fuss.
The second mechanism that we have seen, and will see more and more use of, is the gag or the guillotine to cut off debate on important matters like this so that the government will not sit more days but will get that legislation through. The opposition might shrug its shoulders and say: ‘Oh, well. We can’t do much about that.’ The Greens do not accept that at all. What is happening here is a debasement of the parliament now that Prime Minister Howard and his coalition have control of both houses. This is a manifestation of the abuse of the Senate by the government, and I do not take that lightly and nor do my colleagues.
Yes, we will have a one-hour break and then come back and deal with some other legislation, because it is convenient for the government and Mr Howard. The honourable Prime Minister wants it all put through the Senate with no fuss, because the Senate does not matter. I take a different attitude. It is a hugely important institution. Whether the government has control of it or not, I differ from the opposition. It is our job to halt the government in its tracks and take the time that the public interest demands we take on extraordinary legislation like this and deal with it adequately. This should be done properly and in a coordinated fashion, not in a stop-start fashion such as is being exemplified by the mismanagement of the Senate here tonight.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,31,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-03-28,—I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill. The memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 28 March 2006.,SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-03-28,"—I would like to raise some general matters going to a number of recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee which went to issues that perhaps could not easily be put in a format consistent necessarily with an amendment. I refer particularly to recommendation 6, which states:
The Committee recommends that, consistent with the existing arrangements for telecommunications interception, immediate action be taken to ensure the enforceability of the stored communications provisions on State and Territory agencies by requiring complementary legislation to be enacted as a precondition to being granted the powers of an enforcement agency under the stored communications regime.
This is a matter that has been utilised by the Attorney-General’s Department in the past where they have put preconditions before they allow a state authority to be granted that power. In fact, one notable example of recent times comes to mind where there was a requirement for matters to be dealt with before the Attorney-General would indicate that they could utilise that interception power. In looking at that provision, the committee considered it essential that the Commonwealth has the ability to enforce the obligations prescribed in the bill relating to accessing stored communications:
... immediate action be taken to ensure the enforceability of the stored communications provisions on State and Territory agencies ...
The report states at paragraph 3.65:
The Committee considers that consistent with the arrangement for the existing telecommunications interception regime, State and Territory Parliaments should be required to enact complementary legislation for access to stored communications as a precondition to being granted the powers of an enforcement agency under the stored communications regime.
It is recognised that there is a particularly short time frame to enact this legislation and ensure that it can start. I note that there is obviously a requirement that the matters be brought to a conclusion this week—that seems to be the government view. But these matters could be dealt with by an undertaking here by the government that they will abide by the existing arrangements in place and that they intend to ensure that those matters are dealt with as they have been dealt with in the past.
States have accessed telecommunications interception that way. In terms of stored communications, although it is a different warrant regime it is still a warrant regime that is designed to ensure that there is an appropriate and proper regime in place to process stored communications. It would also allow state governments to utilise the regime while being bound to ensure that they meet all the privacy concerns that have been raised during the committee and by the submitters to it. I think those sorts of issues could be dealt with by the government providing an undertaking to that effect.
Also, more generally—I will move on, but I will come back to that particular issue—and it is really only a case of reiterating what I had an opportunity to say in part during the second reading stage of the debate: this process has effectively been shortened by the government’s desire to bring this legislation forward in this manner. I can complain a number of times about that, and I suspect I will come back to a couple of complaints, but it is perhaps best to get that out of the way early and get it off my chest. There could have been a better process in place. The government chose not to ensure that there was a better process.
I have no complaint about the way the Blunn review was sought, obtained and finalised. The government followed committee recommendations on what was effectively a very difficult issue. I guess I am coming to how you work out what you do with stored communications; how you ensure that there is a balance, with privacy concerns being taken into consideration and safeguarded; and how you then deal with ensuring that our law enforcement agencies have appropriate powers to fight crime. Up to that point, one could only say that the government had acted reasonably, but we find that in the second part, which is the part where the legislation to effect the Blunn review recommendations has come forward, it is disappointing to see that the government is now rushing the parliament. It could have been done in a more metered and better way. It could have been phased in. It could have been brought forward in parts that were able to be dealt with—particularly the stored communications regime. It is a positive regime and is recognised as a positive regime to protect people’s privacy. That could have been the first tranche of this review of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979.
Blunn recognised that this will not be the first or last time that this legislation will be reviewed. It seems that the government has cobbled together some issues that could have and would have been better dealt with at a later stage. Having said that, the submitters to the committee also recognised that they were being short-changed in terms of time and their ability to engage in the committee process. That is my second complaint: legislation should be subject to quality review by the committee. Submitters should have sufficient time to examine legislation and have reasonable time to ensure that their responses are both qualitative and quantitative in the sense of being able to ensure that they deal with all the issues, deal with them in a qualitative way and highlight the issues that they want to, rather than being put through the test of being rushed through, sometimes without being able to consider their submissions and look at other submissions. That would ensure that the process is the best one possible. Also, the committee must be able to ensure, when it hears from submitters, that it has sufficient time to listen to submitters, query submitters and give them a reasonable opportunity to come back on issues that may need to be clarified. The submitters in this instance were given a very short timetable to turn around any responses or queries the committee might have had.
The argument from the government might be that that was driven by the necessity of meeting the deadline. The government set that deadline. It could have changed the deadline if it so desired; it could have extended it further; it could have done a range of things to mitigate it. It did not. We then have to deal with the reality that the government is setting the deadline and driving to it. It is easier if I get those complaints out of the way first, rather than make them every time I stand up to deal with an amendment. I know they are legitimate complaints and I think that in this instance the government has failed to allow the committee to adequately scrutinise this bill in a holistic way. Coming back to the undertaking I suggested: if the government wants to provide that, it would be helpful.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-03-28,"—As I said earlier, the government will continue to consider the recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, and that consideration will take place over the coming months. In the event that further amendments are necessary, the government anticipates addressing those issues in the spring sittings this year. I cannot give an undertaking on the run tonight as to whether any particular recommendation will be adopted or not, but I can say that the government will consider recommendations made by the Senate committee in its report. The Attorney-General has made that clear and I reiterate that tonight. I think that is relevant to the point that Senator Ludwig has made.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-03-28,"—I heard the response in respect of that matter. There are a couple of other matters that I want to deal with before we start on the amendments themselves. One question relates to recommendation 20. The issue there is the government’s view in respect of recommendation 20, in that the committee recommended:
... that the proposed section 46(3) (which contains the requirement that the issuing authority must not issue a B-party warrant unless he or she is satisfied that the agency has exhausted all other practicable methods of identifying the telecommunications services used) be amended to exclude the word ‘practicable’...
However, it comes to mind that there may be some practical, as distinct from practicable, problems with that approach. The essence of recommendation 20 was to ensure that B-party warrants are used as a last resort. I think that was proposed in the government’s explanatory memorandum. As I understand it, with recommendation 20 the committee wanted to ensure that the amendment not only reflected the explanatory memorandum but also ensured that the legislation provided for B-party warrants to be used as a last resort and recorded that.
Labor have not at this stage moved an amendment to delete that. We first wanted to hear the government’s view regarding recommendation 20. We obviously have a little time and, if we see the need to persist with that amendment, we will. But before we consider that we want to see whether the government, in any of its amendments or, subsequently, during any further review, is going to strengthen the last resort provision and whether it sees any difficulty with deleting the word ‘practicable’.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-03-28,"—The government is not dealing with that aspect at this point in time. That would be one of the matters which would fall into the category that I mentioned earlier—it would be considered over the coming months. At this stage, the government is inclined to oppose any amendment which would reflect that, but that does not mean to say that the government would not continue to give consideration to these recommendations. As I said earlier, these matters have not been included in the government amendments tonight because the government is not prepared to give an undertaking one way or another on those particular issues tonight. That is why the Attorney-General has left the gate open, so to speak, on the consideration of recommendations generally made by the committee.
We have picked up some of the recommendations made by the committee, and they are reflected in the amendments which the government are moving tonight. But, as for the remainder, at this stage we are not prepared to make them the subject of amendments—notwithstanding the fact that we would still continue to consider those recommendations. As in recommendation 16, I appreciate the point Senator Ludwig made, but the government’s view is that at this stage we cannot give an undertaking as to support or otherwise. If we were pushed to the issue so that we had to vote on it tonight because of an amendment which reflected those recommendations then the government would oppose that.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-03-28,"—That is farcical. The government has dumped this legislation, which is a total overreach and an invasion of the rights of Australians, on the Senate and on the people of Australia. There was a very short Senate inquiry, peak national legal and other bodies submitted to that inquiry, and the government says, ‘We’ve got some amendments which pick up a couple of recommendations from that inquiry, but we say to the Labor opposition, “Trust us; we’ll look at others further down the line.”’ What sort of process is that? This is the makings of a gross invasion of the privacy rights of innocent people in Australia. It is not antiterrorist law. I cannot ask the minister, ‘Is this antiterrorist law?’ It would be a waste of time because the minister does not really know. He is here doing the Attorney-General’s bidding.
What we do know is that this is a massive increase in the ability of surveillance agencies, ultimately controlled by the government of the day—this Attorney-General and this Prime Minister—to look into private affairs. We all know that the communications being looked at here can be of the most intimate affairs between individuals who are entirely innocent and not even suspected of anything. It is such loose and degrading legislation that the spy agencies involved—and we go beyond spy agencies, because a number of agencies are now involved—will be able to pry into people’s private business without suspecting them of anything. They will be able to keep records of that and potentially pick people up for some other breach of the law which has nothing to do with what the agency set out to track because of what until now would have been illegal snooping on the privacy of Australians.
Let me give comment here from an article written by Mr George Williams and Mr David Hume. We know what remarkably incisive minds they bring to this legislation. On Friday in the Hobart Mercury they wrote:
Federal Parliament is to … debate next week a law that conjures up modern-day images of Big Brother.
That is this law we are dealing with here now, which the government is saying to the opposition: ‘Trust us. Wait a while. We might ameliorate it a bit with some later amendments.’ That is nonsense. Mr Williams and Mr Hume said:
The Bill will allow the Government to read our private emails, SMSs and other stored communications, without our knowledge.
The power will extend even to innocent people, called B-parties, if they have been unlucky enough to communicate with someone who is suspected of a crime, or of being a threat to national security.
The Government should sometimes be able to monitor the communications of innocent people.
This may be necessary to protect the wider community, where a suspect can only be tracked down through another person.
However, the Bill goes far beyond what can be justified and undermines our right to privacy more than is needed to properly enforce the law.
Our key concerns are that, first, the Government will be able to collect not only the communications between the B-party and the suspect—
that is, the innocent person and the suspect—
but also communications between the B-party and anyone else.
If you are unfortunate enough to communicate with someone suspected of an offence and, therefore, you become a B party, the government may be able to monitor conversations you have ‘with family members, friends, work colleagues, your lawyer, your doctor and so on, no matter what you spoke about’. The article continues:
Your most private and intimate conversations could be pored over, without your knowledge, by people you have never met.
This is Australia 2006 in the Howard era. Messrs Williams and Hume go on to say:
Second, in some circumstances, the Government can use the information it collects even though that information is irrelevant to the original suspect.
For example, if the Government uncovers incriminating information from listening to a B-party’s—
that is, an innocent person’s—
conversations, this can set off a chain reaction, allowing the interception of the incriminated person’s communications or of anyone with whom they communicate.
The Government could use this information to initiate a prosecution, even if it relates only to a minor offence.
Third, the Bill sets a very low threshold for ASIO to be granted a warrant.
As long as ASIO has tried other means of tracking a suspect, it only needs to show that intercepting the B-party’s—
that is, the innocent person’s—
communications is likely to assist in obtaining intelligence related to security.
This is a very wide power, particularly since, once ASIO meets the threshold, it can intercept any communications to or from the B-Party—
that is, the innocent party.
Fourth, the threshold that ASIO must satisfy uses general terms such as likely to assist and relating to security.
This vagueness creates the potential for Government agencies to misuse the power or apply it in an arbitrary fashion.
This arbitrariness extends to another aspect of the Bill. It differentiates between stored communications—
like email and SMS—
and real-time communications—
like telephone conversations.
Under the Bill, it is much easier to access stored communications, apparently because SMS and email are thought to be less private than telephone conversations.
However, now that telephone conversations often occur in public on mobile phones, many people, and particularly young people, reserve their most personal interactions for email and SMS.
These problems have been compounded by the speed with which the Government has sought to push the Bill through Parliament.
Interested parties were given only 10 days to prepare submissions on the 90-page Bill. The Senate Committee responsible for reviewing it has only two weeks to the review the submissions, hear evidence and prepare a report.
That is all over and done, since last Friday, and here is the minister saying, ‘Oh well, we’ll look at those after the bill has passed, if you don’t mind.’ Mr Williams and Mr Hume went on to say:
The dangers of a bad process are especially high because, as just one part of a recent torrent of anti-terrorism legislation, it is easy for bad legislation such as this to slip by unnoticed and unamended.
Protecting our national security and investigating serious crime are important goals.
However, we must be careful that in developing a legal response we do not lose sight of the rights and freedoms we are trying to protect.
We should ensure that, where the Government is to gain intrusive new powers over our privacy, these powers are balanced and go no further than is needed.
They conclude with this:
This Bill for surveillance powers over our emails and SMSs goes too far.
It contains more power than is needed over too broad a range of innocent communications and contains too few safeguards.
The Government should go back to the drawing board to come up with a better proposal.
What a great piece of legislation for the opposition to be supporting!",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-03-28,"—There are a couple of other matters that I also particularly want to get the government’s view on. I am going to start with another complaint—maybe I will get them out of the way earlier rather than later, during the substantive amendments. The government’s attitude is really quite surprising in respect of this process which we are now going to embark upon. Labor have sought to circulate in the chamber, albeit a little late, as best we could, amendments which give effect to many of the important recommendations contained in the committee report to ensure that the bill strikes the right balance between privacy and the requirements of law enforcement agencies—which is a difficult balancing act, may I say. But it is one that still has to be achieved. There is a legitimate role for law enforcement agencies to fight crime with the types of provisions contained in this bill.
There is also, of course, a responsibility on us to ensure that the right balance is struck, because it is important to ensure people’s individual privacy is respected and preserved. It is also important to ensure that the bill does not have any unintended consequences and that its provisions are clear and do not offend any laws unintentionally and people can operate under them in a way they can understand. But what we hear tonight is that the government will move through with the bill, then come back and continue to look at the recommendations to see how they might still be required. So some way down the track we may—or may not—find out whether it has subsequently been decided to pick up any of the recommendations. We may not even know when the government has decided not to pursue them. The legislation—as I think Blunn himself said—will still need review and, as the government has indicated, this is only part of the legislation.
What the government could do to alleviate a lot of the concerns—that even Senator Brown has—is move forward with the part of the legislation that is in fact a positive development from the status quo in relation to stored communications under section 3L of the Crimes Act, which allows agencies to access stored communications using what I refer to as ordinary search warrants. This is needed because it will improve privacy and ensure that there is an appropriate access regime. The amendments that the government have, to fix up some of the unintended consequences and some of the suggestions made by the committee, would produce an outcome that would be far superior to the present position.
We could leave schedule 2 for another time. We could continue with schedules 4, 5 and 6, which effectively are the matters that can be picked up. We know that schedule 3 relates to providing unique identifiers of handsets. That is a positive addition and does protect people’s privacy. The amendment of class 1 and class 2 in schedule 4 is a positive development. It indicates that the issuing authority has to take privacy into consideration, and therefore it is a substantial improvement to the law as it currently stands. Schedules 5 and 6 are helpful. They are procedural more than anything else and we can see the necessity for them.
That would be a way forward other than the way that the minister intends to proceed with tonight, but I do not think I am going to be able to convince the government to adopt it, although it would be a much better course. So I am going to have to deal with the matters as they arise. If the government could indicate whether or not it is keen to undertake that process, that would be helpful, but I will not hold my breath.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1,speech

However, if any of the provision(s) do not commence within the period of 6 months beginning on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent, they commence on the first day after the end of that period.
This amends the commencement provisions in relation to schedules 1, 2 and 3 of the bill to provide that these schedules commence on a day to be fixed by proclamation. This amendment is required to ensure the necessary amendments to the Telecommunications (Interceptions) Regulations 1987 are made prior to the commencement of schedules 1, 2 and 3 of the bill.

4 Sunset clause
The amendments set out in Schedule 2 of this Act cease to be in force on 30 June 2011.

61C Review of operation of B-party warrants
         (1)    The Minister must cause an independent review of the operation of warrants to which subparagraph 46(1)(d)(ii) or (1)(a)(ia) applies to be undertaken within 12 months of the third anniversary of the commencement of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amend-ment Act 2006.
         (2)    A person who undertakes such a review must give the Minister a written report.
         (3)    The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days after the Minister receives the report.
I move these amendments together because they relate to sunset and review, or review and sunset as the case may be, so it is more appropriate to deal with them together. A range of submitters suggested that the legislation should be reviewed after a period of time and/or that the inclusion of a sunset clause was necessary. In fact the Law Council themselves indicated during the committee process—in their submission and in their oral evidence to the committee—that an independent review two or three years after commencement, and a sunset clause, should be incorporated into the legislation.
Mr Blunn, in the Blunn review, recognised that there was a strong case for regular reviews at three-yearly intervals. In fact, he went a bit further and even proposed effectively, in my words, a standing committee. We think at this juncture a sunset provision to ensure that the legislation is reviewed and, given the nature of it—particularly the way B-party provisions would operate—is a necessity, and we see no reason why the government cannot adopt this provision. It is not technical in nature; it is one that the government has recognised in other legislation of this type. It is one that they have, in fact, embodied in other legislation of this type themselves, in the criminal area, in dealing with terrorist legislation and in other areas of that ilk. And, of course, Dr Clapham from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner supported a review. In fact, he went to the entire act and felt that provisions should be made in these amendments.
The legislation committee recommended the B-party provisions expire in five years with a review at an earlier time encompassing the broader issues about the suitability of issuing authorities. They are matters that should be dealt with. The committee made those recommendations after hearing the evidence of a range of submitters. The government should be persuaded by the force of a unanimous committee. I should say it was a majority committee, at least between government and opposition. I neglected to admit there was another report but I am sure you will go to that, Senator Stott Despoja. In a majority report dealing with these issues the committee accordingly recommended that the B-party provisions expire in five years, with a review at an earlier time.
Labor supports this recommendation for two reasons. This bill does not bring about the full recommendations of the Blunn report. We are still to see that finalised and, in fact, it is likely to take some time. Therefore, as we will be revisiting this bill, it does obviously provide us with an opportunity to also be able to review it as well. As the B-party intercept regime will be a new component of the legislation it is important that it is also reviewed to see if the regime is meeting the issues that have been raised—that is, it is meeting privacy concerns, that the safeguards that surround those privacy issues are working and that law enforcement agencies are not over-reaching in the B-party intercepts regime. For those reasons Labor supports the amendments and seeks that the government agree that they are both necessary to ensure that the legislation will, in fact, work the way it was intended.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2006-03-28,"—The Australian Democrats will be supporting the amendments moved on behalf of the Australian Labor Party by Senator Ludwig. He is quite right to point out that there was a supplementary report with ‘additional dissenting comments’, which I think was the long-worded title of the Australian Democrats’ report. I wish to emphasise the fact that we did do a report to that committee—that we were involved in that committee process albeit with a truncated time line. Nonetheless, I think it was—as it always is—a worthwhile process to allow people to provide submissions, both in writing and verbally, and to hear from and question the department, which, as always, is keen to present to the committee and I think is usually extremely helpful in answering our questions.
I think there are, though, very good reasons for a review of this legislation and in particular—dealing with the first amendment of the Labor Party—the proposed sunset clause. Predictably, I would argue that a five-year period is insufficient, but it is better than the bill in its current form. Senator Ludwig has, of course, referred to the recommendations of the committee, and the Democrats actually support the recommendations of that majority committee report. We think that they should have gone further, hence the additional recommendations contained in my report. Nonetheless, the committee view in relation to a sunset clause and independent review is a recommendation that we endorse. The actual committee report says:
The Committee considers a sunset clause to be appropriate for the B-party interception warrant provisions; it would serve as a catalyst for a review of the whole telecommunications interception structure, and in the light of advancing technology would offer an opportunity to assess the adequacy or otherwise of this regime.
So, in light of this recommendation that has strong support from those of us who were involved in the committee process, but also support from members of the government because, as Senator Ludwig has quite rightly pointed out, this is a majority recommendation from a majority committee report—the chair’s report—I would hope that the government would consider it. I do not think this is a particularly scary amendment. I think it is an accountable amendment that makes a lot of sense and I would hope that the government would support it and, if not, would outline specifically what the problem is with this particular amendment.
It would be better if we were dealing with a time frame of, say, three years. Anything sooner—when you are dealing with such fundamental, such significant legislation—I think is good. I think we should recognise the Blunn report recommendations in relation to a three-year period in order to, if nothing else, keep up to date with evolving technology—so it is not even from the perspective of guarding rights or protections or understanding how the act is operating or whether there are infringements or issues. From the perspective of the technology and the rapid advancement of that technology, surely there is a very strong argument for regular review and, indeed, update. I think it provides a good opportunity to address whether or not the specifics of the warrant regime are working and are appropriate.
In relation to amendment (19), while that deals specifically with the B-party warrants, I think the arguments apply to both. I think certainly there is a strong case for independent review, as has been proposed. The Australian Democrats strongly support any kind of public accountability provision. Obviously, there is built into this amendment the idea of the tabling of that particular report or review in both houses of parliament, which is a stipulation that we would always make. So, with some proviso, there is certainly support from the Australian Democrats for this amendment—in fact, for both amendments.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-03-28,"—The government does not think that these amendments are particularly scary, as Senator Stott Despoja mentioned. The government does not think they are necessary for two reasons. Firstly, as I have indicated earlier, the government will be considering further recommendations from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee report. That in itself is an ongoing consideration which has been firmly committed to by the government during the course of this year.
Added to that, in relation to the B-party warrants, government amendments (16) and (17) will involve more detail in relation to the reporting of B-party interceptions. That will provide that, in the reporting to the parliament, there will be more information given in relation to those B-party interceptions. That in itself will provide the parliament with an ability to be well informed of the B-party interceptions. That in itself is an aspect of accountability, scrutiny and, indeed, review if the parliament wants to review any of those reports. We see reports in this chamber all the time. There is debate and discussion. We think that, for those two reasons, it is unnecessary. We have had the Blunn report, which was extensive. We have acted on that. We have had the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee report.
Indeed, the genesis of all of this goes back to 2004. I remember very clearly the difference between the Australian Federal Police and the Attorney-General’s Department which was much publicised at the time. That was in relation to the differing views to these interceptions, which were made more problematic by virtue of modern technology. The question then being asked was whether an email was a letter or a telephone call, as someone put it at that time. We had to address that. We have been doing that over the last two years. We have had the Blunn report and Senate committee reports. I really do think that to incorporate any further review mechanism in this legislation would be unwieldy, particularly when you have regard to those other two matters that I mentioned.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-03-28,"—I will not miss the opportunity, if you are going to have a look at this provision a bit further, to also impress upon you that there are two parts to recommendation 25. We did not seek to move an amendment to give effect to the second part, because it really surrounded a broader number of issues. That encompassed the suitability and effectiveness of the AAT members in the warrant-issuing regime together with consideration of ways in which the act may be amended to take account of emerging technologies such as peer-to-peer technology. There are a couple of others that I will not go to now given the lateness of the hour, but there are a number of emerging technologies.
Just so that it is on the record, if you are going to look at it, it is not limited to only those matters of review of the legislation to date but also it encompasses those issues that are a bit broader in compass. There is an important consideration to be looked at about the issuing authority. There is a significant number of these warrants being obtained through the issuing authorities and, more particularly, reliance placed on the AAT. I think there needs to be an explanation as to why that is, if not an examination to ensure that the system is working effectively and efficiently—also that it is not too efficient, in the sense that privacy considerations are not overlooked. That matter should also be included.

Insert:
2A Limitations of operation of Act
It is the intention of the Parliament that:
         (1)    To the extent that there is any inconsistency between this Act and Australia’s obligations under international treaties including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Australia’s obligations under those treaties prevail and override the operation of this Act.
         (2)    Nothing in this Act authorises the interception of communications:
              (a)    of a person unless the person is suspected of engaging in the planning of, or other involvement in, terrorist acts or murder;
              (b)    where those communications contain information which is:
                    (i)    the subject of legal professional privilege; or
                   (ii)    derived from information that is the subject of legal professional privilege.
              (c)    where those communications contain information:
                    (i)    the subject of doctor-patient confidential medical communications; or
                   (ii)    derived from information that is the subject of doctor-patient confidential medical communications.
              (d)    of Federal or State Members of Parliament;
              (e)    of High Court judges or Federal Court judges.
The amendment is to limit the operation of this legislation. It badly needs its wings clipped. That is of course not going to happen, because the government has the numbers.
—Thank goodness for that.
—Senator Boswell, who has not been about tonight, says, ‘Thank goodness for that.’ You are waiting for the 11 o’clock finish, aren’t you? Because he has not been here for the debate, he must not know what is in this legislation, or he would be horrified.
The Greens amendment limits this legislation, which allows government agencies—a whole stack of them—to catch SMSs and listen in to phone calls, mobile communications and all of the things totally innocent Australians use these days. We are wanting to limit that massive intrusion on the right of Australians not to be snooped on by government when they are innocent. This is not about terrorism; this is about a whole range of things—taxes, quarantine and a whole pile of other things.
Senator Boswell might be amazed to know that totally innocent Australians can have their intimate phone conversations with their loved ones tapped by a whole range of government snoops, not in the name of terrorism—it has nothing to do with that—but a whole range of other issues. The Greens are here doing the Liberals’ job of defending the rights of the Australian individual—time honoured since our democracy came into being. Many Liberal legislators of the past would be horrified to know that a conservative government which has the numbers in both houses of parliament has taken this opportunity to legislate against those rights.
The Greens limitations are very short of the mark. They should be much more complex, but we recognise the number situation in here and we are just prepared to put some things on the line. The first part of this amendment—if it were to be adopted—would ensure that:
(1) To the extent that there is any inconsistency between this Act and Australia’s obligations under international treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Australia’s obligations under those treaties prevail and override the operation of this Act.
I will be interested to hear what the Minister for Justice and Customs has to say about ensuring that Australians have the protection of an international covenant on rights that we have been trying to get China not only to adopt—as it has—but also to implement and that we are trying to get countries with dictatorships to take notice of. Australia was busy in formulating and bringing into being the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights but, as has been pointed out by senior legal authorities in this country, this legislation cuts right through the safeguards that that covenant, which Australia has ratified, should be giving to Australian citizens who are innocent of any wrongdoing.
The second Green qualification on this act reads this way:
(2) Nothing in this Act authorises the interception of communications—
and you can read there: ‘by government snoops under the direction of people like Attorney-General Ruddock’—
(a) of a person unless the person is suspected of engaging in the planning of, or other involvement in, terrorist acts or murder;
Let us qualify this legislation by preventing people from being involved in violent crime. The minister might like to say what the limitation is if it is not terrorist acts or murder. Where does the throw of the net in this legislation stop? The amendment continues:
(2) Nothing in this Act authorises the interception of communications:
(b) where those communications contain information which is:
(i) the subject of legal professional privilege; or
(ii) derived from information that is the subject of legal professional privilege.
(c) where those communications contain information:
(i) the subject of doctor-patient confidential medical communications; or
(ii) derived from information that is the subject of doctor-patient confidential medical communications.
We ask: why should innocent people be opened up to their phones being tapped and their computers being intruded upon for personal information, particularly where they expect they are confidentially passing information to their professional legal adviser or their doctor? If the government or, for that matter, the opposition, which supports this bill, are not prepared to support this vital Greens amendment, let us hear from them as to why the confidentiality expected between innocent citizens and their doctor or their lawyer should not be respected anymore in this great democracy of ours, which this government is eroding day by day as parliament sits—short as that time might be now that the government has control of the Senate. The Greens amendment goes on to say:
(2) Nothing in this Act authorises the interception of communications:
(d) of Federal or State Members of Parliament; or
(e) of High Court judges or Federal Court judges.
I ask, through you, Temporary Chairman Watson, of the Minister for Justice and Customs how the government could possibly be contemplating, as it does in this legislation, allowing spying by government agencies on members of the High Court of Australia or judges of the Federal Court of Australia. It is dangerous territory, don’t you think, Temporary Chairman? And it is all the more remarkable because this can be done not related to any act of terrorism or violence—it might be a taxation matter. It is dangerous territory indeed because it crosses that barrier, the separation of the functions of the judiciary and those of the executive—in this case, the Howard government which, as my colleague Senator Milne has said on a number of occasions, stands before the flag, puts its wattle in its lapel and calls on the name of ANZAC but, like no government before, rips away piece by piece at the time honoured conventions and protections of the right of the individual in this country. It is extraordinary, is it not, that the Greens are standing in defence of those rights, as the Howard government strips them away?
Progress reported.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-03-28,"—I rise tonight to speak about why Australia is the hub for superannuation fund management applications in the Asia-Pacific region. An Australian government advertisement in Hong Kong’s The Financial Times states that, over the last two decades, Australia’s investment management industry has developed into one of the most significant and dynamic components of the Australian financial services sector. Economies of scale in the Australian investment management industry have created a cluster of local and international investment management companies with a large number establishing or expanding existing operations to service the Australian region.
Of the world’s largest 20 global international managers, as reported by Pensions and Investment Magazine, 16 have a significant presence in Australia, reinforcing Australia’s position as the funds management hub of the Asia-Pacific region. Ranked the most resilient economy in the world for the fourth year in succession, the strength of the Australian economy has been confirmed by 14 years of uninterrupted economic growth at a rate well above the global average. This backdrop in the rapid growth of Australia’s compulsory pension savings has contributed to a strong, sophisticated and innovative financial services sector. Australia offers global financial institutions opportunities in a rapidly expanding domestic market and is an ideal location for the servicing of markets in the Asia time zone. This leads me to one of the most important reasons for Australia’s success in this area: our geographic advantage.
Australia is often referred to as the gateway to Asia, and this is true. We operate in the same time zone as all of Asia, and our Stock Exchange bridges the US and European markets in a way that none of the Asian ones do. A notable expansion from the Australian shores recently has been expansion of the National Australia Bank’s wealth-management arm into China. In fact, NAB’s chief executive for Australia and Asia, Ahmed Fahour, hopes that the bank’s China operation will one day rival its $8 billion-plus UK operations. Australia is one of the most multicultural and multilingual nations in the world, giving Australian based companies ready access to Asian languages services. Australia has strong legal and accounting regimes and a tax system that increasingly recognises the importance of Australia as a financial services hub.
A further interesting observation is that Asians—and Japanese people in particular—are much better savers than most Australians tend to be. For example, the Japanese place a higher preference on protecting their household assets rather than increasing returns, but I believe this could well change over time. Australia also has excellent relations with the nations of the Asia-Pacific region. We have very strong trading relationships with China and Japan, and we are working closely with South Korea, Indonesia and India. This is especially significant when you consider that the Asian market has enormous potential for growth.
When I recently chaired a conference in Hong Kong, I was astounded at the latent promise represented by the expanding Asian middle class and the growth of the pension market. According to data gathered by Axiss Australia, Australia has the most resilient economy in the world, significantly outscoring regional competitors such as Japan, Singapore and Korea. This is due in no small part to the fiscal responsibility and the steady hand of the Howard government. Australia is the most politically stable nation in the region, which gives investors a high degree of confidence in doing business with Australian companies. Another important reason Australia is so dominant in the Asia-Pacific region is that we were the second nation in the world to privatise pension fund management after Chile. I think five others have followed suit. We have had a lot of experience in the area of privatisation of pensions. This means that the Australian private sector has the most experience in pension fund management and that our regulatory framework is the most mature and well-developed. This is recognised as a fact in Asia.
It is by using this framework and experience that Australian private sector companies are able to sell their expertise to the Asia-Pacific region, even in competitive markets such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. Australians are everywhere in financial markets in these areas. The AFG Global Funds Management Index shows that Australians have more money in managed funds per capita than any other developed nations. Australians have an average of $US45,300 invested in managed funds, compared with $US37,038 in the US.
I remind the Senate that the growth in superannuation fund contributions in the next decade will have a significant impact on the make-up of the ownership of securities on the Australian Stock Exchange. The returns from equities investment in the past two years have been quite phenomenal, and now we have the All Ordinaries Index passing the phenomenal 5,000 mark. The return of commodity prices to long-term average results over the next few years will see a pressure on yields as too much money from retirement savings and other sources is put into the equities market. It will not help Australia’s development if this money goes into overseas rather than Australian equities where some markets now appear quite attractive compared with investing in local infrastructure, particularly in an environment in which overseas countries are lifting their interest rates. Employers regard contributing to employees’ superannuation as a significant cost imposition. Friends from across the water in New Zealand are not surprised that they can compete successfully with Australia because of employee taxes, such as superannuation and payroll taxes. I remind the Senate that raising the current nine per cent, as some suggest, would severely punish business, particularly small business struggling with competition from low-cost Asian countries.
While an employer contributes nine per cent of ordinary time earnings to qualifying employees through their fund, this nine per cent of the employer’s reduces to 7.6 per cent for actual investment purposes after that terrible contributions tax. Hence, I support the idea of the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin, of eliminating the contributions tax as that would encourage savings. In financial circles there is a lot of support for abolition of this tax. Why? Because it is non-inflationary and it will go a long way towards increasing the competitiveness of the Australian market and raising retirement savings very significantly—well in excess of the $A3 billion in contributions tax currently paid to government.
Significant advances have been made of late by the Australian government, including Senator Coonan’s generous co-contribution arrangements to boost retirement savings for low-income Australians. Other advances have included removing the work test and allowing Australians under 65 years of age to contribute to superannuation, the abolition of the surcharge, providing access to superannuation for those who are working and are over the retirement age and allowing those with spouses to split contributions. In all these areas Australia is really leading the world. When you look to the UK there is not the political will to do the sorts of things that we have been prepared to do in Australia. So it is not surprising that we are leaders and that Asians and others are looking to Australia because we have the skills. In the last 10 years, I remind the Senate, the volume of superannuation savings has increased threefold, while the number of funds has fallen from 5,000 to 1,200 and, because of the new licensing arrangements, is anticipated to reduce by 1 July this year to about 420 or maybe even 410.
To conclude, Australia has one of the most dynamic and sophisticated superannuation fund management frameworks in the world and is in an excellent position to secure the Asia-Pacific market and to secure our position as a regional financial services hub. Exciting times lie ahead as Australian firms continue to expand into Asia. It is my hope that our experience and innovation will ensure that Australia will be in a strong position in the future, as we are now.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Superannuation</title>,Adjournment,35,1,speech
