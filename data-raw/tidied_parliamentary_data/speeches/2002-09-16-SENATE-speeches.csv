"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-09-16,"—I will briefly speak to Senator Brown's amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, which is before the chair. In a sense, the amendments that stand in the names of Senator Brown and Senator Murray deal with relatively straightforward principles, but the amendments themselves are complex in terms of their effect. We have said that, in the view of the opposition, these amendments should be thoroughly examined by the relevant committee, which is the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. We have not been able to get the agreement of the Senate to do this and unfortunately neither these amendments nor this legislation will be examined by the joint standing committee. There is a concern—and I think senators have reflected it in the chamber—that decisions will be made about amendments perhaps without sufficient consideration of the implications. In that circumstance, the opposition have determined the approach that we will take to the two amendments. In saying that—and I will outline that position to the chamber—I still stress the fact that a preferred course of action would be for the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to look at these issues.
The amendment that stands in the name of Senator Murray, and that will be put to the committee, will insert a new section into the Commonwealth Electoral Act to the effect that the provisions of section 588FE of the Corporations Law apply to all donations made by a company to a political party or candidate. I have indicated to this committee before that the question of importing concepts from the Corporations Law to the Commonwealth Electoral Act is problematic. In many ways it is like trying to put a square peg in a round hole. For example, the Democrat amendment means that a liquidator will have to determine if a donation by a company to a political party is an uncommercial transaction under the Corporations Law. If a company, as defined in the Corporations Law, is insolvent, then the insolvency provisions, including section 588FE, apply. Section 588FE(3) of the Corporations Law states that a transaction is voidable, provided it is an uncommercial transaction. And the term `uncommercial transaction' is defined in section 588FB:
(1) A transaction of a company is an uncommercial transaction of the company if, and only if, it may be expected that a reasonable person in the company's circumstances would not have entered into the transaction, having regard to: 
(a) the benefits (if any) to the company of entering into the transaction; and 
(b) the detriment to the company of entering into the transaction; and 
(c) the respective benefits to other parties to the transaction of entering into it; and 
(d) any other relevant matter. 
The section of the Corporations Law that the Democrats, through Senator Murray, are asking to be applied to political parties may not deliver what is required here. Benefits in a commercial context are very different to those provided from donations or gifts. I would be interested if Senator Murray would care to address that issue. The other issue it is important to keep in mind is that these sections apply specifically to registered companies, which I know Senator Murray acknowledges. Not only do I query whether the companies donating money to political parties are always registered companies— which is an issue in itself—I also query whether the obligations of political parties should be equated directly with the obligations of those companies. 
These are the sorts of important issues that, in a perfect world, would have been better examined in more detail and at some length in the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Not only are political parties regulated differently to companies; they have different obligations that flow from their vastly different role in society. Companies are generally focused on profit, and we hope that political parties are not-for-profit organisations. Companies are responsible to shareholders and their customers, while political parties ought to be accountable to their members, to the public, to their supporters, to the parliament—to the wider body politic, if you like. Quite rightly, donations to political parties from companies that later go belly up have received considerable attention over recent times. HIH's massive $800,000 donations to the Liberal Party, and Enron's donations to the US Republican Party have caught the public eye, as have a range of other donations. The chief executives of those companies, as we all appreciate, should have been more responsible. Businesses in trouble ought to consider very carefully the extent of donations to anyone, let alone massive donations to political parties in those sorts of circumstances. Those company directors have responsibilities to their employees, to their shareholders and to communities as well. 
It is worth having a look at who gets the money when a company goes belly up. When a company becomes insolvent, secured creditors have first claim to a company's assets and have a right to sell a specific asset in the event that a company cannot meet its obligations. A bank with a mortgage over the plant of a company would be an example of a secured creditor. They get in first. Employees and trade creditors will generally be unsecured creditors. They get in after the banks have taken their cut, and they are generally fighting over the crumbs. That is the experience that we have seen. Unfortunately, employees being unsecured creditors, there are usually insufficient funds to protect employee entitlements because company funds are exhausted in satisfying secured creditors. The whole issue of how parties are regulated—especially those in receipt of public moneys and public funding—and the whole issue of structure and accountability to members and the taxpayers are matters that should be examined by the relevant parliamentary committee, in this case the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.
What is the purpose of the Democrats amendment and, more generally, the Australian Greens amendment before this committee? Are we trying to regulate companies? Are we trying to regulate other entities? Are we trying to regulate political parties? Again, those questions are probably best considered by a parliamentary committee which would be able to call on the advice of the AEC, ASIC and other experts if they need it. I think we are weighing into an area of sensitive public policy without availing ourselves of an important source of advice. In my view, all of these amendments would have warranted closer examination by JSCEM, but I am concerned about the transfer of concepts directly from the Corporations Law relating to the nature of transactions into the Commonwealth Electoral Act. It is not as straightforward as it might seem. I am concerned—and I am sure other senators would be—about any possible unintended consequences. That is why it is better looked at in more detail. I understand the spirit in which these amendments come before the chamber; I accept it absolutely, and I understand that the Democrats supported the parliament looking into how the Electoral Act could be amended to properly deal with how parties are regulated. But if the committee would prefer to deal with this matter by amendments that are not subject to that level of examination perhaps a broader opportunity is being missed here.
I think that Senator Brown's amendment is superior to Senator Murray's in one crucial respect—that is, it places the relevant rules squarely in the Commonwealth Electoral Act and, of course, it attempts to regulate political parties. In considering these amendments, we must be conscious of the purpose of the Democrats amendment and, more generally, the Greens amendment. To cut to the chase: are we trying to regulate companies or other entities or political parties? What are we trying to achieve here? The opposition are not without some concerns in relation to Senator Brown's amendment. We are not sure that a period of 12 months for the clawback of donations is the appropriate period, though I think it is better than Senator Brown's original proposition. The amendment uses the term `donation' rather than the term `gift', which is in the Electoral Act, and there is a concern there. We are not sure— and without closer examination I do not know whether the parliament can be sure— that $1,000 is the right threshold; perhaps a higher threshold is appropriate. As I have said, these are the sorts of matters that should be looked at by JSCEM. 
On the face of it, of the two options that are before the chamber, at this stage the opposition prefers the approach that Senator Brown has proposed in the name of the Australian Greens to that which is suggested by Senator Murray. It is possible that the amendment that stands in Senator Brown's name will not be carried. It is the preferred approach as far as the opposition is concerned to the one proposed by Senator Murray, though I accept the spirit in which both of these amendments are put before this committee. I am pleased that the Senate committee will have an opportunity to determine a position on Senator Brown's amendment before it determines a position on the amendment that stands in the name of Senator Murray. I commend the constructive and sensible approach that the opposition has taken in relation to these amendments to this bill—one which ought not to be being debated in this chamber and which is a transparent effort on the part of one political party in this parliament to try and fix its own internal problems.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-09-16,"—I reiterate that One Nation will be supporting the government's position on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. I believe it is the right of political parties to administer their processes in whatever manner they so desire. In that it may seem something of a contradiction, I indicate to Senator Brown, as I did earlier on, that I cannot support his amendment, not because I do not believe that the amendment has merit but because I do not believe this place has the right to place conditions on other political parties and, reiterating what I opened by saying, that it is the right of the individual party to do that. If Senator Brown wishes to amend his amendment so that, intrinsically, it applies only to the Greens, then I would support his amendment. It would then be up to each and every other party in this place to make a similar amendment for their own political party, if that is their will.
Before going on, Mr Temporary Chairman, I would like to draw your attention to Senator Brown's amendment to proposed subsection 306B(b). I am seeking clarification whether running sheet 2593 revised 2 carries a typo. It reads:
(b)	the corporation within a period concluding on year after ...
Is that supposed to say `concluding one year after'?
—Yes.
—I seek clarification from the Temporary Chairman.
 (Senator Ferguson)—I think revised 2 of running sheet 2593 already has that change.
—It actually carries the inaccuracy that I am speaking of.
—It has been replaced.
—Thank you. Further to the issue Senator Faulkner raised in relation to the essence of this amendment going to the requirement under the Bankruptcy Act of a political party that has received a donation from a corporation and within one year that corporation is wound up or placed in receivership to return that amount based on the fact that it would be seen as a preferential payment, I believe that the Bankruptcy Act itself sufficiently covers that. On that point, if we look at the Australian Electoral Commission's returns for the financial year 2000-01, we will see they clearly indicate that the Liberal Party received in excess of $21 million in donations, the National Party in excess of $6 million and the Labor Party in excess of $31 million. Amongst those, there was also a $100,000 donation from HIH to the New South Wales Liberal Party in 1999 and a $181,00 gift from the Froggy business of the entrepreneur Karl Suleman to the New South Wales division of the Labor Party. While investors in Sydney alone face losses of up to $65 million from Mr Suleman's Froggy business failure, I do not believe that anyone in Australia at this point in time has a complete understanding of the ramifications of the HIH crash. The media reports from News Ltd indicate that, so far, only the Western Australian Labor Party have agreed to repay a $10,000 donation which was received from the Suleman business. I commend the Western Australian Labor Party for their integrity in doing that. So far, neither the Liberal Party nor the Labor Party federally have returned to either of those two entities the donations that they have received. 
In concluding my remarks, I would like to indicate that I believe there is a moral requirement on any political party that does receive what is seen by the public to be a preferential payment from an entity that has either gone into receivership or has been bankrupted within 12 months to return that payment. I believe the Bankruptcy Act already carries the requirement for the liquidator to return either that gift or that donation.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-09-16,"—I have given a fairly detailed outline of why this is an important amendment. As previous speakers have said, it is to ensure that, where a company gives more than $1,000 to a political party and within a year that company then becomes insolvent, the donation is given back to the liquidator so that it can be disbursed to the creditors. It is, in effect, saying that political parties can take a lead here. There are other entities involved in dealing with companies before insolvency which might be looked at under the Corporations Law at another time. It is saying, effectively, that people who lose out when companies go bust should be the primary consideration.
I take into account the point put very strongly by Senator Faulkner earlier that one of the difficulties with the Greens' amendment is that it does not ensure that the money would necessarily go to the little person who has lost their money—it could mean that the banks and other prior creditors get the money—but we are doing our best under the circumstances, and to make that sort of change does require looking at the Corporations Law. However, we are looking here at the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill which deals with the receipt of donations from various sources, so it is appropriate that we deal with this particular factor involving donations—that is, the subsequent going broke of the donor—under this piece of legislation. That is one of the reasons I agree with Senator Faulkner that this is a better amendment than that proposed by Senator Murray on behalf of the Australian Democrats.
In response to the submission we have just heard from Senator Harris, I think it is very important that the whole of the act should be non-party specific. It should be fearless in being fair and should apply to everybody. That is why the amendment is in this form: it does not name the Greens, One Nation or any of the other parties but is fair to all. It is a very important step towards an ongoing and wider look by the body politic at the whole matter of donations to parties and politicians in our democratic system. I will not go back into that territory, as I have covered it before—it concerns me greatly—but I congratulate the Labor Party in supporting this. I know it has been a difficult amendment and, because it is covering new territory, it does not have everything in it that could be desired. I do not know how to get around that problem. I know the Labor Party has been tackling that problem and Senator Faulkner has been involved. Considering that, it has been very generous of the Labor Party to be supporting this because it is ethically a good move despite its shortcomings, and I hope that the Democrats will be able to support it as well so that it does pass into law.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-09-16,"—The Greens' amendment has presented some difficulties because the intent is a good one. I think everyone has said that, and I have put a fair bit on the record previously. The key thing about the amendment is that it relates only to corporations; it does not attempt to pick up all donations from any other entities. Because of that, it alerted me to the nature of insolvency law as already established under the Corporations Act. There are provisions in the Corporations Act which could allow a company's liquidator to seek to recover donations made to a political party by a company if the company subsequently becomes insolvent. The political party, under current law, may therefore be required to repay money to the donating company. The insolvency provisions in the Corporations Act aim to achieve a balance between payment of company debts and protecting parties that have received money from the insolvent company. 
It seems to me that Senator Brown's amendment would still require the liquidator to make the same judgment they currently make under the Corporations Act. It is for that reason I simply designed an amendment that I think achieves what Senator Brown's amendment is trying to achieve, and that is to act as a signpost and say, `Look, the Corporations Act provisions cover this area. If you are dealing with these matters you should refer to section 588FE of the Corporations Act.' That signposting style has many precedents in law. Often laws will say, `With regard to this, look at the definition or provisions in such another act.' I am not certain we need to do what Senator Brown is saying we should do, but I like the intent. Obviously, if there is any doubt, you want to do just this. So it does land us in some difficulty. If it were the wish of the committee— and that really requires the major parties to take a view on it—I personally have no objection to both these amendments, but not the bill, being sent off to the JSCEM, or maybe even to the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, if it wants to explore it within a reasonable time frame.
—Only if the whole bill goes!
—I know that is your intent—even I have gathered that over time!
—I thought you would have worked it out by now!
—I have. The reason I do not feel any sense of urgency or immediacy about this is that I have come to the view that the law actually applies in this way. Corporations Law specifically allows what Senator Brown intends to happen. I think this amendment is making specific what is a general provision in Corporations Law covering all debts. So, in that sense, I do not want to oppose this, but I do think it is unnecessary. All I will say is that, if we are forced to a vote today, I think my amendment achieves the same result with less likelihood of confusion over the application of insolvency law. If, however, the committee were inclined to send those two amendments off and not the bill, I would not object to that.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-09-16,"—The point that Senator Murray has perhaps not picked up on in what he has just been saying is that the Greens amendment says:
... an amount equal to the amount of the donation is payable by the political party to the liquidator and may be recovered by the liquidator ...
It makes very clear that the amount is payable. That is not the case in Senator Murray's amendment, which still leaves it to the liquidator that it may take action to recover that amount. In that sense, it makes it clear to all of us when we receive a donation that it is recoverable under those circumstances. I think that is why it is important that it is in the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. It clears the air on the matter and is therefore a stronger and clearer statement of the situation for the political parties, as well as for any donor, than the current law which Senator Murray wants to signpost through his amendment. I hope he will take that into account and will support the Greens amendment.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-09-16,"—I am going to do something which will make the government feel a bit anxious. I will signal that, if this amendment were to pass, I would not insist on it when it came back and I would expect the government to amend this amendment to reflect both the proposals I have made and the point that Senator Brown has just made. Perhaps it should take cognisance of that.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-09-16,"—It is quite clear that all that has been said this morning, other than Senator Murray's latest intervention, has basically been a repeat of what was said on the previous occasion. I think that there is very strong merit in the suggestion that the two amendments before us—one moved by Senator Brown and the other moved by Senator Murray—ought to go to a committee for detailed consideration. With respect, it is clear that the bill itself—which has been around for 12 months and has been to a Senate committee, which has reported— is different from the amendments that are now being thrown on the table, for a number of reasons that I will not go into. The Greens amendment started off with a three-year period and changed to an `on year' period and then a one-year period. We have had other words being changed, quite appropriately, to try to make them more in tune with the legislation. I do not think that making these sorts of changes on the run does credit to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and there is no real— 
A disturbance having occurred in the chamber—
—We do not need chuckles from the side from unelected individuals. I suggest that the committee ought to—
—Well, it's pretty funny.
—Just remember your reaction to a public servant who accidentally tried to assist at a Senate estimates hearing one day, Senator Faulkner, and you will then understand how very restrained I have been in that comment. I suggest to the committee that we need to put this to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for proper and detailed consideration. If we are to have the principle of universality which seems to have been embraced by Senator Brown in his submission in rejecting what Senator Harris said, the question has to be asked—using, let us say, the HIH example or the Froggy example—whether, next time there is a piece of tertiary education legislation before the Senate, Senator Brown will jump up to move amendments to it to ensure that, if HIH had made a donation, as it has—or, indeed, if any other corporation had made a donation—to a university in the previous 12 months, it can be clawed back, as Senator Brown is suggesting in relationto political parties—or if HIH made a substantial donation to the Collingwood Football Club, as I understand it did.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Now I agree with the laughter. Why anybody would want to do that, I do not know—I would have thought Geelong would have been a much worthier cause—but HIH made that determination. Does that mean that the next time some legislation comes up in relation to, let us say, the Australian Sports Commission, Senator Brown will jump up and move an amendment that any sporting body in receipt of sponsorship or donations in the previous 12 months from a corporation that then goes belly up should repay that money, irrespective of the circumstances under which it was received by that sporting body? We need careful consideration of the precedent that would be set here, and also of the very real possibility that the gift is completely unrelated to the bankruptcy and people have acted in good faith, received the money and spent it for the purpose for which it was designed. I think it is important that these suggested legislative changes be considered in a more rigorous manner, not on the run with amendments flying around and one amendment that has already changed three or more times—
—That's just the way it works.
—We hear from Senator Faulkner that this is the way it works. Yes, it can work that way, but I thought part of the committee system of the parliament was for legislation to be considered in detail through the committee system.
—All right—refer the bill to JSCEM.
—The bill that is before us has already been before a Senate committee—
—I do not think you had a good weekend, Senator Faulkner. I am disappointed—it is so early in the sittings. We are hardly half an hour into them and we are getting so many interjections. The simple fact is that the bill proper has been before a Senate committee and it was considered. I can understand that Senator Faulkner, for his own political reasons, does not like the outcome of that committee report. But the simple fact is that it has now been on the table for 12 months or more. The bill has been considered by a committee. The throwing of ill-considered amendments on the table one after the other is simply an attempt to delay what is otherwise a very straightforward piece of legislation. 
If I take a deep swallow, I am willing to accept the possibility that Senator Murray and Senator Brown are genuinely motivated in the issues raised in their amendments. On that basis, let us explore them in the parliament's committee system. But at this stage, as Senator Murray has indicated, the law already provides the liquidator with sufficient powers to deal with clawing back money. I might add that the one-year period that Senator Brown now talks about would limit the liquidator's powers in relation to the other matters that I outlined on the last occasion. Section 588FE of the Corporations Act mentions certain timetables of two years, four years and even 10 years.
My view is that the legislation that Senator Brown is proposing would in fact prevent the liquidator from going back 10 years, or even four years or two years in certain circumstances. Quite frankly, I have no idea how that can be in any way good for the little investor in a company. If a transaction that is not kosher has been entered into but is not discovered for more than 365 days, under Senator Brown's suggestions it would not be recoverable once you tick past that one year. Yet, under the Corporations Law, it would be recoverable in certain circumstances.
This is a clear case of amendments being thrown on the table without due consideration. But I am willing to accept that there is a genuine issue at stake here and that is what is motivating these amendments. That is why they ought to go to a committee of the Senate, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters or a standing or legislative committee of the Senate, so that the committee can deal with those issues and also come up with a policy as to whether the law that would apply to gifts to political parties should also apply to gifts to universities, hospitals, Rotary clubs and sporting clubs. A whole host of nonprofit and volunteer organisations all around country are the beneficiaries of corporate support, and so why single out political parties? It has been suggested that we ought to do it because the Commonwealth Electoral Act is before us at the moment. If that is the case, I would be interested to see whether, each time we deal with nonprofit organisations—sporting clubs, hospitals, health and tertiary education institutions—Senator Brown jumps up with a similar amendment. I am sure that he will not. The government will be opposing both of the amendments.
—Is the minister intending to send these amendments to a committee or not?
—As per your note?
—Yes. But you do know that I put that proposition on the record earlier.
—I didn't expect you to respond!
Question put:

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-09-16,"—In view of the division we have just had, I will withdraw my amendment (1) on sheet 2605.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-09-16,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments (1) to (5) on sheet 2604 revised:
(1)	Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (lines 28 to 30), omit paragraph (b).
(2)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 4 (lines 18 to 23), omit paragraph (aa).
(3)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 5 (lines 20 to 37), omit paragraph (ad).
(4)	Schedule 1, item 6, page 6 (line 7) after “Liberal Party”, insert “and the agent of the relevant State Branch of the Liberal Party”.
(5)	Schedule 1, item 6, page 6 (line 21) after “A notice under subsection (5E)”, insert “must be signed by the agent of each party specified in the notice and”.
These opposition amendments do take away the possibility of the Liberal Party's central office unilaterally and oppressively lodging a notice to say where the funds due to a state division should go. I am sure that Senator Murray would agree with me that this agreement is absolutely essential for the process to work. Of course, we have a situation where state branches or state divisions nominate candidates who are members of state branches or state divisions. The fact that national offices of some political parties currently pay a very substantial percentage of campaign costs has of course been a more recent political phenomenon. Who is to say what the situation might be in years to come? It is true to say in relation to the major political parties that, a decade ago, the state branches or state divisions paid a much larger percentage than national offices. Around 20 years ago you would probably find the situation where those branches were probably bearing the overwhelming majority of costs from campaigns.
But the factors determining who pays for an election campaign are of course quite varied. There is the issue of who actually buys the media placements—the advertising space—particularly the television advertising space. There is the issue, as you would appreciate, Madam Temporary Chairman Collins, of the actual geographic structure of the television and advertising markets that are relevant—and not only relevant but relative to electorates. There is the issue of the internal organisation of political parties and who produces election material. There is the issue of who has the responsibility for managing and organising policy launches, and who pays for and organises the equipping and staffing of campaign offices. Of course, in the case of the Liberal Party it is generally best left, in their view, to the Commonwealth taxpayer to fund most of their arrangements. But there is no particular reason why those costs have to be borne by either a state branch or state division of a political party or the national office of a political party. That is a matter, we believe—and I think any reasonable person would say this—for those political parties to consider and determine.
It is quite clear that not only do national organisations or federal organisations in political parties have an interest in federal election campaigns; so do the state organisations, the state divisions and the state branches. Most state branches of political parties are registered at both state and federal level; most state branches of political parties operate at state and federal level. Under the Electoral Act, state branches have the same rights as other branches in the party grouping; that is, the Electoral Act does not discriminate in favour of one party structure over another party structure—and quite rightly. These are matters—the structuring of parties and the organisation of parties—best left to the individual parties themselves to determine. It is up to the members of the relevant party to decide how these matters ought to be finalised.
I have said for some considerable time in relation to the parliament's consideration of this legislation that the fact that some people in the Liberal Party of Australia actually want to centralise funding is not a good enough reason to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act and set up a potentially oppressive mechanism in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that no-one will be forced to do anything against their will. The great benefit of them—and I want to say this, through you, Chair, particularly to Senator Murray, who I know is closely following this debate, because he seems to me to need more convincing than most on these matters—
—That is because he is so well read on them.
—He is. Senator Brown, I have acknowledged that Senator Murray is very expert, very knowledgeable, on electoral matters. But sometimes he needs a little convincing; in fact, I would have to say that sometimes he seems to need a lot of convincing.
—Baseball bats work well.
—Senator Murray, we are happy to do whatever is required. I do think this point needs to be made, and I commend it particularly to the Australian Democrats who need some convincing on some of these issues. The amendments that are before the chair ensure that no-one—no state division or branch of a political party— is forced into a course of action which they are uncomfortable with. The amendments keep the element of choice that Senator Murray has extolled before this chamber on a number of occasions in relation to this legislation. They keep the element of choice as an important principle in these matters. Of course, there is legislation before the committee which aims to dictate an approach, dictate a structure and dictate a course of action for political parties. What these amendments provide is that we will be able to keep the flexibility for parties to register agreements with percentage allocations of public funding due to their party grouping in a manner that suits all of the party's needs. This seems to be a very sensible approach.
Amendments (1) to (5) before the chair will keep flexibility for political parties. The amendments will keep the element of choice, which I know Senator Murray and the Australian Democrats are so wedded to and consider such an important principle in the debate on these important issues. Here is an opportunity to do just that. I commend these amendments to the committee.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-09-16,"—Through you, Madam Chair, I will be seeking some quite in-depth confirmation not only from Senator Faulkner but also from the government in relation to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. Senator Faulkner's proposed amendments (1) to (5) actually remove certain sections from the billthat refer to the Liberal Party. My concern is whether an in-depth study and thorough understanding of the consequences of these proposed amendments have taken place. Let me give you an example. For the benefit of members in the chamber, page 3, line 33 of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 states:
—pay the amount to the principal agent; or
(d) in any other case—pay the amount to the agent of the State branch of the party that is organised on the basis of the State or Territory in which the candidate or candidates stood for election.
In removing lines 28 to 30 of the bill, Senator Faulkner is specifically removing a reference to the Liberal Party. But what about the rest of us? On page 3, subsection 287(1) of the bill inserts a clear definition of the Liberal Party. In essence, the bill is speaking to the Liberal Party. Do Senator Faulkner's proposed amendments, which remove the reference to the Liberal Party in subsection (b) of section 299, have an implication for any other party based on subsection (c)? Subsection (c) states:  
(c) if the party is the Australian Democrats and there is a principal agent appointed under section 288A—pay the amount to the principal agent—

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-09-16,"—I accept that Senator Harris has probably been closely engaged in the debate. I am sure I do not have to explain either to Senator Harris or to the committee that the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 is about the Liberal Party. That was the intention of the government when it brought this particular legislation before the chamber. The Liberal Party was unable to get agreement around its state divisions—state branches by another name— to organise the distribution of public funding at the national level. Because of that, the government thought the only way that this issue could be addressed was to solve those internal political problems that the Liberal Party has by legislation. That is why, if you go to subsection 287(1)—as you have mentioned—you see that `Liberal Party' is defined. It states:
Liberal Party means the political party that, at the commencement of this definition, was registered under Part XI as the Liberal Party of Australia.
That is what this bill is all about. Senator Harris, if you are making the point that this bill is not necessary you are absolutely right. I agree with you completely. This could be fixed by the state and territory divisions of the Liberal Party of Australia signing a document that indicates an agreed distribution of public funding. It is as simple as that. Even though the minister will not admit this, that particular document cannot be produced by the National Secretary of the Liberal Party of Australia, Mr Crosby, because they cannot get agreement around the state divisions. The Commonwealth parliament is being asked to legislate to solve this problem. That is the thrust of this legislation. It is absolutely unprecedented in the Commonwealth parliament to have that sort of legislation come before it.
Senator Murray can explain to you in graphic detail the different way in which the membership base of the Australian Democrats works. It is an important point, isn't it, Senator Murray, in relation to a national membership base, as opposed to a state or territory membership base for a political party? That is a matter that has been discussed in this chamber on a number of occasions. But what is open for debate and what is being considered here is simply the issue of how the Liberal Party regulates and organises its own internal affairs—how it deals with the question of the receipt of public moneys. Those matters are obviously best dealt with by political parties themselves.
This bill is about the Liberal Party. Senator Murray has tried to broaden it and see it have application to—he is always trying, and I commend him for it, to help out Senator Abetz. He always tries to do the right thing and see if he can make the way a little easier for the minister. But every now and again I think you would have to acknowledge, Senator Murray, that, even with your best efforts, not all your assistance has been gratefully accepted. Once or twice you have offered from `Community Chest'—as they call it on the Monopoly board—the `Get out of jail free' card, and what happens? You hand the card to the minister but he is not bright enough to even play it. But, there you are.
This particular bill is about the Liberal Party's internal organisation. As far as I am concerned, these amendments are certainly not intended to have any effect in relation to any other political party and, as far as I understand the bill, will have no effect in relation to any other political party. So if Senator Harris has any concerns about that, I think his mind can be put at rest. This is legislation about the Liberal Party. This is a misuse and abuse of the parliament to achieve an outcome that ought to be able to be achieved by a simple letter being placed before the Australian Electoral Commissioner, and then we just get on with the rest of our lives. But because the Liberal Party is apparently incapable of doing that, this parliament has been left with the responsibility of sorting out the Liberal Party's own internal shenanigans. 
My approach to it is quite simple: we should not be involved in that. They should sort it out themselves. But we have before us amendments that keep a level of flexibility in the way that might work, in the unfortunate circumstance that this particular legislation is agreed to by the Senate.

Leave granted.
—I draw the minister's attention to lines 33 and 34 on page 4 of the bill where it says:
(ac) if the members of the group were endorsed by 2 registered political parties, one of those parties is the Liberal Party or a State branch of the Liberal Party ...
The section continues. Then lines 6, 7 and 8 on page 5 of the bill read:
... or, in the absence of agreement, into such shares as the Electoral Commission determines.
Does the first reference refer to any political party other than the Liberal Party and the party with which they are associated? For clarity, could the minister advise the committee whether it is in any way the intention of the Electoral Commission, in the absence of an agreement, to be able to determine the share of any electoral funding coming from the Electoral Commission.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-09-16,"—The circumstances in which it would apply are those where there is a joint Senate ticket—for example, in New South Wales, where the Liberal Party and National Party run a joint Senate ticket. My advice is that the legislation would only apply in those circumstances. I trust that clarifies the matter for you.
 (Senator Collins)—The question is that opposition amendments (1) to (5) be agreed to.
—A division would be required but given that it is four minutes to two—I do not know what the minister's view is—I think it might be better to hold the division at a later stage. Could I respectively suggest to you, Madam Chair, that it would be better not to have the division just now. We usually try to be sensible about these things. It would significantly eat into question time.
—Is this some kind of filibuster?
—There has been no filibuster. I point out to you, Minister, that the sensible way of dealing with the next item of business in the committee's consideration would be the division in relation to these provisions. I think it is generally agreed. We will press for this division but we will do it when government business comes back for consideration at a later stage.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2002-09-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Health and Ageing (Senator Patterson) to questions without notice asked by Senators Forshaw, McLucas and Stephens today relating to increases in private health insurance premiums.
Last Wednesday, 11 September, the Minister for Health and Ageing announced in her press release that, in future, private health funds would be given the right to automatically increase their premiums on an annual basis to reflect cost of living adjustments. The minister said: 
The Federal Government will introduce measures to make private health funds more efficient and competitive, with the aim to deliver better value for money to fund members ...
During question time today, the minister said that it was the objective of her government— indeed, it had been the objective of the government since they came to office in 1996— to make private health insurance more affordable. She went further to say that they were endeavouring to ensure that premiums would be reduced. Of course, that was a promise made by the Prime Minister prior to the election: their policies would lead to downward pressure—to use that term—on private health insurance premiums. We all recall this Prime Minister's core promises back in 1996. One of the core promises was:
What I can give is an absolute guarantee that any change in future will be as a result of a decision taken at a political level in a way and in circumstances where we are satisfied that the rise is completely justified.
That was the Prime Minister's so-called core promise on that occasion in respect of private health insurance premiums. He used the term `an absolute guarantee'. We know that since then the Prime Minister has come to find different definitions of words such as `never ever', `absolute' or `core promise'. The words mean whatever he wants them to mean at the particular time.
I also quote again from that statement by the Prime Minister, that the government would only approve increases in circumstances where they were satisfied that the rises were `completely justified'. They were the words of the Prime Minister—`completely justified'. We have now a situation where the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, is unable to manage her portfolio and her department. That has become obvious since she was appointed to this ministerial position. We all know that the previous minister, Dr Wooldridge, was able to manage the department pretty much to help his own personal interests, but this minister cannot manage the department at all.
On the question of bulk-billing—which was another issue raised during question time—the minister does not know whether or not she even has the information in her office. What she has now announced on private health insurance, because she is incapable of managing this very important area, is that, in future, private health insurance funds will be able to automatically increase their own premiums up to the CPI figure each year. The private health funds have been given the absolute guarantee that they can raise their premiums without having to go to the government or to their members to justify the increase. They can do it each year. This was the government that promised that health insurance premiums would not rise. Yet, since the last election, 31 out of the 44 funds have increased their premiums by an average of 6.9 per cent. In some cases, the increases were up to 16 per cent or more.
I contrast the decision by this minister to give private health insurance funds the right to have automatic adjustments by CPI based increases for private health insurance with the attitude of the Liberal Party, the coalition government, when they were previously in office under Malcolm Fraser and also when they were in opposition during those years when we were in government. On every single occasion they opposed national wage increases for workers based upon CPI increases. They never thought workers were good enough to get a wage increase based upon cost of living increases but now they give that right, that absolute guarantee, to the private health insurance funds. You can see where the government's priorities are, and they are not with the families of Australia.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2002-09-16,"—I rise to take note of answers given today by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, about health insurance premiums. The government welcomes any discussion on the area of private health. Our record over the last six years is quite simply—
—It is abysmal.
—It is not abysmal, Senator Forshaw. It is quite simply explained in just one statistic: the increase in the take-up of private health insurance by the Australian public. There it is before you, Senator Forshaw. 
—I take that interjection. That interjection is a joke. I see that Senator Forshaw is packing up to leave; it would be wise if he did. He says that we are taxing them. Was it not this government against all the opposition—
—I have looked, Senator Forshaw. Stop interjecting. I have enough notes here to keep me going, but your interjections alone are keeping me going.
—Address your remarks to the chair, Senator McGauran.
—Through you, Mr Deputy President, to Senator Forshaw, the joke is—
—No, just to me.
—Through the whole of question time I have been taking down copious notes to speak on this subject. There is so much for the government to speak on. I have not even attended to my notes yet because of two idiotic interjections from across the chamber. They are enough for me to fill my five minutes. One was that the government are taxing private health insurance.
—We are talking about a surcharge.
—A surcharge. Stop interjecting, Senator Forshaw, so that I can make this point—
—Senator McGauran, address your remarks to the Deputy President.
—Senator Forshaw has given me so much material, Mr Deputy President, that I am tripping over it. The point is that we have a 30 per cent rebate. Against the opposition's will, the government introduced a 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance. That was the single point on which a collapsing private health insurance industry turned around. You know that, Senator Forshaw. Just nod your head. Give some concessions on that point. This is a reformist government and that is one reform we will point to with a great deal of pride. The tax rebate is given right across the board, to all sectors of the community. In fact, it has saved the Medicare system. When Labor left office, the private health system had collapsed to the low 20s and the financial burden of the health system had shifted onto the Medicare system. The Medicare system could not sustain a collapsing private health insurance system. That in itself says it all with regard to private health insurance.
I do not know why you would single out private health insurance as an issue in question time when there are so many others that you may. In this chamber we should be debating the lead questions of the opposition on Iraq. They are worthy questions to be answered. We are happy to debate that issue. It is a grave issue before the chamber. But what has the opposition tactics committee come up with? The government's failure with regard to private health insurance. That is simply answered by asking: why is the private health insurance take-up by the public increasing?
Turning to the new policy introduced by the minister and the questions that were adequately answered by her during question time—which is what makes me think that this take note of answers is such a waste of time—she said that the annual premium process will be changed so as to encourage funds to limit their increases to the CPI and to become more efficient and concentrate on delivering better products to members, rather than submitting on each occasion for a rise which is always over and above the CPI anyway. As long as the rises are at the CPI or below, they can be automatic. Therefore, it maintains the affordability for the public, it maintains the profitability of health insurance funds, which are under pressure at the moment, and it reduces the red tape and paperwork; it is in fact a system worthy of introduction.
If the funds claim rises over the CPI, then, of course, the minister still has powers and they still come under the scrutiny of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council to justify that increase. So what we will now get is that most private health insurance funds will increase to the CPI or below. Watch it! You are usually wrong on the other side. You think that rises will increase above the CPI and come under scrutiny. They will not. 
—You're never right.
—You were wrong on the 30 per cent rebate and you will be wrong on this. Most health insurance companies will now simply take up the policy and not have to come before— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Health Insurance: Premiums</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2002-09-16,"—I also rise to take note of answers given today by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, about private health insurance. I refer to the government's announcement last week when, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon of September 11, Senator Patterson announced that automatic CPI related increases would occur in private health insurance premiums. I acknowledge that Senator Patterson advised us today in question time that cabinet had met until 5 p.m. on the day before. I accept that as a legitimate reason, that there was no announcement on September 10. And can I say that it was one of the very first times that someone has actually given us some information that was relevant. So I acknowledge and thank the minister for that.
However, on the following day, September 11, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon when everyone was focused on the issues of the previous year, when everyone was watching television and looking at the horrific events of the year before, Senator Patterson decided it was an important time to make a major announcement, an announcement about a prime ministerial backflip, so that the community could understand that we will be moving away from political involvement in the setting of private health insurance premiums to a system in which we will get automatic increases.
Senator Patterson said that she had appointments on the morning of September 11. I have to say that either it was very poor planning on behalf of the minister's office not to arrange for such a significant announcement to be held in the morning, when major announcements are usually made, or, to my mind, it was a deliberate attempt to hide the bad news from Australian families. The hiding of the announcement continues to undermine any trust that Australians can have in this government to deliver a fair and equitable health system that is accessible to all, irrespective of their financial status.
Since 1996, there has been a consistent undermining by the Howard government of this fundamental value that I believe all Australians cherish—that is, the notion that all of us, wherever we live and whatever our financial position, should have access to a decent health system. Let us remember the comments of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, in 1996. He made an absolutely unequivocal commitment that we would have an absolute guarantee that the government, not the bureaucracy, would have involvement in the management of increases in private health insurance. He said that there would be a continual involvement by the political arm so that there would be surety for Australians that private health insurance premiums would not be able to rise without political intervention. This was essentially consumer protection, so that private health insurance premiums could not be increased without the involvement of the political arm.
Last Thursday's announcement is a backdown on that safeguard that the Prime Minister gave in 1996. Senator Patterson advised the Senate today of the rationale for removing the responsibility for applying and, as part of that application process, the justification that increases were to keep private health insurance affordable. I have to say that that has been spectacularly unsuccessful to this point in time where we have seen continual and regular increases in the past few years. I also suggest that this is, essentially, cost-shifting from the private health insurance companies to the government. Senator Patterson told us that there will still be scrutiny and review of any application, even for CPI increases. But now the government will have to work from a position of little knowledge.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2002-09-16,"—I rise to take note of answers given today by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, about health insurance premiums. I must say that Senator McLucas is struggling to make any substantial points at all in this argument. She was forced to revisit the debate we had on the last day of the last sitting period over whether or not the government is committed to the preservation of a universal health system in this country. This government, without any doubt, is. As we went through at length on the last Thursday of the last sitting period, the Howard government has not only committed itself to the preservation of Medicare but improved and enhanced the health services provided to the Australian community. For you, Senator McLucas, to argue otherwise is nonsense. It is just not the case at all. I do not propose to revisit the arguments which were put that day but, nevertheless, I think the case was made very strongly that the Howard government's commitment to the preservation of Medicare is very strong and that health services have without any doubt been improved under this government. 
One of the most important platforms of the improvement of health services has been the redressing of the imbalance which occurred under the Labor government between the public and the private sector. Under the last Labor government, the number of people who held private health insurance dropped dramatically. As a result of the government offering free services in public hospitals to all comers, the public hospitals in this country became very overcrowded. There were long waiting lists and it was very difficult to get treatment in a public hospital because a lot of people were going to public hospitals who really could afford not to. They did not need the free treatment available in a public hospital and could have used the private sector. They did not because they had dropped their private health insurance as a result of policies followed by the last Labor government.
As a result of the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance premiums—Senator McLucas obviously knows all these details because she is leaving the chamber and hurrying out before her position is totally demolished—the number of people with private health insurance in this country increased substantially. As a result, for the first time in many years we saw a drop in the number of persons attending public hospitals and the reinvigoration of the private sector, which had been lying idle beside the public hospitals. So now we have people who can afford to take up private health insurance doing so and using the private hospital sector. That in turn has taken pressure off the public hospitals and meant that they are able to perform the function they are designed to perform in the community far more effectively. That means that people who need to have operations in public hospitals can have them more quickly because the long waiting lists have been reduced.
The argument today seems to be that in some mysterious way allowing an automatic increase in private health insurance premiums for CPI will in some way mean that the private health insurance companies will be acting unethically and that the public will be disadvantaged. That, of course, is absolute nonsense. The private health insurance companies, like everybody else in this country, are subject to rises in costs according to the consumer price index. Just like any other organisation, private health insurance companies have to meet those costs. I do not think it is unreasonable that the minister should have arranged for them to be able to automatically increase their premiums up to the CPI, if they found that was necessary, without going through a long bureaucratic process. In the interests of good government, the minister is reducing red tape and simplifying the operation of government. It has been said that the government is not abrogating its responsibility to monitor the performance of the private health insurance companies, and that is very much the case. The government will be continuing to do that to ensure that the services provided by private health insurance companies are maintained at the very high standards which are traditional in Australia. There is nothing wrong with the policy announced by the minister. It is a matter of very good public policy.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2002-09-16,"—I also rise to take note of answers given by Senator Patterson, the Minister for Health and Ageing, about health insurance premiums. During the numerous questions asked this afternoon on the issue to do with private health insurance, the minister gave quite clear answers. The answers that she gave focused on two major points: first, that the government had a goal of keeping private health insurance affordable and low and, second, that the focus of the change to administrative cost was to cut down on the administrative burden and make it easier. 
—Thank you very much. You can sit down now!
—Senator McGauran!
—I have concerns related to both of those issues and I have some worries about always reducing these arguments just to issues of statistics. Because just as during the last week when we were worried about the issues of bulk-billing and how we could quote figures—everybody in this house quoted many figures around that— every figure was related to a person. Indeed every figure was related to a person who had health issues and conditions that needed immediate care. Around the issue of private health insurance this is indeed very true.
All the private health insurance funds are gloating about the rises in their numbers. Everybody in this house received a notice only last week about the rise in the number of people claiming private health insurance. But the people who have taken out private health insurance have not only taken individual choices. There was massive pressure on Australians to avail themselves of private health insurance. There were amazing amounts of media coverage encouraging people to take up private health insurance, advertising the benefits and calling for civic responsibility. Linked to that was a direct taxation threat—unless citizens took up private health insurance they were going to be harming our health system and they were then going to be penalised in that way.
Subsequently the figures have been released to show that a number of Australians have responded to that encouragement—and I used the word `encouragement' quite lightly in this case. People have taken out private health insurance, but the same people who have taken out private health insurance are now going to be faced with automatic increases in that private health insurance, not justified directly to them because of the advantages that their fund will give them, not justified to them because of the amazing advantages to the overall health scheme but simply because of a CPI increase.
Naturally, anything which is above the CPI will have to go through a rigorous and quite appropriate justification process. We support rigorous and detailed investigation of cost rises, but we support that investigation for all cost rises so there is not just an availability of rubber-stamping for private health insurance. I choose to take out private health insurance and any increase in my private insurance must be justified to me; it must not just be the result of an automatic process of saying, `CPI or less, therefore rubber-stamp it.' I believe that rubber stamp is in the minister's office.
In our current system, private health insurance is a subsidised industry. It is not just openly competitive; it is clearly subsidised by the Australian taxpayer. As an Australian taxpayer—and we all are—I would expect that we would have quite clear scrutiny of all increases in our private health insurance. I would debate the issue of undue administrative costs or undue bureaucratic focus. If you are going to put costs up and change your service, you must justify those changes. There should be no arbitrary line that says, `CPI and below, rubber-stamp it; CPI and above, apply rigorous scrutiny.' I do not think that is doing justice to the policy changes and to the expectations of the Australian people. I think we need more and we demand more.
I have not heard of any clear link that shows that efficiency and administrative change automatically mean things are going to cost more. If you are going to justify a price increase it should be quite clear: you look at your services and you look at how many people are using your services; it should be a statement of fact. I have not seen the kinds of justifications that the private health people gave in the last round of increases, but they must have been very good because they received significant increases. I believe there is an expectation that, if you are going to change what you have to pay, everyone who chooses to have private—(Time expired)

The Senate was advised on 26 August of the reasons why the government will not provide the documents for which it was asked. The information in these documents is prepared from information supplied to the department by the universities on the basis that it will be regarded as commercial-in-confidence. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has indicated that it wishes these assurances to be honoured. The Secretary of the Department of Education, Science and Training has written to Senator Carr in these terms. The Commonwealth will not breach the agreement it has with the universities on this matter.

It is wrong to bring this matter into the chamber and make a short statement without Senator Carr being present and without his being told clearly when it would come on so that he could then appear and take note of the statement. Senator Carr might have had other matters on his plate or might have been unable to attend, but I think it is one of those issues of which notice should have been given. I am not aware whether Senator Ian Campbell's office contacted Senator Carr and informed him that the matter would be coming on, but surely it is an issue that deserves consideration and it is one that Senator Carr would appreciate the opportunity to respond to. I note that Senator Carr is now in the chamber. Senator Carr may have seen this matter on the red and he may be in a position to respond.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-09-16,"—by leave— Page 4 of today's red does refer to this issue in that Senator Carr has, by way of contingent notice, warned all senators that if the government does not comply with this order he may seek to move a reference of the matter to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee. So it is clearly notified to all senators. What the government has sought to do, in a timely and appropriate manner, is to alert all senators to the facts around it and to state the reasons why it will not comply in the terms that Senator Carr wants the government to comply. Of course, page 33 of the Notice Paper allows Senator Carr to indeed think about whether he is going to use his contingent notice and then act. We are not precluding Senator Carr's rights; we are facilitating his taking action. He would, of course, take action as indicated under item 16 on the red at page 4 where it states:

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-09-16,"—by leave—I have listened very carefully to the comments that have been made by Senator Mackay and Senator Ludwig and also by Senator Ian Campbell, the Manager of Government Business. As I understand it, we find ourselves in one of those unique points on the agenda in any day's sitting somewhere between discovery of formal business, which is item 10 on the red, and item 11, `Any proposal pursuant to standing order 75'. I note that today an urgency motion has in fact been submitted and is due to be debated. So it is not correct to say that the red indicates that the manager would be seeking leave to indicate to the Senate some response to a proposal for a return to order.  
Of course, these are matters where the normal courtesies need to apply. I do not know—and we can hear about this—whether the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Campbell, has given Senator Carr in advance a copy of the statement that he has read into the Hansard. It is fair enough to say that he is not necessarily obligated to do so. But I do not know that and I do not think anyone else does. I suspect he has not. I do not know whether anyone advised the Manager of Opposition Business, the Opposition Whip or the responsible senator—in this case Senator Carr—that this matter would be dealt with at this time—
—We are not proposing to deal with it.
—and that the statement would be made. As Senator Campbell would know, when you seek leave to make a statement about a matter or when a statement is made without leave, it is absolutely competent for a senator in this chamber to seek leave to move a motion in relation to such a statement. I am being very frank with Senator Campbell here. Through you, Mr Deputy President, I do not know what Senator Carr's intentions are in relation to this. I have not asked him and he has not informed me. But he does have certain entitlements and capacities under the standing orders, as you would appreciate—
—I am well aware that there is an indication that he has an opportunity to move his contingent notice of motion. What we are talking about here are simply the courtesies involved in the good management of the chamber. These sorts of statements for the good operation of the chamber are best flagged with those on both sides, whether it be the government or the opposition. It is best if the whips, the managers and those who do that work for the minor parties give advance notice and flag it so that we actually do not go through the sort of interruption to debate that we are having at this time. That is the point I make to Senator Campbell. Whatever the technical situation here—and I do not know whether Senator Carr, the whips or the managers were informed—the point is that it does appear as if those who are responsible for managing the chamber on this side were not aware that this was coming forward. That affects the good conduct and order of the chamber. It may well delay the urgency motion, which is not our intention. We do not want to see that occur. It is not a good way to do business. That is the point I make. I make it in a reasonable spirit, and let us try to ensure that we do not face this again.",SENATE,"<title>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TRAINING: PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS</title>",<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,13,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-09-16,"—by leave—I indicate to the Senate that I was not advised that the government was going to make a statement today. I received in question time today a copy of a letter from the Secretary of the Department of Education, Science and Training, Dr Shergold. I was given no indication whatsoever that the government's intentions were to make a statement today.
—Is today the 16th?
—I am glad he knows what day it is. I will say to you now, Senator Campbell, that even a stopped clock is able to get it right at least twice a day. You are clearly a stopped clock. I suggest that you have a normal obligation in this chamber to let us know that you intend to make a statement, even if it is as discursive and as contemptuous as this document. It is quite apparent that this government has a great deal to hide on the issue of funding of universities. I can understand that: there is a great deal to hide. The university system in this country is in crisis as a direct result of this government's policies. You are seeking to have a debate in this country about the future of universities but not provide the basic information to the public about the way in which universities are funded or whether or not universities have the basic financial wherewithal to weather the current government policies. 
At a time when we are looking at the future of universities, a simple question to ask is: what is the financial health of universities? I have sought some information from this government which I do not think is particularly revolutionary. All the information I have in fact sought is published retrospectively. It is published a couple of years after the event. It is a rear-vision view of the financing of our university system. I have asked for the information that the government collects and provides to the universities about the future. That is what this is about: the information that the government actually gives to universities. I am not seeking the secrets that universities tell the government. I want the information the government gives the universities. I want a copy of the minutes for a number of meetings that occurred in November last year. I want a summary sheet from each of the universities—which is provided here. I have a couple of four-page examples here. I again seek leave to table these documents. The government in the past has refused leave because it says that this information is so secret and so sensitive that it will bring the education system tumbling. That is a load of nonsense. Again, I ask formally to have those documents tabled.
—Is leave granted for the documents to be tabled?
—I have not seen the documents.
—The documents have been seen. The documents have been seen and examined for a great deal of time.
—I will need leave to respond to that.
—The first issue we have to deal with is the issue before the chair.
—I am seeking leave to deal with that issue, which is that the chamber has been asked for leave by Senator Carr to table those documents. I am happy, by leave, to respond.
—Either you give leave or you do not give leave.
—I don't, because he has not shown us the documents.
—Leave is not granted.
—It is clear the documents have been seen by the government and studied at length. Last time I sought to have these documents tabled, you had two ministerial advisers sitting here for half an hour going through them. These are not particular difficult things to go through. They go to the financial statements for, in this case, two particular higher education institutions and they show their income and expenditure. They show their income and operating surpluses or deficits. They show their assets in millions and their liabilities. They go to their income from various sources—government fees, charges and investments—and to their expenditure. They go to the sources of their funding with regard to students and their staff ratios. They go to their ratios of salary cost to total expenditure, they go to their ratios of academic to non-academic staff salaries, they go to their trend analysis of their sources of income and they go to their short-term liquidity ratios.
These are not particularly secret matters. They are matters that are tabled by this government retrospectively—and I want to emphasise that point. When I seek to table them in the cases we have here, the government refuses leave now for the third time. 
—You have not shown me the documents.
—You have seen them. Furthermore, the government says this cannot be done because it is commercial-in-confidence. The government is trying to cover up. The government is seeking to hide behind the claim of commercial-in-confidence. We have very strong advice from the Clerk, which I think highlights the issues, that this is a government that is using what is called the LAPD defence. The situation is so serious that the public cannot be informed because they will lose confidence. That seems to be the argument. 
I have before me here an opinion from the Australian Solicitor from one of their legal briefings which again goes to this government hiding behind commercial-in-confidence to avoid public scrutiny and public accountability. At the same time, this government is launching a major debate about the future of universities in this country but it will not provide the basic information about the financial health of the system. 
In terms of the contingent notice that I have before the chamber, I will be dealing with that tomorrow. It has been on the Notice Paper and I understand that the Democrats would like to discuss it in their party room, so we will deal with it tomorrow. But it makes quite clear what we are trying to do here—establish a Senate inquiry to examine this government's claim. It will call upon expert advice from a range of sources. We will see how this government's claims stack up in the hard light of day. I do not think they will do very well. I ask, in terms of the procedures before the Senate today, that the government ought be reminded of its obligation to at least let us know what their intentions are in these matters. They will facilitate the work of this chamber a great deal by doing just that.
—As I understand it, Senator Carr, your contingent notice of motion can be moved at item 16, Order of Business, Business of the Senate, Notices of Motion, should you desire.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I have had advice from the clerks that this matter will stay on the Notice Paper. I will be moving that tomorrow, and I do not think that I need to formally seek an adjournment to that effect.
—That is fine. It will stay on the Notice Paper. ",SENATE,"<title>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TRAINING: PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS</title>",<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,13,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-09-16,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The visit to Australia by Li Peng and the need for the Government of China to be aware of the abhorrence to Australians of the massacre in Tiananmen Square and the ongoing abrogation of human rights in China and Tibet
While we are debating this matter in the Senate, Li Peng is meeting a number of parliamentarians from both houses in this parliament. The flag of the Chinese government and people of China is flying outside this parliament. When we look at the record of this man, the question I ask is: who is going to eyeball him about the extraordinary history of repression of democracy, of human rights, of civil rights, of political rights, of religious rights, that he is engaged in?
I note that the government has invoked the Vienna Convention in saying that it must not allow protesters with banners outside the Chinese Embassy just down the hill from here because that would be an infringement, under the convention, of Li Peng's dignity. I ask: when did Li Peng extend dignity to democrats in the People's Republic of China? How short is the memory of those who are dining with this man in this parliament tonight? I can assure you that I have not got an invitation. He sent the bulldozers into Tiananmen Square in June 1989 and massacred hundreds of his fellow people who were protesting peacefully for democracy. He, as Premier of China and Chinese Communist boss at the time, used brute violence to kill them, to torture some who were not killed, and to put to death the democracy movement at that time in China. 
What about Tibet and his `strike hard' policy there, which has robbed that country of its right to self-determination, to democracy, to freedom and to liberty? What about East Turkestan where the same applies? What about the whole of the people of China who have no right to freedom of speech, to democracy, to practise the open debate that we take for granted but that is essential in our democracy? 
Li Peng has his way. He is the butcher of Tiananmen Square. But he is now in Australia as a guest of this country. What a failure it is that our Prime Minister, our political leaders, our business leaders, the premiers of New South Wales and Queensland, are meeting this man, but there is no opportunity for the press to question him because there are no press conferences while he is here. Indeed, the ABC news web site in China has been shut down for this visit so that the Chinese people cannot know about any protest that is occurring in this country.
This is an abhorrent set of circumstances. I am hoping that the government and Labor speakers who are coming after me are going to explain their failure to stand up against this man, to call a spade a spade and to say, `Yes, trade with your country is one thing, but selling out on the civil liberties and political rights of the Chinese, Tibetan and East Turkestan people is another.' We will get the usual mealy-mouthed response to that of, `We will raise the topic in discussions between sips of champagne.' That is not what I am talking about. I am talking about nailing this person for the disgusting abrogation of human rights that he has personally ordered in China and Tibet. To allow that infringement to now trammel the news of his visit here going to China or prevent a protest flag being held outside the Chinese Embassy is a pretty poor state of affairs. I object to that. I believe that the majority of Australians will object to that. This parliament deserves to have better leadership in confronting people like Li Peng when those people come to this country to advance business. Business and trade is one thing, but it should not be at the expense of the fundamental liberties and democracy that we stand for.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Human Rights: China</title>,Matters of Urgency,14,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2002-09-16,"—One thing about Senator Brown is that he is predictable. This is a motion that we would expect from Senator Brown today. I, for one, fully welcome the visit by His Excellency Mr Li Peng, the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China. But that does not mean I agree with everything that Li Peng or the Chinese people have done over the past 20 or 30 years. However, it is an important occasion, and it is important because we need to remember that this year is 30 years since this country established diplomatic relations with China.
That is very important and something that we need to remember, because if Senator Brown had his way—and bearing in mind the fact that Senator Brown does not actually like anybody in this world, regardless of their politics; he has criticised plenty of countries, but I have never heard him say a good thing about any other country in the world—and if we were to take his criticism of Li Peng and the events that happened in Tiananmen Square some 14 years ago to its ultimate conclusion, we would no longer be talking to the Japanese, the Germans or any of those people who perpetrated crimes during the Second World War. If we take Senator Brown's motion to its fullest extent, it means that any event that has happened in the past will colour all the events that will take place in the future. If we were to keep referring to events of the past and have no dialogue with Japan, Germany, Russia, Chile or any of those countries where we know things have happened that we, as governments, have never approved of, it would be a funny old world, Senator Brown. I think that that is the sort of world you would actually want to live in.
Li Peng met with parliamentarians this morning, and I was one of them. A number of the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group met with Li Peng this morning, and amongst the issues discussed were the positive things that are happening between our two countries, not the negative things. Senator Brown only refers to the negatives that have happened in the past. Li Peng is one of China's most senior leaders, and the Australian parliament has invited him to visit this year as part of the high-level exchanges commemorating the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations. As many of you know, Li Peng visited Australia in 1988, when he laid the foundation stone of the Chinese Embassy. I suppose that you would not have wanted him to do that either, Senator Brown. In recent years he has visited a number of Western countries, not just Australia. He has visited the United States twice since the events that you talk about, as well as France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. They are hardly people who are likely to be considered among those who support actions such as the events that you talk about. They do not support those actions, but it does not mean that they do not have dialogue. Li Peng is here for dialogue with the Australian government, the Australian people and members of both sides of politics in this place, as was evident this morning when people from both sides of politics met with Li Peng. 
The events that happened in 1989, in relation to the Tiananmen Square crackdown, were criticised at that time. They were criticised heavily by the then government, supported by the opposition of the day—which is now the government. Those criticisms were made known and they were made strongly at that point in time. But if you are going to let that event rule the whole of your future political life and if you are going to let a single event determine the whole of your future for centuries to come, you would never speak to anybody, Senator Brown. To deny Li Peng entry to Australia because of his role in the Tiananmen Square crackdown in June 1989 would accomplish absolutely nothing, because in the past 30 years successive governments—and I pay tribute to the former Labor government—have done their best to develop strong relationships with China. The one way that you can deal with human rights and an abuse of human rights is to have dialogue with that country and let your thoughts be known. In all of our discussions over the past number of years with the Chinese, human rights has always been an element. In fact, there has been some success and progress on individual human rights cases, which would not be possible without dialogue. You are not in favour of dialogue, Senator Brown. You are only in favour of stunts. You will try to get any headline that you can by opposing a government or opposition position through a stunt of some sort— and history will show that. If you go through all your previous press releases and the media stunts that you have done, you will understand what people actually think in regard to how genuinely you feel about things. If you cannot do it by way of stunt, then you do not worry about doing it at all.
The discussions with Li Peng and the Chinese delegation—a significant number of people have come here with him—included talks about subjects where our views may differ a lot. That can be demonstrated in the recent very full and frank discussions in the latest round of human rights dialogues which were held here with the Chinese in Canberra in August. My colleague Senator Payne was one of those who attended and she has spoken to me at length of the issues that were raised in those human rights dialogues. If you do not approve of everything a government does, you simply cannot do anything about it if you are not prepared to have some dialogue. In this case, the Australian government supports maintaining dialogue with China and it maintains that we should look at the positive things that have happened in our relationship and not concentrate on those things which we disagree with in that country. I for one, as I said earlier, welcome this visit by Li Peng to Australia because the visit can only serve to improve the relationship between our two countries and give us a chance to talk about those policies that we disagree with in various areas, particularly in human rights.
When the crackdown in Tiananmen Square took place it was a tragedy that shocked many Australians, and it will not be forgotten. It does not take a stunt like this to make us remember—it will not be forgotten. It is partly because of those events that the government, and successive governments, have made human rights an important part of our approach to our relationship with China. The government is deeply committed to protecting human rights in China—including Tibet. It is ensuring that the values of human dignity and freedom central to Australian society are reflected in our overseas policies and in the things that we talk about with these various countries. You cannot have the most populous nation in the world being locked out of dialogue and not being given the opportunity to discuss or put their own point of view. 
As Australians we welcome all of those people travelling with Li Peng—though you may not welcome them, Senator Brown. There are a large number of members of their congress. Li Peng is the leader of this visit but there are a very big number of people with him who are talking about a range of issues which can only improve our relationship—things like our relationship in regard to business and trade. I did not hear you complain very loudly about the gas deal with China, which is worth about $25 billion to Australia. They are here to talk about tourism, and to get advice on the Olympic Games. We fully supported China's bid to host the Olympic Games in 2008. I suppose you oppose that, Senator Brown, and I would not be surprised if you opposed it because, as I said before, I have never seen you support anything yet. You are only an opposition. You are only a person who is prepared to oppose things; you are never prepared to do anything positive to put our relationship on a proper footing, which is what this government is doing in its current relationship with China—and that relationship is one which is strong and growing stronger.
While we will never forget those things that we disagree with, it does not take a motion like this to remind us of it. You are talking about an event that happened 14 years ago and much water has passed under the bridge since that time and our relationship if anything has grown stronger, even under the difficulties of having to reassess at that time what our position was in relation to the things that happened in Tiananmen Square. Senator Brown, this is another stunt, another day, but I can tell you that Li Peng is most welcome in Australia and we look forward to a much stronger relationship with a dynamic China.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Human Rights: China</title>,Matters of Urgency,14,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-09-16,"—The Australian Labor Party, and I believe the Australian community, were deeply concerned by the events of 3 and 4 June 1989 when a demonstration of students in Tiananmen Square in Beijing was suppressed by the Chinese government. At that time, the then Hawke Labor government made direct, immediate and strong representations to the Chinese government about those events. Labor's strong position on upholding international human rights standards was very strongly registered with the Chinese government then. Labor's consistent position has been that the application of universal human rights standards applies to all countries without exception. These, of course, include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the UN Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, known collectively as the UN bill of rights. It is the opposition's firm view that Australia should continue to make bilateral representations on human rights issues where appropriate, including through our embassy in Beijing, and in support of individual human rights cases that are brought forward by Amnesty International.
The Opposition—the Labor Party—also acknowledges the strides that have been made by the government in recent years in improving the social conditions of the people who live in China. We remain concerned by reports of continuing human rights abuses in China, including forced labour and, of course, the execution of prisoners. In relation to the Tiananmen Square massacre, I believe all Australians abhorred the Tiananmen Square massacre. I do not think the passage of the years has diminished that abhorrence, but Senator Brown's motion that is before the Senate today does not say anything of substance about how we can help advance human rights in China today. I do not think it has anything positive to suggest at all.
For our part, the Labor Party are committed to the further development of a very strong and multifaceted relationship with China. Later this year, of course, we mark the 30th anniversary of the opening of diplomatic relations with Beijing by the Whitlam Labor government. Three decades on, we do have a very broad based relationship with China. It has extensive commercial ties, extensive cultural ties and extensive people-to-people ties. Many thousands of Australians have deep links with China—their family ties, educational ties and business ties—and it is a very broadly based and successful relationship. We believe that relationship will only get deeper and broader with each passing year. In the context of that relationship, I think Australia should be forthright in speaking about human rights issues. We should stand up for the values that we hold dear. We should express our views in a forthright but mature way. 
For a number of years we have had a bilateral dialogue with China on human rights. Labor have been supportive of that dialogue, although we have been concerned about its lack of transparency. Behind closed doors, discussions between officials are no substitute for substantive exchanges at all levels, especially at the highest of political levels. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, raised the issue of human rights—including human rights in Tibet—on his recent visit to China, which was in April earlier this year. Mr Crean had what he termed a `frank discussion'. He said:
... the Chinese indicated the strength of their conviction that they were committed to improvements in Tibet.
Mr Crean also said:
For my part, and I indicated the importance of the issue and the concerns that are raised with us and our ability to in turn raise those with the Chinese ...
Mr Crean has emphasised his view that the relationship we have to build with China is one that recognises their political system as it is and recognises the progress that has been made there. It is one which, importantly, should be able to accommodate our raising of concerns—including our raising of concerns about human rights—with the Chinese government. Mr Crean also indicated that, if the opportunity to meet the Dalai Lama as a religious leader presented itself, he would do just that. Mr Crean was in East Timor during the Dalai Lama's last visit to Australia but our deputy leader, Ms Jenny Macklin, did meet the Dalai Lama on Mr Crean's behalf, and our shadow minister for foreign affairs, Mr Rudd, also met the Dalai Lama.
I do think that this approach by the Labor Party stands in stark contrast to that of the government. I think it is relevant to remind the Senate and the parliament today what the opposition had to say to the Australian electorate during the last election about our approach to human rights and Australia's relationship with China. We said that Labor's diplomacy would be effective and principled. We said a Labor government would make the advancement of human rights a core foreign policy objective. We have said that human rights have been pushed to the margins of Australia's foreign relations. We have said that a Labor government would actively pursue wider regional dialogue and cooperation concerning problems of sustainable economic and social development and environmental protection, with the aim of enhancing human security throughout our region.
At the bilateral level, Labor would work with vigour to build productive relationships which advance shared political and economic interests. Labor would support enhancing people-to-people contacts between Australia and our East Asian neighbours and pursue the further development of social, cultural and educational ties. We indicated that we strongly support engaging and integrating China within the emerging Asia-Pacific security community. The rise of China will inevitably transform our region. Australia's interests are best served by China's positive involvement in the international political and economic community. We have said that a Labor government would seek to work cooperatively with China—bilaterally, regionally and in global forums.
The issue that we are debating here today is a motion that stands in Senator Brown's name. I believe it is fair to say that that motion ignores the 13 years of human rights dialogue between Australia and China that has taken place since Tiananmen Square. It is in fact an opportunistic motion. I suspect that it is probably designed to produce embarrassment on the part of the Australian hosts to the visit by the Chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress, Li Peng. But, as I have said on a number of occasions in this chamber, as is so often the way, motions on foreign policy matters are blunt instruments which cannot easily express the nuances that are necessarily a part of effective international diplomacy. There are elements of the motion with which we are naturally sympathetic. There are other elements of the motion that simply do not accurately convey our position on these matters. 
If Senator Brown wished to make a substantive contribution to the Senate's consideration of these important issues he would have put forward a motion which combined our longstanding concern about human rights in China with proposals about how those rights might be advanced. A condemnatory motion timed to coincide with the Chinese leader's visit will not advance one iota the cause of human rights in China. I suspect that Senator Brown knows that that is the case. I acknowledge that Senator Brown has been to China. Senator Brown has been to Tibet. I accept that he would know the scale of the human rights problems in China. I would hope—and I am happy to accept it— that he would know the scale of the challenges to be met, ranging from reform of the judiciary and the prison system in China to the development of structures for democratic participation in government. These are all important issues. I am sorry that the motion before the chamber today does not get that balance right.
—Where's yours?
—There is no opportunity, as Senator Brown knows, because there has been no engagement of other parties in the chamber. There are elements of your motion, Senator Brown, with which I and the Labor Party are absolutely sympathetic. As I have indicated to you in this debate, there are other elements which are simply not adequate and do not accurately convey our position on these matters. It is a pity that we do not have before us a motion which advocates substantive measures designed to achieve real human rights benefits for the Chinese people. I am sorry that the motion does not do that. If it had done so, it would have been supported by the opposition. But the motion does not do that. It is a blunt instrument and it misses the important nuances I have spoken about. The choice for the opposition is to vote in favour of or against the motion—it is as simple and as stark as that—and the opposition has determined to vote against it.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Human Rights: China</title>,Matters of Urgency,14,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2002-09-16,"—I rise this afternoon to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats, as spokesperson for international human rights, in support of the motion moved by Senator Brown. While the Democrats welcome Mr Li Peng to our country and hope that his visit is a successful and educative one, we feel that there is a need to draw his attention to the ongoing human rights issues associated with China, with which many Australians remain very disturbed and which the past 13 years have not diminished.
I would like to remind the chamber of the Australian Democrats' long record of outspoken support of the Tibetan people's struggle. There have been many times when the Democrats have drawn the Senate's attention to the situation in Tibet, including expressing our concern about ongoing human rights abuses in that country by the Chinese government. The Democrats have moved motions urging the Australian government to encourage China to commence open discussions with the Dalai Lama, to release all political prisoners of conscience in Tibet, to restore full religious freedom in Tibet, to cease cultural genocide and government-encouraged population transfers, and of course to cease environmental exploitation and the dumping of nuclear waste.
The Senate has been clear in its support for the plight of the Tibetan people. Earlier this year we had a situation where the Tibetan spiritual leader and head of the Tibetan government in exile, the Dalai Lama, was not given permission to deliver a televised address in the Great Hall here in Parliament House. The Dalai Lama, as everyone knows, is one of the world's most respected spiritual leaders and an advocate of peace and non-violence. The Dalai Lama does not call for full independence but is seeking a dialogue with the Chinese government. Last year the Dalai Lama was invited to address the European parliament. He has previously addressed members of the United States Congress, yet our government would not extend to him similar hospitality. Tonight Mr Li Peng will dine at a formal dinner in the same Great Hall here in Parliament House. 
I want to assure Mr Li that the Australian Democrats and the Australian people have not forgotten the role he played in quashing the student-led actions for democracy in Tiananmen Square 13 years ago. We know that, as then Premier, he ordered the army into the square, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of unarmed citizens. We also know that there are many people in Australia who fled here as refugees after those events. The suffering of the victims' families continues, as at every anniversary they are reminded of that fateful day, 4 June 1989, when their children, husbands, wives and other relatives were killed. I hope that this debate will provide enormous food for thought in the Great Hall tonight.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Human Rights: China</title>,Matters of Urgency,14,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2002-09-16,"—We are debating a typical hollow motion of the Greens which is just another stunt in the pursuit of a headline. It is another example of where their actions do absolutely nothing for the people they are purportedly trying to assist—in this case, some of the residents of the People's Republic of China. They do considerable collateral damage to Australia and Australian interests. I think you can always trust Senator Brown to do something that will hurt Australia and offend our friends. I cannot remember Senator Brown, either at home or abroad, doing something that uplifts Australia—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I would like you to look at what the honourable senator has just said and to see if that is within standing orders.
 (Senator Ferguson)—I will do as you request but there is no point of order.
—I would point out to you that you cannot seek to look at the matter and say there is no point of order. However, I will leave that to you and await your further consideration of my point of order.
—I cannot remember—and I do not think many people in the chamber can—when Senator Brown either at home or abroad has done something that uplifts Australia or our history or our record. According to the Greens, Australia is not a country of which we can be proud. What sort of gratuitous offence would this motion, if carried, give to our third-largest trading partner at the time that one of their most senior leaders is visiting Australia? What would we feel if our Prime Minister or foreign minister were extended the same courtesy by a foreign parliament? We would be justifiably horrified and I suspect that the Chinese government would feel the same. Li Peng is the current chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress and has ranked second in the Communist Party hierarchy since 1987. The Presiding Officers have invited Li Peng to visit Australia as guest of the parliament and he will receive guest of government status.
I think it was you, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, who pointed out that he has visited Australia before, in 1988, and in recent years has visited a whole range of Western countries. For Australia to deny Li Peng because of his role in the Tiananmen Square crackdown in June 1987 would accomplish absolutely nothing. By visiting he will be exposed to a range of Australian politicians, businesspeople and a number of community groups and he will be made aware of their opinions on this matter and on other matters that are relevant to him and relevant to the Australian-Chinese relationship. I point out that, during the past 50 years, Australia has developed very strong relations with China on a commercial and cultural basis and there are also many family ties. It is a broad and successful relationship. The best way to continue building this relationship is to keep talking in a constructive way on all levels. This includes talking about subjects where our views may differ, as demonstrated by the full and frank discussions in the latest round of the human rights dialogue that the Australian government held with the Chinese in Canberra in August. We have consistently made known our views on Tiananmen Square 14 years ago, but Senator Brown's motion will do nothing to further that dialogue. 
Our government is on record over a number of years as raising legitimate areas of human rights concerns not only with China but also, as you mentioned, Mr Acting Deputy President, with Chile and a number of other countries around the world. Countries have also raised areas of human rights concerns with us and, in fact, have done so quite recently with regard to our policy on detention centres. We are in the business of pursuing cordial diplomatic relations with countries—particularly with China—and not the opposite. As has been said on a number of occasions in diplomacy, `words are bullets', and these words are not appropriate, particularly at this time. It is not often that I agree with almost everything that Senator Faulkner says in this place, but I do agree with the main thrust of his speech today because he said this motion is a very blunt instrument to approach a very delicate problem.
The Australian-Chinese relationship grows stronger every year. This year is the 30th anniversary of formal diplomatic relations but many Australian companies have traded with China for much longer. The Australian Wheat Board, one of our large international trading corporations, has always considered China to be one of its most consistent and reliable markets. Since 1949 the Australian Wheat Board has sold Australian wheat to China, which is a terrific record. I think it is the oldest market that we have—it is certainly the most consistent— and that relationship has been very beneficial to Australian wheat growers. They not only buy wheat; they buy other grains as well. It is a very important market and it has been a very strong relationship. This year, given the potential scope for progress, Australia has increased its efforts to improve market access in a whole range of things, and a new framework with China to enhance trade investment and economic cooperation will be a major priority in 2002. This will establish strategic relations with China in a number of key sectors: for example, financial, legal, education and social welfare services, agriculture—which, of course, has always been strong—the environment and the Beijing Olympics. It will also complement Australia's negotiations for improved access to China in the new multilateral trade round under the ongoing arrangements for the accession of China to the WTO.
A most exciting announcement was made of Australia's biggest ever trade deal with China last month. China's first LNG scheme will provide gas for electricity generation and town use in Guangdong Province. China wants the project to be running by 2005 and Australia LNG was one of the three companies short-listed in January 2001 to supply the project. It might interest the Senate that there were other possible short-listed suppliers. There was Exxon Mobil from Qatar and BP from Indonesia; they were the other possible suppliers and so the competition was intense. The first supply contract was signed and announced on 8 August 2002.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-09-16,"—I rise to speak in favour of the Greens' motion that we are currently debating. The Greens believe that it is important that people are aware of the presence in Australia today of Li Peng, the second highest official in the largest communist party in the world, to discuss trade issues with the current government. However, the Greens also believe that it is important that people are aware that Li Peng, as my colleague articulated, is the butcher of Tiananmen Square and the person responsible for ordering tanks and guns to be used against innocent civilians and students who were protesting for democratic reform within the People's Republic of China.
It is important that the Australian public is also aware that Li Peng has ordered the latest crackdown on the Tibetans in their peaceful movement. It is also important that people realise that Li Peng and his government continue to support the crackdown of a range of political movements, particularly Falun Gong practitioners in China. I understand that most recently there have been 467 deaths of Falun Gong practitioners because of torture carried out in China, and hundreds of thousands of people have been detained and sentenced for their involvement in this peaceful organisation. 
The government would have us believe that they raise human rights issues when they meet Chinese delegations. The Greens question the resolve of this government in truly committing to raising human rights issues through genuine dialogue with Chinese delegations. We believe that it is particularly valid to question this government's resolve on issues of human rights when the government are currently introducing legislation in Australia to increase the power of ASIO and to hold people in detention without charge, thereby undermining civil liberties and the underpinning of Western legal systems.
When this government continue to dismiss human rights by their actions here, how can we believe that they genuinely pursue these issues when they meet Chinese delegations? The great irony is that the government are such vocal cheerleaders on the invasion of Iraq on the basis that there is an undemocratic regime which abuses human rights, uses fatal force against its own population and holds weapons of mass destruction. There is a great irony in this government continuing to pursue these actions against Iraq without recognising that human rights abuses are occurring in a range of other countries that should be dealt with internationally in a non-violent way. This government have failed in relation to Iraq— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Human Rights: China</title>,Matters of Urgency,14,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-09-16,"—I rise in relation to this matter of urgency moved by Senator Brown. Like Senator Faulkner, I am disappointed that, in a sense, the motion does not go to the position now. It effectively summarises where we were. It lacks a sense of: where to from there? Senator Brown expressed cogently the problems that beset the government of China. However, perhaps we can highlight some of the issues that spawned the events of 4 June 1989. When you go back to Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989, no doubt many of my contemporaries and those older than me will recollect the television images of the pro-democracy protests of 1989 in the People's Republic of China. All will no doubt recall the TV images of the youth challenging a tank near Tiananmen Square. It was a student demonstration. However, it became something more. Those images have been reconveyed over the past 13-and-a-bit years, but they have become something more. It is now argued that China's leadership believes that the protest amounted to a counter-revolutionary rebellion with the purpose of seizing power.
Some in the government of the day say that 331 people, mainly students, lost their lives in the event. That figure is still open to debate. On the other hand, demonstrators said at the time that the aim was to persuade the government to adopt reform. Even with the benefit of hindsight, it is difficult to come to a conclusion about that position. However, we can come to a clear understanding of the issue of where we go from there. There is no doubt that it remains a tragic event which should not be forgotten, glossed over or left out. Zhao Ziyang favoured a less confrontational approach at the time, but that was not taken. In fact, he was purged. I am sure that Australians were shocked and appalled by those events. For its part, Australia allowed many Chinese people who were students in Australia to remain and, as I understand it, 30,000 took up that offer. Many of them have returned home, many have formed bonds and friendships with Australians and many continue to stay in Australia and participate in a vibrant democracy.
However, when we look at those issues we should also bear in mind that Australians cherish their democracy and cherish the ability to have free speech and to engage in the political debates that we so often have here. We can see that, for its part, China has been going through economic reform. Under Deng, a reform program and an open-door policy have been at the forefront of their push. However, can it be said that China's position on human rights has improved? Is it now appropriate to have a debate in respect of that here? Perhaps the best that can be said is yes, but it has not been a steady or gradual process in terms of improvements clearly articulated by this government or by the Chinese government itself.
Many problems remain and many setbacks have occurred. Critical law reform and the establishment of a more accountable and effective administration system are still a long way off. Australia, though, can play a constructive role. It can play a much more constructive role than, I suggest, Senator Brown's motion does. It can do so by criticism, by bringing the debate to China, by dissuading China, by jawboning. Whilst the debate continues, the issues are put forward at least and, notwithstanding the sentiment, they do not go off the table. They are not matters that are removed. 
However, we also have to look at this: it is no answer to China's human rights position to argue that the Chinese people now enjoy significant improvements. It is no answer to say that their daily lives may have improved over the last 14 years. There have been setbacks, as we fully know and appreciate. They have manifested themselves in issues such as religious minorities being persecuted and the banning of publications about those religious sects. But some of the important things that should not be forgotten are the entry of China into the World Trade Organisation and China's signature to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights—and, with our encouragement, they may sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Those issues must remain on the table. They need to be spoken about. They need to be continually jawboned to ensure that issues such as the ratification of the ICCPR can proceed. Australia has actively encouraged China to ratify the ICCPR. Those are the issues that I would have preferred to have seen in Senator Brown's motion, in a positive motion about where to go from here.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-09-16,"—I thank Senator Ludwig for giving me some of his time in this debate on Li Peng's visit to Australia. Let me be perfectly clear: those who support this motion are not anti-Chinese or anti-Chinese people. I personally am a great supporter of helping, both officially and through private arrangements, the areas that are flooded. It is very important that we have dialogue with the Chinese people and make that effective dialogue—that is, action, not just words. But here we have a person who presided over the massacre in Tiananmen Square. He not only presided over that; on the anniversary of that massacre, he introduced stricter security measures. Li Peng's statements about human rights are very revealing. For example, on 30 January this year he wrote to the China Society for Human Rights Studies on the launch of their human rights magazine. This is what he said about universality:
While universal, human rights have their peculiarities. Owing to differences in historical background, social system, cultural tradition and the level of economic development, different countries and peoples have different understandings of human rights.
That opens the door to almost anything. Right now there are people languishing in jail because of the gross violation of their human rights. Li Peng has been implicated in violations of religious freedom and in brutal population control programs involving forced abortions, sterilisations, fines and other punishments in the PRC and in Tibet. As a parliament—at least as a parliament— which is a democratically elected parliament and has a special role in the protection of the rights and liberties of citizens, we should not be feting, at the behest of the executive government, this person. I appeal to the Senate: listen to this and see whether or not the action that is taken by Senator Brown is more likely to be brought to the attention of the visitor than doing nothing. I support the motion.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Human Rights: China</title>,Matters of Urgency,14,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2002-09-16,"—I have listened with interest to a great deal of the discussion and debate this afternoon on this urgency motion relating to Li Peng. My interest is made more acute in many ways by the fact that in recent times I have been honoured to chair the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade—as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, being the chair of the joint committee. In that role, in August I had the opportunity to participate in the last round of the Australia-China human rights dialogue held here in Canberra with Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Wang Guangya. That has in many ways refined, if you like, my attention to some of these matters. I think it is imperative that a discussion of genuinely held human rights concerns be held in this chamber, in the other place and in the Australian community in general. There are issues that I suspect we pay inadequate attention to at the best of times. I know that Senator Harradine, as a regular and fervent supporter of the work of the subcommittee, would possibly agree with that. 
In this debate, though, I do see a very important difference between some of the discussions that have been held and my own view. In some ways I think it is very important to take an approach of positive engagement as a way of going about business in this area. Since 1997 we have engaged in a constructive human rights dialogue that has shown manifest and palpable progress in how we are dealing with the issue and how the Chinese government is responding to that. I took part in the human rights dialogue this year, and that was the first opportunity I have had to do that. Many senators would know that my predecessor, Peter Nugent, who was the Chair of the Human Rights Subcommittee, was a Sinophile of no small order and a person with a great commitment to human rights who has participated in the dialogue on previous occasions. 
These are not easy programs to put together and they are not easy to construct so that they do make a real impact. I was very interested to see how the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade went about doing that. Through the Deputy Secretary, Alan Thomas, through Murray McLean, Kyle Wilson and their teams, I think it is important to acknowledge the effort that they put into making those programs work. When we sat down to discuss these matters across the table, there were a number of issues in the back of my mind. In fact, 4 June 1989 is one of those dates which one remembers in life. It is one of those dates when you remember where you were when you heard about the events of Tiananmen Square—I certainly do. I know exactly where I was and I know exactly the response that was felt in my heart and my mind to those appalling events. 
I think that Senator Ludwig made some very valuable points in his remarks. Through some of the processes that we have undertaken, there have been changes and genuine advances on the Chinese side—many of which many members of this parliament may say are inadequate and many of which many members of this parliament say do not even come close, but they are changes and they are positive ones. They have made some constructive differences to the lives of hundreds of millions of Chinese people. 
At the same time in the human rights dialogue we discussed at length the treatment of women and children. For example, it came to my attention for the first time in that dialogue that the suicide rate of women in China is one of the highest, if not the highest, in the world. It involves hundreds and hundreds of women taking their lives each day. It occurs for reasons I have not yet had an opportunity to explore in any meaningful way, but I hope I will have a chance to—reasons which are not explained to us and which are not apparent to me. Those sorts of issues were raised and discussed.
I think the minister acknowledged in his press statement after those discussions that for the first time, in response to Australia raising individual cases with China, the Chinese provided a detailed account of each of the cases. But of the 25 cases raised on that day, six people involved had already been released from prison and one had had her sentence remitted. There is much further to go—even that leaves 19 more people. That is still not enough but it is some change. The activities that are pursued under the human rights technical program—and we have announced a new set of activities for 2002-03—are very important to the people of China in being able to progress this process. I think the discussion this afternoon has been a constructive one and I am glad to have had the opportunity to participate.(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Human Rights: China</title>,Matters of Urgency,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-09-16,"—I thank all members for their participation. I have to say that, where words may be diplomatic bullets, silence is consent. Where there were real tears even by the Prime Minister of this country at the time of Tiananmen Square, if there are tears now they are in silence. There is a balm of silence being offered to Li Peng in this place tonight—as he is feted here—in the absence of members of the crossbench. I will be moving to ask why it is, when Presiding Officers have a leading representative of a government like China in this place, there was no invitation to the Greens or to the Democrats to be at that function. I do not accept that there should be a political line-up of invitees when the President of this chamber and the Speaker in the other place invite a member of the world political community to a dinner in this place. It compounds the problem that we have heard manifest in this debate that the best Australian leaders on both sides can do at this time is stay silent. It is an obsequious silence which sends the message to Li Peng: `It's okay. We won't raise the problems of the people in prison, the people who are being shot or the people who are being tortured.' I am not talking about a few people or hundreds; I am talking about thousands and thousands of people.  
Senator Nettle spoke about more than 400 Falun Gong people who have been killed in prisons in the last couple of years because they practised a different religion to that allowed by the state. How can we remain silent about that? Of course this man is in the country to discuss trade but why should that be the be-all and end-all? Why should human rights be sacrificed on the altar of discussion on trade?

(3)	That regulation 7.8.22 of the Corporations Amendment Regulations 2002 (No. 3), as contained in Statutory Rules 2002 No. 41 and made under the Corporations Act 2001, be disallowed. 
Unfortunately the government has not sought to seriously negotiate with us on this issue, which is a great disappointment to me. I believe it was possible and it is still possible to find a resolution of this matter that would be a reasonable compromise. The regulations which we are seeking to disallow and which are the subject of my motion cover two substantive areas: the disclosure of fees in product disclosure statements and the hours for making unsolicited phone calls to market financial products. As I said, I am disappointed that the government cannot support my intention to improve fee disclosure and to promote the interests of consumers. I am dismayed at the way the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer has handled this matter. He has shown that he is willing to misrepresent Labor's position consistently and that, once again, he is beholden to the interests of big business and, in this case in particular, Australia's large financial institutions represented by IFSA.
The Financial Services Reform Act promised some good reforms in the area of disclosure of fees and charges. There was bipartisan support for the legislation. In fact there was complete support, with the Democrats and the minor parties, from recollection, also supporting this legislation. The support was there because it was perceived to make significant improvements in ensuring that investors could make informed financial decisions. However, because of the complexity of many of the fees charged on financial products, it is not enough just to disclose: the fees must be disclosed in a way that is meaningful to consumers.
I have maintained for a long time that that would require dollar disclosure of costs, fees and charges—whenever possible—and the inclusion in the PDS of a single figure as indicative of the impact of all fees and charges on a product. There have been a sufficient number of cases of consumers paying way too much in fees or being inadequately informed about the level of fees to show the need for these initiatives. However, the regulations tabled earlier this year are inadequate. It was unfortunate that the FSR Bill was passed before the regulations were finalised, especially when so much of the detail was left to be dealt with by the regulations. But Labor, the Democrats and others combined to pass them in good faith. The result has been that parliamentary scrutiny of the regulations has not been possible until this late stage. Moreover, Labor was not consulted before the regulations were introduced into parliament.
The parliamentary secretary will say that these regulations were subject to extensive consultation and that it was just that nobody bothered to hold any discussions with the Democrats, nobody bothered to hold discussions with the minor parties and the Independents, and nobody bothered to have any discussions with the Labor Party prior to the tabling of these regulations. You will hear much about the extensive consultations and Senator Campbell will be right in every respect, except when it comes to this final set of regulations. The FSR was discussed extensively. Senator Murray, others and I have been on many committees looking at this legislation and these regulations—except for this final set of regulations.
Evidence obtained by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities shows that, in relation to regulation 7.9.11, the effectiveness of that consultation must be questioned. ASFA, the peak superannuation body, spoke of patchy expertise and difficulties in getting people in Treasury up to speed on the details of superannuation during the consultation period. ASFA also indicated that, despite their urgings that the disclosure regulations be subject to consumer comprehension testing, this was not done. As ASFA explained to the committee, the regulations were not just about the law but about how effectively they communicated the information to consumers. That made testing essential. Testing now completed by ASFA has confirmed very poor results for the OMC and its ability to provide a useful tool for consumers.
The only organisation that has taken the time to go out there and see whether these regulations are worth while or not has come back and said: `It is a disaster. It misleads consumers.' In fact, so incredible were the results ASFA have indicated that, in the absence of a sunset clause of an appropriate length, they would prefer no regulation at all—no 7.9.11. That is an extraordinary position to take—the results are so damning. For the government to want to press ahead with this just shows you how in the pocket of IFSA they are. This evidence supports the need for the government to act now to improve the regulations. I again extend the offer to Senator Campbell to engage in some discussions within the chamber in the next 30 or 40 minutes to try and resolve this. 
The regulations are flawed and must be improved if the objectives of the FSRA are to be met. But, no, the government's response is to ask me and others in the chamber to wait until 2006 before the regulations are re-examined. That was the last written offer the government made: four years of confusion and misleading information for consumers—and then no promise to fix it; just a review. That is the part I find most distressing: no commitment on behalf of the government whatsoever to accept that their model is flawed, other than to say, `We'll review it in 2006, but we already think it is good enough and we're going to support it again.'
Labor says this is simply unacceptable. Among other things, regulation 7.9.11 prescribes the inclusion of an ongoing management charge, or OMC, in the product disclosure statements of superannuation products. ASFA had the following to say about regulation 7.9.11 and the OMC:
The ongoing management charge, the OMC, is of particular concern to us. It is significantly flawed as a measure. Notably, it does not include entry and exit fees that may dramatically affect a member's benefit. It fails to demonstrate the actual impact of fees and charges on a member's benefit.
It fails to demonstrate the very thing that the FSR actually wants it to demonstrate. ASFA went on:
ASFA strongly recommends that Treasury replace this OMC requirement in the superannuation PDS requirements with an expense measure and examples that will better enable comparability.
Similarly, the Australian Consumers Association have said:
The explanatory memorandum with regard to the FSR stated that the aim of such new measures as the product disclosure statement will be to provide customers with sufficient information to make informed decisions in relation to the acquisition of financial products including the ability to compare a range of products.
That is the key here: how can consumers make an informed decision when they are not able to compare like products? In the view of the ACA, this means an advance on the current position and a lot of the confusion which many consumers report to that organisation when they negotiate the financial services market, but unfortunately it does not appear that this has been met with some of the measures that have been introduced post FSR—in particular, the ongoing management charge. It is clear that the OMC is flawed and must be improved. It is not the only measure, and work that is being done elsewhere can be used to improve the disclosure in the PDS.
In June 2001, Rainmaker Information Services released a fee calculator which calculates a total expense ratio. This is not rocket science. The Australian Consumers Association themselves have released a choice fee disclosure model which calculates a total fee impact and which was presented at the most recent IFSA conference.
The financial services association in the UK has a fee calculator on its web site. This is achievable—if the industry wants it to be achievable. ASFA has been in discussions with the academic Hazel Bateman of the University of New South Wales, who is also working on a more comprehensive expense metric. Clearly, there is a base of work that can be used to improve the FSR regulations—only this government does not want that. It does not want consumers understanding the level of fees they are paying.
The other failure in this regulation is also the result of the parliamentary secretary succumbing to the pressure of the big financial institutions. Regulation 7.9.11 only applies to superannuation products. What is the difference between disclosure to a customer of a super product and disclosure to a customer of a managed investment? There is none. Investors in managed funds will not obtain any additional disclosure which may assist their understanding of fees. This is contrary to the very objectives of the FSR. That is why it is important that this regulation be disallowed: to encourage this government and to encourage an industry that does not want to come clean, that does not want to front up and tell its customers what it is actually charging them. It must be consistent. It must be on both managed investments and superannuation. 
Everyone must understand that the purpose of the act was to consistently and comprehensively protect consumers irrespective of the type of financial product or advice. That was the stated objective. That was what Minister Hockey fought for. That was what Minister Hockey had the guts to stand up to people on. To his credit, he delivered a pretty good piece of legislation. Since the election we have seen backsliding after Minister Hockey was summarily dismissed by the Prime Minister. That is the tragedy here: the government have backslidden on their own commitments.
Before I move on to the regulations dealing with hours for making prescribed hours, the parliamentary secretary will also no doubt protest that if the regulations are changed there will be uncertainty for those who have already opted into the FSR regime. This is utter rubbish. We now have the provisions to manage the transition to the FSR and there is no problem finding those transitions and using those transitional arrangements to work our way through this issue as well. We could have provisions to manage the transition to any changed regulatory regime. Do not be frightened by the scare campaign of IFSA. Do not be frightened by the scare campaign of the parliamentary secretary.
Turning to regulation 7.8.22, which deals with the hours for making unsolicited telephone calls to market financial products, I have the following comments. Labor moved the amendment to the FSRA limiting the hours for making unsolicited telephone calls, but had hoped and had believed that the regulations would be more responsible. Instead, the regulations allow cold-calling between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. and on any day other than Christmas Day, Easter Sunday and Good Friday. I understand that the hours have been chosen to be identical to the hours permitted for the unsolicited sale of any other type of product. There are significant differences between a financial product and a set of steak knives. Such differences support having different hours. I believe that most in the financial services industry do not cold-call on a Sunday, so why does this government want to let every spiv out there get on the phone and annoy people on a Sunday when they should be with their families? This minister and parliamentary secretary want the spivs to be loose, annoying people on Anzac Day and on a Sunday.
—On Anzac Day?
—On Anzac Day. Can you believe that, Senator Sherry?
—You should not, because he is wrong. He is misleading the Senate again. He is a serial offender.
—I look forward to your contribution, Senator Campbell. Once again, the parliamentary secretary would rather not protect the interests of the consumers but would prefer to obey the wishes of the Australian Direct Marketing Association. Disallowance of the regulation will not prevent the parliamentary secretary tabling immediately after its disallowance—
—If you do not know the difference between a set of steak knives and selling life insurance on the phone, Senator Campbell, then you have just proven to be the real estate agent you have always been. 
—At least I have had a real job.
—A real job—a real estate agent. There is a real job; I would be proud of that one. No wonder real estate agents are not roped in by this bill either. I would like now to detail the negotiations that have occurred between me and the parliamentary secretary, because I am afraid the parliamentary secretary has regularly misrepresented me to other senators. 
I first wrote to the parliamentary secretary on 27 February seeking information on the regulations. There was no reply from the parliamentary secretary. I wrote again on 18 March 2002 seeking a briefing on the matters raised in my February letter. Once again there was no written reply. In late March I initiated an inquiry by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the FSR regulations and related ASIC policy statements. On 4 April, after persistent requests by phone, I was finally given a briefing by Treasury officers. At the time I confirmed I still had concerns but once again there was no follow-up from the parliamentary secretary. On 23 May 2002 the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Financial Services held its first public hearing and obtained the evidence I have referred to earlier—still no comment from the parliamentary secretary. I have also used Senate estimates to explore the FSR regulations. My concerns were well known to the parliamentary secretary because the parliamentary secretary was chairing the Senate estimates in which I raised these concerns.  
—I was chairing that one, was I?
—You were sitting there. My apologies; not chairing, Senator Campbell, you are right on that one. You were representing the government on the other side of the table. For the parliamentary secretary to maintain that I have not made known as early as possible my concerns recalling that Labor was not consulted on the regulations is wrong. Labor has not entered at the eleventh hour, as the parliamentary secretary continues to try to represent publicly, and continues to try to misrepresent, but did so on 27 February, six months ago, within a week—probably less than a week— of the regulations being actually promulgated and tabled. 
When I gave notice of my motion to disallow the regulations, I immediately wrote to the parliamentary secretary seeking to commence negotiations. This was before the winter recess when time may have permitted some comprehensive discussions. But the parliamentary secretary did not reply. Accordingly, I wrote again on 3 July 2002. Finally, on 20 August I received a reply from the parliamentary secretary and we met on the following day. On 26 August I wrote again to the parliamentary secretary proposing that sunset clauses apply to the regulations. A period of 12 months was suggested. On 27 August the parliamentary secretary replied:
I am happy to progress the suggestion of a sunset clause and have asked the CEOs of ASFA and IFSA to suggest a reasonable timetable for the testing of the existing provisions and formulating any improved provisions. I believe that a sunset date of no earlier than 11 March 2004 would be reasonable but I will be guided by key stakeholders including investors and shareholders. Once I have agreed to a timeline I will instruct Treasury to draft an appropriate regulation for circulation.
So Senator Campbell wrote to me and suggested 11 March 2004. I happily accept that. Once he had agreed to a time line, as he said, he would instruct Treasury. Upon receipt of that letter of 27 August, my office clarified to what regulations that sunset period would apply, and indicated that I would wait to hear from the parliamentary secretary regarding his discussions with ASFA and IFSA.
ASFA replied to the parliamentary secretary on 29 August that they supported a sunset clause of 12-months duration. I have not been advised of the content of discussions with IFSA. Accordingly, on 12 September I wrote to the parliamentary secretary seeking advice on the progress on determining the length of a sunset clause and proposing arrangements for today assuming that the sunset clauses were to be proceeded with. Instead, between faxing the letter to the parliamentary secretary's Canberra office and his Perth office, his Canberra office faxed me a copy of a letter he had sent to Senator Murray—not to me but to Senator Murray. Those faxes literally passed in the fax ether, and his letter stated:
In good faith I pursued the sunset clause proposal including approaches to the CEOs of ASFA and IFSA for suggested timetables. Unfortunately, Senator Conroy has not withdrawn the motion and the uncertainty created by the disallowance continues. In any event agreement to a sunset clause for the superannuation disclosure regulations would have only served to perpetuate the industry and consumer uncertainty that Senator Conroy's motion introduced to the FSRA transitional process. I am still open to the application of a sunset clause but only in relation to allowable hawking hours. 
A week or two before, he thought it was reasonable to have a two-year sunset clause for the OMC, but, once the industry had told him that he could not have it, he folded. As Senator Murray points out in his reply to the parliamentary secretary on 13 September:
My understanding when parliament last rose was that this matter would be resolved by the government tabling proposed sunset clause provisions of, say, between 12 and 18 months for the two provisions within these regulations that are the subject of the Labor disallowance motion. Labor would then withdraw their disallowance motion. While Senator Conroy's letter conforms with this understanding, your letter alters the situation.
The parliamentary secretary clearly misrepresented me to Senator Murray and the independent senators who are copied into his letter to Senator Murray. Since then, we have got to this current ridiculous situation, where the parliamentary secretary now proposes in writing a sunset clause expiring on 11 March 2006 in relation to the fee disclosure regulation. He would prefer to have everyone transit to a flawed regime rather than try to fix it before everyone has to transit. The parliamentary secretary has shown himself willing to misrepresent me to my fellow senators. He would not respond to my much earlier request for discussions and now, at literally seconds to midnight, he will blame me for creating uncertainty.
Labor wants certainty and wants to protect the interests of investors. The parliamentary secretary is beholden to the big players in the financial services industry, and IFSA in particular. As people have recently noted, the funds management industry is now 55 per cent controlled by the banks. IFSA is now starting to behave like the banks, and IFSA is going to get the reputation for the greed and excess of the banks if it continues down this path. This issue will not go away. This is not an issue that is a one-day wonder, Senator Campbell. You can protect this industry as long as you want, but disclosure will come to this industry whether they want it or not, and they are clearly demonstrating that they do not want it today. I can now only reflect on how accurate an indication of the parliamentary secretary's behaviour an article which appeared in the Australian Financial Review on 2 August 2002 is. The article says:
The Investment and Financial Services Association appears to have established a close and influential relationship with the Howard Government, with its views embodied in regulations for disclosure of fees on managed investments.
IFSA is so influential that one government adviser referred The Australian Financial Review to the lobby group this week when asked for a detailed explanation of the new disclosure regulations that will put the Financial Services Reform Bill into effect.
That is right—when a journalist phoned Senator Campbell's office and asked why the regulations were in the form that they were in, the government adviser referred them to IFSA for an explanation. It says it all.
—That is not true.
—I have not seen an apology, a retraction or a letter from you, Senator Campbell, or from anyone in your office.
—They can do the retraction.
—This is the same man who initially opposed Labor's amendments to the Corporations Act to require the disclosure of executive remuneration. This is an important issue, Senator Campbell. Your office referred queries on these regulations to IFSA. You stand condemned in the newspapers. You have not issued a press statement denying it. You have not written a letter to the Financial Review that has been published; you may have, but I have not seen it.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-09-16,"—For the benefit of the Senate, could I describe the importance of the debate that we are having here today. The Financial Services Reform Act is regarded in Australia and around the world as being the pre-eminent piece of consumer protection legislation in financial services. It is renowned in London, Europe, Washington, New York and most parts of Asia as being a world leading piece of legislation and a regulatory framework enforced by a well resourced and very effective regulator in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. It imposes a raft of new regulatory requirements on financial services providers, including a licensing regime which ASIC are now charged with implementing. It will ensure that many thousands of people who have been offering financial services previously and have not had to be licensed will have to go through what, for many of them, will be the tortuous, expensive and time consuming process of being licensed. 
At the moment much of the time of the very busy and dedicated staff within my office, the Treasury and, very importantly, the regulator—that is, ASIC—is spent on dealing with people seeking financial services licences. Most of the priority of my work at the moment is to ensure that the transition to this new regime is a success. I cannot guarantee that it will be at the moment. We have massively increased the resources of ASIC to ensure that it has the people required with the skills and processes required to ensure that the licensing, surveillance and compliance testing takes place. I am ensuring, as the government and my officers within my office, the Treasury and ASIC are ensuring, that the introduction of this massive new arrangement takes place in a way that protects consumers. That is what we are trying to achieve at the moment.
We set out on the path of achieving this new regime when I first came into the Treasury portfolio in late 1996 and received a report called Good advice prepared by Lynn Ralph, then a Deputy Chairman of ASIC, and subsequently a report by Stan Wallis's financial services inquiry. Both those reports homed in on two key features. The first was that we needed a legislative regime that treated the regulations and disclosure for all financial products in a similar way. For example, CLERP 6, as it was called then, sought to regulate the stock exchange and the futures exchange in a similar way. We also sought to ensure that all other financial products were regulated and licensed, and the licences were complied with, in a similar way. Not a single person has had anything but massive respect for the process.
I wrote the CLERP 6 policy between 1997 and 1998 but I pay tribute to my successor in the portfolio, and now my predecessor in the portfolio, the then Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Joe Hockey, who had to do a lot of the detailed work between 1998 and 2001 to get FSRA into final legislative shape and, of course, he worked with Treasury, industry and all stakeholders, including consumers and shareholders, to get the regulations in shape. The consultations were lengthy, detailed, genuine and have produced an outstanding regime. 
Anyone who comes into the Senate and claims that either the law or the regulation, and particularly this regulation that we are focusing on now, is anything but world's best practice does not know what they are talking about. They do not understand it. For a senator to say that the OMC is somehow misleading and to have the Senate believe that the OMC is the only part of this regulation and to ignore all of the other legal requirements in both the law and the regulation is indeed to deliberately seek to mislead this chamber, because it is not the truth. I ask any senator who seeks to vote on this to do one thing: read the regulation that Labor is seeking to disallow and read the law. The law says that financial product issuers have to produce a product disclosure statement—a PDS—which must provide information in a clear, concise and effective manner on matters that might reasonably be expected to have a material influence on a retail client's decision to acquire the product. Those are all very special words—words that we have derived through a dedication to corporate law reform within this government because of the massive failure of the law during the 1980s and parts of the 1990s because things like prospectuses and disclosures to consumers and potential investors were not clear and were not concise. They were huge documents that no retail investor would bother reading, and most of them did not—the comprehension testing showed that. So this government came up with the idea of creating a legal requirement to have clear and concise and, most importantly, effective disclosure. 
The act, the law of the land which came into force on 11 March, also specifies, quite clearly—and the regulation cannot take away from this requirement; the regulation we are talking about can only add to it—that a PDS must include but not be limited to information on: the issuer-seller contact details; the significant benefits and entitlements and provisions; significant risks; costs, amounts payable, direct and/or indirect; commissions and payments affecting returns; significant characteristics; rights, terms, conditions, obligations; dispute resolution mechanisms; significant tax implications, which will be something I know Senator Murphy would want to hear about; an applicable cooling off regime; access to further information; and any ethical investment considerations. 
What does this regulation do to go further? It does not just include on OMC. It includes an OMC—a model that was put in place by Labor and it is a model that stands by itself. After all these months Senator Conroy came in here and said, `I've written to the parliamentary secretary and I've phoned him and I've been to estimates and asked questions.' He never raised the questions about the hawking hours, which I have already addressed in good faith. I have made it quite clear to senators that I want to reflect community standards in the regulation about hours. I make a commitment here and now that I will as soon as is practicably possible—which involves basically the process of gazetting a regulation; I have to get it out to Government House and go through the procedures and let the other attorneys-general have notice of it and so forth—get rid of the regulation that allows people to call on Sunday and I will immediately have a consultation, which should and will take only a couple of weeks to ensure that the regulation about the hours of contact reflects community standards. I have indicated to all senators who have been involved in these discussions, including Senator Conroy, I believe, that things like Anzac Day, Christmas Day and Easter are days that I do not believe the community would regard as reasonable to receive a phone call from someone selling a financial service. I think the regulations should reflect those community standards, and I commit the government to ensure that as soon as practicably possible the regulation does reflect that community standard and days like Christmas Day, Easter, Anzac Day and any other days will be prohibited. Sunday will be prohibited as soon as I can do it now without any further consultation. We have the message on that.
Labor seek to sweep this regulation away and offer no replacement, no alternative model. They have had months and months and have left the industry in uncertainty. The industry will not produce a product disclosure statement while the law is in a vacuum, and it has been in a vacuum since about May when Senator Conroy made a throwaway line at an estimates committee—which was the very first time we knew that he was talking about getting rid of a regulation. It was the first time he had talked about it. I said, `Senator, you can't be serious; you are going to disallow the reg, are you?' and he said, `We're thinking about it.' That was in May—three months ago. Talk about five minutes to midnight; I have never called it that—I have called it five minutes after midnight. Midnight was midnight on 11 March, Senator, and we are now here in September. The industry has been uncertain about what law it is going to have issue PDSs under since the day you raised and created that uncertainty.
I have worked very hard to find a way to get rid of that uncertainty to the extent of saying: if you want to have a review, let us have a sunset clause. But let us not negotiate about it or have so many months or have a Labor deal of splitting the difference on votes or whatever, let us consult with ASFA, IFSA and industry and find a sensible time line. I have always said to anyone who has asked that we will review this regime after a reasonable period. It is quite clear to me after consulting with both ASFA and IFSA that ASFA's preference was for a very short sunset clause and to try to find some comprehension testing to find potentially a new model—but they did not know what the model might be—within six months. That was their first preference.
AFSA said that they did not want the uncertainty to continue through the transition period. They agree with IFSA that you have got to get a regulatory regime in place and allow people to get on with business, allow people to create financial products and attract investment. So, in a way, AFSA fully support IFSA. IFSA said, `No. If you are going to have a sunset period, it needs to be well after the transition because otherwise people will not issue products; they will not know what the law is.' So even though AFSA and IFSA disagree on the dates, in a way, they had the same philosophy, which is that we have got to allow industry to get on with business. 
After that consultation it has become quite clear to me that you have two choices. One choice would be for you to knock off the regulation today and go back and rely on the law. I make it quite clear to the Senate that to ensure that the industry has certainty, to ensure that consumers have certainty, the government will not introduce another regulation in relation to this throughout the transition period if this goes down today. It would be absurd to continue the uncertainty that Senator Conroy's disallowance has created.
What I have agreed to do, through consultations and discussions with various Independent senators and the Democrats, is to have a review commencing on 1 March 2005. I will introduce a regulation to this effect in the first possible practical time frame—and I am happy to table a draft today—and the sunset clause applying to the regulation in relation to disclosure will apply at 30 September 2005. The government is committed to a review but it will allow the industry certainty to go forward to issue PDSs, to create new financial products, to allow Australians to invest—to invest in enterprises, to grow people's wealth, to grow a better country and to give consumers better quality information.
So what does this regulation that we are talking about today do, over and above the law? It ensures that the details of contributions need to be disclosed. It requires that a statement of the method of calculation of any significant benefits to which a holder of the product will or may become entitled on acquiring the product be disclosed. In relation to death and/or disability insurance, it requires a statement about (a) whether the fund provides death insurance, disability insurance or both, (b) whether those benefits are compulsory or voluntary, (c) whether a person must give information about the person's health before being eligible for insurance cover and (d) the time from which a person would be covered by the insurance and when the cover would cease.
It also requires that the details of the investor's investment options and their risk profiles be disclosed or, if no choice of investment strategy is offered, the investment strategy of the fund and its risk profile be disclosed. It requires the disclosure of investment returns in recent years. It requires disclosure of the charges of the fund for any contribution charge, direct account charge, investment management charge, exit charge or switching charge of the fund. It requires a description of the charge, the amount of the charge expressed as a fixed amount or, if it is not practical to express the fixed amount, it requires that the amount be expressed as a percentage of the contributions. It also requires disclosure of the member's benefits or the assets of the fund, the ongoing management charge and so on.
So on top of the law that says you have to disclose every charge, every cost, every commission and all of those other details that I have enumerated, the regulation requires further disclosure of that. Labor have said, `Chuck it out. We don't want it. Let's have a sunset clause for 12 or 18 months, or let's split the difference.' That is very clever and sensible policy on the run! It is a dilettante's approach to very important policy that affects the lives of hundreds upon thousands of Australians for which decent law-abiding citizens—people who care about policy, people who care about building Australia— have put in thousands of hours of work. For a desperate grab for relevance in the area of economic policy, a senator comes in and says, `Let's have a fight over this.' It is a desperate grab for relevance at a time when they have become irrelevant. They cannot differentiate the product, so they say, `Let's differentiate on this.' What a performance! No cohesive, coherent policy approach; no alternative policy.  
You have got Senator Conroy saying, `Let's apply the requirements of superannuation across to the managed investments schemes', when in fact the law already applies to both, and Senator Sherry saying, `No, that is inappropriate; super should have special and different legal disclosure requirements.' And Senator Sherry is quite right; Senator Conroy is wrong. There are significant differences in the policies and the products. It is like saying you should require the same disclosure statement for a standard passport bank account as should be provided for a managed investment.
I have made it quite clear that the government has always said we are happy to review this—we are always happy to see improvement. After the work and the effort that has gone into putting the FSRA into place—a history-making legislative achievement, which will massively improve consumer confidence in this country, and which I believe is one of the reasons why Australia has been able to withstand the corporate governance problems that have occurred on the other side of the Pacific—we have a regulatory regime that looks at all facets of the investment community and the FSRA puts in place a very effective regime at the cliff face. But we will allow it to be reviewed after reasonable time—and a reasonable time will be once we get to the end of the transition. We want to encourage people to transition; do not discourage them. Labor seeks to discourage people from transiting to the new regime, Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett, as you know better than most in this place.
We say we want people to transition smoothly and effectively. We want ASIC to license people effectively. We want to get it all done by 11 March 2004 and then set a review date to commence on 1 March 2005. This regulation will have a sunset clause that will take effect on 30 September that year. If, after the experience of the transition and one year's operation, we do develop a better model and a better regulation, it will have effect on 1 October. That is a very sensible and diligent process—not one in which we argue about 12 months, 18 months or two years and let's split the difference. It is a diligent, sensible and reasonable process. I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 4)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-09-16,"—I can agree with Senator Ian Campbell on one point that he made: the disallowance of the regulations that we are considering in this debate is of massive importance. It has massive implications in respect of the effective disclosure of financial products in this country. The particular aspect that I want to focus on is the disclosure of superannuation and the way in which fees and charges are laid out for the consumer when it comes to choosing a superannuation fund. This relates to the government's proposal to introduce so-called choice of superannuation. I will come to that in a short while.
The parliamentary secretary has claimed that the regulations in the bill that has already passed the chamber are a pre-eminent piece of legislation renowned in London, Europe, Washington and parts of Asia. I do not know how he can claim that when the regulations to put into effect the legislation have not yet passed the chamber. I do not know how the legislation can be renowned throughout the places he claims when the regulations have not yet been implemented. We do not yet know, although we have some serious concerns, how the regulations will impact in their disclosure of financial products to consumers. He cannot yet make that claim. I do not criticise the length of time and the dedication of the public servants and the thousands of hours that they have put into consultation in respect of the legislation and the regulations that we are considering. I do not question their bona fides and I do not criticise them for the work and effort they have put in, but the simple fact is that from the Labor opposition's point of view the outcome is less than satisfactory.
In respect of the superannuation areas that I have some responsibility for, let me explain why the outcome is less than satisfactory and why the outcome, as reflected in these regulations, if allowed to pass by the Senate, will significantly disadvantage some eight million superannuation consumers. We should not look at this legislation in isolation; we should look at it in the context of legislation that the government is proposing and is currently being examined by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. The regulations we are considering, if passed, will form a vital element in the way in which superannuation products and their fees and charges are disclosed to some eight million Australians. 
As most senators are aware, superannuation for employees in this country is compulsory. Some eight million Australians have superannuation contributions equivalent to nine per cent of their wages and salaries paid by their employers. Indeed, many employees contribute additional amounts to their superannuation. We know that approximately one-third of the self-employed are contributing to superannuation. Superannuation is interesting because it is a compulsory financial product. It is very different from other forms of insurance and from other financial products. It is compulsory. It also has significant tax concessions. The last time I looked, the general taxpayer was contributing between $9 billion and $10 billion in tax concessionality to superannuation. Compulsory superannuation is to underwrite and ensure a decent retirement income for Australians, particularly in the context of an ageing population, and it is a policy of which we are very proud and which was introduced by a Labor government.
The government has a proposal to implement what it calls the membership choice of a superannuation fund. I call it deregulation. At least the theory is that eight million Australians will be required individually to select a superannuation fund of which they intend to become members. This government argues that there are two essential preconditions for so-called choice of superannuation fund to be successful in this country: firstly, that you need effective disclosure; and, secondly, that you need an effective education campaign to educate the eight million Australian consumers who will be required to make a choice of superannuation fund.
Even if the disclosure were adequate— what we are considering is not adequate— whether or not the government's so-called choice regime or deregulation of superannuation goes ahead, I am sceptical that full and meaningful disclosure, which we do not have in these regulations, and the education of eight million Australians will suffice to ensure that we have informed choice of superannuation fund membership in this country. I am sceptical. On behalf of the Labor Party I have put forward some alternative policies which I believe are necessary to fundamentally protect the eight million Australians and the superannuation that they have. Those policies include a range of proposals such as the banning of entry and exit fees, the separate charging of what are called commissions and the charging of commissions against the superannuation contribution, and the capping of fees and charges in the superannuation area.
We argue that it is good public policy to consider these sorts of options in an area which is extraordinarily complex and where a financial product is compulsory and substantial tax concessions are involved. If you go out into the community and ask anyone in the street whether they understand superannuation—and I often do this—unfortunately a significant number of them will come back with the response, `Super is just too complex; I don't understand it.' So if we were to proceed with the government's so-called choice deregulation we would need to have what the Labor Party has put forward—a range of fundamental protections in respect of fees and charges—because we believe it is good public policy to protect against the erosion of superannuation retirement savings by excessive fees and charges.
At the very least you have to get your disclosure correct and you obviously have to get your education campaign correct. I am sceptical about any education campaign this government launches; I suspect it will be more of a propaganda campaign than an education campaign. I submit to the Senate: how do we successfully educate eight million Australians to the desired level of financial literacy, the level where they can make an informed choice? For a start, 15 per cent of Australians are functionally illiterate. How are we going to educate 15 per cent of the eight million Australians to make an informed choice when they cannot read, let alone understand, the sorts of product disclosure documents that we are going to see as a result of the legislation and regulations we are considering? 
I will hold up a copy of a typical key feature statement. This key feature statement has been released but superannuation disclosure will be in a similar format. What I know from the discussions I have had with industry is that eight million Australians will be required to read a document like this and understand it. The documents I have sighted have some 36 pages of extraordinarily comprehensive information in them as well as the disclosure of all the relevant fees and charges. So I do not doubt that everything will be disclosed, although the format of the disclosure, which is at the heart of the regulations in dispute here, is critical. I do not doubt that these documents will disclose everything but how many of the eight million Australians, when it comes to superannuation, will actually understand this document, understand the information provided and be able to make an informed choice? I challenge any senator to read this key feature statement or a document of this type—and the product disclosure document will be of a similar format—and comprehend it. This is what this government proposes to ask eight million Australians to do in relation to superannuation.
I will just deal with the disclosure of fees and charges in relation to the proposed regulations and the issues that eight million Australian consumers will have to understand, based on what the government is proposing in respect of superannuation. We do know that the product disclosure statement of the fund will disclose the ongoing management charge. That has been commonly known as an OMC for the last five years. The OMC would be expressed as a percentage of fund assets in addition to the total OMC. The OMC relating to the management of investments and the OMC not related to the management of expenses shall be disclosed in a similar manner. The total OMC shall also be expressed in dollars for a hypothetical account balance of $10,000. The OMC should be disclosed for each investment option. The OMC explicitly excludes— and this is really important when it comes to superannuation—contribution charges, death and disability insurance charges, exit charges and switching charges. The OMC should be accompanied by the following statement:
The level of costs incurred by an individual member will depend on individual circumstances as a percentage of value of the fund assets of the individual and may be more or less than the ongoing management charge. The ongoing management charge should not be taken to be representative of the actual fee and charges and expenses that will be borne by an individual.
So the OMC, as required in the regulations, does not give an adequate explanation to the Australian consumer when it comes to superannuation, because it excludes contribution charges, death and disability insurance charges, exit charges and switching charges. When it comes to superannuation, disclosure and the way in which those excluded fees and charges are illustrated, it is absolutely critical for consumers at the very least to be able to understand the impact of those charges that are excluded from the OMC by these regulations.
This is where the main criticism of these regulations and their impact lies. This is the main criticism that has been made by the Association of Superannuation Funds and the Australian Consumers Association. They are not unimportant bodies when it comes to the issue of how Australians may be required to choose a superannuation fund of which they want to become a member. One of the leading research institutions in this area is an organisation called Rainmaker. Rainmaker is certainly one of the pre-eminent researchers in the area of the general fees and charges relating to financial products, particularly in relation to superannuation. Its criticisms broadly relate to the fact that the regulations fail to provide an accurate representation of the total fees a fund member will actually face, because of the exclusion of contribution and exit charges.
At this point, let me present to the Senate some real life case studies of people who have complained to me about the impact of exit fees and insurance fees that apply to their superannuation. These are real life examples that deregulation in this legislation fails to deal with effectively. One case was brought to my attention on the John Laws show. It involved a Mrs Teague, who left her employer of many years. She was convinced to put her SG only superannuation, on which she had already paid fees and charges as it accumulated in her employer sponsored super fund, into a personal superannuation product offered by the same company. She was charged a five per cent entry fee, which amounted to $1,716. Mrs Teague did not understand the impact of the entry fee. The regulations we are considering do not provide for people like Mrs Teague to adequately understand the impact of an entry fee. I can tell you that there are plenty of entry and exit fees in superannuation products in this country. 
Let me give an example of another exit fee on a superannuation product. This came before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. It is the case of a holder of a superannuation plan who, after 12 years, had built up savings of $65,500. He attempted to transfer his money to another fund and was told that $11,500—let me emphasise that: $11,500—some 18 per cent, would be deducted as an exit fee. This was not explained to him, certainly not in a way he could understand it, when he joined the fund.
There is the case of another investor facing an exit penalty of $4,000 on an account balance of $33,000 if he rolled it out of the superannuation product. Another case which was drawn to my attention is perhaps the most disturbing. In that case a person who had $3,324 in superannuation savings faced an exit fee of $3,300. If he had rolled his money out he would have ended up owing the provider $24. Let me give you another real life case of an insurance premium and this involves a current superannuation product. In this case, an employee of an IT company received $1,600 in superannuation contributions, deducted from which was an insurance premium of $1,300 leaving a balance of $250—the difference was tax—when he attempted to roll it out of the fund.
I give those examples to the Senate because they involve entry and exit fees and insurance premiums which, while they will be required to be disclosed, will not be disclosed in a way in which the consumer will understand their impact. Certainly the consumers who brought these issues to my attention did not understand and they will not be protected in terms of the regulations we are considering. What amazes me about this legislation and particularly about the regulations when they apply to superannuation is that there has not been any consumer product testing. If we were going to try to identify the way in which consumers would or would not understand the impact of the regulations we are considering, surely when it comes to superannuation, which is the area I have responsibility for, there would have been some product testing to determine whether the consumer could understand the fees and charges being laid out as a consequence of these regulations. That product testing has not occurred. I challenge members of the Senate to take these documents back to their electorates and product test them. I suspect most of the response will indicate that, from their product testing, consumers will not understand the true impact of the total fees and charges that would flow as a consequence of this legislation.
Rainmaker research, to which I referred earlier, has suggested a total expenses ratio. It is possible for a fee calculator to group all the fees together for a given fund option that apply to contributions and to the account balance, and to show their immediate and long-term impacts not just in terms of a percentage but also in terms of flat dollar fees. It is quite possible to do that and the regulations do not provide for that.
I was shown a consumer survey about the level of financial literacy in this country. What really shocked me was that 50 per cent of consumers in Australia do not know what 50 per cent is. Half of Australian consumers do not know what a percentage is. If we are considering product disclosure and regulations, we really have to make—
—They have heard a lot about 60-40 though.
—We really have to make a better attempt, Senator Campbell, than the attempt made in these regulations, not just because of the financial products that will be covered by these regulations if passed but in terms of what may come in respect of superannuation disclosure if the government's choice of superannuation fund passes the Senate. 
For the reasons I have outlined and because of my concerns in the particular area for which I have responsibility—superannuation—I believe that these regulations should not be approved by the Senate. We should send the hardworking parliamentary secretary and the hardworking advisers back to the industry because the industry is not united on these regulations. Let us not give the Senate the impression that the industry agrees unanimously on this; it does not. There is a significant split among the industry. However, I am here to represent consumers and to get the best deal for them.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-09-16,"—I rise to speak on the disallowance motion moved by Senator Conroy. The Financial Services Reform Act 2001 was one of the more gutsy pieces of legislation produced by the Senate. I call it that because it was produced after the intense scrutiny and furore which surrounded the new tax system. Frankly, here was a government which had been burnt—and so had the Democrats, to some extent—by the downsides of some of the effects of the new tax system, BAS and so on, and it imposed a fairly costly and fairly rigorous disclosure regime on constituencies which mattered enormously to the coalition, to Labor and to us, so I describe it as `gutsy' deliberately. Proper recognition should be given to the role that the Labor Party, and particularly Senator Conroy, played in the process of developing, progressing and passing that legislation. Senator Conroy worked very hard, very diligently and very effectively to ensure that the legislation came through in a form that was as good, as practical and as effective as possible. When I hear Senator Conroy and Senator Ian Campbell, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, slagging each other off, I think that they do not give each other the credit that they should for the application that they have both shown in this area.
If we move on from that and take regard of what Senator Sherry has just said—and indeed Senator Campbell himself made the admission—we will also recognise that this is new legislation and that it has holes and flaws which will only be established and exposed over time; it is not perfect. In that regard, I think that Senator Conroy has done the Senate a great service by bringing this disallowance motion to the floor. What he has done is focus a light and some very specific and detailed attention on not only the issues at hand but the consequences of those issues not being addressed. A peculiar aspect of the debate from those two sides is a failure to recognise that in fact there is blazing agreement on a number of issues, and both Senator Campbell and Senator Conroy should take credit for that blazing agreement. Both sides agree that it is necessary to review the matters at hand and to resolve the issues over time. I am using the word `both' but I join myself to these things. Both sides agree that there need to be probably some changes and some new regulations resulting from the practical exposition of these matters. The only real issue at hand, frankly, is the question of timing: when it should occur. Both sides are quite happy to accept a sunset clause provision as a deadline mechanism to ensure that change comes through. If we step back a little from some of the aggression and some of the rhetoric and recognise how much agreement we have, we should be trying to search for a final step to resolve the issues in a manageable way. Parliamentary Secretary and Senator Conroy, I suggest that the first step in that approach would be to separate the motion before us into two parts and that items 1 and 2 be dealt with and voted on separately from item 3.
Starting with item 3, it seems to me that what Senator Conroy has done—and I must, for the record, acknowledge the input of Senator Murphy here as well—is say to Senator Campbell, `Look, here's a problem.' To his credit, Senator Campbell has accepted that there is a problem, and he is going to change the regulations accordingly. So Senator Campbell has said, `Yes, as early as practical,' given the formalities that he has to go through with the states and getting the thing drafted. With regard to regulations on the prescribed hours of calling when a financial institution offers to issue or sells a financial product on an unsolicited basis, Senator Campbell will improve the hours. He will ban such action on Sundays, and it is my understanding that he will ban it on public holidays such as Anzac Day. That is a terrific outcome. So I would simply say to both of you: well done. If that is the consequence, this entire debate has been well worth while. I can see no reason why item 3 should not be disposed of with a firm, public and sincere commitment from Senator Campbell on behalf of the government to introduce new regulations to have that effect. 
We then move to the issue of the PDS regulations. What is in agreement there is that there should be a sunset clause and there should be a review period. All right, so we are in blazing agreement on that. The only disagreement is on the date. The difficulty for you, Senator Campbell, is that you actually make a very good case but your case is a little undercut by what I understand to be happening—namely, the transitional period is being disregarded by industry. In other words, industry regards the regulations and the law as applying right now. That means that it is not necessary to wait until 11 March 2004, when the transitional period notionally ends, before you commence a review. In fact, you could commence a review probably within six months of 11 March 2002, because I think things will be in train. That means to me that probably you could bring forward your review. You wanted to commence your review on 11 March 2005. I do not think that that is necessary. I would think that you could bring forward the date from which you would apply a sunset clause. That is all we are discussing now.
Senator Conroy has delivered a mechanism, and the government has recognised the need—and I personally am very appreciative of it—for a review and for a sunset clause, so we need to resolve the date. I would urge the two of you to find a way during the dinner break to resolve that. If I understood Senator Conroy correctly, he would prefer that the whole process ended in 2004. To me, that goes all the way up to 31 December 2004, so there is a fair bit of latitude there. As I understood Senator Campbell, he was not overly hung up on the particular time as long as industry had enough time to establish the practical operation of these matters. I think that what you have to do between you, since you have agreed on a review and a sunset clause, is work out the final time. To me, that is affected most of all by when businesses are enacting the regulations. As I understand it, they are doing it right now; therefore, the thing is in operation.

 (Quorum formed)",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 4)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-09-16,"—In addressing the disallowance motion moved by Senator Conroy, I have had some discussion with the minister and I think the changes the government has made through the financial services reform legislation have been very good. They are changes that, in many instances, were long overdue. Like Senator Murray, I have no qualms in congratulating the government on that. But what we are dealing with here is a set of regulations that are necessary in some form—there is no question about that. Having some regulations is better than having no regulations. But if there are problems with the regulations, which there clearly are, then there should not be any reticence on the part of the government to step up to the mark and set down a process through which they can be reviewed and, if it is demonstrated that there is a need for change, then those changes can be made. 
I think it is an insufficient argument on the part of the government to say, `We have a set of regulations. There is an implementation phase and that phase will be concluded by March 2004. We then want a period of time for the industry to settle into the regulations that they will find themselves operating under before we have any review and proceed to implement any change.' The fundamental basis upon which that argument is based is the costs the industry might incur and/or the fact that if the industry has a feeling of uncertainty—which it should not have—it will not proceed to operate and put new products into the marketplace. I think that argument is flawed in the sense that the government would say, `We will never make any change regardless of whether the regulations we have in place are satisfactory or whether they provide for the sort of disclosure that consumers require.' I do not think the industry thinks like that. At some point in time, if there is a change that is needed then I suspect that change could be implemented so as to minimise the cost to the industry per se.  
I listened to Senator Sherry give some examples with respect to superannuation products. Some years ago I had a very similar personal experience with regard to entry and exit fees of a superannuation scheme, so I do understand fully what he was talking about, and it is a problem. I also raised with the parliamentary secretary, and officers from his office and the department, some of the problems that I see with the scope of coverage of these regulations. And I thank them for the briefing that they provided to me at very short notice. It was very helpful and useful. 
But, insofar as dealing with this particular issue, I do not think I can accept the argument that is being put up by the government at this point in time as to why we cannot have a sunset clause that would allow for a review to be conducted in a reasonably short period of time after the conclusion of the implementation phase—that is, the review could even begin prior to the end of the implementation phase. It could certainly begin in, say, April 2004 and be concluded by September or October 2004. The parliamentary secretary has said, `Our position is that we will have a review conducted during the course of 2005 and, if there are to be any changes, they will be made some time after March 2006.' I think that is correct, if I understand your position as put earlier. I know I should not be asking questions of the parliamentary secretary.
—The latest is 30 September 2005.
—But that is for the conclusion of the review.
—No, that is for the sunset clause—30 September 2005.
—It does not matter anyway. The fact remains that it does not matter when you put it in—if change is required, it will affect the industry. If you take the parliamentary secretary's argument, there will be a cost. I would have thought that when you are talking about change, as is the case with any financial services reform, somebody has to bear a cost. But I think you could actually introduce the change such that you would minimise that cost and not impact significantly on products which already exist in the market. I think that can be done. I am sure the government would be able to come up with some proposals to do that.
I acknowledge that, with regard to the hours that relate to people being able to hawk things, the parliamentary secretary has given a commitment in respect of Sundays and some public holidays and has committed to a very short review to look at an industry standard for hours. With regard to public holidays, I would have thought it would have been pretty easy, frankly, to designate public holidays per se. I know that states and territories have different days for various other things, but if the Commonwealth legislation was to talk about `designated public holidays relevant to the state or territory' then I would have thought that would cover it. I do not think you would have to specify the particular days. I might be wrong on that, but I would have thought you would not have to do it. That therefore adds greater clarity in terms of dealing with the hours that are allowed for the purposes of selling.
The parliamentary secretary raised this new cost of a licensing regime. Of course there is going to be cost with a licensing regime—and why shouldn't there be? I have limited experience, but I have participated in a couple of inquiries. In one of the most recent ones, which related to managed investment schemes that are mass marketed, there were huge problems. It is a very good move to require licensing—as I said, it is long overdue—and the government is to be congratulated for it. If there is a cost, so what? There is often a cost associated with a whole range of changes at law, and I do not see any problem with the fact that people will have to bear some cost in that respect, because at the end of the day this is all about delivering a better outcome for consumers. With regard to the costs, those people who actually meet the standard and pay the costs really have a marketable tool in their hands. I suppose the process is not just about protecting consumers but also about providing competency within the industry. You can look at any area of accreditation and see that there is a cost associated with it, no matter what business you are in. If you go through an accredited course then you will have some cost associated with it. 
Yes, the new law does say certain things, but it is not necessarily always the case that the law cannot be gotten around. The laws before the Financial Services Reform Act came into being also said certain things, but there were many occasions when those laws were flouted and gotten around through loopholes et cetera. So I do not have a problem with suggesting that we ought to have an ongoing process of review, and I do not think the government does either. I just cannot quite see why the government has a hard and fast position with regard to when a review ought to be conducted and concluded and when you might move to suggest changes be made, if changes are seen to be necessary. I cannot see the soundness in that argument, particularly on the basis that there might be some cost to the industry that already has products in the market, because products will come into the market year in, year out. If you are going to make a unilateral change, of course there will be a cost to somebody, but I suspect that the department and the relevant officers could work out a program of change, as they have here, with a phase-in period, an implementation phase, that would have a minimal impact on the industry.
But what we should be about is ensuring that the consumers have the best protection and the best information available to them so that they are able to make the decisions they need to make. I listened with interest to what Senator Sherry was saying with regard to the documentation. I agree with him. You only have to pick up any prospectus from a prospectus based company endeavouring to mass-market an investment proposal. You would have to be Einstein to understand some of the things that they put in them. Indeed, even to read through one and find the relevant information that is supposed to be in there in accordance with the previous laws is very difficult. So I have no doubt that there will be people who will look at what is proposed under the new legislation and in the regulations for ways and means of getting around that.
I fully support any effort to bring greater clarity to these issues, because I think that is something that the parliament should do. It is our obligation to ensure that the people that are seeking to invest have the best means available to them to make their decisions and have the best protection available to them. So I would urge the parliamentary secretary to seriously consider, on behalf of the government, what is being put on the table here. This is not opposition to regulations. This is just an argument about a process of review and when you would then proceed to enact that review if changes were to be recommended out of a review of the process. I think that makes total commonsense. I do not accept the arguments that you are putting in respect of the industry and the costs that they might have to bear, because I think they can also be dealt with through a means of implementation. I would urge Senator Campbell to seriously consider that, because we can actually get these regulations implemented. It is important that we have some regulation. If we end up with no regulation there will be sectors of the industry that will seek to exploit that. There is no question about that, and that would be bad for consumers. If only there were a really strong soundly based argument as to why you would not proceed to have a review in the format that has been discussed privately and an implementation program in the form that has been discussed privately. I really do question just how seriously the government wants to push this issue.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 4)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-09-16,"—I thank Senator Murphy for that contribution to the debate on my disallowance motion. I think he made a number of very valid points, particularly his last one. Unfortunately I do not share your faith in the government's or the industry's bona fides on this, Senator Murphy. I hope to be proved wrong; I hope that we can still reach an agreement with the government on this.
I think it is important to go through some more of the issues on this. Recently IFSA commissioned some work on the level of fees and charges, particularly those for managed investments in this country. At the time they also said they were going to commission an international comparison, because they wanted to show that, following the introduction of the Managed Investments Act, there had been a fall in fees and charges both here and, comparatively, across the world. When they tendered their evidence to the Senate inquiry in this area, in actual fact they supplied the Australian data, which showed a small fall following the introduction of the Managed Investments Act—and Senator Ian Campbell played an important part in introducing that act. One of the reasons why we all supported MIA was that that had been held out to us. 
Interestingly, despite promising to deliver an international comparison, it may come as a surprise to you that IFSA did not supply any information. When IFSA were questioned about this, they said, `Look, it's very hard to organise this and to compare apples with apples. It's a tricky area. It's very complex and very complicated.' They could do it for Australian products, funnily enough, but when trying to look at products issued in the US and products issued here in Australia they suddenly lost all their expertise. That is interesting because they did not have to go too far to get some evidence and some expertise on the US figures, because the SEC, the premier regulator in the United States, had recently done some work on the level of fees for managed investments in the US. Despite the efforts to pretend that you could not compare the US figures with the Australian figures, in actual fact you could: they were very comparable figures. In actual fact what IFSA's Australian figures and the United States regulator's figures and calculations showed was that for virtually identical products with the same features—the same apples with apples, the same pears with pears, the same oranges with oranges—Australians were paying twice the level of fees compared to US consumers. You have to ask yourself: why is that? Why is it that Australians have to pay twice as much as an American consumer for a managed investment? Why does an American consumer pay half? That is the valid question. You have to say that at the end of the day it is because we do not have enough information for Australian consumers.
The bill is well intentioned, and Senator Murray and you have argued that this was designed to protect consumers. I never lose sight of the fact that this bill was initiated with the purpose of being beneficial to consumers. We are seeing here an attempt by the industry to run away from disclosing to Australian investors the true level of fees they are being charged. That is what this debate is about. Senator Sherry spoke for 20 minutes and outlined case after case under the OMC regime, which is what we have now—the so-called international best practice championed by those on the other side of the chamber. These atrocities, these outrages, these rip-offs are taking place under the regime that Senator Campbell wants to put into legislation. They are happening now. This legislation will not change that. Senator Campbell wants to see some cover for IFSA, the fund managers and the people who own them now—the banks—and we are seeing here an attempt to give some protection, via a dodgy OMC, to the big end of town to protect it against those battling consumers. When those consumers that Senator Sherry is talking about try to seek redress in a court— if we agree to this regulation today—the big institutions will be able to stand up in court and say, `But we haven't done anything wrong.' The act in the opening statements says:
The main object of this Chapter—
that is, chapter 7—
is to promote:
(a) confident and informed decision making by consumers of financial products and services while facilitating efficiency, flexibility and innovation in the provision of those products and services; and
(b) fairness, honesty and professionalism by those who provide financial services; and
(c) fair, orderly and transparent markets ...
The OMC meets none of these. The OMC is something put in place to protect financial institutions against consumers. They will be able to stand up in court, wave it and say, `The government said that we could do this.' That is what is at stake here. What is at stake is whether or not consumers are going to continue to be ripped off, overcharged and misled about the fees they are charged by this government's complicity. That is why the Labor Party is fighting so hard on this. That is why the Australian Consumers Association is saying, `This is not good enough.' That is why ASFA have said, `We have actually gone and tested this. This is something the Treasury did not do, something the government did not do. We have actually tested this and it is a disaster. People are confused, they are worse off and we would rather see the status quo continue than put this in place.' 
I go back to the offer that was made by Senator Campbell in his letter to me when he said that he was happy to progress the suggestion of a sunset clause and had asked the CEOs of ASFA and IFSA to suggest a reasonable timetable for testing of the existing provisions and formulating any improved position. He said:
I believe that a sunset date of no earlier than 11 March 2004 would be reasonable but I will be guided by key stakeholders including investors and shareholders.
So he has gone away and he has consulted and, as Senator Sherry has made the point and Senator Murray and Senator Murphy acknowledge, there was a division. ASFA would have preferred six months to 12 months and they have written to everybody outlining their position: having an implementation phase and outlining the way to handle the transition and the costs that Senator Murphy has talked about. There is a way to handle all of that. But Senator Campbell has fallen into line with the other industry body. He is saying that he wants to give life to the IFSA position; namely, those with the single strongest vested interest, owned by banks now, who want to continue to mislead their customers about how much they are being charged.
At the end of the day is it so much to ask, from one of the richest industries in the world, that they tell the truth to their customers about what they are being charged? Is it so much to ask? Is it so much to ask why Australians are paying twice what Americans pay for virtually identical products? It is not so much to ask, but this is an industry that is going to resist this every single step of the way. It is the same as accountants resisting change to their auditing practices. As Senator Murray and Senator Bartlett would know, it is the same as this government and this very same parliamentary secretary, who resisted disclosure of executive remuneration—they wanted another review, another postponement of the inevitable. Four years down the track they are clutching to their bosom the fact that those changes were made to the Corporations Law, changes that were moved by the Labor Party and the Democrats. Now they want to claim them as their own.
—It was Senator Chapman actually.
—Senator Campbell, I can actually give you the page of Hansard where Senator Cook, on behalf of the Labor Party, moved the changes and they were supported by Senator Murray. I do not know what you think I am talking about, but when it comes to executive remuneration you were on the Hansard record opposing it and then accepting it as inevitable because the numbers in the chamber were going to make that disclosure and transparency happen. Four years down the track after resisting disclosure and transparency, this government now wraps itself in the very amendments that it rejected and resisted. Down the track that will be the same again, because you cannot beat transparency and disclosure. It is what makes a market function, Senator Campbell. It is the basis of the capitalist society and, as Maurice Newman, Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange—and someone who is known to you and me—often says, `Sunlight is the best disinfectant.' I say, `Hear, hear,' to Maurice Newman. What we want to see in this industry is a bit more sunlight for consumers. We want them to stop losing thousands and thousands of dollars they do not know they are losing. We want them to know that their final benefits at the beginning of their retirement have not been significantly reduced.
To allow the richest industry in this country to continue to deceive and mislead their customers should not be allowed by this Senate. There are some I know who have been frightened by the statements by the industry and frightened by some of Senator Campbell's commentary that if you knock this regulation out things will be worse. All of the atrocities, all of the rip-offs that are taking place now are taking place under this regime. The OMC is something Senator Campbell continues to say—and I am still scratching my head about this—was introduced by the Labor Party. I am fascinated by how the Labor Party has introduced this. It is in no piece of regulation and we do not control both chambers, so I do not know how the Labor Party introduced the OMC at any stage—eight years, I think you said, that it has been around. It has been industry best practice for eight years, and all of the consumers who have been ripped off have been ripped off under this industry best practice for the last eight years. 
Do not fall for the scare campaign that there is going to somehow be nothing more. You will be sanctioning big companies to be able to go into court, hold up the Corporations Law and the regulations and say, `But the government said we could mislead these consumers. The government said that, as long as we put the OMC in place, it was okay.' The fact is consumers cannot understand it—and I invite Senator Harradine, Senator Harris and Senator Bartlett to have a look at the OMC and try to understand it. The OMC misleads consumers about what they are paying. It is dangerous and more costly than it should be if we do not make this government and this industry come to the table and do something right by their customers.
Do not be fooled by a scare campaign. All the rip-offs that have taken place are happening now under this very regime, and they just want to give the government a bit of practice. How on earth can the OMC pass a fairness and honesty test; a fairness, orderliness and transparency test. The OMC will protect the business community and the financial service providers, and this government wants us to vote to let them do it. I say let us not. Let us try to find a compromise, Senator Campbell. The Labor Party is still willing to work with you on a compromise on this. We do not trust industry self-regulation on this one, I am afraid. The industry are the ones that are resisting this. We believe we need strong regulation. All we are doing is mandating disclosure. We are not mandating any other behaviour. We are trying to mandate disclosure. What is at stake today is whether or not we can get disclosure.
—You are trying to knock it out; you are not trying to fix it. Where is your replacement?
—Unfortunately, Senator Campbell, as you well know, the agreement with this bill was for the legislation to come first and the regulations to come six months later. The trick with regulations is of course that we do not have the capacity to amend on the floor. We can only reject or accept. A government acting in good faith would have sat down with us when it first received my February letter, not wait until a few weeks ago to seriously engage. It is very hard to take you in good faith when you will not talk to us. 
—Where is your alternative?
—We do not seek to impose an alternative, unlike you, Senator Campbell.
—That is right, Senator McGauran. We are not seeking to say that we know better than the collective interests of all the industry and consumer groups. We are not actually doing what Treasury has done—put something down and say, `That is it; that is the final outcome.' We are actually saying let us work together to improve what is there. I am not being critical of Treasury. There was an impossibly tight deadline imposed for the implementation phase and Treasury worked as hard as it could to get a regulation in place so it was ready by the implementation date. That is the truth of what happened here. We should not suddenly say that the OMC is some sort of sacred tablet. What happened here was that the Treasury got jammed. It had a start-up date of 11 March. There was an election. It desperately needed to put something down. It was not trying to pretend it was the world's best piece of disclosure—it was a starting point. It was a challenge to the parliament to say, `Here is the best we can do in a very short time.' 
—You are having delusions.
—Tragically, Senator Campbell, I know your involvement because you were banished by the Prime Minister once before. I know you go to bed each night thinking only 284 days to go until the Prime Minister's 64th birthday, thank God. I know you go to sleep each night saying that. Minister Hockey put the time line down—I am not blaming you for the time line. I am not blaming you for the fact that it was a very rushed situation. But it is because it was rushed that the obligation is on the parliament to try to rectify any deficiencies—and deficiencies have been identified. 
—Five years is not a rush.
—Five years is certainly not a rush, and that is what you are trying to do. You are trying to make sure customers are ripped off for another five years. You are trying to ensure that customers are not able to find out the truth about how much they are paying for another four to five years. I repeat to you, Senator Campbell, the Labor Party is prepared to work with you. We do not believe that what you have offered so far in terms of the hours goes far enough, and I know Senator Harris shares some of my concerns. I share Senator Murphy's concerns that we know it is possible for you to just designate the public holidays as well. Senator Harris would like to see the hours narrowed, and I am very sympathetic to Senator Harris's position. We are prepared to withdraw part 3 on the understandings and commitments you have given on the floor of the chamber.
We are also prepared to accept your proposition, which you were going away to investigate, of a review beginning on 11 March 2004 for six months. Many products will be out by then—you know that to be the case. Many products will be rolled out. Are you suggesting there will be no new products for the next two years? We are prepared to accept that.
—I did not offer that. You know that.
—You wrote to me. You said that you believed that a sunset date no earlier than 11 March would be reasonable. I am offering you a sunset after that. I am saying that the review starts in March 2004 with the sunset a little bit further down the track, and I am offering six months— even nine months if you want to drag it out until the end of the year. But the sunset clause needs to come in to help drive the change. We are prepared to offer that: a sunset clause on 31 December 2004. Labor is prepared to do that against its will, can I say. We do not believe that this is an optimal outcome for consumers but, as a gesture to try and resolve this issue tonight to the satisfaction of everybody, we are prepared to offer that.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-09-16,"—I seek leave to incorporate Senator Watson's speech in relation to the financial services reform disallowance motion.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
FSR Regulations .... don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.
An issue that is doing the rounds of the Senate corridors concerns the disallowance of the FSR regulations. This issue is a vital one for Australian consumers of superannuation products—do we throw out these regulations, which represent some of the fruits of the 5 years' labour we put in on FSR/CLERP 6, or do we give the regime a fair go and see how well it works over the coming years?
FSRA was a bold initiative, intended to result in a financial services regulatory regime which could adapt, seamlessly and quickly, to a fast changing financial services environment. In replacing all the clunky old regulatory `silos' that grew up, uncoordinated, around the product and institutional boundaries of old, FSRA represents a significant step forward and is the result of much productive compromise—a willingness on the part of many to give up long held positions and comfortable practices.
As always, though, there is a fly in the ointment—someone who says, after the event, `... I don't like it—its not fair—I wanted something different but forgot to tell anyone about it at the time...' etc 
Well, it's not good enough—we must have these regulations because they are the `icing on the superannuation disclosure cake', the last piece of the FSR jigsaw, designed to maximise the degree of comparability facilitated by FSR, subject to the dictates of what is commercially and practically reasonable in a market economy where consumers exercise sovereignty.
The range and choice of superannuation products and services available to consumers in this country, today, is second to none.
This diversity of choice reflects the character of Australian society today
—a society which is diverse in terms of age, individual employment patterns and preferences, cultural background and family circumstances
—a society which can only be properly served by by-product offerings catering to this diversity
—needing a disclosure regime for financial products which drives the provision of quality information to consumers, to enable them to evaluate, to compare and to choose
—but does not discourage innovation in communication by prescribing a `one size fits all' methodology for such disclosure.
The present FSR Regulations recognise the special nature of superannuation, providing minimum disclosure obligations and a sound basis for product comparability. This is particularly so in relation to disclosure of fees and charges, which must be described in full in the PDS. In addition, the requirements with regard to commission disclosure in the Statement of Advice (SoA) and ongoing reporting requirements for superannuation leave no room for consumers to be left in the dark.
What is wrong with these regulations? Who opposes them? Very little is wrong with them and, as far as I'm aware, there is no support for disallowance from any sector of the super industry—I challenge honourable Senators to cite the support he has for this move.
What criticism there is seems to be directed mainly at the OMC itself.
Such criticism is, in my view, totally misconceived. The FSRA OMC is, as it should be in today's fast globalising world, closely aligned with international best practice for the disclosure of ongoing charges for members of superannuation schemes—including as it does, all those costs which can reasonably and practically be included in such a calculation. In particular, super contributors will, under this regime, have access to the same OMC information with respect to ALL funds, not just those that choose to reveal their investment management costs.
Any OMC which fails to mandate disclosure of underlying investment management charges, however, would certainly be a fraud in terms of providing consumer with the information they need.
The OMC has been criticized on the basis that it is expressed as a percentage based formula. Such criticism overlooks the fact that it must, initially, always be expressed in such terms. Investment management fees are universally levied on a percentage basis, so that must always be the starting point for disclosing underlying investment management charges.
In prescribing that OMC's be illustrated by reference to an account balance of $10,000, the FSR Regulations require that all funds provide examples that can be easily compared by consumers.
This particular innovation is in the regulations at the specific request of Senator Conroy—one of his better ideas, recognised as such by the Government and enshrined in the regime.
In short, therefore, the FSR OMC represents a significant advance on the former SIS version, which did not require disclosure of all underlying investment management costs. The $10,000 example, provided for comparative purposes, improves the old model still further.
Entry Fees
The OMC does not, and cannot, include entry fees for the simple reason that such fees are not `ongoing' fees that are charged to a fund. Entry fees are not levied on funds or individual account balances but, rather, on individual contributions or withdrawals. In addition, entry fees are not always known in advance, for they are often rebated by intermediaries to their clients.
The fact that such fees are not included with ongoing charges in a single number does not imply that they can be hidden from consumers. FSRA (Regulation 7.9.11, Schedule 10B) specifically requires disclosure of entry and exit fees in a superannuation PDS, in the following words;
“For any contribution charge, direct account charge, investment management charge, exit charge or switching, charge of the fund, a description of:
(a)	the charge; and
(b)	the amount of the charge
(i)	expressed as a fixed amount; or
(ii)	if it is not practicable to express a fixed amount, expressed as a percentage of: 
(A)	the contributions made in respect of a member; or
(B)	the product holder's benefit in the fund; or
(C)	the assets of the fund; and
against what, or to whom, the amount or percentage will be charged.”
For those who maintain that the super disclosure regulations do not provide adequately for the disclosure of entry fees, I hope you were reading my lips—this is pretty unequivocal stuff, leaving no doubt as to the fact that issuers must disclose these charges in the most effective manner that is practicable for any given super product.
For those who complain that the regulations do not provide a standard format for all super disclosure, I suggest to you that it is neither reasonable nor practical to impose a single format in a market that offers such a wide range of products, services and distribution methods.
This may have been possible once upon a time, when virtually all superannuation was provided on the basis of simple, one or two investment strategy funds, all structured in the same way and all operating on the basis of monopoly style access to captive contributors.
In a world of `standard' product, it might have been appropriate to mandate `standard presentation of information', but the Australian market for superannuation products has long since outgrown susceptibility to such `one size fits all' solutions.
The Government has, rightly, stuck by its guns on the issue of these regulations—to do otherwise would be to betray those product issuers who have, in good faith, embraced FSR and issued PDSs—not to mention those whose plans to do so will be thrown into chaos if these regulations are defeated.
I strongly recommend that the Senate vote in support of the FSR disclosure regulations when that vote is taken.
 (Senator McLucas)—Senator Conroy, I believe you wish to amend your motion.
Senator CONROY (Victoria) (8.07 p.m.)—by leave—I move:
That the motion be amended to omit paragraph (3).
Question agreed to. 
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Conroy's), as amended, be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 4)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-09-16,"—as amended, by leave—I move the motion as amended:
That Regulation 9A.20—Wildlife trade operations and management plans, in item [2] of Schedule 1 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Regulations 2001 (No. 3), as contained in Statutory Rules 2001 No. 327 and made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Wildlife Protection) Act 2001, be disallowed.
The disallowance motion has been on the Notice Paper for a full 15 sitting days of the Senate, and indeed the regulations themselves were originally gazetted back in December last year and have been in operation since 11 January this year. They have been in place and in operation for a long period of time—about eight months. The Democrats signalled their concerns with a range of aspects of the regulations to the government back in the first half of the year and had this as a protective disallowance for the full 15 sitting days, seeking to get some form of recognition from the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, about the various concerns we had with the regulations. Similarly, we sought to engender support from the opposition in relation to our concerns.
A very detailed range of concerns were put forward by a number of environment groups with a special interest in the trade in Australia's native wildlife. The legislation that these regulations attach to, particularly the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Wildlife Protection) Act that was passed last year, was a significant advance in providing mechanisms for the better protection of Australia's native wildlife with regard to trade. It is a great disappointment to the Democrats that the regulations that have been put forward consequential to that act being passed are so deficient. They do not, in a sense, weaken or negate what is in the act but it really is a missed opportunity to enable the provisions that are in the act to be enforced effectively in a number of cases.
I have amended the disallowance motion so it applies only to one regulation rather than to the entire package of regulations as tabled. This certainly does not represent the full scope of the concerns that the Democrats have regarding these regulations but it does represent our judgment of what can be disallowed without causing harm to the native species that the act and these regulations are supposed to protect. It is a bit similar to the debate that we have just had—a new act is passed, regulations that will provide strong mechanisms for enforcing that act are promised down the track but those commitments are not met. If we disallow the whole lot we are left with nothing. The regulations are a fresh bunch of regulations; they are not replacing or weakening existing ones. The dilemma there is that if you negate the whole package of regulations you are left with no regulations at all. That does not negate the fact that the regulations taken as a whole are not adequate, but being left with no regulations at all would also not be adequate. I have amended the motion to specifically target one area. The Democrats believe that we would be better off with no regulation than with those that are in place in that area. I will get to the detail of that shortly.
The regulations as a whole do not live up to the commitments made by the then environment minister, Senator Hill, before the last election when the original wildlife act was introduced and passed through this place. Senators may recall that again, in another less than ideal legislative process of the government, the government brought on the bill and then required it to be debated very quickly. The Democrats were successful in getting a very large number of amendments through this chamber but when the legislation went down to the House of Representatives a number of those were knocked back by the government even though the government accepted them originally in the Senate, and we had to make do with a less perfect act than we would have had if all the Democrat amendments had been accepted. Nonetheless, there were still some significant amendments left in that did provide an enhanced state for the protection of wildlife under the new EPBC Act. 
The regulations nonetheless do not live up to the standard of impact assessment that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act requires of all other activities. In fact, because of these regulations wildlife trade can be assessed through a permitting process which will be neither as rigorous or accountable as an assessment process—it will be less transparent and less rigorous. The government can rely on codes of practice to set out the standards for wildlife practices, while at the same time those codes of practice are often neither mandatory nor enforceable. There is no public process or consultation in developing codes of practice but they are at the heart of many of the trade provisions, most notably in relation to those applying to the killing of kangaroos.
The regulations do not live up to the standards of accountability that currently operate in the rest of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The register of applications and decisions does not include basic information, such as the source and origin of the relevant native specimens. It provides far fewer opportunities for public input and comment. The processes for approved commercial import programs under the regulations are not as open and accountable as they are under the EPBC Act more broadly. The same is true for captive breeding programs and conservation programs under the regulations.
Part of the reason for the amendments that were made last year to bring the wildlife act under the ambit of the EPBC was so that a single standardised system of assessment and accountability would apply. That is beneficial not just for environment protection but for those businesses or citizens who engage in, in whatever way, any obligations under that act to have a standard set of assessment and accountability processes. As a result of these regulations, however, that will not be the case. There will be a separate and weaker set of standards for many aspects of wildlife trade.
Finally, these regulations do not live up to any best practice standards for humane treatment of native animals. We have an unfortunate situation where native animals and those animals used in trade are, once again, being assessed as a commodity rather than as sentient species. The welfare provisions set out in these regulations are vague, cursory and very difficult to enforce. They do not provide the degree of detail and certainty that must accompany welfare provisions if they are to be enforceable. The regulations do not ensure that the minister receives the best advice from the best experts. A Democrat proposal to create an animal welfare advisory committee put to the Senate when the act was originally put forward was eventually rejected by the government.
I will provide some examples. One of the provisions relating to persons receiving native animals is that they be suitably equipped to manage, confine and care for the animal, including meeting the behavioural and biological needs of the animal. It does not specify what the word `equipped' means— whether it applies to the actual conduct of the persons receiving the animal or whether it applies to the capacity to care for the animal. It does not require the person to be adequately trained and experienced in their activity and it only addresses the capacity of the receiving person. It should also address the actual activities that the receiving person engages in.
Similarly, there is a requirement that animals be prepared and transported in a way that is known to result in minimal stress on the animal. This is an area where there is often a lack of scientific knowledge and, if nothing or little is known of what the animal's response to stress is, what standard is there to enforce in such circumstances? Let us not forget that in many of these cases, obviously, there are circumstances where there is recognised substantial trade in native wildlife—and the kangaroo, again, is a key example. But there are also one-off provisions with animals or species for specific purposes that can be granted under the provisions of the act with far less knowledge or, quite possibly, with no codes of practice at all in relation to that particular species.
The provisions relating to research are extremely poor, especially considering the history of some research institutions with totally unnecessary experimentation that causes pain and suffering to thousands of animals. Section 9A.09 of the regulations only requires that research be conducted by a person or institution that has sufficient resources and qualifications. There is no requirement that they are actually suitably equipped or that they have a code of practice relating to animal welfare, or that the researcher has an appropriate history or that the ethics committee of the institution does more than rubber-stamp applications. Even a general provision that said research should not be cruel unnecessarily would be an improvement. 
Some of the regulations contained overall here are positive and the Democrats are supportive of some of those provisions; we do not want to give the impression that it is completely negative. The provisions relating to captive breeding programs under 9A.16 and 9A.17—artificial propagation programs and provisions relating to citations—are positive. But in a general sense they do not live up to promise of the act and the promises made by Senator Hill, as minister when the act was tabled and passed through this place. In general, they do not live up to the act itself, which is one of the strongest wildlife trade acts in the world. The government would deserve credit for that if they were not undermining it with these inadequate regulations. For instance, in Senator Hill's statement in May of last year he said a high priority was to be given to animal welfare considerations. Dr Sharman Stone added:
The bill increases the emphasis on welfare issues by providing the government with the capacity, through regulations, to ensure proposals for the sustainable use of wildlife observe strict welfare requirements.
The act may have provided that capacity through regulations but these regulations do not deliver it; they do not provide strict welfare requirements. They create what the Democrats believe is a weak, vague and unenforceable regulatory structure.
Senator Hill said that a transparent and user-friendly system was to be established, but many of the transparency provisions that are in the EPBC Act more generally do not apply to this part of the EPBC because of these flawed regulations. The government also said that they would ensure that any use of our native species is ecologically sustainable. However, there is no provision for an impact assessment of any proposed native species trade. Even with existing trade there is a reliance on codes of practice that are neither mandatory nor necessarily as rigorous or as thorough as they should be.
I will give an example in one of the best known areas of wildlife trade—the kangaroo slaughter industry. The recent RSPCA report on kangaroo hunting came out a week or two ago. It pointed to a major failing of the kangaroo-killing code of practice, which stated that there was a substantial slaughter of kangaroos occurring for non-commercial purposes and frequently in the most inhumane fashion imaginable. How can the government guarantee that the kangaroo industry is sustainable when totally unregulated practices that would affect any sustainability assessment is going on all around them? Let us not forget that the numbers of kangaroos that are being slaughtered, even under the legal quota, is enormous and yet this RSPCA report found a huge amount of killing in very cruel fashion occurring outside the commercial regulatory framework. In 2001 the government said:
Inclusion in the EPBC Act framework means the wildlife trade provisions are more effectively integrated with formal environmental impact assessment processes ... reflecting best environmental practice, incorporate strict timeframes to ensure efficient consideration by Government.
Again, come the regulation, that turns out not to be the case. In fact, permits can be assessed without the triggering and public input mechanisms that characterise the rest of the EPBC.
All these comments relate to provisions that we are not seeking to disallow, for the reasons that I outlined earlier—as I said, to do so would be likely to harm the native wildlife more than the government. The one section that I am moving to disallow is section 9A.20 relating to wildlife trade operations and management plans. This section sets out the criteria for ascertaining whether a practice is a wildlife trade operation. If it is not a wildlife trade operation it cannot be approved under the act as such. It sets out provisions for wildlife trade operations that are being market tested—not a full-blown commercial enterprise but an attempt to measure the viability of the market. That may be fair enough to some extent, but good commercial practice could be that if you are going to allow trade in wildlife you want to test the viability first rather than open up a potentially damaging trade that may not even be viable. 
However, the provisions in the regulations do not set any limits on such market testing. There are no limits on how long a market test can proceed, no limit on the number of times you can market test the same species in the same market, no limit on the number of times you can renew such an operation, and no requirement to ascertain the impacts that commercialising that particular trade might have in terms of the sustainability or conservation status of the animal. The standard is that it is reasonably likely that the market could be supplied without affecting the conservation status of the taxon. `Reasonably likely' is not an adequate criterion; it falls way short of the precautionary principle which this government has said is part of the act. It is part of the objects of the act, yet the regulation sets a limit of only needing to be assured that it is reasonably likely that the conservation status of the species would not be affected.
Market testing operations should have specific time frames in which to assess a market, and once the test is completed proponents should either apply for a commercial operation or let the idea lapse. They should be prevented from trying to resurrect the tests through other names or modified terms, because the concern—it is a reality that we have seen occur already with aquaculture ventures, for instance—is that the test becomes a de facto commercial operation without proper assessments. We have seen similar problems elsewhere in the relevant regulation we are seeking to disallow, relating to developmental operations. It outlines the nature of small operations for the purposes of wildlife trade and sets out criteria that cannot be justified for defining a small-scale operation. The section sets out the circumstances that will constitute small-scale operations: the harvest area is small, the number of participants is small or the number of specimens is small. As worded, the section appears not to recognise the possibility that a species may be in a limited range in limited numbers in a limited ecosystem.
We also have a situation where the regulations allow a small-scale operation to be declared a wildlife trade operation on the basis of criteria that are insufficient under the act for approval of that operation. These regulations allow a low-impact standard, whereas the act sets out a more stringent standard of `not detrimental'—again, a pretty clear distinction. In other words, a trader could have a trade operation recognised under the regulations whilst the standards under the act would prevent approval of that operation. It creates a level of uncertainty, which is not good for the potential commercial operator and it is not good for the potential wellbeing of the relevant species.
The Democrats have sought legal advice on many of these provisions and we have no doubt that they are neither strong enough nor specific enough to be enforceable. That, I think, is due to poor drafting or poor assessment by the government that again undermines some of the strength in the parent act. The government has made it clear, despite our continued attempts to negotiate some improvements, that it is not interested in improving the regulations or in enhancing the provisions in relation to animal welfare or cruelty or the manner in which a native wildlife trade may have an impact on the environmental wellbeing of particular species. The government's claim that these regulations are best practice does not hold water. We are disappointed that the government appears to have failed to look at ways to make them best practice. We certainly hope that the ALP will support the Democrats' very limited but important attempt to ensure some improvement in the situation.
The animal welfare provisions in the overall act were weak but they had an opportunity to be strengthened by these regulations. The impact of trade in native wildlife in terms of animal welfare issues is not adequately recognised. The live animal trade in many areas is unnecessarily cruel. We have heard again from the RSPCA about the cruel aspects of the kangaroo slaughter; the illegal trade in exotic birds; the appalling puppy farms that occur in Australia, in which dogs are bred like caged chickens; the export of dogs to countries that convert dogs into food and fur; and the massive slaughter of unwanted greyhounds in furtherance of a nationwide gambling addiction. There are plenty of areas where animal welfare provisions are shown to be inadequate. This act could have provided an opportunity to enhance that. It is most unfortunate that the government has missed that opportunity. The Democrats hope that, with regard to this provision that we are seeking to disallow, the Senate will support our move and provide a mechanism for increased protection at least in relation to wildlife management plans under trade operations. ",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 3)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,24,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-09-16,"—I will say at the outset, and I will keep my remarks brief, that disallowance of any of the regulations would have a significant detrimental effect on the integrity of Australia's wildlife protection regime and on important domestic industry sectors. All of the regulations currently in place are necessary for the effective operation of Australia's wildlife trade regime. It would be counterproductive to disallow any of the regulations and would compromise the operation of wildlife trade controls. From the government's perspective it would be preferable to leave the existing regulations in place until there has been sufficient time to determine whether any deficiencies are evident.
I understand there have been a number of discussions between the government, the Democrats and key NGO stakeholders in relation to these regulations. Those discussions have resulted in a far better understanding of concerns on both sides and have set a positive foundation for future engagement. While unfortunately those discussions have been unable to resolve the specific issue, I note for the record that Environment Australia is continuing to engage with NGOs on the implementation of the regime contained in these regulations. Suffice to say, the government will be voting against this motion of disallowance.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-09-16,"—An explanation is warranted on this matter. That is the first I have heard that we need a change to the legislation as listed.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-09-16,"—I do not have advice as to the reason for that but I can say the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002 has been around for a long time. In fact, it has its genesis in some two to three years' work and I think it is now imperative that this bill proceed as soon as possible. This is an essential bill for the Australian community. It has waited patiently in line to come before the Senate and I think the sooner we get onto it the better. I can think of no better reason to alter business in the Senate other than to enable early debate on the Proceeds of Crime Bill.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,25,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-09-16,"—As I understand it, this is just to move the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002 on the agenda so that it jumps ahead of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and the Marriage Amendment Bill 2002. I guess it is the government's right to reorganise things if it wishes. If you just look at the extent of the debate we had on the disallowance motion about wildlife regulations you have to wonder how serious the government is about considering anything very much. The relevant minister did not bother to turn up and there was no contribution whatsoever from the ALP on a significant issue, showing a complete lack of interest in an important area. There was seemingly more interest in the potential effect on trade than the potential effect on Australia's wildlife. 
I think it is worth noting that, each time we get regulations that are brought down after a bill is passed that do not meet the commitments given by ministers at the time the bill is passed, it is more likely that all of us are going to be twice shy and not fall for that sort of thing again. In relation to the motion before us, the Democrats would be willing to support moving the bill up the agenda. I do wonder whether this is more to do with people wanting to spend their time having dinner with certain heads of state, whose record some of us in this chamber criticised quite substantially. Obviously, it is a free choice for some people to engage with people like that. I would hope that with this being given priority the level of engagement with the debate is greater than that which was given to the disallowance motion.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Ellison's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,25,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-09-16,"—The genesis of the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002 and the Proceeds of Crime (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002 rests in the 1999 report from the Australian Law Reform Commission entitled Confiscation that counts. Recommendation 2 of that report stated that the principal objectives of a civil forfeiture scheme should be as follows:
·	to deprive persons of the proceeds of, and the benefits derived from, unlawful conduct
·	to provide for forfeiture of property used in or in connection with the commission of offences against the laws of the Commonwealth or the Territories.
This report underpins the legislation currently before the Senate. The supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002 states in its general outline:
The Bill as introduced contains a refined conviction based confiscation regime which will ultimately replace that in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. In addition, the Bill establishes a complementary system of non-conviction based or `civil' forfeiture, as well as a regime to confiscate `literary profits'. 
The opposition has always been ready to support reasonable legislation that will discourage and deter crime by reducing the profits from it. Indeed, the concept of a civil forfeiture scheme was first introduced into the parliament by the member for Denison as a private member's bill on 2 April 2001.
The intent of the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002 is to prevent criminals from benefiting from their crimes. It further aims to prevent the reinvestment of those proceeds and benefits in further criminal activities. The bill provides for the restraint and confiscation, on the civil standard of proof, of property and assets which are the proceeds of crime. It provides for civil forfeiture to allow the confiscation of unlawfully acquired property without first requiring a conviction.
The concept of civil forfeiture has long been a matter of debate across Australian jurisdictions and internationally. There is a school of thought that says we do not need a civil forfeiture scheme. After much consideration, I believe there is today such a need, to meet changed circumstances of organised crime. We cannot fight crime with dated weapons. Today's criminals operate in a global and technological environment which allows them to stand at arm's length from their crimes and the profits of those crimes. This legislation allows us to get closer and to ensure that those people are not given the opportunity to continue to benefit at the community's expense.
Criminals do not recognise state or even national borders. Multinational crime requires a multifaceted approach. We must ensure that our law enforcement agencies have the appropriate tools to disadvantage those in our community who would be advantaged by the proceeds of their crimes. We must ensure that the criminals in our community do not continue to benefit from their activities, activities which are based on the suffering and misery of others. At the same time, it is important that we do not overreact and introduce legislation which may be viewed as infringing community rights. The bills as they are tabled today are the result of a considerable amount of work to ensure that that balance is right. It is important to note that the opposition has actively sought to use the parliamentary processes to ensure that this is now the case. The report from the Senate committee reviewing the legislation noted a number of issues in relation to possible infringements of our civil rights, as we in the opposition also noted in our additional comments to the Senate committee report. The legislation before us today has been considerably refined to resolve those issues.
I turn now to the reversal of the onus of proof, one of the issues that arose in the inquiry. Once a court has ordered forfeiture, the onus is on the individual concerned to show that the property was acquired legitimately. There was concern that this reversal, by removing the presumption of innocence, was contrary to the essential principles of Australian law. From the Senate committee's hearings, it became obvious that the reversal provisions are very narrowly circumscribed in the bill. A person will be required to show the lawful origin of property only after the Director of Public Prosecutions has established, according to the civil standard, that there is a nexus between the property in question and serious criminal activity.
Another of the issues that arose was derivative use immunity. `Immunity' is the term used within the law to describe the protection in the law against self-incrimination. `Derivative use immunity' describes the level of immunity whereby a person who provides information during an examination, or who produces documents, cannot have that information used later against him or her. These bills remove derivative use immunity but retain use-immunity. Use-immunity is that level of immunity where a person is afforded immunity in subsequent proceedings, for the specific answer to a question provided under compulsory examination. This also applies to the content of a specific document produced in response to a production order. The essence of this is that information obtained in this way can be used in further investigations, and, should these further investigations produce incriminating material, this material will be available as evidence. This change is considered and is appropriate to the intent of the bills. 
I now turn to another matter that gave concern to the Senate committee: the issue of legal assistance. Under the original provisions of the bill, people facing restraint or forfeiture of their assets would be able to seek legal assistance by applying for legal aid. Restrained property would be excluded from the means test, and the application for legal assistance would be considered against the usual legal aid criteria. Where restrained property was subsequently forfeited, some could be used to meet the costs of legal aid. Where costs exceeded the amount of restrained property, the balance would be paid from the confiscated assets account. The whole committee determined that it would be unreasonable for a person who is ultimately found to have acquired their property lawfully to be required to bear the costs of proving their innocence. The opposition concurred with this finding of the committee. This aspect of the legislation has since been clarified by the Attorney-General, and it is worth taking the Senate to that clarification:
Under Clause 21, the court may refuse to make a restraining order unless the Commonwealth—in practice this means the DPP—provides the court with an undertaking as to payment of damages or costs arising from the operation and making such an order. Therefore a person who successfully defends a confiscation action would be able to claim against such an undertaking. In addition, Clause 323 of the bill empowers a court to award costs to successful parties not involved in the relevant criminal conduct. These costs are not limited to those normally recoverable in criminal proceedings but are full indemnity costs which can cover all expenses incurred by the person in connection with the proceedings, including those associated with legal aid.
The matter of forfeiture orders was also raised by the Senate committee. Section 47 of the original bill provided for the making of forfeiture orders in relation to property that has been the subject of a restraining order under section 18 of the bill, for a period of six months. Property is restrained under that clause where the DPP satisfies the court that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a person has committed a serious offence within the six years prior to the application. The original legislation did not provide for a nexus to be shown between the property to be restrained and the offence that is suspected, where the property is that person's property.
The opposition proposed that the words `there are reasonable grounds to suspect' be replaced with the words `it is more probable than not' for the making of forfeiture orders where property has been the subject of a restraining order for a period of at least six months. After consultation, the wording of that section of the legislation now reflects the concept of `on the balance of probabilities', which is acceptable to the opposition.
Another issue raised during the Senate committee inquiry was that of restraining orders. Labor was concerned by the ability of defendants to dispute a continuation of a restraining order within a limited time frame of 28 days. Where a person is charged, and perhaps bail refused, one would expect the person would be preoccupied with finding legal representation and dealing with the practicalities of their changed circumstances. That is, where assets have been restrained, ensuring that the day-to-day expenses are met, will necessarily be uppermost in the mind of the person charged. It is likely that shortly after being charged they would be served with the restraining order. To expect that, in those circumstances either the individual or their lawyers are likely to consider the making of an application under section 42, is unrealistic. A 28-day period is a much too limited period of time for such an application to be made. The opposition indicated that a court should be allowed a level of discretion in determining extensions of time for the continuation of a restraining order. As a result, the wording has now been changed so that a person who was not notified of the application for a restraining order may, within 28 days after being notified of the order, apply to the court to revoke the order unless granted an extension by the court on grounds being shown.
The matter of literary proceeds also arose during the Senate committee inquiry. This matter deals with the making of a literary proceeds order against a person who may benefit from the proceeds of a crime through a literary endeavour. While this part of the legislation attempts to deal with the issue of chequebook journalism, the converse is that it may also restrict freedom of speech by imposing unreasonable limits on a person's ability to speak out. There can be a public interest benefit derived from such a product depending on the nature and purpose of the publication, including its use for research, educational or rehabilitation purposes. While this may be unusual, again, the opposition believes that the courts should have the ability to make such a determination having regard to certain criteria. Some of those criteria include: whether it is in the public interest to confiscate the profits; whether there is any general, social or educational value associated with, for example, a movie or a book; and the nature or purpose of the product—for example, if its use is for research, education, rehabilitation or deterrence. The government agreed to the proposal that the wording be changed from `In deciding whether to make a literary proceeds order, the court may take into account such matters as it thinks fit,' to the words `should have regard to such matters as it thinks fit'. They are small changes but they are important changes. 
In dealing with the issue of review, this legislation has significant short and long-term ramifications—increasing the powers of law enforcement agencies and the potential impact on the privacy of Australian citizens. Its powers must be closely monitored and scrutinised. In their additional comments, the Labor senators raised matters of the removal of derivative use immunity, the guidelines relating to legal assistance and examination by the DPP. The Attorney-General responded to this concern after it was raised by the member for Banks in his speech on the second reading in the House of Representatives. The Attorney-General responded:
The review is set out in broad terms and would encompass the issues of derivative use immunity, legal assistance and the DPP guidelines as well as other issues which may emerge in the course of the operation of the act.
Another issue that was raised a number of times—and I think I can say was of concern to the Senate committee of inquiry as a whole—was that of telecommunications interception. That matter still seems to be alive today. Both the full Senate committee and the Labor senators separately raised concerns in relation to the matter of telephone intercepts. The AFP, the NCA and the DPP argued for an extension of existing law in relation to the use of intercepts in matters of civil recovery. The initial bill proposed no changes to the existing law. The Labor Party does not wish to restrict the legitimate investigations of the law enforcement agencies. At the same time, we do not wish to restrict the liberties of individuals in our community. 
The government proposed an amendment to the consequential bill which clarifies the circumstances under which evidence obtained by what are commonly called TI warrants can be used. This amendment means that the issue is basically evidentiary. There is no expansion of the powers under which TI warrants can be obtained. Evidence from telecommunications interception will be able to be used only in relation to the same offences and to gather evidence about unlawful assets or the activity which gave rise to them solely for the purposes of civil forfeiture proceedings.
The government proposed several additional amendments and we have no dispute with those. The definition of `financial institution' in clause 338 of the bill will be amended to include casinos and Totalisator Agency Boards, or TABs. This amendment would enable law enforcement agencies to seek monitoring orders and notices to financial institutions in relation to accounts held by those institutions. A similar amendment would be made in the consequential bill, which would require TABs and casinos to comply with the document retention provisions to be inserted into the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988. The amendments will provide that property which is the subject of a property order or financial agreement under the Family Law Act 1975 will cease to be the proceeds or instrument of crime six years after the distribution of the property under such an order. However, should the distribution be a sham, this exception will not apply and the money will continue to be proceeds or instruments of crime and thus confiscable. The definition provisions in the bill will be amended to include a definition of `TAB' in the bill and to include a reference to the existing money laundering offence in the definition of `serious offences'. 
The amendments would also amend one of the money laundering offences which the bill is inserting into the Criminal Code to align the range of state offences covered by the offence with the other money laundering offences also being inserted into the Criminal Code. The amendment will increase the range of state offences which can give rise to Commonwealth money laundering offences. The family law amendments would incorporate a number of recommendations from the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Service which have both reviewed the amendments made by the consequentials bill to the Family Law Act 1975. The recommendations are mainly procedural and will significantly improve the running of the scheme established by the Family Law Act amendments.
All these amendments ensure the bills deserve support. Unfortunately, the government has not completed its task in drafting this legislation. While the opposition will not decline to give the bills a second reading, it should be placed on record that the government has failed to ensure that these bills will not entirely discourage and deter crime by reducing the profits from these crimes. The opposition has consistently drawn the government's attention to an anomaly in the taxation laws which was recently reinforced by a decision of the Federal Court in the matter of Commissioner of Taxation v. La Rosa. The court found that a person had profited from drug dealing and that the profits of this drug dealing should be treated as assessable income. In this particular case, the person was able to claim a $220,000 tax deduction for money which was stolen from him. This money, by the way, was buried in the person's backyard and dug up to be used for a drug deal in May 1995. In the course of preparing for a drug deal, the money was dug up, counted and subsequently reburied. The person claimed that this money was subsequently stolen and could not be included as part of his income for that period. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal found that there should be a deduction for that year in the person's taxable income. This case was heard on appeal by the Federal Court, and unfortunately the decision was upheld.
This matter was raised by the opposition. To that end, we urge the government to correct this anomaly and not wait for an appeal as foreshadowed by the Treasurer. He indicated that the government had encouraged the Australian Taxation Office to appeal the Federal Court's decision. We strongly recommend that the government act now to correct the legislation and not wait, which is why we are moving the amendment circulated. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
	“but the Senate:
	(a)	notes that the Courts have recently affirmed the principle that a drug dealer may be allowed a tax deduction where the proceeds from illegal drug dealing are stolen;
	(b)	further notes that this treatment effectively frees from tax the proceeds of illegal drug dealing;
	(c)	confirms that this grave matter was brought to the attention of the Parliament more than two years ago by Labor;
	(d)	condemns the Treasurer for his inaction in attacking drug dealing by allowing this anomaly to stand for years; and 
	(e)	calls on the Government to amend the taxation law to ensure criminals and drug dealers are no longer able to claim a tax deduction where the proceeds of drug deals are stolen”.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-09-16,"—The Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002 and the Proceeds of Crime (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002 bring into effect an expanded civil forfeiture regime at a Commonwealth level. The underlying principle offered by the government in relation to these bills is that they remedy the unjust enrichment of individuals who profit at society's expense. It is also said that they will deter crime by reducing profits and prevent crime by diminishing the capacity of offenders to finance future criminal activities. 
The civil forfeiture regime allows the Commonwealth to confiscate assets, on the basis that they are proceeds of crime, without the need to obtain a criminal conviction. The confiscation of an individual's assets is a significant penalty. At its heart, these bills are about enabling the Commonwealth to impose sanctions on people for alleged criminal behaviour in circumstances where it cannot prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law through the criminal justice system. That is a profound departure from important principles of law and warrants close consideration.
There are a few vital elements of this legislation that need to be outlined. The first is that the civil forfeiture provisions will permit the confiscation of assets on the basis of civil proceedings. The standard of proof to be met by the state is the civil standard—that is, the balance of probabilities—rather than the more onerous criminal standard, which is `beyond reasonable doubt'. This means that a person's assets can be confiscated on the basis that they are proceeds of crime even where the tribunal of fact has reasonable doubt as to the person's guilt. Furthermore, there is no requirement that the allegation of criminality be particularised. For the purposes of ordering forfeiture of assets, the court need only be satisfied that some criminal offence or other has occurred, not that a particular offence has occurred. Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, the fact that there is reasonable doubt as to whether a person has been involved in any wrongdoing at all is not sufficient to prevent the forfeiture of assets. There does not even have to be a proposal to charge the person with an offence. Indeed, under clause 51, the fact that the person has been acquitted of the alleged wrongdoing in a criminal trial does not prevent their assets from being forfeited as proceeds of crime. It is a highly contentious proposal that a person who is acquitted of a particular crime can have a substantial penalty imposed upon him or her by the state for the same alleged activity by confiscating their assets under this legislation.
Once assets are restrained under this legislation, the individual concerned will not have access to his or her assets for the purpose of funding his or her defence to the forfeiture proceedings. This means that people who may have significant legitimately acquired assets may not be able to fund the sort of defence they would like. Under the legislation, such people will be given access to legal aid where appropriate. They will be assessed for eligibility for legal aid on the same basis as other individuals, although restrained assets will not be included in the means test. It is not clear that the legal aid system will in all cases provide people with the standard of representation to which they would otherwise be entitled.
One issue that has arisen in relation to legal aid is juniorisation. The pay scales are such that some senior lawyers do not make their services available to legal aid clients. This is not to cast aspersions upon the many talented people who represent legal aid clients: some of them are very experienced and very dedicated. However, I do note that the pay scales for legal aid are currently under review, partly as a result of concerns about the juniorisation of the representation of legal aid clients. In this context it is worth remarking that people who require legal aid only because the state has restrained their assets may be denied experienced representation for which they would be happy to pay. The rationale for this approach in this bill is that, if defendants have access to their assets to fund their legal defence, many of those who know that their assets will be forfeited will use up those assets on frivolous legal challenges. No doubt this will often be true, and there are two important implications of this. Firstly, the Commonwealth can be denied access to the proceeds of crime. This first consideration should not be pivotal. The underlying rationale of the bill relates to preventing unjust enrichment and removing assets that may be put towards future criminal activity. Where those assets are exhausted on legal challenges rather than confiscated, these outcomes are still achieved. This is not and should not be a revenue-raising exercise. One criticism of some of the legislative regimes applying in the United States is that the revenue implications have had an inappropriate impact on the manner in which criminals are pursued. 
The second implication of the deliberate expenditure on legal challenges of funds that are likely to be forfeited is a more important one. Where legal challenges are mounted in this way, they use up important resources. The DPP must respond to them. The courts must hear them. They are an unwelcome strain on a legal system already under pressure. We Democrats believe that the legal aid provisions of this bill must be closely monitored. I hope that, when this act is reviewed in three years time, this matter will be carefully analysed. While there are legitimate reasons to restrain assets that are the subject of a forfeiture dispute, care must be taken to ensure that the ability of defendants to defend themselves is not compromised.
Another issue arising from this bill is retrospectivity. The legislation is retrospective in that assets can be confiscated on the basis of criminal activity undertaken prior to the enactment of the bill. Section 14 provides that the bill will apply even when the relevant offence or conviction occurred before the bill came into force. In part, this is necessary to ensure that any property that might be confiscated under the current act can still be confiscated under the new act. However, the proposed legislation is much broader than the existing legislation. The result is that new penalties will apply retrospectively to activities that took place prior to the commencement of the legislation. We Democrats are very wary of legislation that retrospectively imposes significant penalties. Of course, it is only imposing those penalties on activities that were already unlawful at the time they were committed. However, it does change somewhat the penalties and consequences associated with those activities, and does so retrospectively.
A further problem with this legislation relates to the information-gathering powers. The provisions of this bill dealing with examination and production orders abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination. While use immunity continues to apply, derivative use immunity will be removed. The important point to make in this context is that civil forfeiture proceedings under this legislation can take place even where no criminal charge has yet been laid and they may occur concurrently with the conduct of a criminal investigation. In the civil proceedings, the Commonwealth can require the defendant to answer questions and provide documents. There is of course no such power in relation to a criminal investigation or a criminal trial, where a suspect or accused generally has the right to remain silent.
The concern that has been raised is that the Commonwealth could use its compulsory examination powers under this legislation to force individuals to answer questions and provide documents that the Commonwealth could never force them to answer or provide under the criminal justice system because of the privilege against self-incrimination. If the Commonwealth can then use information derived from those documents or answers in a criminal investigation and trial, it is as though the privilege never existed. While the testimony and documents provided cannot be used against the individual, anything derived from them can be. In practical terms, there is the potential for this to be used to largely defeat the privilege against self-incrimination. In the High Court case of Environment Protection Authority v. Caltex, Chief Justice Mason and Justice Toohey considered the nature of the privilege in great detail. They observed that historically the privilege developed to protect individual humans from being compelled to testify, on pain of excommunication or physical punishment, to their own guilt. They went on to say:
In one important sense, the modern rationale for the privilege against self-incrimination is substantially the same as the historical justification-protection of the individual from being confronted by the “cruel trilemma” of punishment for refusal to testify, punishment for truthful testimony or perjury (and the consequential possibility of punishment).
They noted that the privilege is now an internationally recognised human right. As Justice Murphy commented in Rochfort v. Trade Practices Commission:
The privilege against self-incrimination is a human right, based on the desire to protect personal freedom and human dignity.
The issue of self-incrimination and derivative use immunity has arisen previously in the Senate in its consideration of the National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. The Law Council of Australia said in relation to that bill: 
... the Law Council does not accept that because a person is suspected of sophisticated criminal activity means that his or her basic rights should be lost—that he or she must answer questions that may lead to incriminating evidence being derived against them or face prison. When this happens, people are being compelled to establish innocence ...
It also said:
... the amendments in relation to self-incrimination may be contrary to Australia's international legal obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ...
The ICCPR states that no person may be compelled to testify against himself or herself in the determination of any criminal charge against himself or herself. The Law Council drew attention to a recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights considering article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the ECHR. The Law Council said:
Article 6 of the ECHR guarantees a “fair hearing” in the determination of a criminal charge. In the Saunders case, the Court held that it was a violation of Article 6 of the ECHR to admit as evidence in a criminal trial evidence that had been obtained in earlier investigations under the UK Companies Act in which the defendant had been required to answer questions and provide evidence that was self-incriminatory, or risk being treated as being in contempt of court (which carried a maximum penalty of a fine or imprisonment for two years).
The courts take Australia's international human rights obligations into account when making their decisions. So too should we as legislators give considerable weight to these obligations in making judgments about the appropriateness of legislation placed before us by the government. If the bill violates the ICCPR then it is contrary to international law. We have circulated amendments that address the issue of self-incrimination. We are mindful of the fact that removing derivative use immunity, which applies in the current Proceeds of Crime Act, is supported by the major parties. What we have suggested is essentially a compromise. 
The draft guidelines for the conduct of compulsory examinations under the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002 emphasise that it is impermissible to use an examination for the purpose of obtaining information to advance a criminal investigation. Our amendment seeks to establish a legislative scheme to ensure that these information-gathering powers are not abused in this fashion. Under the draft guidelines it is permissible for any material obtained from an examination to be used to assist in a criminal investigation. In commenting on the draft guidelines the New South Wales Bar Association said:
... the draft guidelines, in terms of the use that may be made of such material, amount to an invitation to use the examination power to further the investigation of criminal offences, which is not the statutory purpose behind the reason for the examination.
They went on to comment:
The guidelines as currently drafted simply highlight the complete artificiality associated with the notion that in some way a Proceeds of Crime inquiry under the Bill can be conducted separately from any related criminal investigation or prosecution. The tension between the preservation of accused persons' rights and legitimate investigation of their financial affairs has been a part of all Proceeds of Crime statutory schemes.
What the Democrats amendment proposes is that no examination or production order may be used for the purposes of obtaining information advanced in a criminal prosecution. I think all parties would agree that the use of examination and production orders in this fashion would be highly improper. The amendment further provides that where information is improperly obtained in this way it is inadmissible in evidence in a criminal trial against the person. The integrity of the system requires that improperly obtained evidence not be used against an individual. The only remaining issue arising in cases where the DPP wants to use, in a criminal trial, evidence derived from an examination or production order is who should bear onus of establishing that the evidence does not arise out of any misuse of the information-gathering powers in the civil proceedings. In addressing this, we should start from the position that the very use, in a criminal trial, of information derived from evidence obtained under compulsion in violation of the privilege against self-incrimination is itself a departure from important legal principles. 
We should also take into account the growing tendency of the government to reverse the onus of proof and place it on the defendant where the information relevant to the issue is likely to be possessed by the defendant. In this case we are dealing with evidence that is obtained in controversial circumstances. The Commonwealth is the party in a position to establish what the purpose of seeking the information under the examination or production order was. We believe it is appropriate that the Commonwealth bear the onus of establishing that the relevant information was not acquired under a production or examination order for the purposes of advancing a criminal investigation, and our amendment reflects this. In practical terms, all this would require is for the Commonwealth to show that the information it was seeking was sought for the purposes of the civil forfeiture proceedings.
The Democrats have circulated a second amendment which addresses the issue of double jeopardy. The US Bill of Rights contains a prohibition on double jeopardy. In Australia there is no such prohibition. According to US Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, the underlying idea of the double jeopardy clause in the US Constitution is as follows:
... is that the state with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.
The US has used civil forfeiture laws to a much greater extent than Australia. This has attracted considerable discussion on the consistency of civil forfeiture with the double jeopardy prohibition. The state of the law in the US at the moment appears to be that civil forfeiture is not normally considered to be punishment for the purposes of double jeopardy. However, attention has been given to the question of whether, as a matter of substance, civil forfeiture laws offend the prohibition on double jeopardy. Civil forfeiture laws do allow people to be tried and acquitted, tried again in civil court and potentially have a substantial penalty imposed upon them.
Returning to Justice Black's rationale for the double jeopardy clause, civil forfeiture does allow repeated legal action against an individual. It does expose the individual to repeated embarrassment, expense and ordeal and it does compel him or her to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity. Repeated trials of the same matter do enhance the possibility that, even though innocent, an individual may be found guilty. Obviously, if the Commonwealth could take action against individuals in respect of the same matter 10 or 20 times, there is a much better chance that it would eventually be successful even where the person is innocent. To put it another way, either the procedural law on the criminal side will more and more resemble the procedural law on the civil side, or the substantive sanctions on the civil side will more and more resemble criminal penalties.
The Democrats are not convinced that where an individual has been acquitted of an offence it should be possible for the state to further pursue him or her for that offence. The point made by Professor Dribbs is that, as the level of dissatisfaction with the criminal justice system rises, the state will slowly turn to the civil law as a vehicle for pursuing its criminal justice agenda and that, more and more, the civil system will take the place of the criminal system. It may be that, given the changing nature of organised crime, reform of the criminal justice system is necessary to restore the confidence of all concerned. However, we do not believe that the repeated pursuit of individuals over the same matter is appropriate. Our amendment seeks to prevent a forfeiture order being made against a person in relation to an offence for which they have been acquitted.
To conclude, the Democrats are mindful of the need to ensure that where confiscation has taken place there are proven proceeds of crime. We support the principle that criminals should be then denied unjust enrichment from their criminal activities. We have a number of reservations about the operation of this legislation and its impact on civil liberties. We will move a number of amendments to address those and I understand they have now been circulated and we commend them to the Senate.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2002-09-16,"—One of the reasons I want to speak briefly this evening is a comment the minister made in the earlier procedural debate before we moved onto the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002—that this is a piece of legislation that certainly seems to have been a long time coming. I think it is an important part of the approach to dealing with crime that the government has been looking at for some time now. The length of the procedure has meant that the bill before the Senate is in fact the product of very long consultation. The second report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the bill says in the concluding paragraphs:
The committee notes the lengthy process involved in this legislation but congratulates all participants for their contribution to the refinement of the bills as introduced. The Committee considers that the Government amendments constitute a marked improvement on the original bills and is satisfied that the Committee's earlier concerns have been addressed.
The Committee also notes the significant consultation process that has been undertaken in relation to many aspects of the bills and has involved relevant industry bodies, stakeholders, law enforcement agencies, the Family Court and Federal Magistrates Service, the Department and the DPP. 
I think those remarks are well made in relation to this legislation, not just the consultation process that should go with the legislative process but in addition to that the committee consultation, as I am sure other members of the committee who are here will agree. The committee held several hearings over two reports, in fact, on this legislation, and the key witnesses who assisted the committee in that process also made a very constructive contribution to our understanding of the finer points of civil forfeiture regimes and this proposal in particular. Those witnesses include the DPP, the Attorney-General's Department, of course, the Australian Federal Police, the NCA, the WA police, the New South Wales bar and also the Australian Federal Police Association, who, I think it is fair to say, made a very constructive contribution to the committee's processes in relation to this bill.
One of the reasons the committee ended up examining the bill twice was that it was originally introduced in September 2001 and the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002 was introduced in March of this year. The committee had two opportunities to work with those pieces of legislation. Its principal purpose is obviously to strengthen and improve Commonwealth laws for the confiscation of the proceeds of crime. Both the Commonwealth and the states for a number of years have had laws enabling the proceeds of crime to be confiscated after a conviction has been obtained. But I think most people who practise in the area would observe that the laws have not necessarily been fully effective. They have not really impacted at the top of the larger criminal organisations that operate in this particular way, and technology and globalisation in particular have rendered it even more difficult to reach those individuals. I think the Australian Law Reform Commission report handed down in 1999, entitled Confiscation that counts, was a very telling report on the inadequacy of the then Commonwealth conviction based laws.
Coming from New South Wales I was interested to note that the bill is based primarily on the regime that was set up in 1997 in that state. It will enable confiscation by a simpler civil process and at the end of that process a person will have the opportunity to show the court that his or her assets were lawfully derived. If that evidence is provided, those assets will not be forfeited. So, at the end of the day, the provisions are in fact accounting for criminally derived enrichment in civil proceedings, not imposing criminal sanctions as such.
The bill that is before the Senate at the moment includes improvements on the bill that was introduced in 2001, as I have indicated, including increasing the provisions that are particularly relevant to the financing of terrorism—another issue that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has spent much time considering— and refinements which simplify aspects of the procedures in the bill including that for providing legal assistance. It is fair to say there have been nine key changes made to the bills since September 2001, and I only want to refer briefly to a couple of those this evening—and other contributors to the debate have also done that.  
One concerns the measures which enhance the capacity of law enforcement agencies to restrain and confiscate the assets of terrorists. There is an extension in the bill to terrorism offences by defining those as `serious offences' under the bill. In general, on restraining and forfeiture orders, the bill places a six-year time limit on applications for those, but there is no such time limit included for terrorism offences. In that regard I think the bill is supported very broadly. There is also a proposal in the legislation which effects the government's election commitment to enable the confiscated proceeds of crime to be directed in a particular manner, not just to consolidated revenue, that is, but to support national and community programs in the fight against crime and also to provide additional drug treatment and diversionary programs—and I think they are very important aspects of this legislation.
Other senators have already commented on matters concerning the provision of legal assistance and also the restriction of derivative-use immunity, which was in the bill in relation to production. Derivative-use immunity was an issue which gained some focus in the consideration of the legislation by the committee and by commentators. In this case the amendment extends the use of derivative-use immunity to production orders, which was not the case in the first bill.
Senator Ludwig referred to the operation of the Telecommunications Interception Act 1979 in this regard, and the committee in particular—and I think this is an important part of the committee process in bringing the legislation to the chamber—spent some extended period of time contemplating this issue. The committee heard from the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police in particular on a number of occasions, and we were grateful for the commissioner's assistance with that. The bill now comes to the chamber with an amendment which proposes the use of intercept material, subject to particular safeguards, in restraining order proceedings for civil based proceedings under this particular bill.
I want to note the expansion of the class of accounts in respect of which a monitoring order can be made—that has also been commented on this evening. In clause 338 of the bill there is a proposal in relation to the definition of the term `financial institution', which means that casinos and TABs would be in a position where law enforcement agencies could seek monitoring orders and notices to financial institutions in relation to accounts held by those institutions. It is important to note that, as I understand it, the extension of the definition in this regard is limited to this particular piece of legislation and is not intended to have a broad application.
Finally, the government is obviously of the view—and has received broad support in that regard—that the introduction of a civil forfeiture regime is a critical component to a tough on crime approach to law enforcement. This is about depriving criminals and terrorists of their profits. It is a tool that enables the government to fight drug traffickers, people-smugglers, terrorists and other serious criminals which, up until now, the regime which has operated at Commonwealth level has not been able to target at the right level. As I said in my earlier remarks, it is a bill that will also ensure that the confiscated proceeds of crime will be used to support national and community programs in their efforts to combat crime and also additional drug treatment and diversionary programs, and I think that is a very important aspect of legislation.",SENATE,<title>PROCEEDS OF CRIME BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2002-09-16,"—The Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002 and the Proceeds of Crime (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002 are, in my view, excellent examples of what the parliamentary process must be about. In their original form, these bills—as we have heard from previous speakers—presented a possible attack on the civil liberties that Australians have struggled for over many years. The objective of these bills is of course one that the ALP supports. To ensure that the proceeds of crime are not enjoyed by the perpetrators is an aim that all members of a just society must agree with. In fact, these bills will aim to replace legislation originally introduced in 1987 by the then Labor government. 
As outlined by previous speakers, there are two key elements that fall under the provisions of these bills: firstly, the issue of restraining orders preventing the disposal of assets that may have been acquired from the proceeds of crime prior to a conviction being achieved and, secondly, the confiscation of assets that have been acquired from the proceeds of crime once a criminal conviction is actually secured. This fundamental change requires deep thought and consideration before it becomes law. That is why I said at the start of my contribution that these amended bills are a good example of the parliamentary process.
These bills were referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, as has been outlined by Senator Payne, and a thorough and detailed examination then took place. I would like to here acknowledge the work of my predecessor, Senator Jim McKiernan, and other members of the committee in that review. The referral to the committee and the subsequent negotiations between the government and the opposition now mean that these are bills that amend the shortcomings contained in the original versions—although, as was outlined by Senator Ludwig, we still have some way to go before we come up with complete legislation.
Let us consider some of the amendments and how, without amendment, the original bills raised concerns about an erosion of civil liberties. The Senate committee—and I would like to emphasise that it was in fact the whole committee—determined that it would be unreasonable for a person who is ultimately found to have acquired their property lawfully to be required to bear the cost of proving their innocence. These concerns are now addressed in clauses 12 and 323. Clause 12, as it is now, requires the Commonwealth to provide an undertaking as to damages or costs in the event that a person successfully defends a confiscation action. In the original bill, we could have seen a situation where a person facing a confiscation action would still be liable for any costs arising even where they successfully defended that action. The amended bill now means that a person would be able to claim against the government's undertaking. This ensures that a person is not unduly disadvantaged in the event that the action to confiscate or restrain fails. Clause 323 now empowers a court to award costs to successful parties not involved in the relevant criminal conduct. This of course means that, where assets are subject to a confiscation action and where it is proved that the successful parties were not involved in criminal conduct, costs may be awarded to those parties. These two clauses now ensure that successful parties are able to petition the courts in relation to costs and damages.
The new proposals to be contained in the Proceeds of Crime (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill mean that the telecommunications intercepts cannot be used solely for the purposes of civil forfeiture proceedings. Again, this ensures that telecommunications intercepts are still sought for the purpose of identifying criminal activity and are not for use in a civil forfeiture action. In the event that the intercept identifies assets that may be the proceeds of crime, that is allowed.
Without the changes that have been made to the original bill, we could have seen the expansion of intercepts into civil matters. It is fundamentally important that intercepts cannot be sought for providing evidence for civil matters. Limiting the situations where intercepts can be used ensures that the civil liberties of Australians are not being infringed solely on the suspicion that an asset has been acquired as a result of criminal activities. However, the changes that have been proposed by the government and supported by the opposition now mean that a person who was not notified of the restraining order has the capacity to apply to the court to revoke the order. This will allow the person up to 28 days to lodge such an application once they are notified of the restraining order.
This approach means that, although the restraining order is in place, the person so concerned has a right to seek that that order be revoked. It also allows a person sufficient time, and the bill in this case allows the courts to grant an extension of up to three months, to seek that the order be revoked. This approach ensures that the person has sufficient time to get their house in order to contest a forfeiture order. Without this time being granted a person may be severely disadvantaged under the operation of these bills. 
For many people one of the chief concerns with these bills is the implied change of the onus of proof, as has been outlined earlier. Once the courts have ordered forfeiture then the onus of proof rests with the individual to demonstrate that the assets were acquired legitimately. This removal of the presumption of innocence concerns me and many other Australians as being a fundamental change to the principles of Australian law. However, and again I note the success of parliamentary process, it is now clear that this process operates in very narrow terms. A person will be required to show the lawful origin of property only after the DPP has established, according to the civil standard, that there is a nexus between the property in question and serious criminal activity, and we think that is appropriate.
These bills, as I said earlier, demonstrate the effectiveness of the parliamentary process. We have here very complex pieces of legislation, but legislation nonetheless that is vital in the fight against crime. Rather than adopt a crash through approach, it is pleasing to see that the government has taken the concerns of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee as expressed in its recommendations into account. This agreed approach will ensure that the bills now offer sufficient surety for the civil liberties of our fellow Australians. This surety does not, however, reduce the effectiveness of the bills in combating criminals. Their ill-gotten gains are no longer of benefit to them and this of course is the bill's intent.
Before concluding my brief remarks on these bills, I would like to canvass the issue of corporate or white-collar crime. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 26 August, Ross Gittens wrote an article titled `Yes, you can legislate for morality'. I found that Gittens's argument is one that should be tested against this new legislation. If you look at the reported behaviours of some of the executives caught up in the corporate scandals of recent times, the HIH, One-Tel or any of the others that we have seen, one wonders if this new legislation would result in the restraining orders being sought over their assets. We have to ask ourselves: will the full force of this legislation be applied to white-collar crime? Will the government seek orders to restrain assets prior to a conviction being achieved? Will we deny a white-collar criminal the proceeds of crime the same as we would a drug dealer?
It is often said that proving white-collar crime is more difficult because of the complexity of financial transactions and the use of holding companies and all the rest of their complex arrangements. Gittens put it more succinctly:
Apparently, if the crim's wearing a suit at the time it makes all the difference.
For myself, I will monitor the operation of this legislation to ensure that justice is blind to the apparel of the criminal. It would be disturbing in the extreme if, when the legislation is reviewed in the future, we were to find that its application was distorted. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date.

"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2002-09-16,"—It is with deep regret that I draw the attention of honourable senators to the death of Rhonda Brownlie, an officer of the Department of the Senate, who was killed tragically in a car accident on Saturday, 31 August 2002. Rhonda commenced with the department in 1994 as a temporary employee in the Table Office. She worked in a number of roles in the Table Office, becoming permanent in 1995. In later years, Rhonda was in charge of the Table Office document store in the basement, where she organised the thousands of reports and other documents presented to the Senate every year and provided a highly efficient service to ensure that senators received whatever documents they requested as soon after tabling as possible. She will be missed by her many friends in Parliament House. On behalf of honourable senators and Senate staff, I convey our very sincere sympathy to Rhonda's family and friends.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2002-09-16,"—I rise this evening to speak about two Australians who have been caught in legal limbo for nine and six months respectively— two Australians who have not had their rights recognised under international law and who have been treated with total disregard by the Australian government.
Mr David Hicks and Mr Mamdouh Habib are currently being detained in a US military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in a cell five by four metres, in solitary confinement, without sunlight and without regular exercise in Camp Delta. Mr Hicks has been held in detention in Guantanamo Bay for over nine months. It is reported that he was captured at a non-alliance road block on 9 December 2001. From there he was flown to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he was imprisoned in a cage six by eight metres until 25 May, when he was placed and remains in Camp Delta prison in solitary confinement. Mr Habib was arrested in Pakistan last year after leaving Australia in late July to early August. The US has alleged that Mr Habib trained with Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Mr Habib has been in Guantanamo Bay since May.
To date, neither of these two Australians have been charged with any offence under international law, Australian law or US law, yet they remain in detention indefinitely. Since being held in detention, neither Mr Hicks nor Mr Habib have had access to legal counsel or family members. This is due to the legal limbo which they have been placed in—an ambiguous position which the Commonwealth government is content to do nothing about, a circumstance which has stripped two of our citizens of all their rights recognised under international law.
The legal limbo that Mr Hicks and Mr Habib are in has recently been consolidated with the ruling handed down by a US district court. It ruled that Mr Hicks has no right to trial before a US court, therefore ruling out the possibility for Mr Hicks to have access to a legal counsel which he would have otherwise received if he was charged with a crime. Whilst Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said the US courts had no jurisdiction to hear Mr Hicks's case, Australia could pursue rights Mr Hicks would have under international law if it chose to. That is, the Commonwealth government of Australia could pursue Mr Hicks's and Mr Habib's legal rights recognised under international law and through international organisations should it have the concern to assist our citizens caught in such an ambiguous position. 
However, the government views the detention of Mr Hicks and Mr Habib as satisfactory. The Attorney-General has stated:
They—
the Americans—
have told us their intention is to detain all of residents of Guantanamo Bay until hostilities cease. When hostilities will cease I'm not even able to speculate on.
The questions that must be raised following such a vague statement are: who will determine when hostilities cease and under what criteria will it be judged—by the end of hostilities in Afghanistan, the end of hostilities in other parts of the world or the end of the war on terror? The statement demonstrates that the Commonwealth government has no clear and coherent response to the situation and quite clearly does not want to deal with the issue. Rather, it prefers leaving it to another nation to determine what will happen to our citizens.
While it is not my intention this evening to persuade this place as to the innocence or otherwise of Mr Hicks and Mr Habib, it is worth noting that the Attorney-General's Department has spent $750,000 to date investigating Mr Hicks's and Mr Habib's potential links to terrorist organisations and to terrorism yet has not been able to identify any single offence with which they could potentially charge them—not one single offence. The US Ambassador to Australia has stated that Hicks and Habib could be jailed in Cuba until the end of the war on terror, likening their detention to that of Germans during World War II. There is a major difference in the circumstances in which Nazi POWs were held and the circumstances under which Mr Hicks and Mr Habib are currently held—and that is that Nazi POWs were recognised as prisoners of war and were attributed rights recognised under the Geneva Convention. Mr Hicks and Mr Habib receive no such recognition.
Amnesty International has stated that it feels the US has violated many international laws in its treatment of those captured during the war in Afghanistan. In a report published in April this year, Amnesty International stated that, despite repeated statements that it is committed to international law and standards, the US government is failing to meet its obligations to apply such law and standards to those in its custody in Afghanistan and in Guantanamo Bay. The human rights organisation went on to state that, in doing so, the US has not only violated the rights of those individuals but threatens to undermine the rule of law everywhere. In the violations it claims the US was committing, it included the violation of the right to be informed of the reason for detention, the right to prompt and confidential access to counsel of one's choice and the right to the presumption of innocence. The Center for Constitutional Rights in New York has described as `quite incredible' the indefinite detention of detainees without any judicial review of an executive decision, such as the decision not to recognise the Camp Delta prisoners as POWs but as `unlawful combatants' by the US administration.
Whilst international organisations have raised concerns over the treatment of those held prisoner in Camp Delta, the Commonwealth Minister for Foreign Affairs has demonstrated the government's lack of concern about the fate of two of our citizens held in detention. The minister stated:
People who muck about with organisations like Al Qaeda are bound to get themselves into a great deal of trouble.
What the minister has demonstrated is that the government is satisfied to have the internationally recognised right to a presumption of innocence denied. The minister's comments effectively brand Mr Hicks and Mr Habib guilty of an offence, despite the lack of charges and despite the uncertainties surrounding Mr Hicks as to whether he was allegedly fighting for the Taliban or Al-Qaeda.
This government went to the last election with all the rhetoric of protecting Australia, its borders and its people, yet is clearly acting in contradiction to this rhetoric by not pursuing the rights of our citizens more proactively. This government has stood by as it watches the sovereignty of Australia being questioned and flaunted whilst another nation holds our citizens in indefinite detention without being charged with an offence— again, not one single offence. Further, this government aims to present itself as family-friendly, yet it has done nothing to assist the families of Mr Hicks and Mr Habib in gaining access to them. Nor has the government assisted in allowing any form of communication between the prisoners and their family members. Mr Hicks and Mr Habib are effectively shut off from the world and have no time line as to when they will be offered the right to a fair trial. 
It is of great concern to me and many Australians that the Commonwealth government is content to sit by and watch a fundamental right that judicial systems in Western democracies are based around—the right to the presumption of innocence—being denied. Further, it is also a concern that the government has allowed the right to legal counsel to be denied. The Australian Bar Association has accused the federal government of failing the two Australians held captive by the American military in Guantanamo Bay, with the association's president stating that it was `entirely unsatisfactory' that Mr Hicks and Mr Habib had been held for months without charge or access to lawyers.
If democracies allow the erosion of fundamental rights that have been accepted as just and fair for many decades by our citizens and for our citizens, then we are allowing the tragic events of terrorism to be victorious. Rather than erode rights that have formed the moral bedrock of our society, governments must act in a manner that reflects fairness and leadership and ensure that our citizens do not live in fear and their fundamental democratic rights are protected at all costs.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Military Detention: Australian Citizens</title>,Adjournment,29,1
