"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-03-30,"—During the debate on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 [No. 2] yesterday, I was talking about the lack of regional services, an issue that has been avoided by this government. I was particularly referring to the shire of Logan, which is 20 minutes from the centre of Brisbane. Logan is one of the largest cities in Queensland, but Telstra has been unable to provide adequate broadband Internet services to that area. Given that it is an emerging area, the demand is there but Telstra seems unable to provide the service to new areas within Logan. Of course, this highlights the problem with this government: its inability to deal with Telstra in a pragmatic way. This government wants to wash its hands of the affair and sell off its stake. There are better ways to achieve a result. I have raised this issue before in the parliament. For 18 months residents have struggled to obtain services in Logan. These residents can now intermittently receive broadband services through an ADSL exchange, although these services are neither reliable nor up to the standard that others in the metropolitan area receive. New residential areas are screaming out for these issues to be addressed by Telstra. However, Telstra's failure to lay cable in new residential areas has seen a fall in services to metropolitan areas. 
The sale of Telstra is particularly galling for residents living in Forde, Groom and Maranoa. Let me give an example of Telstra's failure to provide adequate and timely services to semirural areas such as those in the federal seat of Forde. I received a call from a constituent whose wife is disabled with a terminal illness. From Christmas until March this year, this family lost the use of their phone line for days at a time. On one occasion they lost the use of their phone for 11 consecutive days. My office sought to follow up on these complaints and contacted Telstra. My staff were told that services had been affected due to storm activity. Anyone who spent Christmas in south-east Queensland would know that, despite soaring temperatures—perhaps high humidity for those who live in Canberra—we did not see a scrap of rain over the Christmas period. In fact, in Queensland we baked during that period, which was absent of any storm activity.
The constituent phoned Telstra on several occasions to have the family's phone connection restored, and was told the delays were due to ongoing difficulties with the line in the area, which had been caused by storm damage. The odd part about the explanation was that no-one else in the street lost their telephone service during this period, as far as I am aware, due to storm damage. And although my office inquired, no-one could recollect whether anyone else's phone lines had been subject to intermittent storm damage in that street or in the nearby area. 
After the constituent made a number of complaints, Telstra offered to divert incoming calls to the constituent's mobile phone in an effort to address, in part, the problem of lack of telecommunications. I am told that the constituent, thinking this was a nice gesture, agreed to the diversion of calls to his mobile. What he did not realise at the time, I was subsequently informed, was that Telstra was going to refuse to cover the cost of the diversion and did not offer to credit the costs incurred by making local calls on a mobile telephone. In fact, Telstra refused to give any sort of credit for out-of-pocket expenses. My office was informed by the constituent that the reasoning behind this was that the mobile phone contract was with a rival telco.
It was only after my office intervened with the telco that the ball started to finally get rolling. Telstra started to at least come round to understanding some of the problems. I do not think they had realised that there had not been a storm to that date, but at least they started to address the problem on behalf of the constituent. But it stalled again. After several more calls to the customer relations offices in both Brisbane and the Gold Coast, a resolution was finally reached. It seems the problem was not due to local storms, as was suggested, but was due to a fault in the substation where the constituent's line is located. The problem was subsequently corrected. It was not a huge issue to be resolved, but it did take a significant amount of work from my office and a lot of work from the constituent to motivate Telstra to fix the problem.
Had my office not intervened in the issue, it could have continued on with little resolution. It is my understanding that the message relayed by Telstra in relation to the fault was not correct. The problem was not due—which they finally admitted—to local storms but to a lack of technicians to follow up on issues of concern. This underlines the point that there is already a lack of technicians who are from Telstra and that the sale of Telstra will not fix these problems. They should not exist. Telstra should be able to address these issues quickly and effectively. In fact, it would be fair to say that in this case Telstra made very little effort to rectify the problem. They had—and still have, as far as I am aware—no intention of making reparations to the family for the inconvenience and additional expense caused by this incident until my office intervened. Even then their compensation offer amounted to a paltry $30. To add insult to injury, the family is still expected to pay full line rental fees for the time the phone was inoperable. This instance alone gives rise to the belief by the opposition that, once control of Telstra is sold off, services to local communities will continue to deteriorate and no recourse will be available to clients of Telstra to fix these issues. The leaked internal Telstra document that was exposed by Labor several weeks ago proved conclusively in my mind that Telstra's services were anything but up to scratch. The document stated that Telstra's fault levels were soaring and that this was due to underinvestment in the network—and not due to the government's and Telstra's usual excuse of weather incidents. 
In my view, if the full transfer to privatisation goes ahead, intervention efforts by my office will not yield results. At least in this instance the constituent managed to have some recourse, to have the fault addressed and, eventually, to have the restoration of the phone line. In my view, it is unlikely that will happen under a fully privatised Telstra. Labor will fight to ensure that Telstra remains in majority government ownership. We will fight against its sale; instead, we will fight to deliver a decent standard of telecommunications services to all Australians. Interestingly, an excerpt from `Rear window' in the Australian Financial Review on the 10th of this month had the following to say about the sale of Telstra. I will quote it in full, because I think it is instructive. It is a little window of opportunity that this government should look at—
—A rear window.
—Perhaps `rear window' is a better description. Thank you, Whip. The article states:
The groan from investment bankers was almost audible yesterday, after another bad set of numbers for Prime Minister John Howard. This is a tragedy for the bankers, who were told to be ready to go on T3 “five minutes after the next election” if the Libs are returned. With this in mind, face time has been very valuable of late, given the fat fees possibly coming their way. “They [bankers] are always down in Canberra giving free advice,” one of our spies says.
The government should come clean on the reasons for the sale rather than lob this bill into the Senate again and hope for the best.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-03-30,"—The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 [No. 2] is one of the key reasons the government is currently in so much difficulty. The bill shows the extraordinary short-sightedness of the government and its preparedness to put ideology before good governance. The problem is that the government simply does not understand and does not realise that Telstra is not just another company; it is not just another asset to be sold to provide the funds for the next round of election promises. Telstra is different. Telstra owns a very valuable and increasingly vital piece of national infrastructure. The Australian people clearly understand this, which is why they continually reject the full sale of this public asset.
A very substantial percentage of any government's spending is on information technology. Yet we have a cabinet whose members are largely IT illiterate, a cabinet which has overseen $5 million being spent on one departmental web site and $4 million of taxpayers' money being spent on one minister's web site. Clearly, there is a lack of comprehension of the issues and of the waste involved here. We have a communications and information technology minister describing an enormous singularity in the balance of payments in IT as being `good for business' and failing totally to realise that IT is the business. 
The 2002 report by the Australian Computer Society showed a $14 billion black hole in Australia's IT imports compared to IT exports. The minister responsible said that this was `good for business'. What the government continues to fail to realise in this area is that IT is not just good for business; IT is the business. A brief comparison may help the government understand this. The current cash reserves of just one IT software company—admittedly the biggest—are sufficiently large to buy the entire unfunded superannuation debt of the entire department of primary industry. In addition, the cash reserves are set to grow with the company backing their own future with vast investments in research and development and guaranteeing their own place in the world. That is another lesson that this government would do well to learn.
The new minister seemed to take it as a mark of pride that he had no understanding at all of the allocation of at least 50 per cent and probably more of the previous minister's spending. He did not even have an email address so that someone could let him know that it might be a good idea to find out. The reason we are here today debating this legislation is to try to fix up another of the government's mistakes. Try as it might to blame the Senate or the Democrats, the problems with Telstra are of the government's own making and are the product of the government's complete failure to understand the technology which underscores all business today.
Telstra is a company in a mess. It is a company suffering from multiple personality disorder. It is an IT company which rushes out to buy a newspaper, yet it had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the large-scale supply of affordable broadband. It is a company which is half-owned by the government, which can afford to throw hundreds of millions of dollars at Foxtel and which can afford to buy the Trading Post newspaper, yet it worries that fibre to the home, or FTTH, is too expensive to provide. In countries such as Sweden, Holland and Japan, governments are encouraging companies to use fibre rather than copper. Where broadband and Foxtel are concerned, Telstra is also competing against itself—and it is they who are picking the winner rather than letting the market decide. I will return to that point later.
I do not want to address the whole issue of Telstra here. I can do no better than to recommend the excellent summation of the issue found in the minority report of the Senate inquiry from my colleague Senator John Cherry. For the purposes of my speech today I want to confine my comments to information technology and the supply of digital content. This is where the future lies. Should it be delivered the old broadcast way where the provider supplies not just the programming but the times that this programming will be available, or is it time to move into the new century and supply the content and empower the user? 
Digital TV is the way of the future; however, this does not mean that digital broadcast pay TV is the future—it is not. TV delivery using broadband technologies is the answer. The smoke and mirrors being flashed around by Foxtel at the moment are designed to conceal the fact that Telstra had a `reach' moment before investing in Foxtel too. Hundreds of millions of dollars later the people of Australia are being held hostage and denied new technology to enable Telstra to recover from its latest misunderstanding about the future direction of technology.
Let us compare the offerings of the new and much-vaunted Foxtel relaunch with the alternative style of delivery provided by Pacific Century CyberWorks. Currently Pacific delivers 26 TV channels, including sport, movies, Discovery and ABC Asia Pacific, at DVD quality via ADSL broadband over the phone line. Pacific already has close to 200,000 customers, and it expects that to reach half a million by next year. 
The Hong Kong experiment is being watched around the world not only as the future of television but also as the future of telecommunications. But Telstra is not interested in broadband TV for two reasons. The first is that Australia's ADSL network is far too slow. Hong Kong's ADSL runs at six megabits per second. Broadband TV needs 4.5 megabits and this leaves room for Internet surfing on the same line. Australia's ADSL runs at 1.5 megabits—and that is on a good day.
Another major difference is that Pacific's broadband TV is an a la carte service. With this service you pay for each channel separately, buying as few or as many as you want for between $2 and $7.50 a month. This contrasts with the minimum $49.95 package from Foxtel, which does not include the new movies or sport. To get the new movies and sport you have to subscribe to the $94.95 package. An a la carte competitor would be Foxtel's nemesis. This leads us to the second reason that Telstra is not interested in broadband TV—that is, that Telstra owns half of Foxtel.
What do you think customers would prefer: genuine programming on demand where they pay for only those programs they want to a maximum of $7.50 per month, or receiving the programs the provider wants to send to them at the minimum of $50 per month? We should let the market decide, not the accountants at Telstra. Admittedly, FTTH is a lot more expensive, but it would be a $15 billion investment in our future. It is an investment that must be made—and will be made. Telstra's reluctance is only delaying the inevitable. All of Australia, particularly business Australia, will suffer as a result of this delay.
The principal metric that the government set as a requirement before the sale was a decent level of service, but even Telstra's own spin doctors are forced into defensive mode on this issue. The recent results from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman show a disproportionately large number of complaints are to do with Telstra. In fact recent studies show that Telstra is consistently one of the worst performers in the area of customer service. The recent Whirlpool study conducted in October and November 2003 showed that, while three per cent found BigPond ADSL customer service to be excellent—and that was the lowest rate of any ISP—over 75 per cent found the service itself to be average to awful. In fact, this survey found there was only one company with a lower ranking: BigPond Cable. It should be noted here that only 5.3 per cent of respondents agreed with the statement that the government's broadband policies are a lot better than they used to be. The real noteworthy thing regarding this survey is the high proportion of experienced users it included. The general population can expect a much worse time of Telstra's service levels.
It is revealing to see Telstra's approach to this poor placing in the market. Does Telstra improve its service? Does Telstra attempt to contest the others by providing a better and cheaper service? We all know the answer to that, for even as we debate this issue Telstra is in receipt of a competition order. Rather than beat the others by improving its service, it used its market power to launch a predatory pricing regime to drive the better and cheaper providers out of the market.
I want to pause here to tell you of my own experience recently with Telstra's service. At home in Perth I had ADSL installed by Telstra. In the course of the installation the technician disconnected my home network. Then, rather than supply the equipment that is advertised as being part of the job, the technician simply used the pieces from my own, now destroyed, network for the installation. As a result of that I was denied access to my own data and could not use my own equipment.  
Telstra's response to my complaints was extraordinary. For a week Telstra refused to allow me access to my own equipment unless I paid a service fee of several hundred dollars. Despite Telstra's admission that the problem was of its own making, it still insisted on a full service fee to undo the original work. It took a total of 30 hours of time and energy to get Telstra to correctly perform the installation—which took fewer than four minutes by a properly trained technician.
Telstra has admitted that in 90 per cent of broadband installations Telstra does not supply the advertised equipment but rather just resumes control of the customer's equipment. When we challenged Telstra on this, rather than undertake to improve its service and agree to simply supply the equipment, it altered the Telstra web site to remove the promise to supply what is basically an essential piece of equipment. That action will result in the continued practice of commandeering the customer's own access and passing on an unnecessary cost to the customer to avoid its own responsibilities. However, I now have ADSL installed at home, and so far it seems to be working well.
Currently Telstra is overadvertising its expensive reiteration of the old technology, with the Foxtel partners having pumped another $500 million into the coffers, despite only 1,000 of the 5,000 exchanges in Australia having been ADSL enabled. This may suit the other Foxtel partners, but it puts Foxtel in direct competition with the role that BigPond should be in—namely, the delivery of digital content via broadband. To put it more clearly, Telstra does not see its interests as being the same as Australia's. If the future of Australia is to be handicapped to enable Telstra to deliver today's profit, then that is okay by Telstra, it is okay by this minister and it is okay by the government—but it is not okay with the people of Australia. They deserve better than the government is prepared to let them have.
Each year Australia drops further down the international digital access rankings. Each year that we fail to act makes it that much harder to begin working on the solution. It is time for the government to stop wasting its time and energy on this attempt to sweep a problem of its own making under the carpet and supposedly out of sight. It is time for the government to accept its responsibilities and ensure the supply of high-quality bandwidth to every Australian. It is time to break the digital divide and get broadband out into the bush. It is time to get service levels up to an acceptable level. But, instead, they are going downhill. As I said, it is time to break the digital divide and, most particularly, get services out into the bush. Most of all, it is time to get services up to an acceptable level. The time that we are debating the possible and future sale of Telstra is not the time to sell off the nation's vital infrastructure.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2004-03-30,"—I rise today to address the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 [No. 2]. Public ownership of Telstra is the only guarantee we have to ensure that all Australians, no matter where they live, are able to access essential, reliable and affordable telecommunications services. As I outlined the last time I spoke about this issue here in the Senate, Labor recognise that in the digital age Australians rely on telecommunications services as essential services. Unlike the Howard government, we do not view telecommunications services as luxury items that people could do without. Such a view is, in my opinion, ignorant and out of touch. 
We recognise that 21st century Australians rely upon telephones and broader telecommunications services as fundamental tools used in everyday, ordinary life. People use them to keep in touch with loved ones, families, friends, colleagues and acquaintances. We organise social lives with them. We consume and conduct business via them. We use them to access emergency services, educational services, help and advice. We undertake household chores, such as paying bills and dealing with government agencies and companies, with them. To suggest that telecommunications services are not fundamental in every aspect of Australian society is simply misleading. Everyone knows that they are.
For many years now, the Howard government has been hell-bent on fulfilling its ideological dream of fully privatising Telstra. It has been fattening it up for many years and has effectively allowed it to act as if it were already a company in full private hands. Under the watch of the Howard government, Telstra's performance in numerous areas of its operations has declined dramatically. Consumers have been hit with ever-escalating Telstra line rental fees, yet they have not been adequately compensated with reductions in call prices. Telstra's network has been deteriorating for some time, crippled by major investment reductions and mass staff cutbacks. Telstra's investments in Asia have backfired, resulting in enormous financial losses for the company and its shareholders. Telstra's roll-out and Australia's take-up of broadband technology, compared with equivalent countries, has been totally inadequate. Telstra has been operating in a market dogged by inadequate competition and has used—and some would argue abused—its market dominance and control of the fixed line network. These deficiencies have been exacerbated by inappropriate corporate behaviour, such as supplying $15,000 plasma televisions to the Prime Minister and the former Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, former Senator Alston, and offering Telstra's CEO a $1 million plus golden handshake if he were to be sacked—on top of his $7 million salary package.
Telstra's capital expenditure has been falling dramatically over the past few years. From a peak of $4.7 billion in 1999-2000, Telstra's financing of capital infrastructure fell to an estimated $3.25 billion in 2002-03, which represented a 30 per cent decline since 1999-2000 alone. Over the same time, more than 13,000 full-time staff have been slashed from Telstra's work force. A substantial proportion of these staff cuts have occurred in areas such as direct customer service and network maintenance, particularly in regional Australia. Moreover, as has been widely reported throughout the media, a growing number of Australian full-time IT jobs are being exported by Telstra to India. Surely this cannot be in the national interest. But it was the Howard government, as majority stakeholder, that gave Telstra the green light to send these jobs offshore many months ago. It is the Howard government, not only Telstra management, that is to blame for these poor business decisions. As I have already stated, the Howard government has been fattening up Telstra for full privatisation for many years now. It does not mind if it guts Australia's IT industry in the process. As a consequence of this and other staffing decisions, Telstra's services and service standards around the country, and in particular in rural and regional areas, have severely suffered. The Australian Communications Authority has conceded that 11 per cent of Telstra's services were faulty in 2003. Telstra's urban fault rectification performance is languishing, with 14 per cent of phone faults not fixed on time. 
These concessions come on top of leaked Telstra documents received by Labor which outline that faults in Telstra's network are at a six-year high; that the fault rate has been increasing since June 2001 and has accelerated in the last nine months of 2003; that the fault rate growth appears to be due to a general network deterioration rather than specific exceptional cause; and that the fault rate is climbing in both regional and metropolitan Australia. The documents also predict that the fault rate will continue to grow between now and mid-2005. On top of all the problems, customers have experienced massive price increases and, as all the facts would suggest, will continue to do so in the future.
Just three and a bit years ago, line rental costs stood at $11.65 per month. Today that figure has reached between $23.50 and $26.50 a month. In the next year or two, this charge is expected to rise to over $30 per month. So one can only conclude that, within the space of four or five years, the price for the privilege of having a phone in your home before you pay a single cent for a telephone call is going to soar to well over $400 a year if this rate of price increase continues. In the last half year Telstra's line rental revenue increased by $54 million, despite the number of Telstra rented lines having decreased marginally. With this coming on top of the $130 million Telstra made in extra revenue from the line rental increases in 2002-03, it is little wonder many customers are angry that service levels are far from adequate. Many are now complaining that they are paying more in line rental charges than in call costs.
Australians have every right to be concerned about what a fully privatised Telstra might charge customers in the future and the decisions they might make with respect to particular services offered today. As recent history has indicated, Telstra will continue to hike up line rental fees and has no problem doing this while winding back popular services. Telstra's reasonably recent decision to axe its 15c local neighbourhood call while continuing to raise line rental fees serves as a prime example of this practice.
Australians recognise that programs such as discount concession schemes for pensioners will be immediately abolished or scaled back if Telstra is fully privatised. Australians also know that a fully privatised Telstra will put enormous and irresistible pressure on the government to introduce timed local calls. Australians demand that Telstra operates and acts in their interest and in the national interest and that consumer interests are not subservient to Telstra's corporate interests.
Under this bill, as its title would suggest, ministerial power of direction over Telstra will be removed once the Commonwealth's equity falls below 50 per cent. This is an important power for the government to hold and use if Telstra acts in an inappropriate manner and refuses to remedy such action. Such power should not be given up. Under the proposal, Telstra will cease to be subject to the Freedom of Information Act and will no longer be required to provide employees with Commonwealth standard long service leave, maternity leave and occupational health and safety provisions. Telstra's reporting obligations will also cease once the Commonwealth's equity falls below 15 per cent. This means that Telstra will no longer have to provide the Commonwealth with financial statements or notifications of significant events. A privatised Telstra would no longer have to keep ministers informed on issues pertaining to the operation of the company. The government will lose all effective control over Telstra. 
As we know, for some time now the Howard government has pretended that the full sale of Telstra has been contingent upon it being `fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians'. But Australians know this is just another Howard government porky. Here again is legislation to bring about the full privatisation of Telstra and, by virtue of the Howard government, it again contends to the Australian people that services in rural and regional Australia are up to scratch. To do this is to play a harsh joke on people living all around Australia who know all too well that the realities of Telstra's performance are worlds away from this out of touch view.
The Howard government has spent a lot of time and money conducting sham inquiries into service levels in rural and regional Australia in order to extract at least one view favourable to its theory. The findings of these sham investigations, in line with Howard government policy, have come about despite hundreds of public submissions detailing actual poor experiences with Telstra. Hundreds of submissions have outlined instances of poor mobile phone coverage, faulty telephone lines, poor broadband coverage, inadequate dial-up Internet data speeds, constant Internet line drop-outs and many others.
The regional telecommunications inquiry—the Estens inquiry—launched in August 2002 was an absolute joke, and everyone knew it. The inquiry took place under the chairmanship of Mr Dick Estens, a National Party member and mate of the Deputy Prime Minister. It certainly came as no surprise to me or, I would suggest, to anyone who takes an interest in these matters that the committee came up with exactly the report the government wanted, and the very next day this bill was introduced into the parliament for the first time. Everyone knows that telecommunications services in the bush are not up to scratch. They are totally inadequate and continue to decline.
The Howard government's mantra was again disproved by the release the other week of the leaked Telstra documents I referred to earlier. There is widespread acceptance that, under a fully privatised Telstra, service levels in rural and regional Australia would at best remain stagnant but would more probably further decline. Either way, everyone knows that service levels in rural and regional Australia will not improve in any way under Telstra's full privatisation—not now and not in the future.
The bill provides for the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts or the ACA to make licence conditions requiring Telstra to maintain a local presence in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia. It also requires regular reviews of regional telecommunications every five years by an expert committee appointed by the minister. These provisions cannot be taken seriously. They are inadequate, hopeless and nothing more than a laughable attempt by the government to pull the wool over the eyes of Australians. But Australians know better than to fall for that Howard government trick again.
The future-proofing arrangements for regional telecommunications services in this bill offer absolutely no guarantee of reasonable future levels of service for regional Australians. A huge privately owned Telstra would dictate to the government what the licence conditions should be. Under full privatisation the government would have no role in Telstra whatsoever. That is the whole point of the bill. As for the provisions in the bill establishing an independent expert committee appointed by the minister, the last one of those was the Estens committee. Australians simply do not accept this government's notion of an independent committee following its track record in this regard. There is no guarantee of equitable service levels in rural and regional Australia if Telstra were fully privatised, and everyone knows it. 
Labor believes a privately owned Telstra would be a giant private monopoly too powerful for any government to effectively regulate. It would focus on the more lucrative markets in the bigger cities and neglect the interests of lower income and regional Australians. That is business. Under full privatisation, there would be no impetus or pressure upon Telstra to invest in new technologies and their roll-out. Under the control of the Howard government, Telstra's investment in new technologies has been totally inadequate. Australia's broadband take-up rate is languishing because of Telstra's indifference to it and inadequate competition in this area of the sector.
Over the past 2½ years, Australia has fallen from 13th to 20th in the OECD table depicting broadband access rates. Only 2.65 per cent of Australians had broadband access as at June 2003. This position has worsened since the same report was released at the end of 2002, when Australia ranked 19th out of the 30 OECD countries. According to the latest table, Canada has a per capita broadband access rate five times higher than Australia's. Korea's rate is nine times higher than Australia's. The EU's position is nearly twice as good. The OECD average is over twice as good, and the US's rate is over three times higher than Australia's. Whereas Australians have generally been at the forefront of adopting new technology, in broadband we are falling further and further behind the rest of the world and particularly the rest of the OECD countries. We cannot allow this trend to continue.
As the telecommunications industry moves from a voice framework to a data framework it is imperative that Telstra remains in public hands to ensure that all Australians have sound, practical and equitable access to future services such as broadband. Majority public ownership of Telstra will ensure that Telstra acts in the national interest as new services such as broadband are rolled out. It is essential that Telstra acts in the Australian national interest and focuses its activities in Australia and on its Australian customers.
Telstra's overseas losses in the vicinity of $2 billion have been extremely concerning, particularly for the many Australians experiencing faults with Telstra's traditional services in Australia today. It is an unacceptable situation that Telstra is allowed to squander billions of dollars on overseas markets while it makes cuts to its network investments and core staffing levels in Australia and continues to hike up customers' line rental charges. This situation is indicative of the misplaced priorities of Telstra under the Howard government and gives little heart to those concerned about where Telstra might concentrate its activities if and when it were to be fully privatised.
Telstra is a public asset and one that provides the Commonwealth with substantial annual share dividends. In 2002-03 alone, the Commonwealth derived around $1.7 billion in share dividends from Telstra. Over the past 10 years, the Commonwealth has reaped over $16 billion in Telstra dividends. Once Telstra is sold the Commonwealth will receive one more lump sum but, once in receipt of that, the taxpayer will lose any future dividend payable to Telstra shareholders. Labor has consistently argued that the Telstra sale will have negative longer term consequences for Commonwealth finances. The reduction in public debt interest will not offset the loss of dividends from Telstra in the medium term. Telstra remains essentially a public utility with pervasive monopoly characteristics. On simple economic grounds there is no justification for its privatisation. 
A majority publicly owned Telstra is the only effective means of guaranteeing universal telecommunications access for all Australians, especially for those in less profitable markets and areas. Labor want to see Telstra act as a builder, not a speculator. We want Telstra to be a carrier, not a broadcaster. Labor want to ensure that consumers receive the highest quality services, widest choice and cheapest and fairest prices possible. We want to ensure that consumers in regional and rural Australia have full access to communications services and that businesses have access to globally competitive and innovative communications services. We want to maximise employment in the communications and IT sectors and maximise competition, investment and innovation in Australia's communications networks.
Australia needs a telecommunications sector characterised by universal access, vigorous competition, rapid innovation and high-quality services delivered at the lowest possible prices. Labor has been the only party that has maintained a consistent, unambiguous and unequivocal opposition to any further sale of Telstra and is the only party with any real plan about how to get Telstra back on the job.
The Commonwealth's equity in Telstra must not fall below 50 per cent. Like the telcos in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Luxembourg, Norway, Pakistan, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey, Australia's Telstra must remain in public hands for the future benefit of all Australians. I call on the Senate to reject this bill and I look forward to the possibility of a double dissolution election being fought on and around this issue in particular.

"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2004-03-30,"—I rise again to speak on the sale of Telstra and the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 [No. 2]. I am not sure why we are here again. The government has returned the same bill to the Senate and just seems to be going through the motions. I have to ask: why are we doing this again? Let me repeat: this is exactly the same bill that was rejected last year. There have been no changes and no amendments. There is no material with the bill suggesting that service levels have improved or giving any insight as to what is happening with the recommendations from the Estens inquiry. There has been no effort to convince the chamber that it should change its mind. So why? One theory is that the government wants another double dissolution trigger, but it only needs one. It now has five or six. There are a number of industrial relations bills as well as the bill to increase the cost of medications under the PBS by 30 per cent. Why does it need another? 
Another theory is that the government is confident that it is on a winner here—that people actually want the rest of Telstra sold, that this bill will go into the basket with those other bills for a double dissolution and then they can all be put to a joint sitting after the government wins the election so that Telstra can be sold that way. Perhaps this bill is being introduced in the hope that it will go down and then the government can use our decision not to pass it to beat us over the head with: `Obstruction! Obstruction! Look how awful the Senate is. We need to reform it.' Another theory is that the bill has been put up once again because of Australia's obligations under the US free trade agreement. The 2002 US National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers Country Review addresses the trade obstacles that the US believes it faces from Australia. The report states: 
Serious concerns have been raised about the apparent inability of Australia's telecommunications regulator to curb alleged anticompetitive conduct by the government-owned Telstra Telecom including delays in access to its network and the inflated pricing of its wholesale services. Such conduct limits U.S. carriers' ability to compete effectively in this market. The United States continues to urge the Australian Government to privatize its 50.1 percent share of Telstra.
So perhaps there is some truth in that theory. What I do know is that it feels like Groundhog Day. However, I will deal with a couple of issues very quickly.
Firstly, competition is something the government puts a lot of faith in. But Telstra is simply too large and too powerful—it controls the infrastructure, which the other service providers have to access through Telstra. In its Emerging market structures in the communications sector reportthe ACCC identified that without competition between telecommunications providers it is likely that `networks will not be developed and used to their full potential', that high speed Internet will not be introduced as early as it should be and that `services will not be provided efficiently and at least cost for consumers'. So basically we do not have a competitive market.
As we all know, Telstra was recently caught retailing services at a price below the price Telstra Wholesale was charging other Internet providers for access to its network. Minister Williams says that the decision by:
... the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to issue a competition notice to Telstra last week is a perfect example of the regulatory framework at work.
Well, yes, the regulator is working, but how well is the ACCC able to work? I argue that the ownership of the infrastructure gives Telstra an absolutely impossible advantage over its supposed competitors. Government must step in as the majority shareholder and ensure fair competition is possible. That is one reason why we have left it in government hands. These structural impediments are not being adequately addressed by the regulatory regime. The ACCC simply does not have the power, so we do not have an effective competitive telecommunications market. We could give extra antitrust powers to the ACCC. We could restructure Telstra leaving just the network—the cables, the wires and the towers—in public hands and then let whoever wants to run services using those do so. If the government is not serious about ensuring a competitive telecommunications market then it is actually dangerous to allow the privatisation of Telstra.
The customer service guarantee is simply not good enough. Surely this government must agree that high-quality Internet services are not a luxury. I would go further and say that, for people in rural and regional Australia and outer metropolitan areas of our big cities, they are essential. For people who are trying to run a small business or to study, it is not a luxury to have reliable, speedy Internet access. All Australians, particularly those in rural areas who already face difficulties in accessing a range of services including education, health, banking and transport need access to e-health, e-education, e-banking et cetera. The more remote you are from our big cities, surely the greater the importance of these services. Unfortunately, it is the case at the moment that you are less likely to have access to the Internet. Rather than wait and hope that services improve, this government should do what other governments are doing around the world and insist on broadband services as the basic standard. In other words, it should redo the requirements for the universal service obligations, give Telstra and the other telcos 10 years to get the infrastructure in place—basically, it will be over to Telstra—and insist that it is done properly. At present it seems that there is little pressure on Telstra to meet current standards, so they do very little. 
Everybody has their own horror stories. In my state it seems that we get `sticky tape' telecommunications infrastructure. I will give an example of a place in the south-east of South Australia. For the benefit of the Hansard I will describe these four photographs. They show the telephone line coming in running along the road, outside of any plastic container. It then goes into an old white plastic pipe and is hung across the street, suspended partly on either side of the bridge. The piping is not attached at either end. These photos were only taken last month. This has apparently been the case now since 2000, and the person whose phone this is has argued again and again with Telstra—they actually had workmen near the site in 2003 and still it was not fixed. Once the cable gets to the other side of the creek it re-emerges from the old white piping and runs across the open ground before eventually disappearing under the road.
If that were an isolated case, perhaps we could simply sort it out. But it is case after case, from place after place, and it is a disgrace. Stories have come to me in the last few months, as this bill has been put back on the public agenda, from Orange in New South Wales, from southern parts of New South Wales and from all across South Australia. These are complaints about basic phone services, let alone Internet access. There is no chance of doctors who cannot even get a reliable phone getting access to telemedicine. 
In light of the growing concerns about service levels and wanting to find out how people felt, particularly how people in South Australia felt, I surveyed around 120,000 people, asking them what they thought about the sale and about what should generally be done. I had thousands of responses. It may take a month, certainly a few weeks, to go through those. At the moment I am only reading letters that have accompanied the survey returns, and they paint a very bleak picture indeed of enormous frustrations with Telstra and very real concerns about what would happen with full privatisation. With the same bill and the same if not worse service standards, with the very real concerns raised by many who have responded to our survey, with no debate or discussion whatsoever by the government about what is going to happen to the money and no discussion about the nation building opportunities or the chance to do some real good in the Murray-Darling Basin and on other environment programs, my vote will simply be no, again.
Where to now? All the reports indicate that much of our nation's telecommunications infrastructure is old, dilapidated, out of date and in need of extensive refurbishment. Surely this tells us that we need to think ahead to develop information networks that can transport voice, data, images and information. Australia has yet to establish a telecommunications policy that will allow the orderly introduction of such an information highway. Consumers are demanding more bandwidth and higher quality broadband capacity. They do not want what I would call Telstra's information cart way. In fact, in some places it is becoming more like a goat track. I liken it to refusing to upgrade the road networks and leaving in place the old road over the Blue Mountains that followed the footsteps of Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth or to leaving forever the old road over Eagle on the Hill through the Adelaide Hills that linked Melbourne to Adelaide. Australians need an information highway that can become a superhighway. Consumers well and truly understand the advantages of an information superhighway in the form of a network that is able to support full video-on-demand services. We are certainly a long way from that. 
Telstra offers Internet access often just via a run-down phone network. It has equated the term broadband with DSL, or ordinary phone lines, but these phone lines are at best a partial and limited interim option for providing Internet services and more. There are other ways to open the doors to a real broadband future. We can make a major investment in new national fibre-optic cable network along Canadian lines. We can emphasise access to broadband through the use of high bandwidth and remote access wireless systems. We can develop satellite technology that will provide everyone—from large corporations to the householder—with affordable access to an array of high-speed, multimedia products. Broadcasting and telecommunications, which a few decades ago seemed entirely different operations, are now converging. A few decades ago, the telephone seemed very much a different service from radio or television. But today television signals, telephone conversations and exchanges between computers are all routinely carried out by cable, fibre optics, microwave and satellite. We have to prepare for this future. We cannot hang onto copper wires.
What sorts of telecommunications will we need? One guide is e-medicine, and we can see the enormous potential that that provides us with. For that to work successfully it needs an information network that can support full video-on-demand services. Australian movie and TV program producers may need to join forces with telephone companies and install centrally switched, fibre-optic, star networks that support full video-on-demand services. I say to the government: let us not have another `sale of the rest of Telstra' bill but let us look at what Australia and Australians need to get access to information; to get access to the bank that is no longer just down the road; to get access to education resources; to communicate with universities, TAFE colleges or schools; to enable people, regardless of where they live, to submit assignments instantly; to instantly communicate with children and grandchildren who live not just in this country but around the world; and to have the latest medical opinion and treatment options, even though the specialist is 400 or 500 kilometres away. Let us look around the world and expand our horizons from `to sell or not to sell' to arguing about what we should do to get ourselves a real, national, up-to-date communications strategy. Then we can have the debate about how to fund it.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-03-30,"—I have not heard one new argument in the debate on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 [No. 2] which would influence my strongly held belief, expressed both inside this place and outside on every occasion the matter of the full sale of Telstra has been raised, that the majority holdings in Telstra should not be taken out of public hands. That has been my view and it remains my view in the absence of any very clear and influential arguments to the contrary.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-30,"—The debate on the full privatisation of Telstra has had a lot of airing, so I will attempt to be brief. I do not think I can be as brief as Senator Harradine, the previous speaker, but I shall try. The Democrats, as will be no surprise to anybody, are opposed to the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 [No. 2] and will vote against its second reading. We believe the fundamental principle behind enabling the further privatisation of Telstra is flawed. Our party's record on the issue of privatising significant public assets has been consistent and clear over a long period of time. That is in marked contrast to the approach of the Labor Party, which when it was in government established a record of privatising major public assets unparalleled by any other government in our history, and it did so often without signalling its intention at the previous election. 
—The Commonwealth Bank.
—Of course the Commonwealth Bank stands out as perhaps the largest of those public assets which were sold, and we think in many ways we are still bearing the consequences of that negative decision. There are plenty of other examples of public assets being privatised under the previous Labor government. However, Labor's position now matches that of the Democrats—that is, that Telstra should not be further privatised and ideally should not have been privatised at all. Unfortunately the Democrats were not able to prevent the sale of the first two tranches of Telstra, but we retain our opposition to enabling the sale of Telstra for the same reason that we opposed previous privatisations of significant public assets: we believe the federal government should not divest itself of a major and valuable public asset unless it can be clearly demonstrated that it is in the public interest to do so. That has clearly not been done in relation to Telstra. As Senator Harradine said, there has been no advance in making that justification since this bill was brought on the first time around, last year.
It is in the government's power to bring forward bills for debate in whatever order they wish but, frankly, they are wasting the Senate's time by bringing forward this legislation when they know that the Senate will oppose it. There has been no change in the circumstances surrounding the debate that would in any way change the position of the Senate. Therefore we are spending time debating this bill because we have to—because the government have brought it on. The sale of Telstra is an important public issue. If it is brought on for debate, it is appropriate that we treat it with the interest that many in the public expect. But do not let us hear the government say, as I am sure they will over the course of the rest of this week: `We don't have enough time. The Senate's chewing up time. It has delayed everything. It's holding things up. We can't get our legislative program through.' I am sure we will hear all of those arguments over the next couple of days, given that this is the last sitting week for five weeks before the budget, but the fact is that a whole day has been needlessly spent on this legislation. The government made that happen. They cannot in any credible way complain about not having enough time to advance their legislative agenda, when they fill up the time with legislation that has already been rejected.
The government will use this opportunity to bring out the same tired old myths about Senate obstructionism and the Senate getting in the way of the government's mandate. In the Democrats' view, there is no way at all that that argument can be sustained. The facts and the statistics speak quite clearly. Less than three per cent of all of the legislation that has been put before the Senate by this government has failed to pass the Senate. There have been well over 300 bills passed in the last two and a bit years. That is an enormous amount of legislation, and it places an enormous responsibility on the Senate to deal with that workload. Not only have we passed all of those bills but we have actually improved a significant number of them through amendment. The Democrats did not support all of those bills and, quite frankly, we believe that the country would have been better off if they had not passed, but that is what democracy is all about. Some of the bills passed because the majority view of the Senate was that they should, despite the Democrats not agreeing with them. The government should remind itself from time to time of that basic fact of democracy. The Senate is practising democracy—that is, ensuring that the majority view prevails. 
The Senate is elected in a representative fashion much more so than the House of Representatives. The fact is—and I do not think even the government would pretend otherwise—that the majority of people do not support the further sale of Telstra. This bill is about to be rejected a second time and is thus about to become another double-dissolution trigger. In the Democrats' view, this is not a case of a parliamentary deadlock. A deadlock implies an unresolved situation, and this has been resolved. The Senate has resolved it by deciding the bill should not pass. If the government wants to get a different resolution, it can put it to the people via a double-dissolution election. That is the mechanism that has been in place in our Constitution for over 100 years. If the government genuinely wants to find a different resolution, it has an avenue open to it.
It is worth taking the opportunity to note the Prime Minister's brief movement into public debate about other mechanisms to deal with circumstances where the government cannot get legislation through the Senate. The Prime Minister phrased it as resolving Senate deadlocks. I think the word `deadlock' is misleading because it implies that something is not resolved or that it is stuck. Clearly in this circumstance nothing is stuck. The bill will be thrown out, therefore a resolution will occur. That is simply a resolution that the government does not like. So it tries to portray it as something negative, whereas I think the majority of the public would see it as something positive, a result that they believe is desirable.
The Prime Minister put forward some other ways of dealing with such situations. Last year, I think it is fair to say, there was not overwhelming public interest in that—in fact, there was no public support at all. The Democrats nonetheless engaged in that process because we believe it is worthwhile debating all of our parliamentary and political processes to look for ways to improve things. We put forward another model to deal with legislation not being passed through the Senate where the government wanted to progress it. The basis was to have a referendum rather than a double-dissolution election. Before people say that that is some whacky, newfangled modern idea, I hasten to add that, at the constitutional conventions in the 1890s, it was one of the serious proposals put forward to deal with these sorts of situations. It is a shame that it was not adopted at that time. It would not only have enhanced democracy by giving the public a direct say on issues where the two houses of parliament are not able to reach agreement, but it would be a clear test of the word `mandate' that is thrown about a lot.
The government like to say it has a mandate because they were elected, that they should be able to pass whatever bill they feel like and that the Senate's job is to just let it happen. That is not the Senate's job. The evidence is quite clear that the public supports the Senate's job of reviewing what the government puts forward. It is only on the rare occasion—certainly since the Democrats have held the balance of power in the Senate—that legislation does not pass, but this is certainly one of those circumstances. Less than three per cent is a fairly good strike rate for the government, I would suggest. It has always been around that level throughout the more than 20 years the Democrats have held or shared the balance of power in various forms since 1981. Of course, the only time the level did get up to what most people would see as dramatically unacceptable was in 1975, when a huge proportion—I think it was one in four pieces of legislation, not the least of which was supply—was not able to pass through the Senate chamber. That is obstructive. What we have now is nothing like that. What we have now is a responsible Senate. 
In my view, it makes the case yet again for why it is important to have the Democrats as a responsible party where they hold the balance of power and are able to make judgments and do basic tests about whether legislation should be halted or opposed, whether legislation should be passed or improved by amendment, and whether it is a positive overall net gain for the public or a move backwards. 
In the last few months there have been a few other circumstances where the Democrat view has been that legislation that passed through this place has been a net move in the wrong direction—one being university fees, the other being the undermining of the universality of Medicare. From my point of view, this makes the case yet again for why it is better to have the Democrats holding the clear balance of power to make those judgment calls correctly. Either way, not only is it the right of the Senate but it is the responsibility of the Senate to consider legislation and, where it believes it is inappropriate, to reject it. I do not really care how much the government wants to moan, squeal and kick about so-called Senate obstructionism. It is not obstructionism; it is the Senate acting responsibly. It is not a deadlock; it is a resolution. I am pleased to say that the resolution that this legislation be thrown out is one which the Democrats support and agree with.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2004-03-30,"—I wish to say a few brief words on the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 [No. 2] to ensure that the minister does not become too exasperated with the situation. The government only has itself to blame and, I think, Minister Minchin, you should take your exasperation out on your government for bringing this piece of legislation back into the parliament. The legislation was not too well explained in the first attempt to pass it. I am almost tempted to vote it through to the Committee of the Whole to see whether we can get a better explanation but, on the face of it, I think that would be highly unlikely. I will not repeat some of the very important and well made statements by the speakers. I am curious about Telstra's approach in more recent times and about whether it knows what it wants to be—a media company or a telecommunications service provider. 
Since the sale of the first tranche of Telstra, it has become clearer, in the interests of the general public in this country, that we must have a company looking after the network infrastructure and providing good telecommunications services and that that must be done from a competitive point of view. It is fairly clear from evidence that Telstra has taken many actions and has been caught out on a number of occasions for being anticompetitive, the most recent being on broadband pricing. 
This government—and any government in the future—needs to have a long hard look at exactly what it wants to do to ensure that this country has good telecommunications services and has the type of infrastructure that can provide those services to world's best practice and standards. We do not have that now. There is no indication that Telstra would deliver that in the future—in fact, quite the contrary. The network and the network infrastructure, in many aspects, are in need of a significant upgrade. If Telstra were privatised, it would probably continue down the same road that it is going down at the moment—that is, it would be interested in generating more profit for its shareholders. That is a responsible thing to do as a private company but, as a government and as a parliament, we have a responsibility to ensure that such a fundamental aspect of life in this country is going to be delivered in the future. 
It is interesting to note that the government said that it had responded to the Estens inquiry and had agreed with or was implementing all 39 recommendations of the Estens report. I posed one question to the new Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts with regard to one aspect of the 39 recommendations—recommendation 9, I think—which went to the question of ongoing funding for infrastructure and service provision, particularly for rural, regional and remote Australia, where the infrastructure needed to be upgraded from a technological point of view. The Estens report suggested that a significant fund should be set up and that the fund would be ongoing. I have yet to hear how the government even proposes to provide the funds either now or in the future, and I still have not received an answer to that question from the minister. For that reason and a long list of other reasons, I am unable to support the bill at this time.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2003 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2004-03-30,"—In the interests of brevity and perhaps having a resolution to the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2003 [No. 2] before question time, I will be extremely brief. I reiterate the government's profound disappointment that the Senate refuses to see the importance of the government being given the authority to sell its remaining shares in Telstra—a profound public policy issue for Australia. I think the Senate is failing to recognise that Telstra—whether other senators like it or not—now has 1.7 million ordinary shareholders, who own 49.9 per cent of the company. It is a fully listed public company. It is Australia's biggest commercial enterprise, required by this parliament to operate commercially and in a businesslike fashion. 
The Senate is now putting Telstra in the impossible position of having the government as the majority shareholder with millions of ordinary shareholders also on its books. It is an impossible position for the company and an impossible position for the government. Inherent in my position as Minister for Finance and Administration—and as one of the two ministerial shareholders—is my responsibility to maximise the value of this company and to get the best result for those shareholders who are conscripted to own half the company, while it is the job of the other shareholder minister who is the regulator, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, to regulate the whole industry in the interests of all 90 competitors that Telstra has in this very important industry.
That is an impossible conflict of interest for the government, which was recognised by the former Labor government when it sold the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. Of course, now that it is in opposition it has the luxury of hypocrisy. Despite recognising the wisdom of governments not owning things like airlines and banks when they were in opposition, they do not see that same wisdom in this government not owning telecommunications companies that are in competition with a whole range of other companies. It is ridiculous for the government to have $30 billion tied up in a telephone company in a very fast moving industry which is subject to very rapid technological change. I hope and pray that the value of Telstra does not erode in any way but, having lived in a state where the government of the day owned a very large enterprise—called the State Bank of South Australia—which ended up with taxpayers wearing the then biggest loss in the history of the commercial world in Australia, the perils of taxpayers being forced into public ownership of government business enterprises of this kind have been evidenced by that recent Australian experience. 
The government's role is to regulate telecommunications, not to own or half-own one of the companies in the industry. Under the Constitution, the government has a full array of legal recourse to ensure the proper regulation of this industry without owning half the company and to ensure that the community is properly serviced through the mechanisms of universal service obligations, customer service guarantees or proper tenders for the provision of services which may not be able to be provided on a commercial basis. So there is a full array of capacity to ensure the proper servicing of Australians regarding telecommunications without the unsustainable conflict of interest that is inherent in the government owning such a company. If Labor ever gets back into government, I am sure they will move to sell Telstra. There is no doubt about that because they will—as they were previously—be mugged by reality and know that the government cannot sustain ownership of this company. In the interest of brevity, I conclude my remarks and move that the bill be adopted.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2004-03-30,"—Senator Collins has been here long enough to know you do not ask such stupid, hypothetical questions like that. What the Australian public wants to know is: what is the Labor Party going to do about increasing participation in the work force? We have 2.7 million Australians of working age who are on income support. What we want to do—now that we have put the economy in a shape that means we have now increased the number of jobs by 1.3 million—
—You claim you've already done that, but there are still children in poverty.
—We do not want to do what Labor was doing—spending the next generation's money rather than building for the future. In your last year of government, you spent $10 billion. You had one million people unemployed; you had no opportunities. Now the government have created almost 1.3 million jobs, we can encourage people to be in the work force. For women whose youngest child is under 13, we have personal assistants to help them at Centrelink. As I said yesterday, I sat with some of those personal assistants working throughout the Sydney area and heard that some of these women say that, for the very first time in their lives since they have had children, somebody is talking to them about what they might do with their lives—somebody is taking an interest in them. It never happened under Labor.
—The number of children has grown by 20,000; there are 20,000 more children in jobless families.
—Senator Collins keeps shouting across the chamber. If she has got something to say, she should—
—Order! Ignore the interjections and address your remarks through the chair.
—I am actually answering a question. Senator Collins has had her chance to ask the question. What we are doing is giving people opportunities, giving hope to people who have children under 16 and whose youngest child is over 13. We expect these people to make some contribution back to the community in the form of volunteering. We also have legislation before the Senate to encourage people who are on a disability pension to participate in the work force. This legislation provides that if people moving onto the disability support pension are assessed as being capable of being employed we are able to give them the opportunity to do so by spending $258 million on them—and those who are currently on the DSP, if they choose to participate in the program—to assist them back into the work force. That is what we are doing. But what do Labor do? If they have not got a policy, they concoct a conspiracy, they manufacture a myth and they scaremonger. That is Labor's tactic. They concoct a conspiracy or manufacture a myth—like Mr Swan, who goes around telling half-truths all the time.
Opposition senator—There is no concoction there!
—You just wait about that document!
—Order! Minister, please address your remarks through the chair.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Oh yes! 
—Senator Patterson, please address your remarks through the chair.
—They wave around a document that a person has leaked, in breach of the law, but they do not worry about using it. We have a program to give people choice and opportunity. Labor has no policies. Mr Swan runs around telling half-truths, misconstruing everything everyone says, manufacturing things, concocting conspiracies and scaremongering. That is all he is capable of. What he needs to do is get on and develop some policies so the Australian public knows what the Labor Party's position is on assisting the 2.7 million people who are on income support and how it is going to give them the opportunity and choice to get back into employment.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Social Welfare: Pensions and Benefits</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer

I am going to talk about our policy. Our policy, unlike Labor's, is to create jobs. We will not borrow from the future to create jobs, but we will create 1.3 million jobs. Senator Collins needs to hear this: we will create almost 1.3 million jobs. Then we will encourage people to get into those jobs and to move from welfare to work. That is the most important thing we can do: create jobs and get the economy in a shape where we can assist people to move from welfare to work.

Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
The government is on track to meet the Prime Minister's commitment to invest $350 million between 2002/2003 and 2006/2007 from the Natural Heritage Trust extension in measures to improve water quality.
Monies under the second phase of the Natural Heritage Trust are largely invested according to the regional strategic plans in 56 regions across Australia.
As of 24 March 2004, $37.6 million has been approved from the Trust for expenditure directly on measures to improve water quality. This is approximately 11 % of the promised $350 million.
This does not include more than $19 million in investment the Government has recently approved in NSW and Victoria which is still being assessed for its contribution to this commitment.
Substantial further funds will flow as regional investment strategies are accredited. The Government will have approved investment strategies for most natural resource management regions nationwide by June 2004.
The Government is also spending money to improve our water quality through a number of other programs.
The National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality will provide $700 million in Australian Government funding (matched by the States and Territories) to tackle salinity and water issues
Some $170 million in National Action Plan funds has already been spent on projects such as the Upper South East Program in South Australia—where $19.15 million of Australian Government money is flowing to key priorities such as internationally significant wetlands.
The Living Murray Works and Measures Program, with total funding of $150 million over 7 years (a quarter of which is paid by the Australian Government), is working to improve environmental water management through infrastructure improvement. This year the Government has also provided almost $5 million to the Commission for managing the shared water resources of the Murray Darling Basin.
In relation to the Great Barrier Reef Wetland Protection Program, the Government has committed to ensure funding for the program at the level of $16 million over five years, with $1 million to be spent in the 200312004 financial year. Thus far $376,000 has been expended/committed in this financial year.
Correspondence from Minister Truss to Senator Andrew Bartlett of 11 December 2003 stated that: “The program will establish, through a process involving independent scientific advice, and inventory and assessment of wetlands that would include identification of areas of greatest risk as a high priority for the early stage of the package's implementation. The inventory process will also establish a target area of wetland protection for the program. It will also include the development of criteria and priorities for management and restoration of wetland areas. It is expected that the inventory and assessment will be complete within 12 months.”
The Government's progress on the program is consistent with this commitment, with activities underway to support the development of the inventory and incentive measures, program elements such as monitoring and evaluation; and a communication strategy.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-03-30,"—During question time on 25 March 2004, Senator Greig asked me a question about trafficking persons, and I undertook to provide further information. I seek leave to incorporate that further information in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Comprehensive victim support is available to all persons identified by the Australian Federal Police as potential victims of trafficking for a period of up to 30 days while the person is on a Bridging Visa F. During this time, the potential victim has access to the kinds of support set out in Senator Patterson's answer in the Senate on 23 March 2004. During this period of up to 30 days, the Australian Federal Police conducts further inquiries into case. If the AFP then determines that the victim is required to assist its investigation (and any subsequent prosecution), and the victim is willing to remain in Australia, then the victim transfers to a Criminal Justice Stay Visa and continues to receive victim support under the interim program in place now, or, once finalised, the permanent program described by Senator Patterson. The Government's package of measures to combat trafficking in persons includes a reintegration project being designed and implemented by AusAID to link victims returning to key source countries in South East Asia with similar services in those countries.
Further details can be sought from Senator Patterson, the Minister responsible for provision of victim support.
In relation to Senator Greig's question on the communication awareness campaign, I can advise that as part of its commitment to eliminating the problem of trafficking in persons, the Australian Government is undertaking a domestic communication strategy. The strategy comprises four stages over four years at a total cost of $0.4 million from the Government's overall $20 million package of anti-trafficking initiatives announced on 13 October 2003. The tender process for stage one, exploratory and developmental research, is now underway. In accordance with Australian Government requirements for communication activities, five consultants have been selected and asked to submit a proposal. They were selected because of their experience and expertise in social marketing on sensitive topics and to hard-to-reach audiences. Project Respect is not a specialist in the development of communication activities and does not have expertise in social marketing. The successful tenderer will be assisted by a specialist project advisory group and will be required to directly consult and liaise closely with key non-government organisations. 
The Australian Government consulted Project Respect during the development of its package of anti-trafficking initiatives. I met with representatives of Project Respect and other non-government organisations to seek their views.
I acknowledge the valuable work undertaken by Project Respect and other non-government organisations on trafficking in persons. We are continuing to consult with non-government organisations, including Project Respect, on the implementation of the Australian Government's anti-trafficking initiatives.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Immigration: People-Smuggling</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2004-03-30,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Patterson) to questions without notice asked today relating to family and community services.
You can tell when the government is feeling particularly uncomfortable by the character of the answers provided in question time. Today Senator Patterson followed the trend she set yesterday, with ongoing insults and a lack of preparedness to address the question—for instance, the silly statement that I was not able to read budget papers. Senator Vanstone had a doozey when she felt threatened in the past. I think she said that we played patience during Senate estimates. These indicate how threatened the government feels about this cabinet-in-confidence document. It is perhaps time that we focused on a little more of the detail of this document. This is no hypothetical plan that we have been referring to. This plan is a comprehensive, detailed plan about how to make significant cuts to the minister's budget. For every one dollar extra she asks for recycled programs, she proposes $2 in cuts. This is at a time when other countries are saying that they need to invest more in particular areas within her portfolio in order to make savings in other areas for the long-term future and benefit of their nations. Can this approach be applied by this government? No. We have a very narrow, short-sighted approach of making additional cuts.
Perhaps the incomprehensible aspect of this plan, though, is that it has surfaced in the immediate pre-budget stage. That element is completely incomprehensible. The only thing that helps explain the element of the plan detailed in the document is that the government, at the same time, talks about coming out with its election sweeteners through a national agenda for early childhood and a national agenda for youth, which are still yet to be outlined.
I made some mention yesterday of the national agenda for early childhood, which we have been waiting for now for five years. We are continuing to wait for the long-term benefits that could be reaped by an adequate strategy, while our children continue to suffer. But in this document we find that the same applies to a youth strategy. Two years ago cabinet asked for a youth strategy. This week is Youth Week, but we still have no youth strategy. There is no goal, no strategy, as Senator Patterson sought to reflect on in her answer to Senator Forshaw's question about Auslan. There is no goal, there is no strategy, other than further cuts.  
I agree with Senator Patterson that, if we can give people jobs, often they will be far better off. But we are not talking about `work till you drop'. We are not talking about trying to ensure our future financial viability by making the aged and disabled work until they drop. If this government were serious about these areas, we would not face the problems that we face today. We would not have the problems that we have had with the Job Network and its inability to deliver jobs to the long-term unemployed. We would not have an outcome, such as an additional 20,000 Australian children living in jobless households. But that is what this government has delivered. Senator Vanstone talked about outcomes for our Indigenous children. Those outcomes have worsened because we have no strategy. The most alarming thing about this document is it further highlights that there is no strategy. The only strategy that Senator Patterson in her new role in this portfolio has put forward to cabinet is further cuts—cuts without the support, incentives and services to help people such as single parents and the disabled into jobs, without assisting in generating the types of jobs these people could move into in order to further their wellbeing. None of those things are provided in this statement; just further examples of how more and more cuts could be made.
Senator Patterson accuses Mr Swan of comparing apples with pears. That is what she did in question time today. At the last election the government offered $2 billion in family payments. But we know through Senate estimates that $1 billion of that was a massive underspend and was never delivered. She should be held accountable for these things.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2004-03-30,"—Mr Deputy President, you and I must have a feeling of deja vu. Here we are, yet again, debating the same issue as yesterday on the same basis, a motion to take note by the same silly proponent. It is very silly. There is no way in which one can look at this whole debate and say that this is not mischief-making. Senator Patterson was quite right in identifying that Senator Collins and many of her colleagues, particularly Mr Swan, do not know how to read budget papers. It is simple—game, set and match. They demonstrate it day in and day out. Senator Collins has come in here for the second time in a row—and she is stalking out of the chamber now; she is not even interested to know the response nor does she have the courtesy to wait for the response. The same proposition is put forward time and time again: that there are some cuts that are going to be made. As I said yesterday, this is all about the Labor Party taking the Graham Richardson line: `Do whatever it takes to win government. Do whatever it takes. Don't let truth get in the road. Don't let your concern about the less privileged in society worry you, because whatever it takes we'll make sure we win government.' 
This is a classic example. Mr Swan has it wrong again. Senator Collins has it wrong again. The entire opposition in all their questions today have it wrong again, but they do not care. They do not listen to the answers. More importantly, they have these inane supplementary questions written before the answer is even given. They do not have the wit or the intelligence to look at the supplementary and say: `There was an answer given to this question; maybe I should not ask this supplementary question.' They just carry on. I remind you that this government has increased pensions, this government has lowered the inflation level; this government has reduced unemployment; this government has reduced interest rates; and, this government has introduced carer payments. It is all to do with the benefits that this government's strong economic management has provided. Yet not once are the opposition prepared to accept that as realistic and factual. They cannot read the budget papers. They do not know or understand how to even put a budget together, let alone read the budget papers.  
We have Mr Swan and the Labor Party coming out time and time again saying that there are going to be cuts. The idea of a common working age payment is not new. Senator Collins cannot get her head around that. She was not even able to read the McClure report, which was released in August 2000. I suppose that is back in the Stone Age for Senator Collins. We cannot possibly put the fibs that have been told now back to the McClure report, because it would be irresponsible of any government not to consider the options with regard to welfare. This government is not—and has never been—about cutting payments. This government has increased payments.
When you look at some of the statistics that I mentioned yesterday, you can see that this government has increased the real level of family support pensions. This has meant an average increase in disposable incomes for low-income households of eight per cent after inflation. The Labor Party could not get anywhere near that. Pensions have increased by 32 per cent for single and partner pensions under this government—32 per cent after Labor left office, and here they are talking about this government being the one to make cuts. They are the ones who did not ever increase pensions. Low-income working families are better off, which is apart from the wage increases made possible by greater employment. Let us face it, there is one important statistic: this government has provided more full-time jobs in the last six months—1.2 million of them—than the Labor government provided in the last six years of their government. If I were them, I would be ashamed of that statistic, but here they are coming in here yet again making false accusations.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2004-03-30,"—It is clear that we are not going to achieve any sense of agreement on this process. The minister made that clear in her first answer this afternoon when she said it was not her job to answer any stupid questions. In answer to a supplementary question further down the way the minister said that the problem with the people on this side of the house was that we could not understand detail, that we were always going over the top. It seems to me that the role of any effective opposition is to ask specific questions to try to find out exactly what the details of proposed policies are. It is not good enough just to throw questions and strong numbers across the chamber and it is certainly not good enough to cover up any attempt to answer with personal abuse. It is very disappointing, in fact to quote the minister, `almost despicable', to descend to this level in this debate.
The role of the opposition in this place at this particular point, looking at the very important issue of family and community services, is to attempt to discover exactly what the government has planned for the budget, to ensure that we are able to find out the way the payments—that the minister is seeking to give to us—will be implemented, not the rhetoric, not the way the media releases will be put out but rather to see what the government's plans are, looking at the real issue of payments. It is not good enough to say what policies have been because we have seen in this place that this government has attempted, through a number of social security-Centrelink policies to cut back payments, to actually impose greater penalties and to cut back on the very people in the community who are crying out most for support. 
These issues were raised quite clearly in the recent Senate poverty inquiry, where, on this particular issue of family support, of payments to those in our community who most need them, the concerns of the people working in the field were raised about people who are relying on the government to provide that security for them into their future. Over the past few months we have seen the implementation or attempted implementation of increased penalties, of breaching, of cutting back the way that taxation operates, in the whole way of secure payments for the people with the most need. This is instead of being able to work together to develop an effective policy, to genuinely look at the issues—and this is the minister who said that it was going to be her aim to go out and work with the people who are currently receiving payments—to sit down with those people and listen to their concerns and find out what the real needs are.
They are the people who are asking what is going to happen to their payments in the next six months, in the next two years. They need to know what is happening to their families now but they also need to have security into the future. There are always concerns about possible reductions in social welfare payments. That is not new. As Senator Knowles has pointed out, many of these concerns and many of these proposals about social welfare are not new. It is part of this process. People are constantly searching to find better ways to balance the budget and ensure that people do have opportunities that move them off complete welfare into the work force. That is something on which we agree.
We have to know how that is going to work for people, for families. Exchanging abuse—in fact, saying that people on different sides of the house cannot understand budget papers, cannot read and would struggle to understand the welfare system—does not achieve a solution. All that does is show that people are covering up and are not prepared to respond effectively to direct questions. When Senator Patterson talks about the very questions that we are asking—the very questions by which we are trying to find out what is going to happen to the social welfare system in this country—and she accuses us of scaremongering, of carping, of conspiracy hunting, she should know that the best way to ensure that that does not happen is to be open with the direction of the policy, with how the policy is going to work and by trying to engage all of us in coming up with a solution rather than being involved in unnecessary and quite capricious scaremongering and despicable name-calling.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Social Welfare: Pensions and Benefits</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2004-03-30,"—Senator Moore attempts to introduce a somewhat high-minded element into this debate by suggesting that the Australian Labor Party is just trying to uncover the facts, to have a debate about what we should be doing with Australia's welfare system, just to see what is going on. If you were interested in simply getting to the facts, you would not be engaged in the scare campaign of which this debate is an integral part. You would not be running around suggesting seriously that the government is about to slash and burn the welfare entitlements of thousands of Australians as part of your quest to find out what is going on in our system. I do not know what is going on in cabinet at the moment; I do not know what is being prepared for this coming budget but let me take a step backwards and imagine what might be happening. 
We have a government which has a record of increasing the effectiveness of Australia's welfare safety net. Throughout its eight years in office it has consistently increased the effectiveness and efficiency of that welfare safety net. It has improved the standard of living of Australians by such things as improving real wages, reducing inflation, increasing employment opportunities and increasing growth. Now we are expected to believe that in this, an election year, we are about to get stuck into concessions and benefits which are available to Australians.
I am sorry, but you people are either very naive or have a less than creditable agenda under way to attempt to scare Australians about what is likely to happen in the coming budget. I do not know what is going to happen, but I do know that this government has an impeccable record of improving the lives of Australians in a variety of ways. We have increased spending on the needs of Australians who are unable to assist themselves to fully provide for their families and their own welfare. We have significantly improved the position of people in those circumstances. In the last six years, for example, this government has spent $8 billion on child care—in actual dollars that is more than double the amount spent in the last six years of Labor's term in office. We are spending an additional $79.5 million over four years to provide an extra 10,000 outside of school hours care places, 2,500 family day care places and 4,000 more playgroups. That is what we are doing to make things better for Australians in need.
—There's another 20,000 you have not provided for—20,000 families waiting.
—This government has increased pensions, Senator Collins, by 32 per cent for single and partnered pensioners. Look at the total picture. Of course you can find places where particular individuals might not be better off in particular circumstances for a variety of reasons, but look at the big picture. That big picture discloses a position where Australians are much better off, including Australians in lower socioeconomic circumstances, than they ever were under Labor. The reason is that we have taken care of the basics. We have looked at what is required to make the Australian economy strong enough to support as many people as possible independently of the welfare system, to allow them to make decisions about their lives, to have opportunities and jobs and to be able to free themselves of dependency on the taxpayer.
That is demonstrated by the statistics. When Labor was in office in 1992, 934,000 Australians were unemployed. We have assisted those Australians by lifting them out of unemployment. Today, despite the increase in the population, that figure is just 595,000. Female unemployment under Labor was 7.6 per cent; today, it is just 6.1 per cent. Male unemployment under Labor was 8.6 per cent; today, it is 5.4 per cent.
—What about children in jobless households?
—Well, let us talk about youth unemployment. Youth unemployment under Labor in March 1996 was 11.6 per cent; today, Senator Collins, it is 9.5 per cent. There is more work to be done, yes, but we are certainly heading in the right direction and we have certainly done a better job than you have. The fact remains that we have created more full-time jobs in the last six months than you were able to create in the last six years you were in office. Those are the basic facts which are assisting Australian families. Your scaremongering about this does you no credit.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2004-03-30,"—I also rise to support the motion to take note of answers to questions posed to Senator Patterson by Labor senators in the chamber today. It is extremely difficult to do that because, as happened yesterday, Senator Patterson avoided responding with any substance at all to the questions that we posed in order to elicit information about people who are in need, people who are receiving payments and who are wondering what will happen to them in the future. Rather than respond with real information, with answers to these questions, we had to endure not only Senator Patterson's avoidance of responding to questions but also, as other senators have said, the language that she used during question time. It was extremely condescending in part and, from the other point of view, on many occasions was extremely abusive.
We wanted to know the answers to questions about activity testing for single parents. We wanted to know what the future payment regime might be for disability support pension recipients, especially for carer payments. We wanted to know what the government was considering to reduce the complexity of the payment system, which has increased over the time it has been in government. We also wanted to know what support measures will be in operation for parents, especially for the government's proposal to develop parenting skills. That is the sort of information people want to know about. That is what question time is for. That is what we are here for and that is what the government is meant to do: tell us what is being proposed.
But we did not get any answers to those questions. Rather, we had to endure, as I said, avoidance of the questions and also, to my mind, extremely abusive language. Senator Patterson will know, as all of us know, that following a question time like this we do get emails and we do get telephone calls from people who are astonished that question time can be allowed to occur in that way. Whilst Senator Patterson has not provided any responses to our questions, through the leaking of the document we do have some detail about what the government is proposing to do. In the cabinet-in-confidence document that has come to light we know there are 23 new key budget measures proposed. But those budget measures contain virtually no proposals to ease the pressure on average families. What we are facing and what the proposals include are significant budget cuts that will come into effect after the election. Those budget cuts would see future benefits cut for sole parent families, for carers and for disability pensioners in particular.
I was also very concerned to read the minister's comment in the letter she wrote to the Prime Minister where she said, `This reform can only be productively addressed through a carefully managed process.' That is code for: `We have to do it very quietly and using language that the community will not understand so that we can get these proposals through.' We have seen this before, with the proposed changes to the disability support pension, and it looks as though we are about to see it again.
The proposals contained $436 million worth of cuts, which are to be funded mainly from compliance measures and making people wait longer to claim their benefits—to delay the process of claiming benefits. There is $167 million of new spending, but much of that includes proposals that we have seen previously. This is not a plan to make the lives of people in our community better; it is very clear that the lives of recipients of payments through these sorts of measures will, in fact, be worse.
We know that yesterday Senator Patterson was asked to guarantee that pensions would maintain their value. That guarantee was not given. In fact, the minister referred to the Prime Minister, which was quite interesting. She said the Prime Minister has said that the government would not be cutting pensions or allowances. We have heard that before. Prior to the 2001 election, the Prime Minister said that nobody's benefit would be cut as a result of changes to the social security system. That did not happen.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-30,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
(a)	the need for the Senate to express its continuing support for and confidence in the women and men in the Australian Defence Force currently deployed in or around Iraq, and its appreciation for the high standard of professionalism they have displayed in carrying out their duties; 
(b)	given Australia's military participation in the invasion of Iraq, Australia's legal and moral obligation to assist with the administration and security of Iraqi civilians and to rebuild infrastructure in Iraq; and
(c)	the requirement for the Prime Minister publicly to define clear criteria of the jobs that are still required to be undertaken by our defence personnel, so that it is clear when the job is done, and so that prompt withdrawal of troops can then occur.
This is an important matter. It is a matter that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has put forward for debate in the House of Representatives by way of a different motion. The Democrats have brought on this debate because we believe it is appropriate that the matter also be considered in the Senate. We find it unacceptable and typical of the Prime Minister that he did not bother thinking that it was necessary to get the approval of parliament to send Australian troops to Iraq. He only did that after the troops were committed. Of course, he did not actually have the support of parliament and the support of the Senate in particular for committing those troops. He is now quite happy to put a motion to the parliament calling for the troops to be left there—but only in the House of Representatives, no doubt because he knows that he would get a much more accurate and realistic debate on the facts of the matter in the Senate. It is unfortunate that in the House of Representatives motions of this type are more about theatre and political positioning than about the substance of what is an important matter, a matter that is appropriate to debate and a matter on which we are bound to have differing views. We should have a comprehensive debate on this important matter.
Let me say at the outset that I am quite happy, indeed keen, for this motion to be voted on in separate parts, because I hope that all senators would support paragraph (a) of the motion. It is certainly not my intention to try and create a wedge by forcing senators to vote against a strong expression of support for our troops. Again I think it is unfortunate that in the Prime Minister's motion in the House of Representatives he has basically done that to try and force people to vote against a motion that contains an expression of support. One of the positive things about the debate that we have been having around the nation for well over a year is that, regardless of people's views about the use of our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq—what they have done there, whether they should be coming home—all viewpoints have consistently emphasised that our disagreement is about the government's policy approach and not about our troops. We all support them and recognise the job they are doing and that they are using rules of engagement that are of a higher standard than those of other troops engaged in that area. 
In this debate we should forget about the nice sounding phrases because what we have yet again is the government being dishonest and misleading the Australian people. Mr Howard says, `We have to be there until the job is done', but he will not say what the job is. Let him define the job so that we all know what we are aiming for and when the job will be done. If the job were to find weapons of mass destruction then we may as well have gone long ago, because they are not there. We could have just let the UN keep doing that. If the job were to get rid of Saddam, that is done. What is the other job? If we are there to rebuild democracy, stability and security for the Iraqi people, which is a very important job, frankly, we will be there for years and years. If that is the job, we should have more troops there than we have committed. 
Mr Howard uses pejorative phrases like `cut and run' as though every time one of our personnel is withdrawn it is some act of cowardice. I think it is a poor reflection on anybody who puts forward a suggestion of withdrawing troops that somehow that implies an act of cowardice. Is he suggesting that the SAS, because they were withdrawn, `cut and run'? I would like to see him say that to the SAS people. They could have stayed there and played a role. Let us remove that ridiculous language and look at the facts.
The Democrats have brought this matter of urgency on for debate in the Senate to try to at least debate the facts of the matter. In response to a question about when we will know the job is done Mr Downer said, `We will let you know.' That is not good enough: it is not good enough for the Australian people and it is particularly not good enough for the troops themselves and their friends and families who are here in Australia. 
A mess has been created in Iraq. Nobody was stronger in their opposition to our troops being committed to an invasion or an invasion occurring than the Democrats, but the fact is that it has happened and we have to conduct this debate on the basis of the reality now, not on the basis of wishful thinking. There is a mess and, frankly, a lot still needs to be done. It is worth noting Mr Latham's initial comments that I supported—setting an aspiration by saying, `Let us attempt to get our troops home as soon as possible.' I am not sure it was wise to set down a specific date—I would not have done that—but I think his suggestion of not letting this drift indefinitely and aspiring to get them home as soon as possible was appropriate. The Democrats have always had an approach of saying that once the action was taken, once the war had happened, we do need to keep our troops in there. We do have an ongoing obligation as an occupying power to the safety and security of the troops. We have not supported, as some others who opposed the war have done, an immediate withdrawal of troops. 
Let us recognise how many troops we are talking about. It is a very small number. If the government were genuine in its big chested rhetoric it would have far more in there. This is a deliberate wedge on the part of the Prime Minister. I refer people to Brian Toohey's article in the Financial Review of last weekend. I do not have time to go into it now, but it talked about just what a small number of troops are involved here. The fact is that 80 of the Air Force air traffic controllers will be coming home in any case in May or June. Their work will be done. There are 53 Australian Army units training the new Iraqi army.

Let me now in this debate set out in some detail the opposition's position. Australia's international security policy should have as its principal priorities the ongoing war against terrorism, enhancing the security and stability of our immediate region, and the protection of Australians both at home and overseas. Decisions to deploy Australian defence forces overseas need to be made on the basis of these priorities. Any government committing Australian forces overseas must have a defined exit strategy in place. History has shown that open-ended military commitments can entail considerable cost and diversion of scarce military resources from key priorities.
The government is yet to articulate a clear strategy for our forces in Iraq. The Howard government has previously provided public undertakings to the Australian people ruling out a postwar Australian military commitment in Iraq altogether or else limiting that commitment to months, not years. Labor did not support Australia's involvement in the war against Iraq, but Labor has always supported the men and women deployed by the government to Iraq.
Labor's position on the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq has been consistent. Labor has always said that this should take place as soon as practicable once our responsibilities as an occupying power in Iraq have been discharged. The handover of power from the Coalition Provisional Authority to an interim Iraqi government on 30 June this year is a critical milestone in this respect. A Labor government's intention, if elected later this year, is to withdraw the following Australian military forces from Iraq by the end of 2004: the 60 personnel assigned to air traffic control functions at Baghdad International Airport; the up to 15 Australian analysts and technical experts supporting the Iraq Survey Group in its search for weapons of mass destruction; the 11 personnel assigned to the Coalition Provisional Authority; the Royal Australian Navy training team of 12 sailors; the Army training team of 60 soldiers; the military liaison officer with the Australian mission in Baghdad; and the military adviser to the United Nations Secretary-General's representative in Iraq.
Labor will also withdraw Australian forces based outside Iraq operating in direct support of Australian operations inside Iraq: the two C-130 Hercules and the 120 personnel crewing and servicing them and the 90 Australian personnel assigned to coalition headquarters, logistics and communications units. Labor recognise that some Australian military personnel in Iraq are protecting Australian officials working in our representative office in Baghdad. While our intention is to withdraw these troops, Labor will consult the Chief of the Defence Force and the diplomatic security experts of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the likely security needs of these officers at the appropriate time. Labor's commitment is to the War on Terror, and the following assets operating in the Middle East in support of this war will remain in place: one ship—currently the HMAS Melbourne, to be replaced by the HMAS Stuart—currently stationed in the gulf as part of a multinational interception force, and a RAAF AP-3C Orion detachment conducting maritime patrol operations.
Australia should continue to provide strong levels of humanitarian assistance and economic reconstruction assistance to the Iraqi people for the rebuilding of the Iraqi nation. Of course, the real issue in relation to our military involvement in Iraq is the basis on which the government made the decision to deploy our troops. The real issue is weapons of mass destruction. Let us not forget what Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, told the Australian people at the time of the troops' deployment. In his televised address to the nation on 20 March last year, Prime Minister Howard said: 
We are determined to join other countries to deprive Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, its chemical and biological weapons, which even in minute quantities are capable of causing death and destruction on a mammoth scale.
They are the words of Prime Minister Howard. A year later, with no weapons of mass destruction having been discovered and this justification for war lying in tatters, Mr Howard and his colleagues are intent on reinterpreting history and emphasising regime change as the justification for the war. But it was the same Mr Howard who, at the National Press Club on 13 March last year, had ruled out regime change. Mr Howard ruled it out. I want to quote him again:
Well, I would have to accept that if Iraq had genuinely disarmed I couldn't justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime. I've never advocated that. Much in all as I despise the regime.
They were Mr Howard's words at that time—at the Press Club on 13 March 2003. The fact is that the Australian people were persuaded to go to war in Iraq in order to deprive Saddam Hussein of his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. A year later, after the most extensive searching by the Iraq Survey Group, no such weapons have been found. None have been found, but do we get an apology from Prime Minister Howard on this? Of course not—not on your life. And I would suggest to the Senate: do not hold your breath for an apology from Mr Howard on this.
The only member of the Howard government to tell the truth on this issue was good old Senator Hill. Good old Senator Hill, from his hot-air balloon, told the truth. Of course, he admitted—and I give him credit for having the decency to admit—that there are no weapons of mass destruction. But what happened to poor old Senator Hill? It is quite symbolic, isn't it, Mr Deputy President? Senator Hill tells the truth, goes up in a hot-air balloon, bumps down to land—and what happens to him? He is immediately gagged by Mr Howard and forced to retract what he said. The truth lasted three hours. It stood for three hours before Senator Hill was heavied by the Prime Minister. As I said, the opposition can support the first paragraph of the urgency motion, but the remaining paragraphs do not capture our position on this issue and, accordingly, I have moved an amendment which I would commend to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Australian Defence Force: Deployment</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2004-03-30,"—That was a colourful contribution from Senator Faulkner—plenty of life, little relevance to the motion before the chamber and perhaps some failure in accuracy, but that seems to be the Labor Party way at the moment. The issue today is whether Mr Latham has become fast and loose with the truth. Mr Latham has got himself into an awful political mess over this issue by making policy on the run and determining that he would be adopting a populist position by a decision that, if in government, he would return the troops by Christmas—no matter what the situation in Iraq, no matter what the consequences for the Iraqi people and no matter what the consequences for peace and stability within the region or the state of reconstruction of the country. It seemed to Mr Latham to be a good idea at the time to make such an announcement, and he simply made it. He did not bother to consult his colleagues. He did not take into account—maybe he did not even know—that his shadow spokesman for foreign affairs had been advocating that the government continue with its efforts in supporting the reconstruction of Iraq, even arguably increase its efforts. So Mr Latham adopted what he thought was a populist position, but he made an error of judgment because that was not really the attitude of the Australian people at all. 
The Australian people believe that when a job is being done and it is an important job, particularly when others are reliant on Australia, it should be completed. That created a difficult political issue for Mr Latham and he needed to find a way out. We have seen a number of embarrassing moments over the last few days when he has varied his policy position according to the pressures of the moment. It was brought to his attention that by bringing the Australian troops out he would leave the Australian diplomats vulnerable, so he said that perhaps he would leave the security forces there that were protecting Australian diplomats. When he was told that those security forces are supplied and supported by Australian Hercules aircraft operating in and out of Iraq, he changed his position again and said that perhaps he would leave the Hercules aircraft there as well. Now he has been told that the P3 Orion aircraft are actually carrying out work that is relevant to the safety of not only the Iraqi people in surveillance operations but also the coalition forces. He is refusing to respond to the issue of whether he would leave the P3s operating over Iraq or not.
What all this means is that not only did he make policy on the run but he had not done the hard work to determine exactly what the situation was in Iraq, what our forces were doing and what the consequences would be of the policy he made on the run. Today it has been suggested to him that he should have done some more hard work, and he of course came out with that statement that he had in fact been listening to advice from both DFAT and Defence. He said: `Yeah, well, I've had discussions with officials from Foreign Affairs and Defence about the situation in Iraq.' In actual fact, he has been offered briefings by officials in both departments and has refused those briefings. But, again, caught on the run today, having to try and explain the basis for his positions rather than acknowledging that he had not done the hard work and had got himself into such an embarrassing position, fast and loose with the truth, he comes up with this nonsense about discussions with Foreign Affairs and Defence officials.
It tells us a lot about Mr Latham and the way in which he would manage issues of the highest national importance—that is, issues of national significance. He will not think through the consequences of his actions. He will not do the hard work that is necessary to ensure that his positions are soundly based. He will say whatever it seems to him at the time is necessary to attract popular appeal and whatever the consequences of that might be is of no particular concern to him. I think that is something that the Australian people should clearly take into account as this year progresses and they have to look at both the government and the opposition as to who they would prefer as the future government of this country.
The position of the government is obviously clear on these issues. We believe the Australian forces are doing a great job in and around Iraq at the moment in helping to rebuild that country and create opportunities for the future—a democratic opportunity, an opportunity for economic growth and perhaps, just as important, an opportunity for that economic growth to be better shared so that all Iraqis have the chance for a better future, not only the privileged, as has been the case in the past. 
The country is delicately poised at the moment. It is moving towards its transitional government. It is being undermined by an insurgency that is both cruel and ruthless. It cannot achieve its objectives without the support of the international community. It is in that environment that Mr Latham argues that Australian forces should not do the job but rather should leave. The contrast between the positions of the two parties is clear. The government says the job is half done and it is important for the Iraqi people and for Australia's national security in that a free democracy, if it can be built in that region progressing on a different path to that which has been the case in the past, can make a significant contribution to peace and security in the whole region.
It is the view of the government that a better set of words to be voted on in this place today would be those in the motion that was moved in the other chamber. I therefore foreshadow that, in the event of the defeat of Senator Faulkner's amendment, a government amendment—which I will not read out now, because I do not have time, but which basically commends the role the troops are playing—be put. I would hope that this chamber, in a bipartisan mood, might recognise that that is important. They are doing a great job and the job is still not complete. The job needs to be completed, and that is where the Australian people should put their support. I foreshadow that amendment in the event of Senator Faulkner's amendment failing.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Australian Defence Force: Deployment</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-03-30,"—The Greens will be supporting the Labor amendment to the motion but not the government amendment. We do not believe the motion as it has been brought forward is satisfactory. I also foreshadow the Greens amendment as circulated which has the additional component of calling for the immediate withdrawal of the Australian Defence Force from Iraq with the exception of any personnel required to protect Australian diplomatic representatives.
I have just three minutes to speak and I want to point out that between the cruelty of Saddam Hussein's regime and the insurgency that Senator Hill has just spoken about was the cruelty of 10,000 to 25,000 people in Iraq being killed. The fact is that Australian Defence Force personnel refused to go on some of the bombing sorties of civilian targets during that cruel war—the invasion of Iraq. All senators have expressed—and I join them in expressing—our support for the Australian Defence Force personnel. They are in Iraq in the service of this country, but we totally disagree with the government having deployed them in this way. We want them brought home—and have said so right from the outset—to help secure this country and to take part in the defence of this region at a time of heightened security concerns.
The government made a historic error: it lied to the Australian people and deceived the Defence Force personnel in sending them to the Iraq theatre of war. It did so on the basis of information coming from the George W. Bush White House in the United States, which has now been found out in hearings being held in the United States—and this goes right to the President who influenced our Prime Minister—as having ignored the information before it and having determined to override the information to say, `We must align Iraq with al-Qaeda, deceive our own people and send our defence forces to war.' It was wrong, it was unethical, it was based on a lie; and it should be rectified. And that is why we bring forward this motion now—to rectify it. 
Of course we support an ongoing humanitarian effort in Iraq. Why not put the extra $65 billion being spent on so-called `offence' by the United States into the reconstruction of that country? How much better it would be if we had that humanitarian approach instead of spending on armaments to occupy the country for however long it takes until the American ethic is fulfilled.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2004-03-30,"—I support the Prime Minister's motion in the other house—and the amendment that Senator Hill will be moving in the Senate today—as it is the only motion that expresses absolute confidence in and appreciation of the Australian Defence Force and says that we will be there to finish the job. 
On 18 March, Mr Latham said, `If the federal election is held in September and there was a change of government, we would be hoping to have the troops back by Christmas.' There were no caveats that we would leave some people there—that we would leave forces there to protect the embassy and do other things. It was a completely unilateral decision to remove all troops from Iraq. What message does that send to terrorists? Go in, kill 200 people, bomb people in Bali and in America, blow buildings up, hijack planes and you will be rewarded. Australian people will be frightened. The going will get tough and the Australians will run. Mr Latham, you have grossly underestimated what Australians think. 
A poll reported in the Sydney Morning Herald today found that 61 per cent of people in Australia wanted to maintain troops in Iraq. If that poll had been taken in rural Australia, the approval rating would have been up to 95 per cent because people in rural Australia do not run. They depend on each other and their communities. They work together and do not quit until the job is done. I am surprised it is only 61 per cent. I would have thought 95 per cent of people would say that if you bow, if you submit, if you say peace in our time then you are running up the white flag; you are saying Australians are cowards. Australians are not cowards. They will not be beaten into submission. They will hold the line. They will stay there until the job is done. I want to quote Mr Jack Straw, who eloquently said:
So, we walk out of Iraq, abandon Afghanistan. Does anyone think that this would satisfy their appetite? Of course not. Their appetite would simply be whetted, for it is insatiable.
No-one could say it better than that. But Mr Latham, following his ideologue and mentor, Gough Whitlam, thought he would hop on the bandwagon. He thought it worked for Gough Whitlam when he brought the troops home from Vietnam. So he decided on the spot that it would be a great idea—he had not had a bit of publicity for a while, he wanted a bit of populism and he found that this was one way he could get attention. He got attention all right. He stepped right over the mark. But what he did show Australians was that he would be a very dangerous person to be in charge of this nation. He showed very distinctively that this nation would be put at risk.
When you reward terrorism you actually invite more terrorism. That is what Mr Latham has done. On top of that, I think Mr Latham has threatened Australia's reputation as a proud nation—a nation that is prepared to stand and fight cruelty and injustice. Australian soldiers are respected all over the world. Mr Latham has shown that he does not want that respect for our Australian soldiers. We know that when the going gets tough we stick in there. We undertook to help the Iraqis. We said that we would stay there and do the job—we would not rat on them, we would not walk out on them. Now Mr Latham is saying that we will cut and run, that we will walk away, that we do not care what happens to them. Imagine if every one of the Poles, the Japanese, the English and the Canadians all walked away. What a mess that would leave Iraq in. 
There really is no alternative but to support the foreshadowed amendment that will be moved by Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate. We may have had differences over whether we should be in Iraq. I can see the arguments in that, although I do not support them—I always thought we should be there. But there is no argument that the opposition and the crossbenchers can construct that we should walk away from a people that are getting bombed and shot at and who need our support. You could say that we could bring back Saddam Hussein, because that is what would happen. Some other cruel dictator would crawl to the top. We have got to stay there until democracy is returned, until there is a credible business sector where people can make a living and until farming is developed so that they can feed themselves. We took this job on and I am very sorry that the opposition, the alternative government, have shown that they want to reward cowardice, that they want to reward the terrorists for carrying out their acts of terrorism. They want to say to them, `Good job. You've killed 200 people in Spain. You've killed 80 people in—
—You ought to give it away, Bossie.
—No, I should not give it away. I know this is embarrassing you. This is what the people of Australia are saying: you are rewarding terrorism. It might be hurtful to you, but that is what the people are saying out there. That is why 61 per cent of the people of Australia said, `Leave the troops there. Do the job, protect the people and don't walk away from them.' You go out there and ask them. If you can put any other construction on it I would be very surprised and so would the people of Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Australian Defence Force: Deployment</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-03-30,"—In the midst of the political debate about Australia's strategic direction, on 1 May this year a very senior parliamentarian had this to say about Australia's role in postwar Iraq:
Well, the task of rebuilding Iraq will be essentially a civilian task ... we are committed to play a part in the reconstruction of Iraq, but it won't be predominantly a military contribution; it will be predominantly a contribution provided by the private sector.
That was not Mark Latham. It was the Minister for Defence, Minister Hill, expressing the government's view about what it saw at the time as its role in Iraq. It is one of a number of assurances the people of Australia were given by this government that our involvement in Iraq would be short, that we would be out quickly and that we would be making no contribution to peacekeeping in Iraq. Mr Howard made it very clear he would not be embroiled in Iraq, that we would not be there for the long term—we would be there at the sharp end, for the invasion phase and the occupation, but as soon as we could we would be out. It was his very clear intention that was repeated on a number of occasions, supported by Senator Hill and Minister Downer, that we would be out of Iraq.
How is it that we have gone from that to this hysterical debate of the last few days, with people like Senator Boswell making such claims as bin Laden has been given comfort and terrorists have been encouraged? I remind Senator Boswell and some others that bin Laden was last reported seen in Afghanistan, not Iraq. I also remind him that we currently have one member of the ADF in Afghanistan, compared to 400 or so in Iraq, because this government made a decision, which it said was in the national interest, to remove our military commitment—our SAS soldiers—from Afghanistan because we had played our role and it was time to do so. This government said our military involvement in Afghanistan was no longer a priority, and it made the decision to withdraw. No-one pretends the security situation in Afghanistan is safe. No-one pretends that democracy is not under threat. No-one pretends that there are not very serious problems there. This government, after having the support of the Australian Labor Party for its involvement in Afghanistan, made the decision to withdraw its military contribution and it justified that decision in terms of Australia's strategic priorities. 
The government are now trying to run the argument that Labor arguing the same case with respect to our military commitment in Iraq—that is, that we will withdraw our commitment at a time of our decision—is somehow giving comfort to terrorists. That is a complete nonsense. An alternative Labor government would have the ability to make a decision about our national strategic interests. We have decided, we have announced publicly and we will argue up until the election that military involvement in Iraq is not a strategic priority for Australia. It is a not a defence priority for this country. We have played a role in Iraq in a military sense, and we ought to withdraw our military commitment from Iraq in order to address other priorities for our defence forces—which the government say are and have been stretched for some time. That is a legitimate opinion for an opposition to hold. It is legitimate for an opposition to say that, as an alternative government, we have an alternative position which we will advance if in government.
What I really find difficult about today's debate is the way the Prime Minister has again tried to politicise defence. The first part of the Prime Minister's motion in the House of Representatives talks about support for the troops. This chamber and the House of Representatives have unanimously supported our troops in Iraq before, during and since the war. We have worked very hard to achieve a—
—We have not!
—Senator, I will take your interjection, because we have and those troops value it. Idiots like you who do not pay attention to those sentiments—
 (Senator Brandis)—Order, Senator Evans!
—I withdraw, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—You're getting steamed up here!
—I do get steamed up, because I know how important it is to the troops that they have bipartisan support. I know how much they value it. I have been to the farewells and I have been to the welcome homes. Despite knowing there was a difference of political opinion in this parliament on this issue, they have appreciated the fact that the ADF have not been drawn into that and have not been made the butt of the political debate. The Prime Minister today, in a low, sneaky attempt to create division, was to wrap up in a motion support for the troops with support for his stance on when they might be withdrawn. He would not split the motion. He would not agree to allow the parliament to express its view about the troops—to express our support for their professionalism, their integrity and the job they have done—because he wanted to try to create a cheap political debate. I think he has lowered himself. He has demeaned himself, and he has demeaned the Liberal Party and the National Party. We have always made it very clear that, despite our opposition to involvement in Iraq, we have supported the troops wholeheartedly. I have been at pains to make that clear to them, and it has been appreciated. 
That has not changed. Today's debate marks a new low in the Prime Minister's attempts to hold onto government. He has refused to set aside the issue at the centre of the political debate. We have had a genuine political disagreement about withdrawal of troops from Iraq. The alternative government, the Labor Party, have an exit strategy. We say that at the end of the year it will no longer be a military priority for us to be involved in Iraq. We gave a commitment to the Australian people about that. Labor's position on this has been consistent. We opposed the war and from the day we opposed the war we said we would bring the troops home, and we have said that on the occasion of every decision. The Leader of the Opposition the other day defined the timetable for that with respect to when Iraq got its own independent government. He said that if there was a June handover to an Iraqi government and if a Labor government were elected in, say, September we would hope to have the troops home by Christmas.
—He didn't say `we hope'.
—He did say `we hope'. He said that very clearly. He made a commitment. He said, `We'll bring the troops home.' We are saying this is what a Labor government will do. We are out there with a very clear policy that we will bring the troops home.
Government senators interjecting—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, am I speaking or are the other senators interjecting? I just want to be clear. I know how fastidious you are.
—I am sorry, Senator Evans. I was talking to the Clerk. I ask senators on my right to hear Senator Evans in silence and with courtesy.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is important that we have this public policy debate, and there is a genuine division between the parties on this issue. That is a good thing in some ways, because it allows us to have a proper debate. Labor have an exit strategy. We have made an honest commitment to the Australian people that we will bring the troops home. We say we have other priorities. We are far more concerned about the war on terrorism and about its impact on Australia and on Australia's strategic and defence needs. The war on terrorism will be our priority, along with our ongoing commitments in Timor and the Solomons. We supported the government's commitment in the Solomons because of our responsibilities in the region. We have other priorities, which this government has previously recognised and argued for. This government made a strong argument against providing more peacekeepers for Iraq and resisted American requests for that because it had other priorities. The government has made public on a number of occasions its commitment to bringing the troops home as soon as it can.
Funnily enough, it seems that the government has now changed its mind. It had a view that we ought not have peacekeepers in Iraq. It had a view that we ought not be caught up in Iraq for a long period of time. But something happened last week that made it change its view. Now it is very committed to staying in Iraq for a longer period. It is pure opportunism to now try and reverse what has been for a long period of time a very sound policy to not provide peacekeepers in Iraq. Labor's priority is to withdraw those troops and to prioritise our commitments in the region and to the war on terrorism. Labor's priority is to make the same sort of decision that the Howard government made in relation to Afghanistan. The government made a contribution to the military invasion of Afghanistan and then said that Australia had other more pressing priorities closer to home and that we could not continue to supply military forces to Afghanistan. Labor's argument is much the same with respect to Iraq. We say we will maintain our commitment to the war on terrorism and we will continue to make very strong contributions to that as well as fulfil our role in the region. Our priorities lie in the defence of Australia and in our involvement in the region and in the war on terrorism. 
Those are our defence and strategic priorities, and we are prepared to argue them. We think that the war on terrorism is a much greater priority for Australians and for Australia's defence efforts and that the growth of terrorist cells in countries to our immediate north requires a concentration of effort and a concentration of defence resources directed at that. What we have seen with the war on Iraq is a diversion from the fight against terrorism and a diversion from the war on terrorism, with thousands and thousands of resources being poured into Iraq against what could have been used on the war on terrorism.
What we know is that we have a very small commitment to Iraq—albeit a very effective commitment of highly professional ADF soldiers—of about 400 ADF members compared to the total of 130,000 British, American and other troops inside Iraq. Our contribution is small. We are not providing peacekeeping; we are not providing security for the Iraqi people. As the minister is fond of saying, we are providing some niche capabilities. Each of those niche capabilities can be withdrawn without impacting on the security of the Iraqis or the security situation inside Iraq. The minister has already indicated that the air traffic controllers will be coming home as soon as the function is moved to a private contract. Clearly the weapons search team are coming home. They have been searching and searching for a long time; they have not found anything. I suspect that if they have not found anything by Christmas it is reasonable to say, `Come home, chaps. There is nothing to find.' As for some of the other detachments we have got inside Iraq, clearly these forces can safely be removed without impacting on the security of Iraqis or the security situation inside Iraq.
This is an important debate. Labor is very committed to providing a strong defence policy but one centred on our priorities: the war on terror, security in our region and defence of Australia's interests. We say that those are our priorities, not Iraq. We have an alternative defence posture to the government's. We are entitled to that, we are entitled to argue it and it is important that it be argued, because we say Australia's interests do not lie in a long-term military engagement inside Iraq. There is no walking away from the Iraqi people but it is reasonable to withdraw from our military commitment.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2004-03-30,"—I am sure our defence forces would be somewhat bemused by the matter of urgency debate in this parliament at the moment and by what can really only be described as total political one-upmanship using the troops in Iraq. We have the government position, which seeks to exploit the opposition's view—or at least the Leader of the Opposition's view—that the troops ought to be brought home by Christmas. We have the Democrats' position, which seems to be contradictory to positions they have previously expressed but which is also seeking to exploit the situation from a public and political point of view. Of course, the opposition is seeking to amend the Democrats' motion with a somewhat changed view of attempting to bring the troops home by the end of 2004. Then we have the Greens' position, which is for an immediate withdrawal of some of the defence personnel, with the exception of those that are required to protect Australian diplomatic representatives, which is a rather interesting position as well. 
I am sure that the defence forces of this country would be somewhat disappointed that we are having this debate. Sure, there was a situation that occurred so that, in essence, we participated in the invasion of Iraq on a false premise, on wrong information. We will never know to what extent the government of the day here knew about—or to what extent they had information that would at least indicate to them that there were no—weapons of mass destruction. We have heard that position change time and time again, and it continues to change. Of course we did go there; we are there. The country of Iraq is in a terrible state and it would be a shame if we were to walk away from something that we probably should not have started in the first place. If we were to walk away from it, that would not allow the Iraqis the opportunity to get their country rebuilt and it would not give them some opportunity for the future. But this is not really the way to go about it.
I think that the time we are consuming in the Senate by what can only be described as political opportunism in an election year and kicking our defence forces around like a political football is reprehensible. That really should not be the case. We should not be arguing about when they should come home. Even the opposition suggest that they should come home after the job is done. I am amused by the call by the Democrats to get the Prime Minister of the day to somehow define the task that needs to be done, which is a very interesting proposition.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2004-03-30,"—I can understand this matter of urgency motion being brought forward by the Democrats because in fact the Democrats have been quite consistent on these issues—consistently wrong, I might say, but they have been quite consistent. I can understand the Greens' position and Senator Brown's because, as he appeals to the loony Left and those people who could not be considered to be in the mainstream of Australians, he has been quite consistent in his position. He has been consistently wrong, but he has been consistent. 
Then we come to the position of the Australian Labor Party and, to be honest with you, I have no idea what their position is because they have five or six different positions and they have had them over this past week. They have changed their position on the withdrawal of Australian troops on a daily basis. We listened to Senator Faulkner today as he meandered along talking briefly to the motion that was before us but then getting onto the issue of weapons of mass destruction. The last half of his contribution bore no relation to the motion that is before us today. So we saw yet another position of the Labor Party because we find now that the Labor Party are not going to bring the troops home by Christmas but that it is in fact their intention to return our forces to Australia by the end of 2004 or as soon as practicable. So once again it is changed and the position of the Labor Party is just simply not known.
I listened to Senator Brown talking about the terrible events and the numbers of people that had been killed in the war in Iraq. This is the same Senator Brown who came into this chamber prior to the commitment of our troops and said there would be 500,000 women and children—citizens of Iraq—killed as a result of our being part of the coalition in Iraq. In fact, the numbers he is talking about are getting close to the sorts of numbers that Saddam Hussein killed in Iraq—not the coalition forces. To get rid of that tyrant with such a small loss of life was, I think, a wonderful effort and a tribute to all those who took part. 
I can tell you, if you really want to find out what the people of Iraq are feeling. In August last year, Senator Lightfoot and I were honoured to host Mr Jalal Talabani of the Iraqi Governing Council at a dinner while he was here. Mr Talabani was at that time the head of the governing council. He explained to us his proximity to the terrorist activities in Iraq—those activities arranged by the fundamentalist Muslims—and how they were against the new democratic climate and environment growing in the wake of the collapse of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship. Mr Jalal Talabani said:
We are in need to rebuild Iraq and to reshape it on a democratic principle. We are determined to have a democratic parliament, a federation, an independent Iraq with full sovereignty. And for that, of course, one day we want to see the coalition forces go back home.
He was asked then: but when? He responded:
We think that if they leave now there will be chaos and even civil war, and the possibility of our neighbours interfering. When the democratic Iraq has been established, when we have our government freely elected and our parliament, and when we rebuild our security forces then I think there will be the day that we ask the coalition forces to go home.
That is what the people of Iraq want to happen. Here we have the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Mark Latham, saying—in spite of all the requests we have had from the Iraqi people and in spite of the fact that we are part of a coalition of some 34 or 35 countries inside Iraq, along with a number of others who are contributing not necessarily inside Iraq but making a contribution nonetheless—`Well, if we win government when we have a federal election, we will have our troops home by Christmas.' It is very reminiscent of his mentor, Gough Whitlam, who said, `I'll have the troops home by Christmas'. History tends to forget that most of the troops were already out of Vietnam when Whitlam said that: there were only 70 or 80 left. So of course he brought the last 70 or 80 home. In fact Sir William McMahon, when he was Prime Minister, had brought all the other troops back prior to that election taking place. It is one of those myths that seems to be able to be perpetrated by the ALP that the saviour who got the troops home from Vietnam was the new Prime Minister Whitlam when in fact it was not.
Senator Evans says that we seem to be having a hysterical debate. The only one who got hysterical today was Senator Evans. He was trying to defend the indefensible of having five different policies in one week—five different inferences on their policy. He says that we are part of a coalition of 34 or 35 countries. Why would we want to pull out and give that signal to the terrorists who are still operating within that country? Why would we pull out—a sign of weakness—when in fact we ought to be part of the large number of countries that are there helping to get Iraq back on its feet? Senator Evans also said that we have three priorities. One of those, he said, was the defence of Australia. He then went on to say what a small number of forces we have in Iraq. As you well know, Mr Acting Deputy President, with the number of troops we have committed in Iraq it is well within the ability of the Australian defence forces to do the job of being part of that coalition and also to defend Australia.
What does Senator Evans mean by the `defence of Australia'? Does that mean that you have to have all of your troops inside Australia looking out in case somebody comes to invade Australia's shores? The defence of Australia in modern times, with modern communications and modern warfare, means that you do not necessarily defend Australia by having all of your troops at home. In fact sometimes the best thing you can do to defend Australia is to have some of your troops helping other people elsewhere in the world to rid the world of terrorism and to make sure that we stop terrorist acts at their source rather than have them waiting back in Australia for people to come to our country to perpetrate acts of terrorism. I strongly support the amendment by Senator Hill, which at the end says: 
That the Senate is of the opinion that no elements of this contingent of Australian Defence Force personnel should be withdrawn until their respective tasks have been completed and that no arbitrary times should be set for such withdrawal.
I would urge the opposition to support that motion because there should not be an arbitrary time.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Australian Defence Force: Deployment</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-30,"—I must say that the government members' contribution to this matter of urgency debate has been very disappointing. This is an attempt to have a serious debate about an important issue in the Senate as opposed to the political name-calling in the House of Representatives. I think most other senators did that despite their differing views. I do not know what Senator Murphy is saying when he talks about the Democrats position being inconsistent because our position has been completely consistent on this issue. That is the reason why we will not support Senator Brown's amendment. The Democrats and the Greens had a shared view that our troops should not have been involved in Iraq, but we do have a difference of opinion on this—our view is that our troops should not be withdrawn immediately.
We do have an obligation under international law, specifically the fourth Geneva convention, as a party to the conflict. An occupying power cannot refuse to govern. It has obligations to maintain the basic social infrastructure, to guarantee food and medical supplies, and to permit and facilitate the provision of relief aid. Quite frankly, the Howard government has in many respects already cut and run in terms of that core obligation. The amount of support we are providing is token at best. I again refer people to the article by Brian Toohey in the weekend Financial Review. The fact is that, once the air traffic controllers have withdrawn—which Senator Hill has already said he is going to do—New Zealand will have more people in Iraq rebuilding the infrastructure than Australia. New Zealand have no obligations—they were not part of the invading force; they did not even support it—but they are still chipping in to help rebuild more than Australia is. New Zealand have 91 personnel in Afghanistan; Australia has one, because Mr Howard has already cut and run from there.
So let us stop this pathetic name-calling suggesting that just because you believe our troops should be withdrawn somehow you are withdrawing from the battle against terrorism. That is ridiculous. We are all equally committed to fighting terrorism and to simply use that sort of schoolyard name-calling is to not treat an important issue seriously. The Democrats support Senator Faulkner's amendment. We think it is quite a good choice of words that we agree with almost completely. It puts the situation well. It is a simple fact that we did not support the troops going. Now that they are there, they have a job to do; but let us get them home as soon as possible.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-30,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This document—the national interest analysis and regulation impact statement relating to the Australia-United States of America free trade agreement, agreed at Washington DC on 8 February and due to be signed after 13 May 2004—together with the free trade agreement will be examined by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, of which I am a member, and the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America, on which Senator Ridgeway is the Democrats representative. I will not, therefore, speak at length on those now. Suffice to say that the agreement was made on 8 February but it was not until today, 30 March, that the national interest analysis and regulation impact statement document were provided to the parliament. That is another example in the Democrats' view of why we need to change our approach to key international treaties so that the government cannot simply negotiate the whole lot in secret and then whack them down and say to the Australian people and the Australian parliament: `Here they are—like it or lump it.' 
We should have a system in place whereby the parliament must ratify or express support for treaties before they can enter into force. That is the approach of the United States and many other countries. The Democrats have long argued that it should be the approach here. The negotiation of this treaty, and the flow-on national interest analysis that was tabled today, is an example of why we should adopt that approach here, particularly given that such agreements are more and more significant, have more and more influence and are of more and more importance.
This agreement is part of what is often called globalisation. I prefer to use the term `internationalisation', but it probably does not really matter. It is part of what is becoming the reality of more and more linkages with other countries not just on trade but on environmental issues, social and human rights issues, animal rights issues and many other issues. Due to our general principle of embracing other countries, the Democrats are not scared of that. We do not run away from that. We are not an isolationist party, but we do believe we need to consider carefully all engagements and agreements to ensure that they serve national and global interests with respect to not just economic matters—in the case of trade treaties—but also social, environmental and cultural matters. All are touched on by this free trade agreement.
Not surprisingly, I have not had time to read the national interest analysis, let alone the regulation impact statement, I am speaking to. Suffice to say they will both be referred to the Senate select committee and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which will be starting hearings over the break from parliamentary sittings. We sometimes talk about a break from sittings as though we all go on leave because there is nothing else to do. These committee inquiries will be just one example of how that is not the case. Members of those committees will travel to hearings that will be held all around the country.
So I draw to the Senate's attention and to the public's attention that two extra documents are now out there with extra information on what is an important agreement, about which there is still a lot of public uncertainty, a lack of understanding and many questions to be answered. The Democrats will certainly ensure that the Senate does its job in assessing all those issues as fully and as dispassionately as possible and in looking at what is in our national interest and what is not and at what is in the global interest and what is not. There are a wide range of issues that are dealt with in these documents which need examination both in their totality and in relation to specific components. That needs to be done, and I am sure it will be done.

I commend the report to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
The response read as follows—
RESPONSE
This response relates to a speech made by Senator McGauran on 3 March 2004 in the Senate.
That speech was critical of an Editorial Comment made in National Observer, issue 59, Summer 2004, headed “Israel and Anti-Semitism”. The main thesis of the Editorial was that those discussing international affairs should be able to criticise Israel's actions, where appropriate, without being attacked as “anti-semitic”. The Editorial Comment was also critical of Israel's practice of creating settlements in adjoining Palestinian territory. National Observer agrees with those who believe that these settlements are clearly a major cause of increased unrest in the Middle East and contribute to Palestinian resentments leading to terrorist activity, and National Observer also agrees with the many who believe that these settlements should be withdrawn as soon as possible.
Senator McGauran was also critical of the statement in the Editorial Comment that Israel was created through Jewish terrorist activity which involved the murder of civilians and of British soldiers and the driving out of Arabs. However it is correct that this terrorist activity took place in fact, and led to the setting up de facto of a Jewish state. As is commonly the case, the de facto setting up of a country was in due course followed by de jure recognition.
Senator McGauran was also critical of the Editorial Comment for referring to the fact that, as well as Palestinian killings of Israeli citizens, including women and children, Israelis have killed many more Palestinians, including women and children. The question whether Israeli responses have been disproportionate is correctly regarded as an important matter for public discussion.
Senator McGauran referred critically to the Editorial Comment's mention of a 2003 poll in Europe indicating criticism of Israel. However the fact is that there is very widespread criticism of Israel in Europe. Indeed, it appears that in many cases Israeli actions have led to the formation of anti-Jewish feeling more generally.
Senator McGauran's speech created a distorted impression of National Observer's Editorial Comment, and in order to correct that distorted impression the Editorial Comment is set out hereunder, as follows—
ISRAEL AND “ANTI-SEMITISM”
An indefensible slur is now encountered whereby any criticism of Israel is referred to by Jewish supporters as “anti-semitism.” This slur is inexcusable.
Israel is a state that was created by Jewish terrorist activity which involved the murder of civilians and British soldiers and the driving out of Arabs. It has acted to defend its unlawfully acquired territory, but has also assumed the deliberate practice of creating settlements in adjoining Palestinian territory. 
These deliberate and carefully planned appropriations of Palestinian lands are indefensible. Not only do they involve oppression of the unfortunate Palestinians, but they also demonstrate Israel's bad faith.
Israeli propaganda attempts to persuade that the Palestinians are irrational and that their resort to terrorism is entirely unjustified. This propaganda recounts how Jewish citizens, including women and children, are being killed by Palestinian suicide bombers.
But this Israeli propaganda is silent in regard to Palestinian complaints that the Israelis have killed many more Palestinians, including women and children, than the Palestinians have killed Israelis. The dishonesty of the Israeli position is found in the inconsistency in Israeli complaints about Palestinian actions and the subtle but persistent continued appropriation of Palestinian territory. Although terrorist acts are per se undesirable, in the present case the Palestinians should not be blamed unless equal or greater blame is allotted to the Israelis.
The Jewish writer, Tanya Reinhart, a Professor of Linguistics and Cultural Studies at Tel Aviv University, has commented:1
“Sharon, now Israel's Prime Minister, describes its present war against the Palestinians as `the second half of 1948' . . . By now there can be little doubt that what they mean by that analogy is that the work of ethnic cleansing was only half completed in 1948, leaving too much land to Palestinians. Although the majority of Israelis are tired of wars and of the occupation, Israel's political and military leadership is still driven by the greed for land, water resources and power. From that perspective, the war of 1948 was just the first step in a more ambitious and more far-reaching strategy.”
It is for such reasons that in a recent European opinion poll Israel was regarded as a greater threat to peace than Iraq and other such countries. This perception is well based, in so far as intense resentment amongst Arabs of Israeli oppression has fuelled radical Islamic groups and continues to do so. The United States has been an obstacle in these regards. At the instance of the wealthy and powerful New York Jewish lobby successive American governments have vetoed United Nations' resolutions censoring Israel and have provided money and support for oppressive Israel policies.
The response to these unpleasant facts by many Jewish supporters of accusing their critics of being “anti-semitic”2 represents an important attempt to blackmail and to preclude the proper discussion of Israeli actions.

That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to have my tabling statement incorporated in Hansard. 
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The committee reviewed thirty-four Auditor-General's reports tabled during the fourth quarter of 2002-2003, and selected three for further examination at public hearings. These were;
	Audit Report No. 42, Managing Residential Aged Care Accreditation
	Audit Report No. 51, Defence Housing and Relocation Services; and
	Audit Report No. 55, Goods and Services Tax Fraud Prevention and Control. 
In essence, the committee probed the operational efficiency and the maintenance of the integrity of three nationally important management systems,
	aged care accreditation;
	Australian Defence Force housing costs and availability; and
	Goods and Services Tax fraud control.
Mr President, rather than discussing the committee's findings in great detail, I would like to highlight the significant observations that emerged from each of the three reviews.
Aged care is increasingly important to an already sizable, and ever-growing, sector in the Australian community. Accreditation of aged care homes by the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency seeks to underwrite the quality standards of those aged care facilities.
The aged care accreditation system experienced some early teething problems. Although accreditation of residential aged care facilities was established in 1997, the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency could not commence audits until the gazettal of principles in September 1999. This left the Agency with a severe time constraint which contributed to inefficiencies, and to inconsistencies in judgements and decisions during the first round of accreditations. The committee notes, however, that many of the early problems associated with maintaining accreditation standards deriving from the peaking of the Agency's workload around three-year accreditation cycles, are now being resolved. 
The committee is satisfied that an acceptable level of consistency was achieved during the second cycle of accreditation which is now complete.
Mr President, I remind Senators that this inquiry was not about the quality of aged care per se, but rather it was about monitoring systemic standards that would deliver quality improvements in aged care homes.
Although evidence showed that clinical quality improvements have ensued, the committee sought to discover whether residents' quality-of-life had actually been enhanced since accreditation commenced. No witness could provide convincing evidence that it had. This not to say that quality-of-life hasn't improved; it's just that no supporting data were proffered.
Hence, the committee recommends that quality-of-life information be collected along with the clinical data for feeding into accreditation decisions. The committee is adamant, though, that there must be no additional costs incurred by aged care facilities in meeting these broader criteria. Nor should the accreditation process be more complicated.
I will now comment, Mr President, on the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the agreement between the Department of Defence and the Defence Housing Authority (an independent commercial entity) established to manage the provision of housing and relocation services to Australian Defence Force personnel. 
The committee notes that housing classification inflexibility has meant that Australian Defence Force housing demand is not always being matched cost-effectively by commercial market supply. Review of the classifications may be necessary to resolve this issue.
The Defence Housing Authority Act 1987, requires three Defence Force personnel to sit on the Defence Housing Authority. This poses some potential for conflict of interest.
I'll explain my point this way. The Department of Defence negotiates with the Defence Housing Authority over housing contracts. It is conceivable, therefore, that Australian Defence Force members on the Defence Housing Authority may end up in the future having to negotiate with themselves.
The committee recommends that the requirement to have three Australian Defence Force personnel sit on the Defence Housing Authority be removed from the Defence Housing Authority Act 1987. To provide an alternative avenue for Australian Defence Force personnel to have a voice in strategic decisions affecting their housing, the committee recommends that the role of the existing Defence Domiciliary Group be expanded to include a formal consultation function with the Defence Housing Authority. 
Mr President, I turn now to the third review which undoubtedly has potentially broader consequences—GST fraud control.
The committee recognises how fundamentally important it is to have the nation's taxation system operate free of fraudulent behaviour. This point was reinforced by the Australian Taxation Office officials who acknowledged at the hearing that containing Goods and Services Tax fraud indeed poses a significant challenge for the Australian Taxation Office.
The committee is pleased to note that Australia's Goods and Services Tax system compares favourably with systems of similar type used overseas. This is, in the main, due to thorough preparatory research by the Australian Taxation Office, of relevant international value added tax regimes. So the system is good.
The committee found, however, that GST fraud remains a major tax revenue loss area. The committee is seriously concerned with not only the revenue loss, but also the potentially destructive impact on taxpayers should any laxity by the authorities in pursuing tax dues, connote a wrong signal to all taxpayers.
GST fraud is prevalent in the cash economy but determining the magnitude of the cash economy has proved to be difficult. The committee endorses the efforts of the Australian Taxation Office to capture tax owing on cash transactions using a variety of tools. Australian Business Number registration and monitoring has been particularly successful.
To date major fraud has been heavily targeted for investigation and prosecution. The committee is pleased that minor fraud is now increasingly being captured cost-effectively using tools such as a tax evasion hot line. In addition digital systems are being employed to risk rate GST payers and by so doing, prevent fraud before it happens. The Australian Taxation Office has also up-graded its non-compliance capability and is in the process of installing a new case management system that will record and report on Goods and Services Tax fraud. 
The committee is concerned, however, that instances of `borderline fraud' appear to be escaping prosecution because the relevant statutory definitions of `fraud' are too stringent. The Australian Taxation Office is instead forced to handle this range of fraud administratively. To give the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions greater clout to prosecute `borderline fraud' successfully, the committee strongly recommends that the proof of fraud be eased marginally through amendments to appropriate statutes.
In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to express the committee's appreciation to those people from the several government agencies and private organisations who contributed to the reviews by preparing submissions and giving valuable evidence at public hearings. 
On behalf of the Chairman of the committee, I also wish to thank the members of the committee, particularly its Vice-chair Ms Plibersek, for their time and dedication in the conduct of these inquiries. My thanks also extend to the committee Secretariat for its professionalism in carrying out its duties.
Mr President, I commend the report to the Senate.

The committee is satisfied that an acceptable level of consistency was achieved during the second cycle of accreditation which is now complete.
Mr President, I remind Senators that this inquiry was not about the quality of aged care per se, but rather it was about monitoring systemic standards that would deliver quality improvements in aged care homes.
Although evidence showed that clinical quality improvements have ensued, the committee sought to discover whether residents' quality-of-life had actually been enhanced since accreditation commenced. No witness could provide convincing evidence that it had. This not to say that quality-of-life hasn't improved; it's just that no supporting data were proffered.
Hence, the committee recommends that quality-of-life information be collected along with the clinical data for feeding into accreditation decisions. The committee is adamant, though, that there must be no additional costs incurred by aged care facilities in meeting these broader criteria. Nor should the accreditation process be more complicated.
I will now comment, Mr President, on the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the agreement between the Department of Defence and the Defence Housing Authority (an independent commercial entity) established to manage the provision of housing and relocation services to Australian Defence Force personnel. 
The committee notes that housing classification inflexibility has meant that Australian Defence Force housing demand is not always being matched cost-effectively by commercial market supply. Review of the classifications may be necessary to resolve this issue.
The Defence Housing Authority Act 1987, requires three Defence Force personnel to sit on the Defence Housing Authority. This poses some potential for conflict of interest.
I'll explain my point this way. The Department of Defence negotiates with the Defence Housing Authority over housing contracts. It is conceivable, therefore, that Australian Defence Force members on the Defence Housing Authority may end up in the future having to negotiate with themselves.
The committee recommends that the requirement to have three Australian Defence Force personnel sit on the Defence Housing Authority be removed from the Defence Housing Authority Act 1987. To provide an alternative avenue for Australian Defence Force personnel to have a voice in strategic decisions affecting their housing, the committee recommends that the role of the existing Defence Domiciliary Group be expanded to include a formal consultation function with the Defence Housing Authority. 
Mr President, I turn now to the third review which undoubtedly has potentially broader consequences—GST fraud control.
The committee recognises how fundamentally important it is to have the nation's taxation system operate free of fraudulent behaviour. This point was reinforced by the Australian Taxation Office officials who acknowledged at the hearing that containing Goods and Services Tax fraud indeed poses a significant challenge for the Australian Taxation Office.
The committee is pleased to note that Australia's Goods and Services Tax system compares favourably with systems of similar type used overseas. This is, in the main, due to thorough preparatory research by the Australian Taxation Office, of relevant international value added tax regimes. So the system is good.
The committee found, however, that GST fraud remains a major tax revenue loss area. The committee is seriously concerned with not only the revenue loss, but also the potentially destructive impact on taxpayers should any laxity by the authorities in pursuing tax dues, connote a wrong signal to all taxpayers.
GST fraud is prevalent in the cash economy but determining the magnitude of the cash economy has proved to be difficult. The committee endorses the efforts of the Australian Taxation Office to capture tax owing on cash transactions using a variety of tools. Australian Business Number registration and monitoring has been particularly successful.
To date major fraud has been heavily targeted for investigation and prosecution. The committee is pleased that minor fraud is now increasingly being captured cost-effectively using tools such as a tax evasion hot line. In addition digital systems are being employed to risk rate GST payers and by so doing, prevent fraud before it happens. The Australian Taxation Office has also up-graded its non-compliance capability and is in the process of installing a new case management system that will record and report on Goods and Services Tax fraud. 
The committee is concerned, however, that instances of `borderline fraud' appear to be escaping prosecution because the relevant statutory definitions of `fraud' are too stringent. The Australian Taxation Office is instead forced to handle this range of fraud administratively. To give the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions greater clout to prosecute `borderline fraud' successfully, the committee strongly recommends that the proof of fraud be eased marginally through amendments to appropriate statutes.
In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to express the committee's appreciation to those people from the several government agencies and private organisations who contributed to the reviews by preparing submissions and giving valuable evidence at public hearings. 
On behalf of the Chairman of the committee, I also wish to thank the members of the committee, particularly its Vice-chair Ms Plibersek, for their time and dedication in the conduct of these inquiries. My thanks also extend to the committee Secretariat for its professionalism in carrying out its duties.
Mr President, I commend the report to the Senate.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2004-03-30,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, Senator Payne, I present the report of the committee on the provisions of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2004, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Report of Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title>,Miscellaneous,26,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-30,"—The date at the end of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 gives an indication of how long it has taken to come on for debate in the Senate. It was introduced, as the title suggests, in 2002 and it has basically languished on the Notice Paper since that time. It was examined by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and a report was brought down which raised some concerns—not a wide number of concerns but some concerns. They have been addressed to a fair extent in the House of Representatives. The Democrats still have one concern, which I will touch on in a minute.
I have said before and I will say it again because it needs saying each time: this is a case again where the Senate committee process has worked well. It has drawn out some potential flaws—in this case I think inadvertent to some extent with some of them—has clarified potential misunderstandings, has highlighted a potential injustice and has therefore led to an improved piece of legislation. That needs to be said every time because this government continues from time to time to run the myth that the Senate is obstructionist and gets in the way of the government's mandate or the government's agenda or the government's legislative program. This is just the sort of bill, quite frankly, that the government would point to and say, `See, this bill is two years old and we haven't been able to get it through the Senate.' The reason they have not been able to get it through the Senate is that they have not brought it on for the Senate to debate. Now we do have that opportunity and I welcome it. 
The migration area is a very important one that in some ways may seem as though it is often in the media but that, in my view, actually does not get the amount or the type of attention it deserves. It gets attention about a few narrow components of the issue but the broader, very wide-ranging number of issues that come under the migration umbrella are often not given the focus they deserve by the public, the media, the parliament and, indeed, by many parliamentarians. The opportunity to highlight a few of those issues is one that I welcome.
The bill itself is what is often called an omnibus bill: it deals with a whole lot of unconnected matters. It has six schedules which do not particularly relate to each other, and none in themselves are enormous matters; nonetheless, each matter can and does affect individuals, some of them significantly, even if the number is small, and therefore it should be examined properly. There are a number of amendments that have been circulated in the chamber for some time relating to other matters, given that this is an omnibus bill and it deals with six unrelated matters. We have a couple of amendments that deal with some extra matters that do not relate specifically to the individual schedules in the bill but certainly relate to the Migration Act. Those deal with temporary protection visas—something which the Democrats have spoken about many times. These were visas whose introduction the Democrats opposed but were nonetheless unsuccessful in preventing. I will speak on those when we get to the committee stage. There are also some amendments relating to detention of children—another area that has caused significant community debate, as it should, because it is very significant issue. There is a component of the bill that the Democrats do not support, and I will move an amendment that goes to that when we get to the committee stage as well.
I will speak to a few of the components in the legislation. As I said, it has six schedules. Schedule 1 is one of those classic areas that might perplex people and show some of the curiosities that can apply in migration law. The schedule amends the act to clarify the status of non-citizen children who are born in Australia. These children are taken to have entered Australia at their birth. It might sound fairly self-evident but, according to law in the migration area as it stands at the moment, that is not necessarily the case. This schedule seeks to clarify beyond doubt that, when a child is born here, even if they are not a citizen—particularly if they not a citizen—they are nonetheless deemed to have entered Australia and be in Australia, and that can affect the visas that they are entitled to. So it is important to clarify what might seem a fairly self-evident situation.
There is a broader debate about citizenship, citizenship status, resident noncitizens and, indeed, non-resident noncitizens and the potential for that to be another grouping of people. That is a matter that is actually before the High Court at the moment. From memory, it is a case in the matter of Singh, where judgment is currently reserved, to deal with the ramifications of children who are born in Australia to non-Australians and whether those children acquire citizenship or some other status that is not citizenship but is not an unauthorised entrant. That is a broader matter before the High Court and obviously we will find out what the decision is on that in the near future. I have been assured by departmental officials that this schedule in no way impacts on that. It does not look to me like it should impact on it. But, again, in something that is occasionally as arcane as the Migration Act and the curiosities within it, it is worth specifically stating that it in no way should affect or impact on that upcoming High Court decision which relates to non-citizen children who are born in Australia. This schedule simply relates to clarifying that they are taken to have entered Australia and therefore be in Australia at the time of their birth. 
Schedule 2 is a minor one, which the Democrats support, relating to authorising the taking of security. Schedule 3 makes a couple of amendments relating to special purpose visas. It is an area that potentially had some concerns for the Democrats in relation to lack of natural justice. Once the circumstances under which this provision will operate—and the only circumstances under which it can operate—were clarified, those concerns were satisfied and we are willing to let that pass without further comment.
Schedule 4 is a minor schedule to create a deputy principal member position for the Migration Review Tribunal. It is something that we support. It gives me the opportunity to once again raise the issue of the significant delay in the matters before the Migration Review Tribunal. Whilst I recognise that there has been some improvement in the length of time it takes for matters to be determined before the tribunal, particularly in the last 12 months, there is still room for improvement. The Democrats will continue to highlight that issue and pressure the government and the tribunal to do more to get the decisions made as quickly as possible, in some migration decisions, anyway. When people are appealing a decision of the department, time is important and we need to have those decisions made as quickly as possible.
I also draw attention to concern about the high percentage of tribunal decisions that overturn the initial decision of the department. In one sense that is good, because it shows the tribunal is doing its job; in another sense it is bad, because it shows there is a high degree of error or at least incorrect judgment made at the initial stage. There is justification for some of those decisions, given the amount of information available at the primary stage. Perhaps more information is provided by the time a case gets to the tribunal stage. But that does not justify by any means all the cases that are overturned. The rate is still very high. It is well over 50 per cent in certain visa categories. That is not acceptable at all.
The Democrats do not support schedule 5. The minister's statements have a very innocuous description. They simply say that certain offence provisions in the act operate as they did prior to the commencement of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. That was the sole explanation all along, back when the Senate committee was looking at this. In practice it means that, with certain offence provisions, strict liability is put in place. In effect, strict liability means a much tighter requirement for the person who is accused to prove their innocence. It is one of those areas where ignorance is no excuse. They have to clearly prove that there was no offence. It is virtually a reversal of the onus of proof, although perhaps not strictly in a legal sense. The Democrats do not believe that that is appropriate for the offences outlined in the bill, one of them relating to spouse visas and the setting up of fraudulent spousal relationships for the purpose of spouse visas. Any type of deliberate misleading is of course unacceptable and inappropriate but we do need, in the Democrats' view, to ensure that in pursuing deliberate fraud we do not go for overkill and end up catching people who may be innocent or naive parties. The Democrats will seek to delete that schedule when we get to the committee stage.
The final schedule makes a range of different amendments. It is an area in which the wording is quite confusing. There have certainly been a range of different views about how the wording will be interpreted. I do not know whether there is any other way that could have made it clearer. Sometimes when the initial act is complex and confusing and interconnects a range of different sections, it is pretty hard to deal with loopholes in a way that removes all doubt without using amendments that in themselves are difficult to comprehend or that are subject to different interpretations. 
I looked at it a couple of years ago when it went to the committee and I have refreshed my mind again in recent times. In fact, I have refreshed my mind a few times along the way because this bill has risen to the top of the Notice Paper a few times, almost come on, disappeared again off into nowhere land for months on end and then reappeared. Frankly, it is almost a shock to have it finally come on for debate. Having recently refreshed my perspective on it, I am satisfied that it seeks to achieve what it says it seeks to achieve, which is that if people are in Australia on a bridging visa and they pop across to New Zealand and come back then they are, for the purposes of their visa, deemed to have stayed in the country the whole time. That prevents people using a loophole to get around restrictions that may be on the bridging visa. That is the intent. It is an intent that I support, having convinced myself that the wording actually reflects the intent.
Overall, the Democrats support the bill apart from one schedule, which we will seek to delete. This particular bill has been a long time coming. Clearly, it is not the highest priority, given it has taken so long to make its way up through the other competing priorities on the Notice Paper. This is certainly another example, even on this less important matter, of the Senate doing its job appropriately. It highlights again—and I do want to reinforce the point—that the focus in the Senate on the balance of power role is occasionally on one or two big ticket or big publicity issues such as the sale of Telstra, for example, which we had earlier today. That was quite rightly thrown out. The balance of power and the role of the Senate in scrutinising legislation apply to all of the bills. I think we have dealt with 320 or so bills in the last couple of years, including the so-called minor ones like this. They will never have the public interest of the Telstra sale and there is no particular reason why they should. But they are still bills that affect people and people's lives for better or worse and we have to make sure that even on the so-called unimportant bills we get it right. The Senate has done its job again in relation to that. Just how right we get it we will see once we get to the end of the committee stage—we might make the bill even better. It highlights again that the role of the Senate is absolutely vital and that the job of the Senate, with its balance of power, involves doing the work across the range of issues, on the not so important as well as the important bills, to make sure that the task which people put us here to do is done.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2004-03-30,"—I agree with Senator Bartlett that immigration and migrants are important to Australia. That is why the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 is important as part of the law that underlies our immigration program. Senator Bartlett has gone through the bill in some detail in his speech; I do not intend to do the same. Instead, I shall record the fact that in his second reading speech the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs said that the purpose of this bill is to make a number of amendments to and enhance the integrity of the act.
This bill deals with a simple issue—the integrity of our immigration law. Specifically, it deals with the vexed question of how to manage the welfare of people who come to Australia claiming—but not always proving—to be refugees. While their claims are being established, or more commonly when their claims have been disproved, we need to manage their welfare consistently with regard for human rights and at the same time maintain the integrity of our migration program and protect our national interest. But the Labor opposition and the Democrats have made the issue complex by proposing a number of amendments which would, in fact, put at risk the balance of Australia's proven anti-people-smuggling measures and thus threaten the very integrity of our immigration program. 
At the time of the 2001 census, there were 4.1 million Australians who were overseas born. More than half of them—2½ million of these first generation Australians, these Australians by choice—were not only migrants but migrants from a non-English-speaking background. Ninety-nine per cent—indeed, perhaps 99.9 per cent would be a more accurate figure—of these good people would have come to their adopted country, their home by choice, after meeting Australia's strict but fair immigration selection criteria, whether they came as skilled migrants, through family reunions, as business migrants or as refugees through our exemplary humanitarian resettlement program, which has to date brought more than 620,000 refugees and displaced persons to settle in Australia.
Having met these criteria themselves and being beneficiaries of Australia's fair and objective migration law, these Australians have a right to know that these same criteria are still applicable and that the integrity of our law remains intact. They have a right to know when, how and why these criteria are changed and, more importantly, they want to be assured that any changes will be for the good of Australia. There is a special context in which I rise to speak tonight—I do so on behalf of these 2½ million Australians, migrants from non-English-speaking backgrounds, to consider how and why it is proposed to change the migration legislation this time.
In particular, I wish to consider the changes proposed by the Australian Labor Party. I know that the Democrats have also proposed a number of amendments, but I shall pass over these since Senator Bartlett has already indicated general support for the bill and since the Democrats have no real prospect of taking government and cannot be expected to be responsible. The Labor Party, on the other hand, is a pretender for government and must be accountable for what it proposes. The Labor proposals, therefore, need to be considered for what they are worth.
Properly scrutinised, only one conclusion can be drawn about these Labor amendments. They are merely a smokescreen for Labor's lack of ability to add value in the face of the strong measures the government has already introduced in response to the scourge of people-smuggling. These amend-ments fall into two sets. Those in the first set ostensibly seek to strengthen the already strong and effective anti-people-smuggling measures the government has in place.
However, by proposing penalties that are disproportional to accepted standards, these Labor amendments actually enable more lenient penalties in application. For example, section 229, 230 and 232 offences are strict or absolute liability offences. Proof of fault is not required for these offences. Given that, the new penalties proposed by the Labor amendments are draconian to the extreme and thus recognised will simply be ineffective. Vessels are currently forfeited under section 261A of the Migration Act if the master and/or owner knows that the vessel has been used to smuggle people to Australia. This is a discretionary power so that, if it becomes obvious that seizing such a vessel means that its passengers will have to be brought to Australia's migration zone for their refugee claims to be processed, then other options may be exercised. The Labor amendments, on the other hand, will ensure that any passengers on such a vessel will have their refugee claims processed in Australia, giving them access, regardless of the merit of their claims, to the Australian legal system outside of the international refugee assessment process. Such an outcome clearly will be contrary to Australia's national interest. It is certainly worth noting that the Labor Party has so far failed to own up to this dangerous implication of its policy. 
The proposal of mandatory forfeiture regardless of prior knowledge will also lead to the ludicrous outcome of making a 747 aircraft carrying one unauthorised arrival subject to mandatory confiscation. This is a manifestly unworkable proposition. Labor penalties clearly depart from the established judicial benchmarks on many points. For example, under section 4B(2A) of the Crimes Act the maximum fine that can be imposed by a court for an offence that carries a term of life imprisonment is only 2,000 penalty units. In contrast, Labor's amendment to section 233(2) equates 10 years imprisonment with 5,000 penalty units. Perhaps Labor is advocating that a life sentence is equal to 4 years imprisonment. Is this another Latham social initiative?
Labor should be well aware that drafting criminal offences and penalties requires careful consideration and that there has to be consistency across the Commonwealth so that the penalty appropriately fits the crime. Given the Labor Party's involvement, when it was in government, in the development of the Criminal Code, this is a sheer mockery of our legal system and a shameful attempt to deceive the Australian people. I might point out that Labor is also proposing a tenfold increase in fines generally, from the order of $10,000 to the order of $100,000. Given that most of the offenders are noncitizens from Third World countries, $100,000 is simply not an understandable figure to be a deterrent. The question must be asked: does Labor really not understand how people in poverty think, or does Labor simply feel that this is good for the all-important three-second sound bite?
The proposed offence where a people smuggler causes the death of a noncitizen while bringing them to Australia—that is, proposed new section 233AA—is superfluous. If such an offence were currently committed within Australian territorial waters, state or territory offences of murder or manslaughter would apply and these carry the same penalty range. If such an offence is committed outside Australian waters, the Criminal Code already deals with causing death in the context of extraterritorial people-smuggling. The existing offence carries a maximum 20-year penalty. Again, where does Labor add value?
Similarly, the proposed offence of assisting a people smuggler to evade prosecution—that is, proposed new section 233AB—does not add anything to the range of offences that can be applied, since aiding escape and accessory after the fact are already well-defined offences. The proposed offence of financial support for people-smuggling operations—that is, Labor's proposed new section 233AC—is actually less stringent than existing measures. Money laundering, for example, carries a maximum penalty of 25 years or 1,500 penalty points. Therefore, these Labor amendments are mere grandstanding. They are simply a disgraceful attempt to score political points.
Existing people-smuggling offences are proving effective. Since 22 July 1999, 459 prosecutions have been finalised, resulting in 437 convictions of crew members under these offences. In addition, there have been 10 convictions of people smugglers, and another 11 cases are pending. Labor should be supporting this bill, which will provide some necessary and sensible measures in the interests of protecting the integrity of our migration processes. 
The second set of Labor amendments introduces a schedule 7 to the bill. In fact, Labor seems to be introducing two lots of schedule 7. Maybe this is simply another manifestation of the confusion Labor engenders whenever it has to take a policy position. One of these versions of schedule 7—that is, the one on sheet 2858—is subtitled `Immigration Detention—Special Arrangements for Children'. The other, on sheet 4195, is subtitled `Amendment of Migration Regulations 1994' and purports to establish a two-year regime for temporary protection visas. I do not quite see the point of the second of these schedules, and I think the best I can do is ignore it. But the proposals contained in the first of these schedules are rather fun to analyse.
These are best characterised as smoke-and-mirror tricks which allow Labor to offer up a bowdlerised version of measures that are already in place but which are so hedged about as to seriously compromise the integrity and effectiveness of the system. For example, the proposed section 197D provides that `as soon as possible' an unaccompanied child must be released into the care of a foster family or other guardian. This is already done. The amendment is absolutely not necessary. The minister for immigration has an ultimate and unambiguous duty of care to such a child under the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act. Does Labor intend to remove this responsibility from the minister? This amendment implies that. Who then should have that duty of care in law? This is no small matter, not even to the Labor Party.
In summary, the government has successfully met the challenge posed by international people smugglers. Last Tuesday Minister Vanstone announced a 50 per cent increase in Australia's offshore refugee resettlement program—the program that assists those refugees whose status is absolutely clear and who are most in need of assisted resettlement. This is proof, if any proof is needed, that our anti-people-smuggling strategy is working. Labor should take note of that fact and act responsibly for once.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2004-03-30,"—As we on the crossbenches deal with the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, we have to firstly acknowledge that, with the Labor Party supporting the bill despite a number of concerns they raised in the House, our votes on the substantive content of the bill are not critical. Therefore, I will look at the bill only briefly. The bill tightens up the Migration Act. It closes some so-called loopholes, and it will make it more difficult for some people who seek refuge in Australia. It changes the status of children who are born in Australia to that of their parents. If, for example, the parents are non-citizens on special purpose visas, the children are non-citizens. Basically it means that no longer are you an Australian citizen just because you were born here. It also toughens the penalties for people-smuggling offences, which is very welcome. I do look with some caution at some elements of this change, because we may catch people whom it was never intended to penalise. But tightening Australia's attitude toward people smugglers is very positive, so generally this bill does not create a lot of concerns.
I will now make some general comments about our mandatory detention policies. Firstly, yes, we must make sure that we do not open the floodgates to terrorists and to people who are just looking for better paid jobs. But people facing terror and persecution in their country of origin are entitled under international law to travel, to escape, to seek refuge and to look elsewhere for a place for them and their families. We must support and help these men, women and children, and we must deal with them humanely and fairly. We should not refuse refuge to those fleeing from persecution. 
We do have an obligation to assist those less fortunate than us, and this includes those who have arrived here unannounced—those who cannot find a queue to join and those who were duped by people smugglers. More and more Australians believe we should extend the hand of friendship and assistance to those who risk life and limb in leaky boats to get here. Those whom I have had contact with over the years are escaping murderous regimes or fleeing persecution or looking for a life where their children have some chance of a reasonable education and some opportunities to live a life without constant fear of trauma.
Many of the people we have incarcerated behind barbed wire are religious refugees. Many are members of minority religions like the followers of St John the Baptist who were locked up in Woomera when I was up there a couple of Christmases ago to deliver presents to children. These groups also include more moderate factions of the dominant religion of the particular country. The persecution of these peoples in their home countries is well documented.
As we look back we find that, in the past, people fleeing religious persecution were once accepted into Australia very readily, for example some of the Lutheran settlers who came to my home state in previous centuries. But today we have a government that has encouraged Australians to reject genuine refugees. It encourages us to support the barbed wire, the detention camps and the indefinite locking up of people, many of whom have no country to go back to.
I now return to the bill. With the ALP supporting the substantive issues in the bill, we are now focused very much on the amendments, particularly those moved by the ALP that will see children released. As I have said, I absolutely oppose the present detention system that keeps children locked up. I object to it as a whole but in particular I object to locking up children, who I believe will be scarred for life as a result of their experiences behind the barbed wire. I will support any amendments that give genuine refugees opportunities to re-establish their lives free of violence and the threat of persecution and, in particular, I will support any amendments that will get children out and keep families together. Hopefully we as a parliament will soon begin to undo the system we have in place and move to a more humane process for working through the identity checks, health checks and everything that is needed. Hopefully when the election is out of the road we can take some of the heat out of the issue and make some major progress on this. Of course, we must find out exactly who people are and whether their claims to be refugees are genuine, and then we must support those who are genuine. In this place I will support whatever legislation or whichever specific amendments undo the current inhumane system, particularly for children and families.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-03-30,"—I rise to add my comments to the discussion on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. In particular I want to focus on the provisions for temporary protection visas. By dragging out the time and uncertainty for refugees on temporary protection visas rather than concentrating on harsher penalties for the people smugglers, the government is adopting a `blame the victim' attitude and furthermore is ignoring the wishes of a large number of Australians in rural and regional areas. Members of this parliament may recall that last November we received a delegation from Rural Australians for Refugees, a grassroots group representing the concerns of more than 60 rural and regional communities across Australia. The delegation was made up of members of Rural Australians for Refugees and representatives from local councils. They came to Canberra to highlight the contribution refugees make to rural communities across the country. The delegation told parliamentarians that refugees living in country towns are fitting in and making a big contribution to the local economies. Spokeswoman Lara McKinley said these communities want the refugees on temporary protection visas to stay. 
John Walker, the Mayor of Young Shire in my home state of New South Wales, was part of the delegation. In his community the local meat-processing plant, Burrangong Meat Processors, relies on refugees to provide labour. According to Mr Walker, the town could not get enough local employees to work at the abattoir and workers had to be sourced from elsewhere. The refugee workers in Young are Afghans from the Hazara community, an ethnic minority in their homeland. They are Shi'a Muslims from the central mountainous part of the country, and they are here on temporary protection visas. They fled—as have many on temporary protection visas, as Senator Lees suggested—from fear of racial discrim-ination and persecution by the Taliban regime, which threatened them with torture and execution. According to Mr Walker, they have proved to be excellent workers.
The group spokesman was Assad Mehri, a young single man who fled to Indonesia and arrived in Australia aboard a people smuggler's fishing boat. His parents, brothers and sisters still face problems in Afghanistan. Mr Mehri said that the workers appreciate the freedom they have in Young. He said, `We can go anywhere we like and do things we like to do. We'd love to stay, but if the government tells us to go home we will go home. We will follow the laws.' The company, BMP, decided to officially sponsor these men so they could stay in the country and become a permanent part of its work force. In the words of the proprietor, Grant Edmonds, `The men are all gentle and polite, who fit in well with our work force. They certainly aren't taking away any jobs from locals. We couldn't find enough people to work here.'
Then there is Ian Skiller, who has a farm in Tooleybuc in south-west New South Wales. He also wants the refugees employed at his farm to stay in Australia. He has employed up to 15 refugees at one time on the farm and says that since he started employing extra workers he has been able to expand his operation from six hectares to 20 hectares. He says:
I've had an Afghani picking crew on my farm for the past two years. They are great blokes. They really miss their families and the uncertainty of their situation takes its toll on all of us. It would be a great blow to my farm and to my region if they were sent back. They should be allowed to stay.
Mr Skiller has appealed to the federal government to review the process for granting temporary protection visas, as he would like his employees to have a more certain future. Not only has Mr Skiller benefited financially from having TPV holders working on his land; there is also a huge financial benefit to the country to be considered. Rural and regional Australia could lose millions of dollars and a regional labour shortage could be exacerbated if refugees are not given permanent status in Australia, according to Janet Carr, a spokesperson for Rural Australians for Refugees. She says: 
If our government was serious about regional economic development they would grant permanent protection to refugees and give them a real chance to put down roots in our communities.
TPVs are granted to people who are recognised as refugees but have travelled to Australia without valid documentation. Of course it is necessary to have strict migration legislation, but sometimes the inflexible rules can cause inhumane suffering. I am thinking of the Sammaki family, for example. I am sure everyone here recalls the dreadful situation of little Sara and Sabda Sammaki, whose mother, Endang, was killed in the terrorist bombings in Bali, where she had gone to get legal advice regarding her husband's detention in Baxter detention centre. Her husband, Ebrahim Sammaki, was in Australia on a TPV and under the terms of his visa was not permitted to leave this country and go to Bali where, as every right-minded person would agree, he needed to be at that time; and the children were not allowed to visit their father for fear they might remain in this country illegally. Fortunately, that particular knot of red tape has been dissolved and the children are now here with their father, where they should be, but their situation highlights the need for more compassionate and flexible migration legislation.
Offshore issued TPVs that do not allow an application for permanent protection at any time should be eliminated, and Labor will be moving an amendment to do that. This amendment is in keeping with Labor's awareness of the suffering and uncertainty of TPV holders. Labor supports a one-off TPV period for all unauthorised arrivals and believes that a two-year period is ample time to do the necessary background checks to determine the status of new arrivals. Under this model we can reduce the amount of anxiety unnecessarily suffered by so many refugees. In what could be called a win-win situation, we could be helping ourselves as well as the refugees. It is widely recognised that we have a demographic problem in rural Australia. Just a few weeks ago the Parliamentary Library hosted a vital issues seminar on this very topic, and I know that a number of members of this chamber attended that seminar because they recognise the urgency of encouraging migration to the regions. There is plenty of evidence that country and regional towns see a solution, or at least a partial solution, to their problem in asylum seekers and refugees.
Rural Australians who want to show refugees that they are welcome as our future citizens have begun signing and writing messages in welcome books. These books, inspired by the sorry books that were so successful in the reconciliation process, have proved a very popular idea. Each asylum seeker in the detention centres will eventually receive one, and the thousands of messages will also be presented to government. City people have also taken up the welcome books with enthusiasm. The concept of welcoming refugees into our communities rather than fearing them is nothing new. Another idea that reflects the way country people are thinking is the proposal for a welcome towns project put forward by Mr Ken Davidson, a vet from Moss Vale, on Radio National's Bush Telegraph.
In these times of international suspicion and unrest, it is vital to have effective immigration controls and especially to come down really hard on people smugglers. But having a strict migration policy does not require us to cause unnecessary suffering by dragging out the time on TPVs of people who have already endured enough; nor does it cause us to disregard the contribution many of these people can make to our country or the wishes of all those rural Australians who would be happy to give them a home.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2004-03-30,"—I rise to speak to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. Not a great many of the amendments that the government have put forward in this legislation are particularly notable. This is part of the normal path of ensuring that the fabric of our border protection, which is made up of the threads of regulation, continues to be inspected to ensure that there are no holes. The intent of the legislation is to ensure that the provisions operate as the Migration Act originally intended. 
I would like to speak briefly on the Labor Party amendments that have been proposed in this place today. `Disappointing' is a word we often use for the contributions of the Labor Party in this place, but it is particularly disappointing that this is clearly a smokescreen. It must be very difficult for the Labor Party to come here and add value. It is very disappointing to see that this series of amendments that they have suggested does not do that. In fact in some cases, as has been said already today, these amendments step outside the standard Commonwealth criminal law policy. They are not an additional deterrent and do not act as a practical deterrent. In some cases, what Labor have recommended would in fact mean more lenient penalties.
This is an area that the government has scrutinised continuously, and it is tremendous to see that we have a history of ensuring that the penalties in place are those that will ensure a deterrent. We had some very tough penalties for people-smuggling offences in 1999. In 2001 we decided it would be an extra deterrent to include mandatory minimum sentencing. We sent a very clear message: `If you come to Australia to trade in human lives you will be detected, you will be caught and you will be punished in a way that will provide a sufficient disincentive to others.' The whole idea of a punitive mechanism is that it provides a disincentive, and that is a very important part of the policy.
To those people who have said that it does not appear to have worked—and that argument has been put by those on the other side of this place—I say that since July 1999, 459 prosecutions have been finalised. Of those, 437 people have been convicted under this legislation. There have been 10 convictions of people smugglers and 11 are pending. That is testament to the success of this legislation and this government's continued involvement in this very important process to build not only strong border protection but also strong disincentives to ensure that people do not put the lives of their families at risk.
Some of the amendments proposed by the Labor Party have provided for mandatory seizure as if it is something new. It is very disappointing. I can remember another life when we built 16 artificial reefs off Darwin out of the very vessels that were confiscated under the current arrangements. But this is a very sophisticated issue and it needs a sophisticated approach. In relation to these amendments I know that Senator Tchen has already mentioned in this place the 747s and those sorts of issues, where these amendments will catch people in innocent passage. The amendments have not been particularly well thought out. Under these amendments we would even have the situation where it would be mandatory to confiscate a cargo vessel which people had come over on. Nobody would know they were there but under these amendments that vessel would fall under a mandatory confiscation. That would be a ridiculous outcome. This whole process has been fraught with ridiculous policy suggestions from those on the other side. And this has to be hard to top.
I often wonder about the behaviour of Mark Latham. One day when he is speaking about the United States he behaves like a benzedrine puff adder and nothing it does is right, but the next day he is a sycophant. He has a quick look around: `I don't know where I put my border control policy; we'll borrow the United States policy. We'll just take it holus bolus.' The United States is a completely different environment and has completely different issues but the Labor Party will just borrow theirs: `We'll all put on a special hat and put a red stripe on the side of the boat.' That is an absolutely ridiculous approach, characterised by Mr McClelland. I remember reading an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 10 March when he suggested we use 10 additional patrol boats. He has obviously forgotten that we already have 15 Fremantle class boats and eight Bay class boats. They are exactly the same size as the Labor Party are suggesting; it is just a duplication of what we have already. Mr McClelland also suggests we have snipers in helicopters. Talk about off-the-wall policy! Welcome to Australia! Can you imagine serving our obligations under the refugee convention by going in a helicopter and shooting—with high-powered rifles—at people in boats with the intention of stopping their passage to Australia? This would require a .50 calibre rifle, which would be the only type that could penetrate about 12 inches of timber and go through the roof of the decking to get to the inboard motor. What a welcome to Australia! What a ridiculous policy approach these people have to this matter. This is a very serious matter. I condemn the suggestions and proposed amendments of the Labor Party as laughable, unhelpful and misguided. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-30,"—I would like to speak not as the minister closing the debate but as a private senator for Queensland with an interest in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. The changes in the bill are, in the main, technical in nature and do not change the underlying policy settings of the act.
—Keep talking.
—Thank you, I intend to. All in all, I think the legislation brought forward by the minister is good legislation and I urge the Senate to support it.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-03-30,"—I would like to join the debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 very briefly to respond to the second-last speaker from the government, Senator Scullion. When government senators want to stand up and talk about off-the-wall policies and how dangerous and lunatic some policies are, I think it is time they had a good look in the mirror. This government presides over a policy that directly led to the deaths of two refugees. When they tried to turn back a boat—they tried to tow a boat back out to sea and it began to sink—ultimately the Navy were not able to save everybody on that vessel. And two refugees attempting to come to this country, in flight from persecution, drowned. So when the government senator talks about policies that are off the wall or policies that sound a bit mad, I say that he should have a good look in the mirror, because the policy he put his hand up for—the policy that the government want to champion around this country—directly led to the deaths at sea of two refugees. That is a shame on this country and it is a shame on government policy; no government policy should lead to that outcome. No matter how well intentioned the policy may be and no matter how well intentioned the government senators believe the policy to be, the hard facts are that two refugees died at sea because the Navy were doing their best to enforce the government's policy and doing their best to ensure that they turned the boats back. When that happens there has to be something wrong with government policy because they are no longer protecting— 
—It is your policy to turn boats back, as well.
—Not when it leads to people dying, Senator Vanstone. Our policy is to capture the boats and take them to Christmas Island. That is our policy. Our policy is not to turn them back.
—You do not know what your policy is.
—I know exactly what our policy is, Senator Vanstone. Our policy is not to lead to people drowning at sea. That is not a policy I would ever be proud of, and you should not be, either. However well intentioned you believe that policy is, you have to have a look at it and say, `This is a consequence of the policy.' It is just a fact; it is what happened. If you can live with it, that is fine. That is what happened; you cannot dispute the fact that it happened. That fact is sitting there. The Navy did their best. No-one is critical of the Navy for doing their best but what happened—
—I am terribly sorry; I am prepared to point at you and say that when people end up dying it is not a good policy and it needs to be revised. That is what Labor has proposed—a revised policy—and some of the amendments are being debated today. I can only invite you to read what your second-last senator wanted to accuse the Labor Party of, so do not come in here not having heard all of the debate, Senator Vanstone.
—I will come in here when I like, sonny Jim.
—Do not come in here not having heard all the debate and try and put on some mock outrage, okay. Do not come here with mock outrage when your senator has been here accusing the Labor Party of all sorts of off-the-wall policies. I think we are now ready to go into committee so I will happily end my contribution, but get all the facts on what your second-last speaker said before you want to join the debate, Senator Vanstone.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-03-30,"—I understand that there is agreement around the chamber that speeches for the second reading debate be incorporated. In view of the hour, I seek leave to incorporate my speech.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 is the first piece of legislation to be introduced to the Parliament to amend the flawed Higher Education Support Bill since it was passed last December.
Frankly I am not surprised to see amendments to this bill. It was, from the very beginning, a shoddy document, full of dangerous policy, hastily, and just plain badly, drafted.
It is claimed that this Bill is addresses minor technical and drafting issues, and transitional complications. But there are matters here that are not minor for Notre Dame University.
In the unseemly rush to allow Notre Dame access to HECS places, the 2003 act afforded the private Catholic University table A status until 2008.
The Minister himself conceded in the House that this had it unforseen consequences” for the university.
That means there has been an almighty stuff up!
If these changes are not made, Notre Dame would only be able to receive funding through Commonwealth grant scheme for programmes deemed national priorities - ie nursing and teaching. That would mean that Notre Dame places for indigenous and ICT students may not be funded.
Furthermore, section 36-35 of HESA requires providers to ensure that at least 65% of places in undergraduate courses must be Commonwealth supported places - ie not full fee places.
Likewise the changes to the National Protocols that is part of the Commonwealth' agenda, regarding to the size and makeup of university governing bodies, are not possible without State legislation. Universities are not able to adhere to the Commonwealth new requirements, through no fault of their own.
This hasty fix also includes a distinct change of policy to increase the Minster's discretion to allocate funding under the Commonwealth Grants Scheme.
This is the scheme that made $404 million in desperately needed university funding contingent on the Howard Government's industrial relations and governance policies.
When we considered the substantive Bill last year the unprecedented Ministerial discretion, the Big Brother powers that Brendan Nelson was granting himself, came under strong criticism.
This Bill further extends that discretion.
Buried at the very end of the `Miscellaneous Amendments' in Schedule 5 is a proposal to give the Minister discretion to approve Commonwealth Grants Scheme funding for 2005.
The Minister will be empowered to provide funding if he is satisfied that universities had attempted to meet his conditions, irrespective of whether the conditions had actually been met or not.
How will anyone know what attempts have been made and whether they amount to anything?
This is the same Minister who urged the Senate to pass his package, as a matter of the highest urgency. He told us repeatedly that:
If we do not undertake change now, this sector will be on a collision course with mediocrity.
(MPI, 24 June)
Last year, you would have thought the world turned on whether the governing bodies of universities had 21 members or 18 members and whether universities employed their staff on AWAs. Three months later, this bill makes them an optional extra at the discretion of the Minister. 
Labor does not believe that Government should be interfering in internal university management, regarding AWA's, governing bodies, or any number of other areas that Dr Nelson's legislation meddles with.
Labor believes in university autonomy, academic freedom, and student choice.
Thus we do not object to this amendment, which loosens what are already draconian provisions.
The Bill itself
The fact that this bill is in need of amendment, just three months after it was rammed through, goes to its nature.
Before they embarked on their vote-buying spree in the lead-up to the passage of the Higher Education Legislation last year, the bill was dangerous, shoddily drafted, and highly interventionist.
After the Government had bought its way through the Senate, it was even more of a mess.
It is now a deeply divisive and regressive piece of Legislation, that completely lacks policy integrity. It is a complete mess.
So what have we seen as the bill begins to make its grubby mark on our troubled university system.
1.	Tens of thousands of students missing out on places that they are qualified to have;
2.	Universities scrambling to impose the 25% fee increases because the Government has drained them of funds through woeful indexation of their grants, and 
3.	local undergraduates forced to take full fee paying places, the rise of the $100,000 degree and more.
And this is only the beginning.
Equity
Lets have a look at what this bill means for equity.
We know that 26,000 full-time students from low socio-economic backgrounds including 2,500 full-time indigenous students start university each year. The Government's new laws are an insult to these students.
The paltry 2,500 scholarships offered up are no compensation for the creation of an increasingly divided system, which compounds disadvantage.
Shortage of publicly funded places and full fee places
The Prime Minister is fond of talking about the 32,000 “new” places. There are no 32,000 new places.
The Government is removing 32,000 so-called overenrolled places.
The Government is contracting places, not expanding them, at a time when it is imposing all sorts of other pressures to increase demand. The 32,000 places will go gradually, up to 2007. There are to be no growth places to 2007.
At least 20,000 students missed out on a place last year, this year's numbers are not issued yet, but are likely to be the same or worse. The cumulative effect is a tragic waste of talent—a tragic waste of potential that is not in the national interest.
The Howard Government are happy to let some Australians continue falling behind.
Last year Brendan Nelson told Australian families that some children are simply not `biologically or socially equipped to finish school or go on to further study, later that there was a `natural limit' on who is suited to go to university.
But he didn't stop there, he went on to warn that if access were opened up to too many Australians:
`you'd have people with IQs of around 90 going to university' (SMH 31/1/04)
This is an impoverished view of the role of the university in society. Labor believes in the transforming role of the University. The ability of Universities to improve the way individuals live their lives, but also the state of the national as a whole, in terms of economics—jobs and productivity—as well as social cohesion and well-being.
Labor believes that universities are critical, forward-looking, progressive institutions that nourish a healthy society.
Looking for a moment to research, we know that funding levels are not sufficient to sustain world-class research. Our investment in research continues to fall behind our international competitors 
Australia's Gross Expenditure on Research and Development as a proportion of GDP has been falling since 1996, at a time when our competitors are boosting their investment. The gap is getting wider and wider, we are falling further and further behind the rest of the world.
Falling behind is not just a mater of concern to the people whose jobs are on the block.
Our researchers nourish the nation in social and economic terms. They are critical drivers of job growth and productivity. They are critical to Australia's prosperity.
It is not difficult to see the stark contrast between Labor's vision, and that of the Howard Government.
The Government “vision” is about producing a winners and losers system, with the already advantaged able to advance and those most in need of assistance left to languish. The Government's package boosts social division, and entrenches disadvantage. It turns the gap between the winners and losers into a gulf!
It is a basic argument.
None of the great things universities and research do for the nation can happen if qualified and enthusiastic students cannot get a place, without a fat wallet.
This is why Labor will properly fund the 25,000 over-enrolled places, and create another 20,000 new places for Australians each year.
In the absence of enough HECS places the Howard Government is pushing more Australians into full fee places, costing $100,000 or more.
So the Government has created a system, drained of places, drained of funds through woeful rates of indexation for University operating grants, which allows universities to increase fees by up to 25 per cent.
What happens next is simple economics. Universities are, not surprisingly, involved in a mad scramble to increase their fees.
Ten universities to date have said they will increase their fees, and many more will follow. The Government has made much of the fact that some will decrease fees. But let us look at the two that have said they will drop fees.
It is not difficult to see here a concentration of power, privilege and wealth, in an already divided system. This is simply not sustainable.
Increased private investment is not the cure-all that Dr Nelson has made out.
It cannot compensate for inadequate Commonwealth funding, to compensate for the neglect of a Government that refuses to live up to its obligations.
Former head of the Higher Education Division of the Department of Education Science and Training said that even if every university increased their fees by the full 25%, it would at best compensate for inadequate indexation of operating revenues for 3½ years.
So once the HECS hike has been absorbed by growing fees, there's nothing left.
So a measure that imposes enormous pain on students is essentially a stop gap. After 3½ years universities will be right back where they started.
Only Labor can stop this terrible trend.
Only Labor will abolish full fee degrees for Australians, and we will do it immediately we win Government.
Only Labor will reverse the 25 per cent fee hikes imposing crushing debt on students, again immediately we win office. Only Labor will acknowledge the Commonwealth's responsibility to fund universities properly—stop the backward slide—and impose reasonable indexation of university funding.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2004-03-30,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—
I rise to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. 
I don't think any of us on this side of the house are surprised to see this bill, a Bill which contains a number of relatively minor amendments relating to technical and transitional issues. We aren't surprised because we knew this legislation was flawed right from the start.
That was one of the reasons that the Democrats didn't want this legislation rushed through the Senate last December. But the Minister who in his haste to pass the Bill last year was too busy making deals with the “Gang of 4” and the Vice-Chancellors that he didn't have time to make sure his legislation was properly drafted.
You would think that after 2 reviews and a legislative review that Dr Nelson would have been able to get it right. Instead of accepting some of the criticisms of the legislation from the Senate committee's report “Hacking Australia's Future”, he ignored this report and now we have to fix parts of this flawed legislation with 89 amendments to an Act that is not even 4 months old! Not only that, but the Government had to make over 100 amendments to their own bill last December.
Make no mistake though, despite all the Band-Aids on this legislation it still leaves the Higher Education sector's wounds festering.
One of the band-Aids in this Bill will increase Ministerial discretion—already at extraordinary levels in this Act—to allocate $404 million worth of funding through the Commonwealth Grants Scheme. 
The Minister's bizarre attempt to improve university governance—and his pushing of the Government's ideological workplace relations regime onto universities—by tying the $404 million of funding to these provisions were key arguments in his case for reform last year. 
The Minister said “There are many things in these measures which are popular and there are some things that are not always well received by all people, but we are committed to doing what is right.” 1
The changes proposed in the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements (HEWRR) were not received well - in fact they were rejected by the entire sector—and yet the independents still allowed a compromised version of these requirements to remain in the legislation.
These so-called key reforms, that last December were so important for universities, now only have to be partially met under amendment 10 in Schedule 5 of this Bill.
This amendment also allows the Minister to allocate Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding in 2005, if he is satisfied with a universities effort to meet the criteria.
I wonder how many of the National Governance Protocols universities will have to meet to satisfy the Minister of their worthiness for funding? Will the Minister disclose to this Parliament which points of this program have been met by each university and the State Governments?
This amendment is important because if it isn't clear what criteria are being met in 2004, how do we know which ones are being met in following years when the Minister still has discretion over this funding? 
Rest assured that the Democrats will be watching how committed this Minister is to following through on what he thinks is right for universities.
The problem caused by inadequate indexation of universities grants for over a decade is still not solved in this legislation. 
The AVCC is still arguing that base university funding should increase by $1,200 per place in 2004 prices- in recognition that higher funding levels are required to maintain the quality of education necessary for Australian students. 
Since 1995 the indexation shortfall has been estimated at $600 - $700 million2, a considerably larger amount than $404 million.
So, instead of tackling the big issue of indexation—which still appears to be the number one request from the AVCC - Dr Nelson `reformed' the sector by limiting the number of members on University Councils and told universities that if they want more money they'll have to get it out of students. And then 3 months later announces record levels of funding for private schools. What a slap in the face for the Vice-Chancellors that must be...
The hike in HECS fees, dubbed `flexible HECS' was sold by Dr Nelson (with support from the Independents) telling us that “In some universities charges will go up and in some courses, as I have already been advised by Vice-chancellors, they may well go down...” and “For the very first time, universities will set a HECS charge between zero and a level which is no more than 25 per cent above current HECS levels”. 
The Independent Senators assured the public that despite the potential for a scare campaign on fees, there was nothing to worry about. Senator Lees at the time said, “I have spoken to the Vice-Chancellors at USA, UWS and also Flinders and none of them have any intention of lobbying for an increase—indeed, they are going to lobby against increases with their governing bodies. We will not see that potential increase in HECS charges.”
On the fourth of March the Adelaide Advertiser reported that Flinders University's Vice-Chancellor had presented a confidential report to the University Council proposing a 25 per cent increase in HECS fees, stating “it is my considered view that Flinders University should take the opportunity to increase HECS levels ... the recommendation is that HECS be increased uniformly by 25 per cent”.
Dr Nelson and the Independents may as well have told universities to just set their HECS charges between current levels and 25 percent above that, because that is the reality we are now seeing. The proposed flexibility of HECS has just turned into a straight fee hike in most universities.
The Minister also told us that universities “...need the flexibility to determine the value of their courses and to set HECS charges”, arguing that deregulation of HECS went to the heart of quality and market differentiation.
But when Queensland University of Technology decided to increase its fees by 25% across the board, the Minister described the decision as “facile, ridiculous and nonsensical”. Perhaps the Minister doesn't understand the complexities of deregulation? 
Once you have argued adamantly that universities should be allowed to set their own HECS fees—within a range—it is extraordinary for the Minister to then complain about a university acting within his policy framework.
Dr Nelson has already indicated that he will use his Ministerial discretion to control funding to courses that he believes are not suitable and it appears that he would also like discretion over which universities can increase fees, despite having pushed for the deregulation himself!
Universities across Australia are increasing their HECS fees for 2005 by the full 25 per cent in what could only be described as an `inflexible' approach to setting HECS fees. 
The failure of `flexible' HECS—apparently delivered in response to Vice-Chancellor's requests—to provide a diverse cost structure that includes 2005 HECS fees below the current rates, and is somehow related to quality, is the first failure of Dr Nelson's policy of `Backing Australia's Future'. 
This first policy failure of backing Australia's Future has taken only a few months to become evident, however the flow-on effects of increased debt for students will be felt for many years.
So far nine universities have said they will increase their fees by the full 25 per cent in most courses, the University of Southern Queensland will increase HECS by 20% in most courses and only 5 universities have stated they will maintain their current HECS prices for 2005. 
Last year, Sydney University declared that it would increase fees across the board by the full amount, before the legislation was even passed. This was a clear indication of how much universities thought they were being under funded. From this it should have been understood that other universities would follow Sydney's lead and increase their fees across the board.
The Senators on this side of the Chamber knew that most universities would jump at the chance to increase fees. The Government was even warned during the Senate Committee hearings into this legislation about what would happen, by Professor Chapman - 
“The system with its current arrangements must inevitably mean that if there is no change to the indexation then this price instrument [increased HECS] will cause a radical change in the burden of financial resources. No institution will be able to survive down the track without increasing the HECS charges. ...All the institutions down the track will ...have higher HECS arrangements.”3 
But would the Minister listen? No!
It is now perfectly clear that universities believe it is necessary to increase fees and the consequences of greater student debt appear to be a minor consideration in their deliberations.
The most recent university to increase fees by 25% and expand domestic undergraduate full-fee paying places was the University of Queensland. Their Senior Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Paul Greenfield gave the following reasons for increasing HECS from next year - 
“Students have a legitimate complaint - but it is the funding model adopted by the Commonwealth Government which should be the object of their criticism, not universities,” 
“Chronic and continued government under-funding has given UQ - like most other Australian universities—little option but to reluctantly increase fees. 
“During a decade of under funding, UQ has consistently urged the Commonwealth Government to provide greater funding for universities. 
“Instead, in legislation enacted last year, the Commonwealth decided that the urgently needed additional funding for universities should be provided partially through a user-pays system.”
Universities are increasing their HECS, but can Australian students afford the higher HECS fees? No.
Australian students already have the fourth highest fees in the world; with a 25% increase they may be paying the highest fees in the world to attend a public university. The total HECS liability for 2004 is estimated at $2.064 billion with the accumulated HECS debt set to surpass $10 billion this year (according to DEST and AVCC).
Professor Chapman - often referred to by the Government - told the Senate inquiry `Hacking Australia's Future' that, Government funding for higher education has fallen from 85% in 1987 to just over 45% in 20024. 
The HECS increases outlined in these bills mean students will pay, on average, about 44-56%5 of the cost of their tuition and in some cases they may be paying more than the cost of their course. In the face of this evidence the Prime Minister still has the hide to say last Friday, on radio in Melbourne, that the average contribution of a student to a university course will be about 28 per cent of the total cost of that course.
In his submission to the inquiry, Professor Chapman showed that the introduction of differential HECS in 1997 increased the disparity of participation rates between `rich' and `poor' students. 
ACOSS and Professor James, in their submissions to the Senate inquiry, identified debt aversion as a real factor in students deciding whether they will undertake higher education and predicted a drop in the participation rates of students from low SES backgrounds and rural and isolated areas. Links have also been made between HECS debts and declining home ownership and fertility rates.
Recent research conducted by Professor James and the Centre for the Study of Higher Education (CSHE) at the University of Melbourne for DEST on equity groups participation, entitled Analysis of Equity Groups in Higher Education 1991-2002, shows students from low SES backgrounds are still majorly under-represented in higher education and are a key area of concern. Their retention rates are declining and they are still under-represented in many of the high-status courses such as law and medicine. 
Another aspect to the shift of costs from the Government to students is the increase in the number of domestic undergraduate full-fee paying places. The Minister says these places will provide greater opportunity for Australian students and that the tens of thousands of students who miss out on a HECS place because of insufficient marks should take up this “fair deal”. 
This deal may be fair to someone who can afford to pay $100,000 for a degree or is prepared to take out a FEE-HELP loan on which you have to repay 120 percent of what you borrow, but for the majority of Australians these options are out of reach.
The main barrier to entry into university remains the lack of Government funded HECS places, which is well recognised by the entire sector.
The Democrats won't be opposing this Bill because we believe that this Government has been failing to provide adequate funding for universities since it took over from Labor, who also failed universities. The universities desperately need more funding from this Government and not from students. 
Unfortunately the arguments around university finances and fee increases have increased recently. Just last week Ms Rhonda Galbally resigned from the Monash University Council declaring their decision to increase fees “morally and educationally reprehensible and against good governance”. But why should it come to this—Councillors arguing with Councillors, students and staff arguing with management?
It is clear that the Government now has a fight on its hands in the universities, to implement its so-called reforms, as we will see tomorrow in the National Day of Action. The Democrats' will fight against these regressive reforms and for equitable and accessible higher education.
I think that this is only the beginning of the unrest that will be felt within institutions as a result of this Government's fundamentally flawed higher education legislation that is inequitable, unsustainable and even after more than 200 Government amendments it is still hopelessly flawed.
We will be supporting the ALP's amendments.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2004-03-30,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—
The Higher Education Support Bill was passed on 5th December 2003. This current bill now before the Chamber is a combination of implementing last minute aspects of the deal done with the Independents, difficulties that would have arisen from trying to implement the bill in its original form, and minor drafting errors.
This bill brings about minor funding changes, an easing of conditions on the $404m funding under CGS and $1.5m for 2004 and 2005 for Indigenous education
Since the original Higher Education Support Bill passed, several universities (9 to date) have raised their fees but none have reduced them.
This is scarcely surprising when one considers how they have been grossly under funded since 1996 when the Howard Government came in to power.
But then—how hypocritical can you be? Having opened the door for universities to raise their fees, (and indeed forced them to do so by years of under funding) when QUT actually does so, the Minister has the gall to attack them and suggest they should be tougher on cost cutting rather than raising their fees! Of course, what he really meant was attack staff conditions, which too are already bad enough.
As is the norm for this highest ever taxing government, they still pass as much of the costs of anything on to users as they possibly can—the students and their families in this case.
They still try to justify their policy as equitable. They offer paltry scholarships to assist those less well off, but up to $4000 per annum will do little to alleviate the hardship and the final HECS debt burden round the graduates necks. A debt burden that government seem to see as almost insignificant but one which will force graduates to put off home buying and starting a family for years.
So we now have reports of student families re-mortgaging their homes to pay university fees; of students having to work at paid jobs, sometimes 2 or 3, where hours worked exceed hours of study.
In The Age of 22nd March, Shane Green ( Education Editor) wrote “Poverty among university students appears to be worsening, with a growing demand for soup kitchen style free food services for cash strapped students “
He went on to report that at least 2 student organisations in Victoria are providing such services, while the Salvation Army are seeing many more students seeking food vouchers.
The AVCC too is lobbying for a better deal for students at a time when government income support is just too low. 
So congratulations Mr Howard—I hope you and your government feel proud of creating this dire situation and now making it even worse for our students by allowing fees to go up even more.
But I want to look at another aspect of the initial reform proposal which many universities acted on but is now removed from the legislation—that was the proposal for the government to severely interfere in the governance of universities in the size and make up of their governing boards.
This was always highly contentious, and as with much of the government proposals, such as linking funding to workplace reform, nobody could really see any academic justification for it. Just how limiting Councils to 18, banning certain categories of person from membership, insisting on certain qualifications or experience for others, limiting student and staff representation, would benefit universities was beyond most people.
It was though only a part of the proposed regulation over universities. As The Hacking Australia Report said ( P117) this government has “the intention of diminishing the role and status of universities through heavy handed regulation. Universities are to be reduced to being `higher education providers': selling a service to a purchase, the government, on terms dictated by the government and at the non-negotiable price the government is willing to pay”
As was also said in the “Hacking Australia Report” (Ch3 P69) “.. as the [government] funding is reduced the supervisory intrusion increases.”
Professor le Grew (Uni of Tasmania) said in evidence to that committee “. . . What is a problem is the way the legislation is shaped. It gives potential for the over emphasis on control and for intrusion on the integrity and autonomy of the university...” (Hacking Australia Report P 70).
Professor Gavin Brown (Uni of Sydney) said “It is very strange that a Liberal Government prefers `bureaucratic central planning' with its attendant rigidities over a flexible, more devolved mechanism which would be more responsive to market forces and student demand” (Committee hearings)
Professor Le Grew had also reminded the committee that we have 1000 years of history built on the charter of Bologna—guaranteeing universities a sense of autonomy (Report Pg 70). However it is hard to believe this government either knew or cared about such charters in their drive for control over higher education. Perhaps they knew what they were proposing would be unpopular and thought that by such control they could stifle comment and debate.
So while Vice Chancellors head institutions dedicated to the furtherance of knowledge, these are not always valued by those making public policy who like to try to ram square pegs into round holes and who see this as an accomplishment.
However, they came unstuck and again have had to do a back flip. The structure of university councils was something under the control of state and territory governments and not something that universities could easily influence—it was realised that state or territory legislation was needed to enforce these proposals. Since one of the conditions being imposed was that state or territory parliamentarians would be barred from university council membership, few state governments might comply!
So this element of Federal control has been removed, although too late for my own NT electorate where CDU had felt sufficiently threatened to comply in setting up their new council as they changed from NTU to CDU.
So the bill under debate now removes this element of control over university council structure as a condition of funding which is a welcome and sane move.
It also offers other funding changes including some additional funding for indigenous higher education in the NT—$1.5m in each of 2004 and 2005 although there are strings attached before BIITE or CDU might see this released. However, Bachelor Institute have commenced a review to develop a strategic plan which is part of the conditions attached to this funding.
Unfortunately what it does NOT do is alleviate the additional HECS fees being imposed on students, or make higher education access more equitable. It still leaves those wealthy enough to pay full fees at an advantage over less well off . It still leaves tens of thousands of young Australians unable to get a place in higher education. 
That is why Labor are moving substantive amendments to this bill to reverse the 25% HECS increases, abolish full fees for Australian undergraduates and introduce proper indexation of university funding grants.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2004-03-30,"—Under normal circumstances, at the end of this debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 the minister would thank everybody for their contributions and make some remarks about them. But, as the speeches were incorporated, I have not the slightest idea what you are saying. I have to say that in the middle of my 20th year in this place this is not a practice I personally endorse. I think it diminishes the standing of parliament. But I do realise it is the end of this period and we need to get on with it. People might have liked to expel some air from their lungs and they might be doing us a favour by incorporating. That may well be the case and I hope they accept my explanation for not being able to give either serious criticisms or compliments for what they may have said, since I am unaware of what they are saying.
Question agreed to.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2004-03-30,"—As the Senate would know, this week is National Youth Week, which seeks to mark and celebrate the contribution of younger members of the Australian community. It has been running in this nation for four years. As a unique celebration of young Australians it has the support of all state and territory governments. This government launched National Youth Week in 2000 in recognition of the value of the contribution of young Australians to Australian society, and I am very pleased that the government continues its strong support of the event.
In 2004, due to, I suspect, the enthusiasm and natural inclination of the participants, there are more than a thousand events to be held across the country marking Youth Week, including one this evening where, I understand, the Hon. Larry Anthony, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, took part in an online forum at 8.30 tonight giving young people the chance to interact with him in an easy and accessible manner.
All of us who have the opportunity to visit schools on a regular basis know that it does not matter what questions are put to you in the chamber or what questions are put to you in the process of committee work or anything else, the most challenging usually come from the young people we meet in schools, from virtually primary age up. I can just imagine that an online forum would be equally challenging.
I also want to recognise the value of the National Youth Roundtable, a great opportunity for the participants but also for members and senators to meet participants from all around Australia to judge for themselves the extraordinary calibre of the intellectual contribution of these young people and the effort that they make in raising issues of extraordinary importance to them. I have always found my attendance at and opportunity to observe the activities of the National Youth Roundtable a very valuable experience.
I think one of the most important things that we can do as members and senators regarding the welfare, wellbeing and development of young Australians—and I think the government does this—is to take them seriously and respect the role that young people play in this nation. Whether it is programs aimed at developing the confidence of Indigenous youth to continue their further education and training or go into employment, or programs that allow young Australians to develop their own video or online game concepts, we have set out to comprehensively engage in a very positive way with the lives of young people. They are very real programs, they are on the ground and they help real young people achieve their goals and make their own contribution to society now and, one imagines with that accomplishment under their belt, most definitely into the future.
As a government we have invested very heavily in education and training as the basis for ensuring young people can get the best out of themselves so that they can develop their lives. In fact since 1996 we have invested in creating more than 580,000 New Apprenticeships positions, and over the next three years we will be directing in excess of $3 billion to the states and territories for them to pursue their responsibilities as well to provide an effective system of vocational education and training. That is not to mention the reforms in higher education recently adopted by the parliament which will see some $11 billion delivered to universities over the next decade—money aimed at giving the universities the flexibility and sustainability that they need to continue to deliver a good education system for young Australians to become world leaders into the future.
I think there is much more to the story, though, than simply throwing money to try to overcome problems and concerns. One of the approaches that the government takes is to work constructively to develop partnerships with local government, businesses and non-profit organisations for working with and for young Australians. That partnership approach characterises much of the work of the government, and I have spoken about it before in other contexts. It is equally important here. 
There is absolutely no denying that we live in a time of phenomenal change. It is a time when information moves at lightning speed, where email and text messages are everyday life. This generation of young Australians simply expect information to be available, and available quickly. It has also changed the way we do business as elected representatives. Our offices receive hundreds of emails a day—and I know that is the case in many other realms of business, of course. What it means is that we have a world of information available to all, but most importantly, in this case, to young Australians. 
Technology has changed the way we think about business, about learning and even about recreation. It seems to me that the most adept users of technology are usually those who have grown up most recently immersed in it—not necessarily those who may have had to learn new skills with a set of preconceived notions. The opportunities that technology provides are usually stunning to many of us, but they are a part of everyday life for young Australians. They want access to information. They want answers, usually from us, and they want them in real time—the same way that they use the technology. The problems that that fundamental shift in interaction pose, and will continue to pose, are the problems that young people will have to deal with as the society they inherit even accelerates that change.
I want to look briefly tonight at two aspects of modern life that I find of great concern or great interest to many young Australians that I meet every day but most particularly across western Sydney, where I work. Young people are incredibly and acutely aware of the impact that we as a society and a community have on the environment, and they are in some cases its most passionate protectors. From using high SPF sunscreen as a normal part of life to seeing recycling as the norm not a new practice, environmental awareness is subconsciously a part of their daily routine in every way. Even the growth in the membership of environmental groups amongst young Australians points to that increasing awareness of environmental concerns. It is increasing, of course, because the world that we leave behind is the world that will be their reality. So it is only natural that they want to play a part in how we treat that world, and they tell us in no uncertain terms what they think about it.
There are a couple of achievements of the government which I think are worth noting in this area. Firstly, there is the enormous investment in environmental projects through the Natural Heritage Trust established in 1997. In 2000—the same year that the first National Youth Week was held—we directed an additional $1 billion to that trust. It reminds me of programs like Green Corps, which will offer over 1,700 more young Australians the opportunity to develop their skills and contribute to a range of environmental projects across the country over the next three years. Just a quick review of the web site for Green Corps is a very stimulating experience in and of itself. The opportunity it gives young people to participate in projects designed to preserve and restore Australia's natural environment and heritage is a very stimulating story. If you have the time to look at the case studies from Green Corps, from one end of this country to the other—literally, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, from your state of Tasmania to the northern tip of Cape York—you will see that they are fantastic activities and they really engage young Australians in supporting and protecting the Australian environment. 
The second issue that I want to talk about is in the area of health. You might think that is a very broad dichotomy but I think it provides a penetrating insight into how acutely aware young Australians are of the issues that really matter to them now and will in the future. As a government we provide significant funding for a whole range of projects that continue to make a difference in the lives of so many young people. I want particularly to draw attention tonight to the mental health of young Australians—and I have spoken about this before. Under the National Mental Health Strategy and the National Suicide Prevention Strategy we are developing and implementing a major mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention and suicide prevention agenda for children and young people. It is primarily aimed at schools but it targets a number of special needs groups in the community as well. It is called the MindMatters suite of initiatives. It is a comprehensive and complementary set of promotion, prevention and early intervention mental health and suicide prevention subinitiatives to fit a `whole school' framework. It includes MindMatters, MindMatters Plus, MindMatters Plus GP, FamiliesMatters and ResponseAbility, and now also StaffMatters and MindMatters International. This gives a universal framework in secondary schools for mental health promotion and suicide prevention, and it provides a range of resources related to the three arenas of curriculum and learning, school ethos and environment, and partnerships and services. 
In relation to these initiatives, there are other programs supported by the government, and I particularly want to comment on the ReachOut! initiatives with which I have had some contact over the years. A radiothon was run on radio 2JJJ some years ago to raise money to support ReachOut! and the then minister, Mr Warwick Smith, was a very strong advocate of the work of the organisation and the Inspire Foundation behind it. It troubles me that so many young Australians are considered to have such extraordinarily challenged lives in terms of their own mental health. We as legislators and members of this place need to be very aware when we are walking into their environment, into their world, that that is so often what they are confronting.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>National Youth Week</title>,Adjournment,31,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-03-30," asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 9 January 2004:
With reference to the suicide of ABRO Mark Andrew Starling in March 2002:
(1)	Will the Navy implement the recommendations of Cmdr Gary Barrow RAN, who conducted an inquiry into `Whether there was any failure to follow the applicable procedures or whether there were any factors that may have led to the delay in finding ABRO Starling'.
(2)	Will the Navy institute an inquiry into the circumstances leading to ABRO Starling taking his own life in particular; (a) whether ABRO Starling was subjected to undue pressures within his naval career; (b) whether his naval superiors recognised, or should have recognised, that he was in such stress that he may take his own life; (c) whether adequate psychological support was available; (d) whether he was encouraged to use the available psychological support; (e) what changes should be instituted to protect other seamen who might experience similar severe psychological problems.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,"<title>Defence: Starling, Able Seaman</title>",Answers to Questions on Notice,33,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-03-30,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)	Yes. The recommendations from Commander Barrow's Report have been implemented. Commander Barrow was appointed by the Commanding Officer HMAS Stirling on 11 March 2002 to inquire into a range of matters relating to procedures dealing with absentees, not with the circumstances of the tragic death. That was a matter for the coroner.
(2)	No. It is not Navy's intention to institute any further inquiry into Able Seaman Starling taking his own life. As the incident was one that involved the Western Australian Coroner from the outset, all records were forwarded to that office for the sole purpose of establishing the cause of death. The coroner found that the cause of death was suicide.
	(a)	At the time of Able Seaman Starling's tragic death, the Royal Australian Navy had no evidence to indicate that he had been subject to undue pressure during his naval career. In fact, he was well reported upon.
	(b)	The Royal Australian Navy had no evidence that Able Seaman Starling was under stress such as would, or should, have been apparent to his superiors that he may take his own life. 
	(c)	At the time of Able Seaman Starling's death, the Australian Defence Force (ADF) had in place a comprehensive mental health strategy that included access to psychological support for all personnel, and provided guidance on recognising signs of psychological distress. 
	(d)	As previously noted, there was no obvious indication that Able Seaman Starling was suffering any psychological problems. 
	(e)	However, there is no evidence that AB Stirling suffered severe or other psychological problems. The reasons for his tragic death are unknown. The ADF framework for providing the best possible mental health support continues to evolve. Key developments over the past two years include:
(i) The ADF Mental Health Strategy, developed in consultation with the Australian Centre for Post-traumatic Mental Health;
(ii) Enhancement of the ADF Critical Incident Mental Health Support program, a process of intervention with individuals who have been involved, either directly or indirectly, in a Critical Incident or Post Traumatic Event;
(iii) Establishment of the ADF Suicide Prevention Program an overarching framework for a comprehensive approach to fatal and non-fatal suicide related behaviours amongst ADF members; and  
(iv) Improved mental health support to operationally deployed forces.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,"<title>Defence: Starling, Able Seaman</title>",Answers to Questions on Notice,33,1,answer
