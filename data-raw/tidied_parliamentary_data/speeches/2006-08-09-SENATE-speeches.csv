"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2006-08-09,"—Last night I was making the point about the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 that this bill is more about opportunity than it is about a lack of opportunity. The bill represents an important step towards enabling Indigenous people in the Northern Territory to obtain an economic advantage from the land which, over the last 30 years, under the land rights legislation, has been transferred to the ownership of those Aboriginal people. It is important that we therefore consider in this legislation a shift in the paradigm whereby such land might be used for the benefit of its traditional owners. The fact remains that it has been the case that that land has, for the most part, not been available for such economic exploitation, and this has unquestionably worked to the disadvantage of Indigenous people in the Northern Territory.
I want to focus for a moment on one particular proposal in the legislation, which is that it will be easier for Indigenous people to own their own homes and businesses on land in townships. The scheme was developed by the Northern Territory government. It is important to put on the record that it is not an initiative of this government but in fact was proposed by the Northern Territory government. What is more, it is a proposal which is entirely voluntary and would apply only to townships where most of the residents are not traditional owners. Traditional owners have the power under these proposals to set lease conditions and retain freehold title to the land. It is not about the alienation of Indigenous land—at least not for more than 99 years.
The federal government can only offer homeownership to townships if land tenure issues are resolved. Land councils do have a role to play in respect of this, but the decisions are principally ones for owners of townships. The dynamics which these changes engineer are ones which permit a use of land which is much closer to that which occurs in other parts of Australia. For instance, it will be possible now for individual Indigenous people or families to obtain ownership, at least for 99 years, of a parcel of land. It will also be easier to regularise the arrangements whereby a business might operate in or move to a township and have a form of land tenure which is much more like what they might enjoy in another part of Australia.
At the moment, many such businesses, if they operate in those areas, operate under a licence arrangement. It is very difficult to see how any business would be willing to invest a large amount of capital in the growth and development of a particular business when there are such uncertain arrangements about the use of the land on which those businesses are based. I think that this development offers the prospect of much better use by and attraction to business of parcels of land for commercial operations.
It is true that many Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory would not be able immediately to take advantage of provisions that allow them to purchase their own homes. It is true that the level of disadvantage in many communities is such as to not make those provisions immediately available for the use of many people. Senator Siewert made that point in her remarks yesterday. But I would say to the Senate that the fact that not everybody is able to take advantage of provisions of this kind should not be an argument against making it possible for those who can.
The argument that if all cannot benefit then none should is a very weak argument indeed. The fact is that some land councils in the Northern Territory are keen for these provisions to be available; some are ready to take advantage of these provisions and to put in place arrangements for better commercial use of land and for ownership to be transferred to people who live in those townships under the 99-year lease arrangement. I think it is unconscionable for the Senate to stand in the way of those arrangements merely because some people in other parts of the Northern Territory may not be in a position to take up and use those arrangements immediately.
Senator Siewert made the comment yesterday that under these proposals traditional owners lose control of their land for four generations—for 99 years. That is true up to a point but, first of all, the conditions under which such leases are to be granted are essentially conditions that are set by traditional owners before the initial 99-year lease occurs. Secondly, if there is a loss of control for those 99 years, or four generations, it is no more or less than occurs in many other parts of Australia where leases are granted and where a measure of individual or corporate ownership occurs over land that is otherwise owned by somebody else for a period of time that approximates with that 99 years. If it works in other parts of Australia and if it is acceptable as a device for the commercial exploitation of land in other parts of Australia, why is it not acceptable on Aboriginal land?
The bill means that many townships under Aboriginal control will need to have a different way of looking at the land that exists in those townships. But it is clear to anybody who visits many of those communities that there is a serious problem in those communities, a problem rooted in poverty and a lack of opportunity, and a problem which the present settings do not adequately address. I believe that it is important that we rethink our approach towards the issues in those communities, and this is part of that process. It is part of introducing the kinds of motivations, the kinds of commercial dynamics, in those communities that apply in other parts of Australia. I have no reason to believe that the principles that work in other parts of Australia would not work in these communities as well. I emphasise again that the 99-year township leasing program was one that was originally proposed by the Northern Territory government and was supported, at least in principle, by a number of witnesses who came before the inquiry by the Community Affairs Legislation Committee in Darwin a few weeks ago.
The arrangements proposed in the legislation with respect to mining provisions are somewhat less controversial. They make for easier and clearer pathways for decisions to be made on exploiting the potential to mine on Aboriginal land. Again, the whip hand is retained by traditional owners. It is they who determine the essential conditions under which such arrangements are worked out. Many of the somewhat outdated impediments to making decisions on that land are to be removed by this legislation and I think they are widely seen as being appropriate steps in the right direction.
There are other provisions in the legislation dealing with, for example, the potential to create new land councils which attracted some criticism in the inquiry. These are among a number of provisions in the legislation which may have great benefit to Indigenous communities but which may also create controversy if they are used in the wrong way. On that point, I make the observation that if we stood against any legislation in this place which had the potential to be misused, which had the potential to be wrongly applied by individual governments from time to time, we would not pass a great deal of the legislation that comes before this House. But we have to accept that in order to create opportunities some risks might have to be taken that such misuse or abuse of power might occur. I do not believe that any of the governments involved in exercises such as this, and I refer to the federal government and the Northern Territory government, are likely to exploit such provisions to the disadvantage of Indigenous people in the Northern Territory. I believe there is enough goodwill on the part of the governments concerned to ensure that these provisions are used for the benefit of Indigenous people in the Northern Territory, and provide for an injection of certainty into arrangements which in the past simply have not had sufficient certainty to allow firm decisions to be made.
For example, under present provisions it is possible to create new land councils in the Northern Territory where a ‘substantial majority’ of Indigenous people support the creation of a new council. That has not been defined. What is a ‘substantial majority’? In the past we did not know exactly what that was. This bill defines that substantial majority as 55 per cent of Indigenous people living in an area where a new land council might be created. That is the kind of certainty which people need in order to be able to make arrangements for the future, to deal on a commercial basis with particular landowners and to identify the issues which need to be identified in order to proceed to negotiate outcomes which are to the advantage of those people who own that land.
There are other provisions dealing with the termination of land claims, for example, the termination of claims over intertidal zones and riverbeds which are not contiguous with existing Aboriginal landholdings. It seems to me that that is an entirely sensible arrangement. Although such claims have occasionally been granted in the past, there really is not a reason why land which is not contiguous with existing Aboriginal landholdings should be treated in that way. Again, this is about an end to uncertainty.
It seems that the opposition and others in the chamber are opposed to these changes. They are intent on defending the status quo. They want to resist the measures in the legislation for greater flexibility, greater accountability and the use of some market principles. That is unfortunate because it is clear that even others within, for example, the Australian Labor Party see potential in these provisions.
I note again that the Northern Territory government gave substantial support to many of the provisions in this legislation while expressing some concern about the time frame in which they were being implemented. Nonetheless, for the most part they accepted in principle the reforms inherent in this legislation, including those provisions which had more recently been added to the proposal by the minister.
It is important to remember that these changes are going to in large part be administered by the Northern Territory government. They are not about the federal government making day-to-day decisions about use of land in the Northern Territory or about creation of new land councils and so forth. Many of the changes which this bill provides for will confer powers in effect on the Northern Territory government, and it will be making these decisions. So, if there is some sort of conspiracy here to deprive Indigenous people in the Northern Territory of some rights over their land, it is a conspiracy in which obviously the Northern Territory government is at least to some extent a partner. I said that we should look at the benefits in this legislation, not the potential for harm, and I believe that is the case.
I want in the last couple of minutes to make reference to a couple of other matters. No doubt members in this chamber will have had a great many emails and phone calls in recent days from members of the community who are concerned about these changes. As members will be aware, that has largely being generated by the GetUp! website, which has begun a campaign on this legislation. I note that in my case, and I suspect it is the case for other senators, there was almost no correspondence on this legislation before the weekend and now there is a flood of it. I think that reflects more the power of sites such as GetUp! than necessarily a genuine basis of concern in the rest of the community. I do not think that people, though, ought to take their information from one single source, a source which has been universally critical of the present federal government, and consider it to be the only source of information to use for finding out about important reforms such as this.
The Community Affairs Legislation Committee report which was presented out of session last week does endorse the legislation being passed, but I need to put on the record that the committee did feel that there was inadequate time to completely and comprehensively cover the issues which were entrusted to the committee to review. This was not a conspicuous example of the Senate committee system working at its best, and I put on the record that I would urge the Senate to consider very carefully putting issues of such significance into committees which already have a very heavy workload. That was certainly the case for the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-08-09,"—Next week we celebrate the anniversary of one of the most remembered and historic moments in the history of this country. It will be 40 years ago, on 16 August 1975, that Gough Whitlam poured a handful of soil from the Daguragu land into the outstretched palm of Vincent Lingiari in a gesture signifying the handing back of 3,236 square kilometres of ancestral land and the final chapter in the Gurindjis’ nine-year fight. The official record of this significant gesture was the drafting under the Whitlam government of the land rights legislation finally passed by the Fraser government.
Let me spend a moment looking at the history of the legislation, which was the culmination of the royal commission conducted by Justice Woodward. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 before us today would make the most significant and monumental changes in the history of the legislation’s existence. The legislation was designed and has always been seen as an instrument to preserve and strengthen Aboriginal interests in rights over the land and ensure that these interests are not taken away without consent. After review by Justice Toohey in 1983 and amendment as a result, we did not see any other attempt to change the fundamental intent of this legislation until the arrival of the Howard government.
John Reeves QC was commissioned to undertake a further review of this act in 1997, and the controversy of his report culminated in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs considering his recommendations and the implications of these for change. The report that the House of Representatives committee wrote is there for the history books and should be read by anyone who has an interest in this legislation. The unanimous recommendations—that is, recommendations supported by government members and opposition members in this building—especially the first of these recommendations in the report Unlocking the future, say that this act should not be amended without the traditional owners in the Northern Territory understanding the nature and purpose of these changes and giving their consent and, further, that any Aboriginal communities or groups that may be affected should be consulted and given adequate opportunity to express their views.
That thought was good enough for government members in the House of Representatives to sign up to in 1998-99. It is a pity they did not stick to their view when this bill was put through the House of Representatives in June. We have seen all too often of late the arrogance of the government with control of the numbers in both houses and we have seen their preparedness to abuse such control. This is another of those examples.
This legislation has been rammed through with minimal debate, minimal scrutiny and minimal time for any Senate inquiry. We have just heard Senator Humphries admit that the Community Affairs Legislation Committee of this chamber had a grossly inadequate time frame in which to deal with such serious ramifications as this act presents. The government think they know best on all matters and that they do not have to consult, negotiate or debate with anyone except their mates. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 before the Senate chamber today is no exception. As I have travelled around Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, particularly in last six months, I have heard constant complaints that Indigenous people have not been consulted and have not been given time to understand, consult and talk with one another about these major changes.
The Aboriginal land rights act is a very major and important piece of legislation. It is, in fact, fundamental to the future of Indigenous people in terms of promotion of social harmony and stability, and maintaining the spiritual link with the land which gives Indigenous people their very sense of identity and their basis for spiritual beliefs. Any changes should be worked out in very close and full consultation and negotiation with Indigenous people and communities—not thought out using paternalistic ideology by politicians and bureaucrats and then rammed through this parliament in great haste.
Historically, this legislation has had the benefit of being treated in a bipartisan manner. But in the current context of this government and its treatment of Indigenous people we should not be surprised, although very disappointed, with the haste of these changes and the lack of genuine discussion and agreement with the people who will be most affected by them. The existing land rights act has certainly not failed. Under it we can find countless examples of development on Aboriginal land, whether it be mining bauxite at Gove, goldmining in the Tanami, even uranium mining at Kakadu and manganese at Bootu Creek. Then there are examples of tourism at Katherine, Uluru and Kakadu National Park and even the new housing development on the Malpi estate that is being developed in Gove, as I saw only last Friday, and the list goes on.
Under the existing act, Aboriginal people have seen development on their land but in a way in which they can control and in a way that they have come to accept, understand and agree to. This bill proposes major amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act of 1976. In summary, these are reforms in relation to mining and exploration provisions, the introduction of the 99-year headleases on Aboriginal land, mechanisms for the creation of new land councils, provisions for the delegation of certain land council functions to incorporated regional groups, new requirements regarding performance and governance of land councils, major change to the funding of land councils and finally, of course, the excision of intertidal zones not contiguous with Aboriginal land.
Everyone except this government—and including the Northern Territory government—agrees that the time allowed to work out and consider these changes is totally inadequate. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee had minimal time to consider this bill and with only one public hearing in Darwin on 21 July—totally inadequate and with not even a chance for the Community Affairs Legislation Committee to get to Alice Springs, let alone to any of the remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory who will be at the very core of the effects of the changes to the legislation.
Even the government members of this committee could not give unqualified support to this bill in the report, supporting the legislation only on the basis of further, ongoing negotiations with affected groups—but after passing the bill. Quite frankly, that is nonsense. If the bill in its present form is not good enough to support then it is not good enough to pass and say that later we will tinker around at the edges and make the changes. If it is not good enough to pass in its current form it should not be passed and then sought to be negotiated and discussed further down the track.
We have seen last minute changes of major proportions being made to this legislation. Even, I understand, the Northern Territory government has only had three days to comment on it. The mining and exploration provisions are seemingly accepted by the key stakeholders such as the Northern Territory government, the land councils and the minerals councils. These were done in consultation over many, many months—not in haste—and Labor can and will support them. However, other parts of this bill give rise to serious cause for concern and amendment or even rejection. Some of the problems include the conditions of the 99-year headlease model, the use of the Aboriginals Benefit Account to fund township surveying and administration of the new entity to hold the headleases, the creation of new land councils and the new requirements on land council performance, accountability and funding methodologies.
Under these changes the land councils are being required to perform and account for funds like few other organisations are expected to do. They have to state their anticipated annual budget and stick to it unless they get ministerial approval to vary it. They are already required to report annually to the federal parliament, as are most other bodies of this nature. It is very unclear to me why they are being asked to do more when this level of accountability is already there and other bodies are not put under such scrutiny.
This bill also makes it possible for the establishment of other land councils and for their powers to be delegated from the existing four land councils. This is nothing more than the implementation of an ideological policy base, and I have not seen such strong opposition against the existing land councils as I have seen in this suggestion. Rather than a genuine attempt to ensure that this act continues to work effectively and in the best interests of Indigenous people, the strength of the larger organisations is not supported by this government. It runs counter to the Commonwealth’s current drive to consolidate services and economies of scale in native title representative bodies and Aboriginal legal services. So on the one hand this government wants to consolidate services to Indigenous people through rep bodies and legal services, and on the other the establishment of this legislation seeks to break up the land councils and larger bodies, abolish their existing strength and effectively create many small land councils and organisations, which will be the end result.
This point was highlighted and disagreed to by the Minerals Council in their submission to the Senate inquiry. If you know anything about the history of this legislation, you would know that this government has seriously got it wrong when even the Minerals Council does not want this change to the legislation, has backed the land councils in suggesting that the current legislation should stand and has urged that this provision not proceed.
All of my Indigenous constituents do not want this at the expense of their culture, and it seems that this government, by the way they are going about things, want to return to an assimilation policy. The establishment of this legislation shows that government members totally lack understanding of and empathy for Indigenous tradition. This bill certainly continues that impression and that trend. Aboriginal people have had minimal input and minimal say in something that will have a major impact on their communities and land councils.
In his submission to the committee, Professor Jon Altman, who is vastly experienced and acknowledged nationally in Indigenous affairs, particularly in the Northern Territory, says that it is his belief that these changes will actually make the amendment objectives, especially with respect to economic development, harder to achieve than under the current laws. He believes headleasing would have been better if trialled first in some communities.
Oxfam Australia, in a letter that I received only yesterday, said that they were one of the many organisations that were prevented from making a submission because of the extremely short time frame for the passage of this legislation. This is very disappointing, as Oxfam Australia undertook research last year to examine the claim by this government that these changes will generate improved economic development and private homeownership. The report, titled Land rights and development reform in remote Australia, found that many of the necessary elements required to promote economic developments are not related to butchering the land rights act and making profound changes to this legislation but to taking action to improve health, housing, education and infrastructure for Indigenous people in their communities.
Mr Daly, the Chair of the NLC, made this point during the Senate inquiry:
We want to be part of the Territory economy ... We want to see our people move forward. We also want our kids to have a decent education and to be able to get decent jobs out on their own traditional lands.
Tom Calma, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner and an elder and traditional owner from the Northern Territory, says in his submission that he has serious concerns about the land rights amendments in this bill. He says:
The amendments make significant changes to the existing land rights legislation which has the potential to compromise the rights and interests of Indigenous people living in the Northern Territory.
He states very clearly that he is concerned that these amendments have been made without the full understanding and consent of traditional owners and Indigenous Territorians. He says:
... the consultations with land councils regarding the ALRA amendments did not cover the full provisions of the proposed changes to the legislation.
At the Darwin hearings, Raymattja Marika, a traditional owner from north-east Arnhem Land—and current Northern Territorian of the Year, I might add—said:
While we Yolngu have always known our connection to land and the laws that govern our connection and our rights ... Our struggle was against the mining companies and the federal government that issued the first leases in 1966. Now we are in the same position today—we are still fighting the Commonwealth government.
She went on to say—and I quote these words because I think they are of particular significance:
Land ownership is not something you can play with. You dig our land and you take our land, but that land is our backbone. It is our life source. We invite you to respect that and to understand the value we have on our land and to help us achieve our goals.
We also heard from Mr Wali Wunungmurra, a man who my husband calls ‘brother’ and who was the first person to invite us to become part of an Indigenous family in north-east Arnhem Land. He said that, in the view of the grassroots people he was representing, the present land rights act was working fine and was a workable act that people could now understand. He went on to say:
What I say and what the people who asked me to present the case here to the committee say strongly is that if there are going to be changes made to the act, Aboriginal people would like to be a part of those changes. They are saying that they would like to be making decisions and saying where we should go and how fast we should go. We want to make decisions about the pace and the timing.
I want to make a few comments in conclusion. There are many areas of this legislation that I could spend quite a deal of time criticising and commenting on, but I want to address very quickly the notion that, despite what this government says about the 99-year leases being voluntary, what we have seen in the two or three instances in the Territory is that it is anything but that. On 4 May 2006 a joint press release between Minister Mal Brough and Minister Julie Bishop said:
A secondary boarding school will be built on the Tiwi Islands as part of an historic deal to open the door for home ownership on Aboriginal land.
In this press release there is clearly a connection between the boarding school and homeownership on Indigenous land. There is clearly a link that, if you give up your land for a 99-year lease, we will provide you with a further $10 million towards the construction of a new community managed boarding college on the Tiwi Islands.
After I asked Mr Greer in estimates this year, ‘Is this school funding linked to any other requirements from the Commonwealth?’ he said:
Yes. I think when the minister for Indigenous affairs announced the new initiative on 4 May, he indicated there would be a condition around signing a heads of agreement committing the traditional owners and the government to settle an agreement by the end of year to allow for home ownership and commercial business development over the township of Nguiu.
But when we were in Darwin on 21 July the chair of our committee asked exactly the same question of Mr Stacey from OIPC. Mr Stacey said:
The government has made it clear right from the outset that the arrangements are voluntary.
We went on to ask Mr Daly, the chairman of the NLC, about the condition on Elcho Island that 50 new homes would be provided in return for a 99-year lease. I asked:
If the people on Elcho Island decide not to enter into the 99-year lease, I take it they don’t get the 49 houses, then, that have been promised by Minister Brough?
Mr Daly said:
That is correct. The community leaders out there have been told, ‘If you do not sign up to this community leasing scheme, you will not get the 50 houses that I have promised you.’
And, in a press release on 19 June this year, Mal Brough had this to say:
Around fifty houses will be built and real jobs provided, if the community is safe and signs up to full school attendance, a no-drugs no-violence policy and agree to a 99 year lease to support home ownership and business development opportunities.
Mr Stacey denied that in Darwin, and he said to me:
I think, with all due respect, it is an oversimplification to try and characterise the government as going around saying, ‘Unless you agree to a headlease, you are not getting essential services.’
In that context, he denied that the government is doing that. Who is right here: ministerial press releases or departmental officials from OIPC? But the point I want to make is that the 99-year leases will be anything but voluntary. The track record of this government in those two instances shows that you will only get essential services or services connected with your future if you agree to give up your land. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2006-08-09,"—As a member of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, I was involved in the inquiry into the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006. Recently, I have also been involved with two other Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiries, which have visited a number of remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, Queensland and the Kimberley area of Western Australia. These visits have given me a great insight into the infrastructure needs of these communities and the opportunities that are available to Aboriginal people through the successful passage of this bill.
The amendments contained within the bill are the first comprehensive reforms to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act since it was introduced in 1976. The changes to the act will provide more choices in life for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, and in time it is hoped other states and territories will follow. They will modernise the act and allow Aboriginal people to get more economic returns from their land. The changes to the Aboriginal land rights act will occur without changing the two fundamentals of the act—the inalienability, meaning the title cannot be taken away from traditional owners, and the traditional owner right of veto, meaning traditional owners can prevent or stop development and access to their land if they choose.
Land is the best asset that Aboriginal people have for economic development, and these changes will provide more choices for Aboriginal people. I would like to stress the word ‘choice’. There has been a great deal of misunderstanding amongst some Aboriginal groups and communities regarding the 99-year township leases. The 99-year township lease scheme was developed by the Northern Territory government and is entirely voluntary. It would only apply to townships where most of the residents are not traditional owners. Traditional owners would set the lease conditions and still retain freehold title to the land. The idea is to give individuals more control over their lives. They now have the option to lease their land to other individuals and businesses. For the first time, individuals and families will be able to buy land, and home and retail centres can be privately developed. The opportunity for homeownership should be a great incentive, especially for large extended families, to have a suitably designed house to meet the needs of all occupants. Private investment in retail centres for remote communities is a positive step, considering they may bring employment options as well. I stress again the two fundamentals of the act which will not change with these amendments. The title cannot be taken away from the traditional owner, and traditional owners can prevent or stop development of and access to their land if they choose.
The land councils have criticised the use of the Aboriginals Benefit Account to fund rentals to traditional owners under the leasing scheme. The Aboriginals Benefit Account, known as the ABA, is made up of mining royalty equivalents for the benefit of Aboriginal people. The ABA is designed for the benefit of the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, and providing rental to traditional owners satisfies that requirement. It is important to note that this will be a temporary arrangement until the scheme becomes self-funding. The performance and the accountability of the land councils, incorporated bodies and royalty associations which receive payments for the use of Aboriginal land will be improved under this bill. In future, land councils will be funded on the basis of workloads rather than a guaranteed funding formula. Land councils already receive more than the statutory minimum, so this is a much more businesslike approach.
With the Northern Territory government’s support, this bill has the provision to withdraw land claims to the intertidal zone and to beds and banks of rivers which are not adjoining Aboriginal land. The claims are being disposed of because they cover narrow strips of land, which are inappropriate to grant. It was never intended that people could own land that did not abut other owned land. Granting these intertidal zones would prevent legitimate access to non-Aboriginal land. The bill seeks to promote economic development on Aboriginal land by speeding up and clearing up the processes related to exploration and mining on Aboriginal land. The time frame for negotiations relating to exploration licences will be better defined, and the minister will have the power to bring negotiations to a conclusion.
There was a very good editorial in yesterday’s Sydney Morning Herald, titled ‘Dreaming of home: land rights and land deals’, which sums up what the government is hoping to achieve with the amendments in this legislation. The following passage is particularly relevant:
The risks of failure, then, are known, and are great. Yet the alternative is to continue with the welfare-based policies which have trapped generations of Aborigines in the most abject poverty. It is to reject the possibility that some communities may be induced to rely on their own efforts to pull themselves out of the dust. In Aboriginal communities there is enthusiasm and misgiving about the land rights amendments shortly to come before the Senate. That is reasonable. The amendments will never fix every problem or make everyone a winner. But if they can help even some communities to help themselves, they will be worthwhile.
I believe these amendments are a positive step towards improving economic opportunities, providing greater choice for local traditional landowners, and allowing for more decision making for local people.
The bulk of the amendments are based on a joint submission by the Northern Territory government and land councils, and the Northern Territory government supports the bill overall. Whilst the committee has stated that adequate time was not given to conduct the inquiry, I am confident that the government will continue to seek comment from traditional landowners and the community and that it will review the legislation on an ongoing basis to ensure that we are working towards a better outcome for Indigenous Australians. I support this bill.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2006-08-09,"—A number of senators have spoken on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006, and we have heard considerable evidence about the history of this wonderful piece of legislation. When the original legislation was being passed in the chambers, I was at school and I listened to the debate.
There is no piece of legislation that is beyond consideration. I have said before in this place that the whole role of our representative democracy is to consider legislation and to reconsider it to see whether amendments can be made to improve it. Extraordinary care is required when moving changes to some landmark pieces of legislation. In this case, the original land rights legislation followed a period of disputation and negotiation in this country which I think came to signify all things about the acknowledgement of Indigenous rights in Australia. That was important to people not only here but internationally, because we were seen to be making genuine attempts to acknowledge Indigenous people and Indigenous rights.
Other senators have talked about the fact that this legislation was originally introduced by the former Labor government but then taken forward by the new Liberal government, and both sides were able to move together and take a unified approach to make the necessary changes. Senators have also talked about the fact that there have been attempts to make changes—and that should happen. There should be attempts to improve and to make changes. But through this process there has been considerable discussion, and concerns have been raised about the motivation of the changes, the impact of the changes and, most importantly—and it has come up consistently during this debate—the involvement of the people on whom these changes will have an impact, and they are the traditional owners of the Northern Territory. We are being watched, and that is important. How we work with this legislation will show our communities how this government is willing to work effectively with the traditional owners in the Northern Territory and with all traditional owners. On that basis, that is our job.
The changes that are being attempted to be made with this legislation fall into two main parts. There are those changes that have been the subject of ongoing discussion—in fact, ongoing discussion which has led to agreement. Consistently, there has been talk about the fact that there has been considerable debate over the years about mining rights and about structures, and a degree of consensus was achieved. There is no such thing as a perfect agreement. But a number of the proposals in this legislation have been discussed and there has been a degree of acceptance which could be moved forward. There is an opportunity with this legislation to have consensus and agreement. But then, at the end of the process, a range of other changes and amendments were brought in that have not had the option for that degree of consultation and negotiation.
It comes back to the core issue of understanding and knowledge of the process. Other senators have talked about the truncated time for consultation with traditional owners, with other people in the Northern Territory and with the wider community. Whilst this piece of legislation relates specifically to the Northern Territory, its impact is much wider. It will have an impact on all of us, because it sets up the model and the expectation of how we are going to interrelate and communicate. It actually puts down our credentials as a government for how we are going to operate in this field. I think the credentials are flawed, because the opportunities for consultation and negotiation have not been effectively taken.
That was acknowledged in terms of the process with the Senate committee. Once again we have seen a disregard for the Senate committee process because of the tokenism of saying that the bill would be brought in and that we would go through the standard process and refer it to a committee for consideration—a very fine, very noble and accurate process to follow. But then there was pressure on all members of the committee to ensure that there would not be effective consideration; there would not be the opportunity for people to have their voices heard.
I will talk more about grassroots discussion later, but I want to talk now specifically about the standard operation of the committee, which has a long history of working in this area. The committee has integrity, it offers the chance to communicate, to work together and to achieve often genuine consensus recommendations.
All of us on the committee agreed that we had inadequate time and that we were in fact not providing respect to those organisations and individuals who had made the effort to put forward a submission and who wanted to talk to our committee. They saw the advertisement and they wanted to have their say in the process. So what could we do? We were restricted in our time, and the deadline for when this legislation had to be brought back to the chamber was predetermined. And the legislation must be pushed through. We understand, because we are numerate, that the numbers are there for this particular process to be pushed through. The committee process was a sideshow; it was going through the motions. The motions were disrespectful. As we have heard from other senators, people genuinely wanted to have their say and wanted to put forward their responses to the legislation—legislation that included amendments that were not previously known about and which they had only recently received notification about. They wanted to have their say about how the legislation was going to impact on them, their community, their lives and their futures.
But we had one day in Darwin and we had to limit the number of people who were able to come and talk with us. We received valuable and incredibly important information from people who knew their business and who wanted to come and talk to us. We had to restrict it. As always, we could not hear from all the people who put in submissions. There were large numbers of people who said that they could not meet the original deadline for submissions, but we could not listen to them because we had to have our committee report concluded so that it could come back into this place in the first week of sittings and so that the legislation could be rammed through and this process proceeded with. So be it. That is the expectation of the government; that will happen. But it devalues the way that we operate and it devalues our credibility and credentials with the wider community.
OIPC were so busy at the time that they could only send some representatives to the committee hearing in Darwin. Some had to stay in Canberra and talk to us by phone hook-up. We acknowledge the fact that OIPC could share a couple of hours with the committee that was tasked to consider the legislation that was going through. I also want to put on record my thanks for the rapid response that OIPC gave to the questions on notice that we put, understanding the time frames and constraints under which we were operating. I want to put on record my appreciation for them getting those responses to us very quickly so that in the limited time that we had we could move forward.
In terms of the process, we set up the committee, we had the hearings and we wrote the report. Even in this very small report we can hear and feel the pain of people who wanted to be involved in the process of changing the legislation which was going to affect everything that they held dear. Senator Crossin quoted the traditional owner who talked so eloquently about the meaning of traditional ownership of their land. We know it. Every single senator in this place understands—I hope—the particular relationship between traditional owners and their land. This strong Indigenous woman could not get to the hearing in the one day that we had but was generous enough to give her time by phone. It is difficult, Acting Deputy President Lightfoot—and I am sure you have had this experience—when you are trying to work through painful issues and you do not have the person in front of you to talk with and see. You do not get the power of their individual evidence. This woman’s evidence was strong even across the telephone line. Senator Crossin quoted those wonderful words about what landownership means.
In that day, we were able to receive significant evidence. I want to quote from one piece of evidence that was specifically about the consultation process with the key people in this whole change, the traditional owners. They were talking about their response to the OIPC submission, which talked about the years over which this particular legislation has been discussed. The traditional owners of north-east Arnhem Land—and I will not attempt to pronounce that area in traditional language because I would destroy it—said, among other things:
There may have been 9 years of consultation leading to these proposed amendments, but it was not with us.
                  …         …         …
The changes the Government are making to Indigenous affairs generally, and in this case Land Rights, are happening much too quickly for our people to understand let alone respond to. This is placing enormous stress on our leaders, and the sense of ‘loss of control’ and powerlessness to respond is resulting in demoralisation, depression and fatigue.
                  …         …         …
Yes, changes are needed and new ways forward need to be carefully developed in partnership with government and business, but the changes must be led by us, and implemented in consultation—not imposed.
That is my whole argument. We have missed an opportunity by ramming through this particular group of amendments in this way at this time.
There were no objections during that one-day hearing that we had—maybe if we had had more time we could have found some objections—to them being involved in the process. There was no objection to them looking at the land rights legislation and seeing whether appropriate changes could be made and made in partnership. The objection was to the way it was being done and to the imposition once again on the people who would be affected by these changes by people who are not from there.
The government, which is supposed to be representing them, chooses not to work with them in partnership for its own philosophical reasons. People have the right to have those. All governments have positions on Indigenous affairs. That seems to be something that every government must do: make particular changes in Indigenous affairs. In many ways, that is good and right because that is one of the key issues for all of us. But it is not good when it means making changes to core legislation about land rights about which the people are not fully informed and aware.
We all know that there is no education process which can guarantee that everybody will be fully aware of every change that could be implemented. That is a goal which, whilst it may be noble, will never be achieved. But there must be understanding. The difficulties of consulting with traditional owners across the Northern Territory were reinforced to us in our one-day hearing. These difficulties are not new. The people who are best able to work through them are the land councils and the government bodies working with the local people.
I was surprised and confused in many ways by the response from OIPC when I asked them about the need for consultation with the local people. Their response to me—and I am not making a direct quote but I am confident that I am not verballing them—was that it was not their responsibility, that it was the responsibility of the land councils to do the consultation and that they would give support to the land councils. I reject that outright. In something as important as this legislation—or as important as all legislation which impacts on Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory—no-one can shirk responsibility or push it onto anyone else.
If the government is going to be introducing changes in legislation, it must be the government that has the final accountability to ensure that the people who will be affected by the legislation are at least aware of what is happening. They may not fully understand it—I think that many people in our community are not fully aware of all changes that government makes—but if we are going to be making a change to the core 1976 land rights legislation, which most traditional owners know about very thoroughly because it is their business, we all share the responsibility to ensure that they are aware of it. It is not good enough to just say that it is the responsibility of either the Northern Territory government or the land councils to do that. If we are introducing change, we must be confident that the people who will be affected by that change know what is going to happen.
It would be a good result if they were part of it and agreed to the changes. That would be the best possible outcome with any change of legislation. But the basic minimum must be that we accept our responsibility to ensure that they are aware of it and they see and understand what is going on. I am not confident that that is the case with this legislation. The evidence that we had from people who were living in the Northern Territory who had the opportunity to come before our committee indicated that they were not confident that this is true. In fact, I do not believe the government is confident that the people of the Northern Territory are fully aware of this legislation. Indeed, what the government has said in responses to our committee and in statements made in this place during the debate is that the legislation is evolving and once we get through the necessary process of passing it in this chamber and in the lower house then we can get down to evolving the processes and making sure they work.
Certainly, any change of policy and any change of legislation will involve that kind of working through and seeing what works best and making that fit. Certainly, we have had evidence from OIPC that they will be not imposing standards and that they will be working through things with each community because each community is different. In my opinion, that is a given. There is nothing extraordinary about that. That should always be the commitment. But, in terms of where we go next, I question whether it is genuine partnership in that way.
I agree with the comments of Senator Crossin about the 99-year lease, which is the core aspect of disagreement. Many other things could be worked out, but the processes around the 99-year lease have not been agreed. I share the concern that Senator Crossin put forward about whether this would be a truly voluntary arrangement. We heard in evidence about the kinds of things that would be part of the discussion when communities are asked whether they wish to give up a 99-year lease on their land for other purposes. The kinds of things that we were told would be given back as part of this very large shared responsibility agreement included added housing. We heard about that in one community. In another community, we heard about the development of higher education, a secondary school.
It seems to me that housing and education should be a standard expectation of any Australian, regardless of where they live. This is tying the provision of housing and education to giving up your land—because a 99-year lease is a long time. I totally accept the evidence we have had from the government that it is not changing the title. We know that the process would never be—actually I should rephrase that; I never use ‘never’: we would hope that the process would be that there would be an acceptance that there would be no attempt at any time in our community to change native title. However, we heard from people about what a 99-year lease would do. I had to stop and think about it. If I gave up something for 99 years, it would be highly unlikely that I would be around when the new lease was going to be signed. In that process, you are looking at a cross-generational information exchange, and decisions that are being made over the next few months in Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory will see a break in the linkage between the traditional owners and their land for generations to come. I think that is something that needs to be considered.
Whilst the core native title is not being changed, that special relationship is. To do that in response to something like houses or schooling would seem to me to involve a not particularly equitable balance of power and I am not convinced it would be particularly voluntary. I hope that people understand this in the process. I am concerned that this legislation will go through both these houses, but I implore the government to hear the words which the people gave to us at our committee inquiry and try and return to a true partnership, not an imposition yet again.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2006-08-09,"—I rise to speak about the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006. The report on the inquiry into this bill was handed down last week, and there remains serious dissatisfaction from key stakeholders, including the traditional landowners, regarding the bill proceeding through the parliament. Unfortunately, there appears to be a lack of consideration and respect from the government in considering the impact of some of the changes that will result from this bill.
This is another important piece of legislation that has some degree of merit but where the negative far outweighs the positive. It has been formulated without proper assessment of its impact on the lives of the people it will affect and without proper consultation. Submissions received from the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research, the Australian Law Society, the major land councils and the Minerals Council of Australia were all critical of the bill. It was strongly argued that the bill should not proceed until such time as agreement could be reached with traditional owners and other key stakeholders. The message that the bill should not proceed in its current form was clear. The answer as to whether the government listened is simple: no.
So today we stand here again witnessing the government’s abuse of a Senate majority. We are dealing with a situation where a Senate inquiry was held with only one public hearing and less than a week to prepare the report—not enough time to allow for proper consideration of such a bill. If this sounds familiar, it is because it is becoming a regular occurrence with this government, one that we on this side have come to expect from the out of touch Howard government. Even the majority report of the committee made the point that the time allowed was totally inadequate. But that is not all it had to say. It said:
There was insufficient time for many groups to prepare submissions and a single hearing was complicated by the necessity to include a number of teleconferences within the hearing. Additionally, time constraints prevented the Committee hearing from a number of witnesses. The inadequacy of time to do justice to the complex nature of the issues involved was reinforced by a number of groups in evidence.
So the majority report highlighted the inadequate time frame and the denial of potential witnesses to be heard.
As some in this chamber may remember, it was the establishment of the Woodward royal commission by the Whitlam government and the resulting report that formed the basis of the land rights legislation. The royal commission was brought about by a number of cases surrounding the unfair treatment of Aboriginal Australia with respect to traditional connections to the land. One of the most significant of these cases was the Gove land rights case, in which the Yolngu people’s fight for land rights led to a Federal Court case. The action of the traditional owners of the Gove Peninsula and Arnhem Land to protect their land was due to Nabalco being granted a 12-year lease by the federal government to extract bauxite from the ground on the Gove Peninsula. However, the traditional owners lost. They lost because, at the time, Justice Blackburn used the terra nullius claim, which implies that land was unoccupied prior to European settlement.
The drafting of the land rights legislation was based on the report by Justice Woodward and included such significant aims as:
The doing of simple justice to a people who have been deprived of their land without their consent and without compensation.
The promotion of social harmony and stability within the wider Australian community by removing, as far as possible, the legitimate causes of complaint of an important minority group within that community.
The provision of land holdings as a first essential for people who are economically depressed and who have at present no real opportunity of achieving a normal Australian standard of living.
The preservation, where possible, of the spiritual link with his own land which gives each Aboriginal his sense of identity and which lies at the heart of his spiritual beliefs.
Justice Woodward said that these aims could best be achieved by:
Preserving and strengthening all Aboriginal interests in land and rights over land which exist today, particularly all those having spiritual importance.
Ensuring that none of these interests or rights are further whittled away without consent, except in those cases where the national interest positively demands it—and then only on terms of just compensation.
The provision of some basic compensation in the form of land for those Aborigines who have been irrevocably deprived of the rights and interests which they would otherwise have inherited from their ancestors, and who have obtained no sufficient compensating benefits from white society.
The further provision of land, to the limit which the wider community can afford, in those places where it will do most good, particularly in economic terms, to the largest number of Aborigines.
Perhaps central to the current state of Indigenous affairs in this country—which, under the Howard government, is not being achieved—is Justice Woodward’s aim that:
The maintenance and, perhaps, improvement of Australia’s standing among the nations of the world by demonstrably fair treatment of an ethnic minority.
Now, more than 30 years on—a whole generation after the Woodward royal commission—we are in a position to update and reform the bill to assess if the changes previously made are still relevant and still to the advantage of the people whom this bill affects and protects. We have the opportunity to uphold this important recommendation of Justice Woodward made back in 1973. But the reality is that here is an opportunity to address an important issue and this government has set it up for failure.
Looking at some of the content in this bill, it would appear that Minister Brough has continued with the same attitude of the coalition ministers before him. That has not been lost on Indigenous Australians, as highlighted in the speech by the member for Lingiari, who held consultative meetings with traditional owners in their communities in the Northern Territory. He said:
At those meetings, people expressed their frustration, their anguish, their concern and their hurt at the way the Commonwealth government has imposed its agenda for change without any reference to them.
He went on to say:
They are deeply concerned that the government feels absolutely no compulsion to sit down and talk with them, let alone to consult or negotiate with them; that the government shows them no compassion; that it shows no knowledge or understanding of their cultural values or priorities; and that it shows no knowledge or understanding of the cultural differences that exist across Indigenous Australia, and of the different historical experiences that different communities have suffered.
There have been three reviews of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 over a nine-year time span. Significantly, in 2003, a submission to the government was made by the Northern Territory lands council, in a joint effort with the Northern Territory government, regarding possible amendments to the act. Many of these amendments, based on the finding of the three reviews and their own consultations, have been adopted in the bill. However, some of the proposed amendments contained in this bill before us today have not been negotiated with traditional owners and their representatives.
One has to question why the government call for submissions for an inquiry when they clearly fail to give them the genuine consideration they deserve. They do not adequately consult with those affected and they put in place a series of reworded amendments that have the potential to destabilise the whole region. As was outlined in Labor’s dissenting report, the following amendments were not negotiated with the traditional owners: the 99-year leasing on Aboriginal townships; the creation of new land councils; the ministerial power to override a land council’s decision not to delegate its function to a regional body; the removal of guaranteed funding for land councils; the altered administration of the Aboriginal Benefits Account and composition of the ABA advisory board; and the excision of intertidal zones not contiguous with Aboriginal land.
In principle, there are perhaps some functions that may be better off if delegated at a more regional level. This was indeed a proposed amendment by the Northern Territory government and the existing land councils. However, as the member for Lingiari rightly pointed out, the government has taken this way too far. One of the amendments means that the core land council functions with respect to mining and leasing on Aboriginal land could be delegated. This is problematic because it provides for a situation where the powers of the body representing the traditional owners, a land council, could be delegated such that a body including non-Aboriginal people could exercise the core land council functions.
In addition to this, one of the recommendations of the Reeves report of 1998 was opposed by members of the standing committee investigating Reeves’s recommendations. Another poorly conceived consequence in the land council deregulation amendment is that the minister of the day has the power to make decisions about a land council’s authority, whether they agree or not. So you get this scenario whereby the original act, which was designed to give rights to Indigenous Australians, is going in the completely opposite direction. A further poorly conceived aspect of this bill is the proposal for funding for land councils to essentially be at the minister’s discretion. There exist serious concerns about this outcome. If the government of the day is giving payment to the land councils based on workload, it is essentially saying, ‘Let us know what you’ve got coming up and we’ll see what happens.’ It gives an unfair amount of decision-making power to Canberra. This is just a small insight into the problems resulting from some of the government’s amendments.
There is no doubt that there remain some serious flaws in the bill as it currently stands. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee handed down its report on the bill last week, and it is fair to say that the people who were most disenchanted and generally unhappy about the proposals were the very people who will bear the consequences of the bill’s passage. With a bit of jockeying around the committee table, the government agreed to consult with them but only after the bill has been passed. Paragraph 1.75 of the government majority report recommends:
... subject to the amendments foreshadowed by the Minister and a commitment by the Government to undertake further ongoing negotiations and dissemination of information to the NT Government, Land Councils, traditional owners and communities likely to be affected by this legislation.
What they are saying is that the bill be passed and then the government will negotiate with traditional owners—after the horse has bolted. They are saying to the traditional owners, ‘Trust us, and we’ll negotiate later.’ One can only wonder as to why the government see the need to rush the bill through the parliament without taking the time to negotiate with the traditional owners beforehand.
Given this government’s record in honouring undertakings made, it is plain to see why traditional owners, key stakeholders, the opposition and minority parties have grave concerns about such a statement. It is little wonder that those in the Indigenous community get extremely frustrated and discouraged by this government when every time they have the opportunity to move forward they are pushed two steps back. Labor senators, in their minority report, called for the bill to be split to allow for the agreed amendments, such as the negotiated provisions of the bill relating to mining, exploration and subleasing, to proceed. Mining expansions are welcomed by many areas of the Indigenous community because it means they can generate substantial funds to improve their communities and social conditions. The negotiation process of mining has come a long way since the people of the Gove Peninsula boldly defended what was theirs.
Labor also recommended that the remainder of the bill be subject to thorough consultation and negotiation with traditional owners, their representatives and other key stakeholders before it is considered by parliament, not after. Given the lack of consultation raised in submissions to the inquiry, it would be a valuable recommendation to adopt. If, however, the bill is not split, then Labor recommended that the bill should not proceed.
I looked at some of the speeches on this bill made in late June by coalition members in the House of Representatives. Some of the comments are just proof that there is a serious partition between what is needed for Indigenous Australia and what is being applied. For example, the government’s member for Solomon wants ‘normalisation’ for Indigenous communities and cites Irish theme pubs and McDonald’s for incorporation into their lives as his measuring stick for what is normal. The member for Kingsford Smith said at the time, ‘What a joke,’ and I say today: what a disgrace. It just highlights that some government members have little regard for the cultural sensitivity of Indigenous Australia. The minister had the bravado to call it a ‘sorry day for the Labor Party’ for not supporting this bill’s passage through the lower house. In my view, Minister, sorry in respect of rights for Indigenous Australia is a word that many in your party, including your leader, have a very bad track record on.
The transcript of the Senate inquiry on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 demonstrates a lack of consultation and negotiation. It demonstrates a lack of respect for traditional owners. As stated in the Labor senators’ report:
These non-negotiated amendments represent some of the most significant changes to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act since its original enactment thirty years ago. They have the potential to undermine the long-term viability and independence of Land Councils and deny cultural, social and economic enjoyment of land by traditional land owners.
Without the government addressing the key areas outlined by opposition senators in the inquiry, and indeed today in this chamber, we cannot support the bill.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-08-09,"—We heard this morning and yesterday afternoon what the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 is all about. It proposes to alter 30-year laws that gave Aborigines control and communal ownership over land in the Northern Territory and established land councils to administer the land. This morning, Senator Crossin, who so strongly represents the constituency most affected by this legislation, has outlined the historic nature of the original land rights bill and the local impacts of the proposed changes to this legislation.
The government majority report of the House of Representatives entitled Unlocking the future: the report of the inquiry into the Reeves review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 was tabled in the House of Representatives in August 1999, and I note that it is referred to in the explanatory memorandum to this bill. A committee with a majority of government members produced a unanimous report. Recommendation 1, on page 8 of that report, states:
The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 ...not be amended without:
traditional Aboriginal owners in the Northern Territory first understanding the nature and purpose of any amendments and as a group giving their consent; and
any Aboriginal communities or groups that may be affected having been consulted and given adequate opportunity to express their views.
As I said, it was a unanimous report with a government majority.
The bill before the Senate today does not meet that basic test of proper consultation and informed consent of traditional Aboriginal owners in the Northern Territory. The report of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, tabled out of session, noted the concerns of the committee members and many witnesses about the lack of time for preparing submissions and that the committee had only one day of hearings about the bill, which will have a profound effect on Indigenous communities, and that many of those most affected by the changes in the bill are probably not even aware of its existence.
Professor Jon Altman, Director of the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research at the Australian National University, in his submission to the committee, made a critical point:
.. the proposed amendments ... will result in a statutory framework that lacks internal consistency and that will make the meeting of amendment objectives ... less likely than the current framework.
Professor Altman reiterated concerns about the lack of consultation and the explanation of the impacts:
Other parts of the amendment (especially the provisions for head-leasing and then sub-leasing Aboriginal township sites located on Aboriginal land) emanate from quite recent ideas that have not been explained at all to Aboriginal traditional owners, have not been openly negotiated, and that have enormous potential implications for both the workability of ALRA—
the act—
and especially its financial provisions.
He suggested that the proposals should be undertaken under section 19 provisions of ALRA, rather than amending the act. Professor Altman is a highly respected expert in Indigenous issues. His submission raised very serious constitutional issues about the legislation as well as strong economic arguments. He also said in his submission:
... many old laws ... are good laws and statutory change should only be passed ... if it is likely to result in better outcomes for all stakeholders, but primarily Indigenous Australians.
Paragraph 8 of the explanatory memorandum explains the true motives of the Howard government. Under the heading ‘Objectives’, it states:
The principal objectives are to improve access to Aboriginal land for development, especially mining—
That is why we are here today. The current mechanism of negotiating ILUAs, Indigenous land use agreements, with agreed outcomes and opportunities for communities and businesses, is not enough for this government.
Labor oppose this bill because aspects of it are wrong and make it deficient. We believe that the bill should be split. The bill seeks to undermine the principles of self-determination by removing funding for land councils from the Aboriginals Benefit Account and replacing it with a funding formula based on workloads and results—however the minister wants to define those. We support the provisions of the bill that relate to mining and exploration which also have the support of traditional owners and the Northern Territory government.
We share the desire of the people of the Northern Territory for investment. We understand that they want the capacity to develop their resources and want to be consulted about how that may occur so that there is a chance to maximise the return for communities—not just in the form of royalties but, more importantly, in social and economic development. The Indigenous communities want resource development and tourism that create local opportunities for training, employment and enterprise development.
It is time for the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to admit that he is wrong. Indigenous communities are not anti economic development, but they have been alienated by this government. Shared responsibility agreements that make unrealistic demands on unsuspecting communities, the dismal failure of some of the COAG trials, changes to CDEP funding and interference by the Indigenous policy coordination unit—they are all part of this minister’s style. And let us not even go to the minister’s former employee who helped perpetuate a disgraceful hoax on national television.
The best way to achieve development in Australia is by negotiating with people and taking them with you. That is exactly what the act does as it stands right now. Unfortunately, this government wants to diminish the capacity for land councils in the Northern Territory to properly represent their communities, encouraging instead new regional incorporated bodies to which the minister can delegate functions that override the wishes of traditional owners. Writing in the National Indigenous Times on 15 June 2006, Chris Graham had this to say about the bill:
... the government is seeking to wipe out the independence of the NT land councils—to gain control of them. The land councils’ financial resources will now come under the direction of Mal Brough. He will decide the level of funding they receive (if they receive funding at all).
The Minister is also proposing to give himself the power to delegate land council functions to other bodies—bodies he has created and funded.
What does this mean in practical terms? It means that the land councils are dead. They will no longer do the bidding of traditional owners—they must do the bidding of the government, or they will be abolished.
So what is the intent of the Howard government amendments? They are designed to increase white access to the resource rich lands of the Northern Territory.
The minister has been out there working very hard to try to sell the government’s spin on the bill. I quote him:
The reforms to the Land Rights Act will help create future opportunities for Aboriginal people. These amendments allow for 99 year leases which will make it easier for Indigenous people to own a home or establish a business in Aboriginal townships.
The fact is that the government amendments will actually ensure that traditional owners will forgo their ownership of the land and associated rights to control entry onto their land. That is really what this bill is all about, and tempting Indigenous communities to exchange their land for community housing or facilities is really outrageous. As Senator Crossin said this morning, 99-year leases equate to four generations. Shameful!
To date, the legislation has provided for traditional owners in certain circumstances to refuse consent for mining and other developments on their land—not because they are against development but because they are trying to ensure there is a balance between development and traditional rights in their communities.
The National President of the Australian Property Institute, Ms Marcia Bowden, yesterday wrote to Minister Brough outlining the concerns that the Australian Property Institute has with this bill. In particular, Ms Bowden expressed concern that the bill will disturb compulsory acquisition law and provide for compulsory acquisition of land held under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Ms Bowden wrote:
... it is the strong view of the Institute that the compulsory acquisition of property rights, be they held by Indigenous or non-Indigenous holders, should not arise solely to permit a private purpose that cannot be construed as a Government activity. Whilst tenure holders under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 could withhold consent to a proposed lease, such action should not cause compulsory acquisition to arise merely because it frustrates third party private interests.
And there you have it: the government would rather help its mates at the top end of town than give any consideration to long-established compensation law. I call on the minister to respond to the Australian Property Institute’s letter and explain to all Australians—Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians—why he is prepared to allow a situation to arise whereby an undesirable private property rights precedent may be created.
We know that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 was a direct result of the Woodward royal commission, and several people have spoken in the chamber about its genesis. The Whitlam government drafted the land rights legislation based on Justice Woodward’s report, and the legislation was ultimately passed by the Fraser government. But since the Howard government gained control of both houses of this parliament, we have seen its ideology shine through. It spends its time attacking those areas about which it has a long-held view. The land rights act, for the Prime Minister, is one of those pieces of legislation.
This is very bad public policy. We should be respecting the rights of our Indigenous Australians. We should respect their right to say no. We should respect the fact that there is informed consent in relation to their decision making. We should not have a situation where the land councils have a gun held to their heads by the minister saying to them, ‘If you don’t approve development, we’ll put you out of business.’
This is exactly the reason the land councils have a problem with this legislation. In reality, many Indigenous people want mining in their country, because they see it as the only way to advance themselves and their communities. They are not anti development; they just want to have a say over the development on their land. They want to protect Indigenous assets on the land once a mining lease is entered into; they want clarity about their control of development under the 99-year lease model. To suggest that land councils should be forced to delegate land use functions to small corporations, and as such prioritise scarce resources to them, is unworkable, and will certainly jeopardise development outcomes.
The CDEP program was established in 1977. It is the single biggest employer of Aboriginal people and operates through an Indigenous community organisation, creating a common pool of unemployment benefits that pay unemployed community members to undertake work within that community. In December 2004 the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations announced planned changes to the CDEP scheme, and in February 2005 he released a discussion paper which was widely criticised for its potential to create job losses and cut costs.
Nearly 18 months later, with the detail of the bill now before us, I wonder whether Minister Andrews can stand by his claims. Last year, he said of Senator McLucas:
The senator is simply wrong in calling the consultation process a ‘sham’ and is misrepresenting the discussion paper in making erroneous claims about job losses and cost cutting.
I also wonder whether the minister read yesterday’s Melbourne Age, in which three traditional owners of country in Arnhem Land were reported as having written an open letter to the Prime Minister and the people of Australia. About the CDEP, they wrote:
Right now the CDEP allows our people, especially our younger people, to work for the money they get, to learn skills and talents that work for both the white community and the Aboriginal community. The Government wants it to work for the dole, but this is a problem. For the dole you must apply for jobs every two weeks or your payments stop. Here there are not very many jobs, so we share the CDEP work so everyone can get paid and all the work can get done. We are concerned that without the CDEP our younger people will go to places such as Darwin to look for work. This will break up families and expose the young to things such as drink and drugs, which are not here at Gunbalanya.
The Howard government continually espouses its family values credentials, yet its dogged ideology continues unabated. We have had the extreme industrial relations legislation, making life more difficult and uncertain for hard-working families. The government refuses to act on rising fuel prices. Last week interest rates rose for the third time since the Prime Minister promised Australia he would keep them at record low levels—due to the cost of bananas, he would have us believe. Now, the Howard government’s ideology seeks to destroy Indigenous families. It is mean, it is cruel and it is bloody-minded.
We heard what the member for Solomon thought about Indigenous communities when he suggested, ‘You do not see a hairdresser, you do not see clothing stores or a McDonald’s or an Irish theme pub.’ What a shame if an Irish theme pub is evidence of economic and cultural vitality! And we had the minister saying, ‘We’re saying to the people: “You’ve been living on what are, for all intents and purposes, little communist enclaves, which means there’s no opportunity for business to flourish and there’s no access to a market economy.”’ What is the answer for this government? It is to transform the CDEP—to encourage the development of microbusinesses without the appropriate structures, processes, training and planning in place—to allow subleasing of Aboriginal townships, to allow access to traditional lands and to adopt a paternalistic approach to land council funding.
This is one of the fundamental problems of the bill. It is further evidence that the government does not take Indigenous Australians seriously. It is obvious the minister has never read the words of Justice Woodward, and I suggest that he does so. If he did he would see that his world view is not only wrong but also not even close to where Indigenous Australians see themselves. They are concerned about involving themselves in the market economy in some way. Indigenous Australians aspire to having roofs over their heads and their children having access to education and health services. Indigenous Australians want access to work opportunities. Indigenous Australians want these things just like the rest of us.
Labor supports any Australian who aspires to purchase their own home. However, this bill is not about homeownership; it is about housing provision and the regularisation of the arrangement between housing providers and traditional owners. Across Australia Indigenous Australians face a chronic housing shortage. Nationally the housing shortfall is around $3 billion. This housing shortage is reflective of the level of poverty being suffered by Aboriginal Australians, as well as poor health, poor education and the lack of employment opportunities.
Recently the Northern Territory government proposed a new way of addressing the housing crisis on Aboriginal communities, involving community, government and private sector finance. I applaud the Northern Territory Chief Minister for this initiative. There needs to be a genuine partnership between government, the private sector and Aboriginal communities if we are ever to address the chronic shortage of Indigenous housing. But the Howard government’s proposals will not attain that objective, either. The government should be looking at models that do not require traditional owners giving up their right to control commercial development on their land and that would provide ample capacity for dealing in residential property.
The haste with which this legislation has been rushed through is evidenced by the suite of amendments proposed by the government and circulated yesterday afternoon. This will be a function of the new Senate majority of this government: legislate in haste and amend as each unforseen consequence is identified—an unwieldy and intellectually lazy approach to legislation.
Finally, I commend the substantive amendment moved in this place by Senator Evans that has the effect of splitting the bill. If the Howard government is serious about its practical reconciliation agenda then it can afford to acknowledge that this bill has been contrived in haste and accept these amendments that are about ensuring that Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory, as traditional custodians of their country, are afforded the same rights as everyone else.
 (Senator Hutchins)—Thank you, Senator Stephens. I have Senator O’Brien next on the list.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-08-09,"—No, I am on the list after Senator Scullion.
—Not on the list I have here. Who is seeking the call?
—Does Senator Scullion seek the call in this matter? A government senator would normally come after an opposition senator in this debate. If Senator Scullion is not seeking the call—
—Senator O’Brien, please take your seat for a moment. The list I have been provided by the whips has Senator O’Brien next. That is all I can go on, I am afraid.
—My advice from the deputy whip in the chamber is that Senator Scullion is next, and it is normal for the order of debate to be alternated across the chamber. I take it that Senator Scullion is not seeking the call in this debate if he is choosing not to speak in the order that would normally occur. If he declines to take part in the debate, so be it.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order on clarification. I am present in the chamber as the whip. I have a list of speakers here, as does everyone else, that is quite clear: Senator O’Brien is next on the list and I am after that. I would not be in the chamber apart from the fact that I am here as the whip.
—There is no point of order.
—I have never heard a whip use that excuse for not speaking at the appropriate point in the debate, but we hear new things all the time from this government, which is keen to ride roughshod over the practices in this chamber whenever it suits them.
I commend Senator Stephens for her contribution and would respectfully adopt many of the things she has put on the record as a very fair reflection of matters that ought to be put in this debate. We are seeing Indigenous communities being demonised on a regular basis in the media by and with the assistance of this government. I am not surprised. As Labor’s former Indigenous affairs spokesman, I have seen this coming, particularly since this government was able to obtain a majority of senators in this chamber. The unspoken desire of many in the government to turn the clock back in relation to the representation of Indigenous Australians in many respects is typified in this legislation.
I also reflect on the fact that this is a government that when it suits it says that communities who are affected by change ought to have a say in those matters. We saw it quite recently with the plebiscite which was conducted in the Toowoomba community on proposals in relation to their water supply. They are not an Indigenous community, of course. Clearly, according to this government, different rules apply to them than apply to Indigenous communities. It was this government that imposed the obligation on the Toowoomba council to hold the plebiscite on a proposal for funding for water recycling. That has received ample coverage in the media, and I do not need to canvass the nature of that proposal.
That was not the first occasion on which this government interposed in proposals put forward within a community for change. I recall some of the fishing communities in the prawn industry being the subject of a plebiscite requested by coalition senators which ultimately saw the removal of the industry development levy—much to the detriment of the industry—because there was some opposition to the existence of that levy. It was this government that imposed on that industry the obligation to hold a plebiscite. In relation to the establishment of other mechanisms which are given effect by this parliament in the farming industry, such as industry levies and other important industry measures, this government imposes—and we do not object to a democratic indication of an industry’s will—an obligation to conduct a plebiscite to ascertain that there is proper support for the proposal within the industry.
That is not happening now—not for this community. This is an area, particularly in relation to the land councils, in which the government is content to do what its secret discussions are telling it it must do to satisfy its constituency. It is imposing on the Northern Territory land councils and the Indigenous communities within them rules that suit this government in relation to their land. Of course, land rights in this country have had quite a chequered and, in many respects, shameful past over many years.
There had been up until this point quite a degree of bipartisan support for the model of representation through land councils to ensure that the Indigenous communities who had a traditional connection with the land would have a proper say in matters, and it was to ensure that development would be in accordance with the wishes of the traditional owners of land that this legislation which is now in place and is subject to the proposed amendments came into existence. There was a degree of bipartisanship. That issue has been the subject of review and discussion over a period of time.
Now this government has a majority in its own right in this chamber and there is no proposal for extensive consultation with those communities. There is no proposal for a plebiscite within the traditional ownership groups which will be affected by this legislation as to whether they are prepared to accept it on the basis that there is some benefit for them. No, this government will impose its will on these communities. This government will be saying to the land councils: ‘If you don’t do what we want, we will make sure that we get our way. We have control over you in terms of funding. If you don’t do what we want, you can kiss goodbye to the funding.’ This government is saying in relation to setting up new land councils: ‘It doesn’t matter that traditional owners have a view. Any Indigenous Australian who lives in the area proposed will then have a vote in a plebiscite—not just the traditional owners.’
In some of these communities live traditional owners and Indigenous Australians from other parts of the country who have moved there. This legislation will effectively provide the potential for the dispossession of traditional owners by other Indigenous communities through a land council established under a plebiscite, conducted by the Electoral Commission, of any Indigenous Australian who lives in the area proposed. So the government is saying to the traditional owners of land affected: ‘Your rights will be gone. Unless you somehow can exclude those people from the area proposed, you can become the minority.’
I interpose that people talk about concerns about the potential for violence. I would have thought that that would be one of the ways in which this legislation could actually provoke it. I sincerely hope that that is not the case. I know that most Indigenous Australians are gentle people and most Indigenous Australians seek to work well within their communities. But, unfortunately, just as in the white community, a minority of people give some Indigenous communities a bad name and blacken their reputation because they choose to act violently and unlawfully. There are many causes of that, and I do not propose to touch upon them now.
Labor is saying let us proceed slowly. This government has a majority in the Senate and it is not as if it has a time requirement to pass this legislation now without the consultation we propose. It is not as if in a month, three months or six months the position within this chamber will change. It is not as if it does not have the resources to conduct the consultation that Labor is proposing. It is not as if the government has a history of doing otherwise with other communities. It is simply a matter of choice for this government as to what it wants to do now. Why impose on these communities without that consultation and, indeed, without the opportunity to have a proper say in it—and not a farcical, one-day Senate inquiry and not an inquiry which removes from those people the opportunity to have any say at all, let alone to participate in a plebiscite?
Let us have a proper consultation. Let us take this matter to the communities who will be affected by the legislation. Let us not deal with them in the way that other communities have been dealt with where their basic human rights, their rights to the services that the overwhelming majority of Australians receive, can be subject to some community performance standard set by this government. Let us have a proper consultation where the people who are affected by this legislation can have a say.
Why is the government so keen to push this matter through now? That is a question I have not heard an answer to. This government has in many respects in relation to other legislation talked about the need to preserve the principles that operate in many areas in the community. Constitutionally, for example, the government has been talking about preserving our connection with the British monarchy as a cornerstone of our democracy, and that is a matter that the community will have a chance to have a say on. This is a government which has opposed rights for people who have different beliefs from it in relation to families and relationships, but there is a democratic process through here, through the community and also right through state parliaments that can deal with some of those rights—but not here. What we have here is a group of Australians with special rights that have been enshrined in legislation with the support of both sides of politics over many years. Now this government wants to change it, and it wants to change it without the right of those people to have a proper say.
I wonder how the government can say that this bill will improve access to health care, education, employment and housing for Indigenous communities. Indeed, it may be possible that they can demonstrate those facts. They have not so far and they have not to the communities affected but, if their case is as strong as they say it is, why are they not prepared to test it with those who are affected by the legislation? Why can’t they bring the communities with the government on this legislation rather than simply ramming it down their throats?
The Labor Party are committed to reforms that will provide opportunities for Aboriginal people to gain a maximum benefit from their land. In that context we could consider positively any reforms that have clearly demonstrated that they will enable this to happen. If the government were confident that they can demonstrate that then they would not be rushing this legislation through today. They would have gone through a much more extensive consultation, not just through the Senate committee but with the communities involved.
Aboriginal communities can of course maximise economic gains within their communities without the changes proposed in this legislation. It is happening now in communities across the Northern Territory in partnership with mining interests and others. It has been negotiated under the current legislation. It leads to benefits for those communities through the payment of royalties. Those communities, through their land councils, have had some fine ideas about how they could enshrine the benefits for their communities in the long term. It shows a foresight by those land councils that should be encouraged.
The benefits that might be gained from the proposals that the government talks about are counterbalanced by the negatives that might be given effect. I can envisage circumstances where, in a particular area, it is in the interests of a development proposal to seek to divide a community between traditional and non-traditional owners in order to provoke a proposal for a land council. Who knows? In that circumstance perhaps it could even encourage other non-traditional owners to move into the area and propose that it is beneficial for them to support the change and to establish a land council on the basis of a plebiscite. I do not know if there is anything in this legislation that will prevent that from happening. That is one of the flaws that I see and there are other people in the Indigenous community who see that potential as well. Where there is a financial gain to be made there will be strong incentives within Indigenous communities, and outside them, to seek to persuade a majority of people to vote for a particular proposal, even though it is not in the interests of the majority for that proposal to succeed.
We might say that that is democracy, but this will be a flawed democracy because we are changing from a traditional owner model to a model which will be based on whoever the Indigenous occupants of the land at the time are, and that is a concern. So why not wait? Why not sit down with those communities and talk about the potential ramifications? Why not look at how we can make sure that the rights of the traditional owners are not overridden or effectively wiped out by these proposals? That is a question this government really needs to answer, but I do not expect that it will. I expect that there will be a lot of bravado about how this will be good for communities. There will be a lot of bravado about how this will attend to the problems of the communities and provide a basis for good things in the future. I wonder why many Indigenous Australians are not convinced by this proposal. Many of the leaders of their communities have denounced the proposals and called for further discussions.
The opportunity is there for the government, but it will not take it. It will ram this legislation through and oppose the proposal to divide the legislation so that the good parts of it can be passed and those matters which are more controversial can be the subject of more rigorous consultation. That is what we see from a government that has become arrogant after 10 years in office—a government that now has the numbers to do whatever it will. That is what we will get from this government and, unfortunately, in some communities we will probably reap the whirlwind accordingly.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2006-08-09,"—I rise to speak in support of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006. It is with some sadness that I have listened carefully to the contributions of those opposite. It saddens me that the only interpretation that they can make on every aspect of this bill is that there is some sort of a mischief in government to go out there and upset Aboriginal people. We have heard from the other side about the creation of violence in the communities. To say that this is some sort of a conspiracy runs in the face of the facts that most people, and certainly all the Aboriginal people who have spoken to me, put to the matter. It is very sad that those opposite have obviously not consulted widely, because, in my experience of living in and around Indigenous communities for well over 20 years, the changes to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act proposed in this place today simply reflect the aspirations of Aboriginal people and Aboriginal communities.
The Howard government has three fundamental approaches to economic development. We want to grow the economy, lock in prosperity and build for the future. That vision of this government is in an Australia-wide context and it should extend to every Australian. Unfortunately, many of my constituents who live on Aboriginal land have not been part of this economy. They have been isolated from the mainstream economy and face a number of impediments, in the Northern Territory particularly, primarily to do with education, housing, unemployment and, of course, as we have heard with sadness, the lack of services and of a capacity for law and order in many Indigenous communities. Clearly, the Northern Territory government is not providing the sorts of services and the sort of environment for safety that those first Australians deserve.
There is another important impediment to the development of the economy of this country—particularly to the benefits to be gained by Indigenous people who live in the Northern Territory—which is, of course, the Aboriginal land rights act. The principal reason that we are here today is to make some amendments to an act that allow people to participate in the economy that all other Australians enjoy. People have said that it is a good act. It is 30 years old; it has to be a good act. Old acts are good acts. I do not know where they got that from—they have dug it up from somewhere—but in this place we normally know that times change, and 30 years is an awfully long time. It is out of date, it is paternalistic and it needs to be updated. Some 30 years ago, as part of that act, we set up structures and processes that, instead of developing economies and assisting Indigenous people in developing economies, have been impediments to mining, have dumbed down economic activity, have denied local decision making and have disenfranchised many Indigenous people in the townships and deprived them of being able to make choices in life that so many take for granted.
This is the fundamental process under which we are looking at this legislation. The fundamental plank of the amendments is about choice. Nothing that we are proposing is being imposed. We are providing for the locals to have more say. If you want to buy a house in the townships at the moment, you cannot. You will have to go outside of the community if that is your wish. Senator Crossin said in this place that we should not be able to do this, because people on low incomes cannot afford a house. I am not sure about Senator Crossin’s particular arrangements, but I assume that she owns or is buying a house, as are many like her. There are, of course, people in Darwin who cannot afford to buy a house and are renting. But just because there are people in Darwin who are renting does not mean that we should not provide the environment and the legislative framework for people to buy their own houses. It is absolute paternalism at its very worst.
People say that they are on low incomes, but some people in these communities are employed. Through Indigenous Business Australia we have the Home Ownership on Indigenous Land Program so that a family on CDEP income can in fact buy a house. If those opposite had sat down with Indigenous people for a long time, they would have found out that it is a simple aspiration of every Australian that is shared by Indigenous Australians who live on their land. Just like us, their aspiration is to own their own house, not only for themselves but to pass it on as a legacy to their children as property so that through each generation there is an accumulation of wealth. It is something that clearly has not happened in those communities. Again, it is typical Labor paternalism, an ideological lockdown and a lowest common denominator approach.
All we are trying to do is give local people a say over their own lives, and I cannot understand what is wrong with that. I cannot understand why this government is being attacked over trying to provide choice. I do not understand what is wrong with devolving decision making to local people. The land councils support it. Perhaps those opposite should have better communications with the land councils, because they certainly support it. This legislation gives traditional owners the right to decide the future of their townships and to look after the rights of their local residents, who are not all traditional owners. I do not understand what is wrong with that either. Senator O’Brien stood up in this place and painted a picture of violence and of traditional owners somehow being disenfranchised. Obviously, he either has not read the legislation or has not paid attention to the process.
A lot has been said today about consultation. ‘Let’s have a proper consultation,’ says Senator O’Brien. When he says that the government is rushing headlong and jamming this legislation through the parliament, I am almost speechless about this misrepresentation of the facts. I will go through a couple of the processes in this consultation, and I am sure that what Senator O’Brien is really saying is: ‘Let’s delay action. Let’s delay Indigenous Australians getting access to the same sorts of rights to own their house as every other Australian has.’
I will briefly run through the consultation process. In July of 1997, Senator Heron announced a review of the Aboriginal land rights acts and their terms of reference. In October 1997, Mr Reeves was appointed to conduct the review. In November 1997 an issues paper was circulated, including public hearings in 22 communities with 98 written submissions received. In August 1998 there were the findings of the Reeves report. In December 1998 the minister referred the Reeves report to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs inquiry, with 31 public hearings and 72 written submissions between March and June of 1999. The House of Representatives standing committee report was tabled in parliament in August 1999. In January of 1999 the ATSIC commissioned a national competition policy review of the mining provisions of the act. This included written submissions, statistical surveys and meetings with major stakeholders. The draft report was circulated to major stakeholders for comment. The report was then released publicly in August. Early in 2002, Minister Ruddock commenced a new round of consultation meetings with land councils, the Northern Territory government, the mining industry and other stakeholders.
I was very pleased to participate in many of those meetings. They were comprehensive meetings. They certainly did not reflect any of the garbage that I am hearing from the other side. In April 2002, the minister released an options paper to all major stakeholders, and pretty much all of them responded pretty quickly. In June 2003, joint land councils and the Northern Territory government responded. That response was provided to the government. In October, further discussions occurred between the minister and major stakeholders. In 2005, in October, Minister Vanstone announced details of proposed amendments. The opposition was briefed by the senator’s office and by officials. The material was posted on the minister’s website. Detailed media releases and brochures were prepared, and they were distributed widely. On 25 October the land councils, the Northern Territory government and other stakeholders were briefed on the township leasing proposal. The minister’s senior adviser visited the Northern Territory to brief land councils and the Northern Territory government on all the proposed amendments.
On 1 December 2005 the draft legislation on township leasing was provided to the Northern Territory government. On 2 December the same year, the department had a teleconference with the Central Land Council on all the issues. On 30 March a summary paper on reforms was provided to land councils. On 31 March, draft legislation on exploration and mining leasing was provided to the Northern Territory government officials. Early in April the department met with the Northern Land Council, the Tiwi council, the Central Land Council and the Anindilyakwa Land Council in a teleconference. By April, all the comments were received from all the land councils. On 15 May comments were received from the Northern Territory government, and on 4 June comments were received from the Northern Territory government on the township.
People think that the Commonwealth government should sit down under the tree with every single stakeholder and talk to them. It is just a nonsense. We rely on the very good work on the land councils to consult on our behalf with Aboriginal people. That is their principal role: to manage the land, provide advice and consult with Aboriginal people. They have done a very good job in this, and that list does not seem to me to be a comprehensive failure of consultation. In fact, I would say that it demonstrates quite clearly that the furphy that those opposite are putting forward—that we have not spoken to Aboriginal people—is an absolute lie. It is absolute rubbish, and should not be supported.
After the announcement last year, Senator Evans in his media release of 18 November said:
Labor is pleased that the package of amendments to the NT Land Rights Act were finally announced by Senator Vanstone...
The mining industry, represented by the Minerals Council, said at the time that it supported the package announced by Senator Vanstone. It said:
Though these reforms have been a long time in gestation, the process of consultation between interested parties has been a critical and productive element to the reforms announced by the Government.
Again, more acclaim for the consultation process, how widely we have consulted and how successful and forensic it has been. I cannot understand that those on the other side are saying: ‘Well, it’s not right and it’s not good. We don’t support it.’ I know the Northern Land Council supports the package. The Northern Land Council has been very supportive of the township reforms and has undertaken a very responsible approach to the permit issues. I have to say, from a personal point of view, that at one time I was inclined to pursue the permit system further than the government wished. It was my wish, originally, to ensure that the media had full access to these communities inside the permit system. But I have been convinced by the activities of the Northern Land Council that it is responsible enough to ensure that the media have access, without any prescriptive legislation to ensure the permit system gives them access. I will be continuing to watch that space, but it is because of the activities of the Northern Land Council and its responsible approach to these matters that I have decided not to pursue that matter.
Let us go through some facts. I know we have had a lot of stuff from the other side—doom and gloom and saying the world is going to fall in—but these are, simply, good amendments. This is good legislation that provides for the future aspirations of Indigenous Territorians. The 99-year leasing for townships was put forward by the Northern Territory Labor government, and it is funny to see those people on the other side saying that they are all part of the Labor Party. All you have to do is pick up the phone and ring Clare, and she will probably straighten you out on it.
There was a bit of an issue about the five per cent cap of the rentals. The Northern Land Council talked to us at length about that. We have made changes and amendments to ensure that we have reflected their concerns. There is no longer a cap. This whole process is voluntary, and in Nguiu the consultation is under way with the support of the Tiwi Land Council. It is very interesting; when I was last there they were reflecting that some of the traditional owners had in times past visited Lord Melville. They were telling me how Lord Melville’s land spread for so far. They had some industry on it, other people had sheep and cattle, and it was all going very well. The Tiwis from Melville Island asked Lord Melville, ‘What is the secret?’ He said, ‘Never sell your land.’ They understood that. They asked, ‘How do you get all these people?’ And he answered: ‘I lease it. Never sell your land; make sure you lease your land.’ In this speech by traditional owners, they were telling me that what the government are intending to do in these amendments is exactly what they want. It is common sense, and they want to be part of the mainstream economy.
Senator Stephens brought up the issue of Ms Bowden. It was to do with the Australian Property Institute. She had apparently written to the minister for some reason or another to say this was going to be a compulsory acquisition. Let me make this clear: the headleasing arrangement is a voluntary arrangement. The framework we are putting in place simply allows the process to happen.
There are some issues associated with the creation of new land councils. I think it is a bit misleading to say ‘the creation of new land councils’. Yes, the legislation provides for the devolution of some responsibilities, not the devolution of all the responsibilities of a land council. We have already talked about plebiscites. The government previously used the term ‘substantial majority’, and all our feedback said: ‘We need some clarification. What does “substantial majority” mean?’ We have defined it as 55 per cent. Other senators on the other side think that is a bit low. I would have thought that we in this place would normally consider that to be a landslide, or some other name. We think that 55 per cent is very reasonable and very fair.
Some senators, including Senator O’Brien, have suggested that we restrict this to traditional owners only. This is the sort of selective democracy that we are gaining on the other side. We need to understand that the land councils are meant to represent all Indigenous people on Aboriginal land, not just the traditional owners. They understand that very clearly. Senator O’Brien’s assertion that this would cause outbreaks of violence is, I think, really off with the fairies. I certainly have not had any indications of that level of negativity on this matter. There have been allegations of bribery. There has been misinformation going around that we are going to threaten to stop basic services, education and housing if people do not sign up to a lease. That is absolute irresponsible nonsense.
This bill is the result of nine years of consultation and four separate reports. I have gone through the most comprehensive consultation list, and I would say that it would be very rare for any piece of legislation to have more than nine years of consultation and such a comprehensive process. The bulk of the recommendations in the bill have been drawn from a joint submission of the land councils who represent the traditional owners, the people of the Northern Territory, and the Northern Territory government. That is right: the Labor government in the Northern Territory—Aboriginal land councils and the Labor government in the Northern Territory. The principle of the township leasing program is based on a submission from the Northern Territory government.
This legislation seeks to provide ministerial power to override land council decisions, not to delegate. It simply offers natural justice for any aggrieved party in the arrangements. It simply provides the capacity for the minister to review land council decisions and to determine if a decision is a reasonable one. Frankly, I do not expect the minister to very often come down on the side of anyone other than the land councils. It would be in circumstances where somebody says, ‘We would like to devolve the process of saying “I would like to negotiate about a mining lease.”’ The land council might quite reasonably say, ‘We don’t think that you have the resources or the capacity or the competence to do that. It is quite a complex matter. You will need some legal advice. We do not think you are ready yet to have that.’ The plaintiffs can then say, ‘Look, Minister, we think we can do it.’ The minister can look at it, and all he will look at is whether or not the land council behaved reasonably. It is just about natural justice.
With respect to the removal of the 40 per cent funding guarantee, this bill provides for outcome based funding—the same as the rest of Australia. Outcome based funding is exactly what it is about. Any organisation goes towards outcome based funding. The land councils support it. They want to be held accountable for what they do, and they want to be funded on the basis of what they achieve. It is absolutely anachronistic. It has got to go.
This legislation also seeks to alter the administration of the Aboriginals Benefit Account and the composition of the advisory board. The royalty associations are being made more transparent by being required to report on the purposes for which payments are made. I think that is going to be a great thing for Indigenous people, and it will ensure that all Aboriginal people benefit, not just a few.
With respect to intertidal zones not contiguous with the coast, these are issues that I have had personal dealings with for many years. To understand the process, these are only the areas that are adjacent to pastoral leases. They have been claimed simply because they are claimable under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. So if you are a pastoralist, you cannot have a barge come up over the low-water mark and unload cattle without going through the whole process of saying that you are using the land. It is an absolutely ridiculous process to have to go through.
We have been able to provide more choices for local people and a prospect for real market economy without changing the fundamentals of the act, which is inalienable freehold title and the traditional owners’ right of veto. Those are being maintained, they are fundamentals of the act and they are not being amended.
The choices now available will allow Aboriginal people to grow their economy, locking in prosperity through a greater number of benefits from this growth. They will allow traditional owners and other people on Aboriginal land to build a better future and to share in an economy that all Australians are benefiting from. I can see no reason why we should not support these amendments to support the prosperity of Indigenous people. An editorial in yesterday’s Sydney Morning Herald stated:
The amendments will never fix every problem or make everyone a winner. But if they can help even some communities to help themselves, they will be worthwhile.
Clearly, this bill will help many communities to help themselves. As such, it is far more than worth while; it is absolutely vital. The time for talking is over. Indigenous Territorians need action. By bringing in these changes, we can offer them a better future. I commend the legislation to this house.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2006-08-09,"—Senators who wished to speak in this debate on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 have now had a chance to put their views. Let me record my appreciation for the speech of Senator Scullion, which was in many ways quite a visionary speech and one which is strongly rooted in his very deep experience in the Northern Territory. I congratulate Senator Scullion for the work and the thinking which has gone into developing his own position on this bill.
The changes to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act are fundamentally designed to give Aboriginal people more choice. The act has been largely unchanged, as many senators have noted, since 1976. Many of its provisions are, of course, now outdated and paternalistic. I think this was a point that Senator Scullion made in his remarks. It is time that the Aboriginal people were given the opportunity to make their own decisions. This legislation will help Aboriginal Australians in townships on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory to enjoy the same opportunities as other Australians. They will be able to own their own homes and obtain secure title to land for business or community purposes.
We are not saying that these amendments are a panacea for the economic woes of Indigenous Territorians. Obviously, economic independence requires education, good health and decent housing. But changes to land tenure will indeed make a difference. Around one-third of Indigenous Australians own or are buying their own home. With our support, the proportion is growing. But on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory this is not the case because of land tenure problems. Imagine the difference it would make if, over time, 10 per cent, 20 per cent, 30 per cent or more of these people enjoyed the benefits of homeownership. This is not about hurtling into the unknown. The model that we are aiming for is the normal Australian town where people are able to make their own way in the world.
The reforms implemented by the bill before the Senate have been under consideration for nine years and have followed extensive consultations with all stakeholders. In October and November last year, the government made detailed public announcements about the changes. I can report to the Senate that the consultation process has led to a narrowing of differences among stakeholders. This next point is a particularly important point, and I draw it to the attention of Labor senators: almost all the measures in the bill are supported by the Northern Territory government, including the township leasing scheme, which it put forward, and the disposal of certain land claims, such as those to the intertidal zone.
I am also pleased to report that the Northern Territory land councils, which represent Aboriginal people living on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory, also supported the majority of the reforms. In particular, most of the changes related to the streamlining of the mining provisions and improved administration and accountability were put forward by the Northern Territory government and the land councils. On behalf of the government, I want to compliment the land councils for their constructive engagement in the lead-up to the bill. They have shown enthusiasm for improving economic outcomes and a willingness to devolve decision making to local people. While they may have issues with the removal of the statutory funding guarantee for administration, they have accepted the concept of outcome based funding because they are prepared to be assessed on what they achieve for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory.
The government is particularly pleased that, with some qualifications, the Northern Land Council supports the township leasing scheme. It advanced the argument that led to the proposed amendment to remove the five per cent cap on rental returns to traditional owners. Senator Scullion referred in his remarks to the constructive approach that the Northern Land Council is taking in relation to the administration of the permit system. While there are some areas where we differ, the mature relationship that we have with the land councils means that we will continue to listen to them and remain open to further sensible changes.
We have continued to take into account the views expressed by key stakeholders during the passage of this bill. In the House of Representatives, the government moved a number of amendments to the bill related to the mining provisions and the township leasing scheme based on suggestions made by the Northern Territory government. In this chamber, we will be proposing further amendments—in particular, the removal of the rental cap for township leases.
In relation to the delegation of land council powers to regional groups, the government is not planning to fragment the current decision-making structures. If regional groups apply to the land councils to have powers delegated to them so that they can make decisions locally and the land council refuses, it is fair and appropriate that they have recourse to a review mechanism which will assess their capacity to exercise those powers. In such circumstances, if the land council has made a reasonable decision to refuse to delegate its powers, there is no reason to imagine that a minister would not support the land council position.
There have been suggestions that the government should split the bill to allow passage of some of the provisions of the bill while other provisions are subject to further consultation. The government believes that the whole bill should be enacted as soon as possible to provide Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory with the opportunities offered by the township leasing scheme.
I remind the Senate that entering into a township lease will be voluntary. No-one will be forced to agree to such a lease. However, we believe that the opportunity should be available as soon as possible, particularly given the fact that the communities are already involved in discussions concerning township leases. The Tiwi Land Council has signed an agreement with the Australian government to negotiate a township lease and the Galiwinku community in Arnhem Land is actively considering the opportunities of such a lease. Other communities have expressed interest, including communities on Groote Island. Splitting the bill would delay this considerable momentum for change that is building up at the community level.
We believe that there has been more than sufficient consultation on the reforms outlined in the bill. As I said earlier, the government has made changes to the bill to take into account views expressed by stakeholders, including changes in relation to the township leasing scheme. There will be continuing discussions with stakeholders on the implementation of that scheme and other aspects of the bill following its passage through parliament.
Some people in this debate have described this bill as paternalistic. It is the opposite. It is about allowing people living on Aboriginal land to make their own decisions. Indigenous Business Council chairman Joseph Elu once said that we should stop wrapping Indigenous people in cotton wool. Will some people make mistakes? Of course they will. Will the majority make the right choices? Undoubtedly.
After 30 years, the land rights act has been a great success in delivering almost half of the Northern Territory to Aboriginal traditional owners. It has not been successful in generating economic wealth and independence for the people who live there. This bill will help spread the entrepreneurial culture exemplified by people like the late Mr Lee from the Jawoyn Association in Katherine and other prominent Indigenous Territorians. This bill will help people to follow in their footsteps. I commend the bill to the Senate. It is a very important bill. It is one which there has been widespread debate about. As I have outlined, the government has involved itself in very extensive consultations with key stakeholders. Now is the time for action and I hope that we can have a speedy passage of this bill through the Senate.
Question agreed to.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2006-08-09,"—Australians are a generous people. Australians are also generous in their donations and bequests to charities. I am proud to be a member of a government which has made it possible and easier for Australians to be generous to charities like never before. As a consequence, by some estimates Australians give as much as $3 billion per year to charities. More broadly, the not-for-profit sector within Australia has become big business indeed. Though estimates as to its size vary, BRW magazine, which has done some excellent work on the not-for-profit sector, estimates that the sector is worth $70 billion and employs 600,000 people. The Australian Taxation Office estimates that the sector is made up of 700,000 organisations.
The generosity of Australians towards charities is with very good reason. Australian charities do a wonderful job, and the list of great work being done in the charitable sector is endless. Australia’s charitable organisations have a commendable track record of rolling up their sleeves and helping those who cannot help themselves. As such, they have justifiably earned the trust of Australians.
The difficulty with many of the figures that I have just referred to is that these are only estimates. No-one really knows how many charities there are, how many people they employ and what assets they own. Part of the problem is that many charities do not report on their activities to the public. Earlier this year BRW magazine listed what it believes are Australia’s top 200 charities. But it was thwarted in an analysis of this list because 72 of those 200 organisations do not have annual reports. I must confess that I was amazed by this. This lack of transparency threatens to erode the donating public’s trust in charities.
The importance of trust to the charitable sector is something that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, touched upon recently in a speech with the intriguing title ‘Is faith a lost cause’. The speech was made in the aftermath of a well-publicised controversy which engulfed one of Australia’s best and most respected charities, the Red Cross, over its handling of its Bali appeal for victims of the terrorist bombings. The problem as highlighted by the Treasurer is that the hard-won trust which the sector has built up is threatened by the type of inefficiency and waste that has given government a bad name. I am afraid that some in the charitable sector have not heeded the Treasurer’s advice.
Increasingly I find myself reading stories in the media about charities behaving in a manner that threatens this reservoir of trust among Australians. Stories which detail that commercial fundraising organisations or face-to-face fundraisers are asking for as much as 94 per cent of the proceeds they raise on behalf of charities pose a great danger to charities and the public’s faith in them, as do the findings of the Melbourne Herald Sun’s thorough investigation of the activities of these so-called charity muggers. Clearly, the sector must work more aggressively to improve itself and its efficiency in fundraising.
But it is unfair to place all of the blame upon charities. In 2003, during Senate estimates, I asked Mr Michael Carmody, the then Commissioner of Taxation, if the Australian Taxation Office reviews the status of a charity after that status has been granted to see whether it has been following the rules. Unfortunately, the answer was no. Effective reviews of charitable status are not regularly undertaken by the Australian Taxation Office. BRW’s Adele Ferguson put the potential consequences of this benign regulatory neglect more starkly, observing:
Without adequate supervision or transparency, the not-for-profit sector is a ticking bomb. It would take just two or three scandals to harm all the good that the other charities are doing. Even larger charities such as the Salvation Army concede that the sector needs reform ...
I have little doubt that the vast majority of organisations are doing the right thing and are doing great work. The problem is that we cannot sort out the many good not-for-profit groups from the handful of bad ones or those who are underperforming. It is my belief that this threatens the donor-charity trust relationship within the sector at large.
It is here that government needs to step in and provide clarity where confusion prevails. After all, the government does have a legitimate interest in the not-for-profit sector, as the sector is the beneficiary of a raft of taxpayer funded subsidies handed out by government. What is needed is a clear set of rules by which the charities sector must abide. At present, the not-for-profit sector is governed by a complex web of rules and regulations imposed upon it from a state and a federal level. Rules vary from state to state, and what rules there are are largely unmonitored and, sadly, rarely enforced. To put it simply, we must cut the red tape that currently exists and start providing structure and efficiency to charities law so that charities can do the same to themselves.
Attempting to fix up the charitable sector, however, is not an easy task. Any attempts are quickly subject to political demagoguery and scaremongering. When the government attempted to codify the charities law in 2003 with the seemingly innocuous charities bill, it was met with howls of protest from a vocal minority within the charities sector. Opposition to the bill centred on the misleading argument that it was a ‘gag on charities’. This depiction was enthusiastically adopted by the government’s political opponents and sections of the media who were largely ignorant of charity law in Australia or not interested in the facts at all. As the Treasurer pointed out in an opinion piece in the Australian Financial Review, though:
... if it—
the bill—
codifies the current law as laid down by precedent, how could this be a new restriction? How could this be a gag?
My suspicion is that it was not the law that was changing but that some charities had strayed from their original purpose, were operating at the edge of the law and were hoping that the law would change to fit their circumstances. This argument that any changes when mooted are simply about gagging charities, despite being incorrect, has been an effective tactic in suffocating debate. As a result, charities continue to operate within a framework of complex and conflicting rules and regulations because many in the community see necessary reform as detrimental to the charity sector. Three years later the same type of argument is still being pushed by those who would prefer to score cheap political points rather than engage in an intelligent debate about much needed regulatory reform.
On 12 July this year the member for Sydney, Ms Tanya Plibersek, wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald:

The Government threatened to introduce a bill to remove charitable status from organisations which engage in advocacy ...
Ms Plibersek needs to get her facts straight. The government did no such thing. The issue here is not one of whether charities can engage in advocacy but, rather, how much advocacy and lobbying charities might engage in while still retaining their taxpayer funded subsidies; that is the issue.
For example, I have here a photocopy of the annual report for the Wilderness Society for the year ended 30 June 2005. The Wilderness Society are supposed to be about protecting the wilderness. They have in the back of the annual report a list of their expenditure. They spent more than $10 million. I looked very, very hard for any indication of protecting the environment. I did not find any evidence of weed pulling or the planting of trees. Indeed there is no dirt under the fingernails of those who work in the Wilderness Society’s office in Hobart.
The best I could find, out of more than $10 million, was $341,000 spent on community campaigning—it is about 3½ per cent of their budget—and $295,000 spent on scientific research, which is about three per cent. But that indeed is less than the Wilderness Society spend on postage and packaging. The community campaigning I referred to is even less than they spend on travel and accommodation. The big expenses for the Wilderness Society, according to their own chart, are salaries plus salaries on-costs—which are about 45 per cent of their total budget—and legal costs and something called ‘branch subsidy’. There is not much evidence here of saving koalas or saving the rainforests. This is a shopfront for political advocacy.
If you doubt me, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins, and I am sure you do not, you only have to look at a media release dated 8 October 2004 from the Wilderness Society. They say:
The only chance to protect Tasmania’s great forests is if a Latham government is elected on Saturday.
Voters can help achieve this by voting 1 Green, 2 Labor and placing numbers in order of preference on their ballot papers.
The Wilderness Society will have a strong presence at booths in the seat of Bass and will be handing out how to vote cards. We will be supporting the Greens in Dixon, Deakin, Latrobe and McEwen. Print advertising will occur in Richmond and Bass.
There is no problem with charities engaging in advocacy; the question is the extent to which they do it. Looking through the accounts of the Wilderness Society in their own annual report there is so little evidence of actual engagement with the wilderness or the environment. This is a shopfront for political activity.
In sharp contrast to the contribution of the member for Sydney there is the work of Senator Murray, who has completed some outstanding work on this topic. In his discussion paper entitled One regulator, one system, one law he makes the case for a simpler, streamlined system of charities law governed by one, ruling, regulatory body. As we have come to expect from Senator Murray, his arguments are well researched and based on an intimate understanding of the issue. While I do not agree with everything that Senator Murray says in his paper, I do acknowledge that it is a substantial and thoughtful contribution to the debate. I commend that contribution to people in this chamber. Certainly we agree on one thing, Senator Murray, and that is the need for reform, accountability and transparency in the charity sector; we agree on that.
The only way to give Australians the information they need to judge the efficiency and effectiveness of charities is to clear the red tape and lay down a set of new rules which adds greater clarity and requires greater disclosure on the part of charities. The more that commentators and elected representatives deceptively turn public opinion against this type of reform, the more they jeopardise the future of Australian charities. In March this year the BRW magazine listed 10 ways to fix the not-for-profit sector. Aside from setting up an independent regulator, some of the other significant initiatives warrant thought. Near the top of that list is introducing common accounting standards to the not-for-profit sector. This would seem to be something that surely everyone might agree upon.
One suggestion I have is that the whole issue of state laws regulating fundraising be placed on the COAG agenda. There needs to be greater harmonisation among the states so that charities only have to comply with a uniform set of fundraising laws throughout the country. This would greatly ease the administrative burden of charities which fundraise in different states. Ideally, the states should consider handing these powers over to the federal government but, failing this, the harmonisation of laws is a good alternative.
As politicians we know what happens when trust is eroded: the public become sceptical and they disengage. Charities have a good reputation but trust can very easily be lost. It is vitally important that the sector makes itself more efficient and transparent, lest the sector experiences a decline in trust. There is a role here for government to step in and promote high standards within the sector and to establish a clear, transparent regulatory regime that will allow Australian charities to thrive in the 21st century.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Charitable Organisations</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,2,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-08-09,"—My question without notice is to Senator Campbell, Minister for the Environment and Heritage. Can the minister confirm that he will now be forced to reconsider exactly the same proposal for a wind farm at Bald Hills as the one he blocked four months ago? Isn’t the only change one whereby the company will now submit a management plan for the orange-bellied parrot so as to allay the minister’s concerns about the bird with a once in a thousand-year risk of flying into one of the 23 wind farms somewhere on the Australian coast? Isn’t this precisely what the Department of the Environment and Heritage told the minister he should ask for before he unilaterally vetoed the project in April? Isn’t it also a fact that the government has approved five wind farms with management plans in that area since 2001? Couldn’t this whole fiasco have been avoided if the minister had simply followed the law?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Wind Farms</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-08-09,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Why wasn’t it the case that during the minister’s 450-day quest in search of a parrot he did not think to ask this company for a management plan? Doesn’t the taxpayer now face a legal bill of $250,000 because of the actions of a minister who is more interested in political stunts than he is in acting in accordance with the law?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Wind Farms</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-08-09,"—I think that the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party on this is quite overwhelming. Senator Carr’s comrade in the Victorian government Mr Hulls knocked back a wind farm at Port Fairy and a wind farm at Ballan on the basis that they might kill 2.7 wedge-tailed eagles. This is a species that is not on a threatened species list, unlike the ones in Tasmania where we are down to 130 breeding pairs of wedge-tailed eagles, in northern Tasmania—and three have been killed in the last three months. The Labor Party is deeply embarrassed by the Victorian government’s duplicity and hypocrisy on this matter. This is a Labor Party that has hidden from the Australian people the truth about the impact of bird strike caused by wind farms. Mr Hulls’s and Senator Carr’s Labor Party comrades in Victoria refuse to supply to the Australian public or to the Australian government evidence that it had that the impacts on the orange-bellied parrot were potentially catastrophic. Senator Carr in his question continues to repeat what is clearly untrue in relation to the potential bird impacts. Yesterday in a debate he referred to a report given to me that said that the impact was one in a thousand years. That report nowhere says that. In fact, when the Victorian government wrote to the author of the report and asked them to confirm that their mathematics were correct on that, the response from the Biosis report author was, ‘No, that is not correct.’
—That is not true.
—But if you repeat a lie often enough, as Senator Carr tends to seek to do—he works on the theory that if you repeat a lie often enough it might come true. But once a lie always a lie. I agreed to a request from the proponent that they withdraw their court action. They came to me and said, ‘Let us withdraw the court action.’ They tried to get a whole range of conditions on that.
—You are big-noting yourself again.
—I just wish we had some more turbines in here to put in front of the mouths of Senator Evans and Senator Carr because there is far more wind coming out their mouths than there is blowing around the Australian coast at the moment.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! There is too much noise on my left.
—What Senator Carr needs to understand—he is obviously confused over this and embarrassed, I suspect—is that the proponents withdrew the court action and said that they would like to put a new submission to me. They have not told me what will be in their submission and I will review the submission when it comes to me. I will certainly not prejudge it.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Wind Farms</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2006-08-09,"—My question is to Senator Ian Campbell, Minister for the Environment and Heritage. Isn’t the sole basis of the minister’s defence of his Bald Hills decision a single sentence from the Biosis report, that ‘almost any negative impact on the species could be sufficient to tip the balance’ against the orange-bellied parrot? Did the minister even bother to read the next sentence in the report, which says, in relation to blocking wind farms:
... such actions will have extremely limited beneficial value to conservation of the parrot without addressing very much greater adverse effects ... currently operating against it.
Doesn’t that sentence completely destroy the minister’s defence of this blatantly political decision? Can the minister tell the chamber why he has failed to tell the whole truth and, instead, has selectively quoted words to justify his political decision to veto Bald Hills?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Wind Farms</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2006-08-09,"—I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. I, again, remind the minister of the sentence in the Biosis report in relation to blocking wind farms. It says that such actions would have an ‘extremely limited beneficial value to conservation of the parrot’. Given that, Minister, how can you possibly use the Biosis report to justify the decision in relation to Bald Hills? Have you done anything to take any action, in relation to that second sentence, to address the very much greater adverse effects operating against the orange-bellied parrot which pose the real threat to its survival?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Wind Farms</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-08-09,"—I am happy to respond to, I think, a very sensible question from Senator Wong. It goes to two issues. Firstly: did I read the report? In fact, I read the whole report. I read all of the advice and thoroughly understood it. Having listened to what Senator Wong read into the record, it reinforces the case that a whole range of actions need to take place if Australia as a country is going to save this endangered species. In fact, if you go to the Victorian government’s website, there is one thing that you will find and one thing that you will not find. Firstly, you will not find a copy of the report that they had before Minister Hulls—
—What about your report?
—Senator Carr!
—saying that the impact on this bird was potentially catastrophic. It was exactly the same advice, but Mr Hulls has refused to make that available to the Australian people. He continues to hide that from the Australian people because he does not want the people to see the scientific advice that was before him. What the Labor Party is saying is that, when a Labor Party minister makes a decision to stop a wind farm in a Labor electorate, it is based on science, but if I make a decision it is political. I refer the senator to someone who did in fact play politics with the Bald Hills wind farm, and that is a now retired, or defeated, member of parliament: Christian Zahra. I will table this document. Christian Zahra sent out a wind power station survey before the last election.
—Is that why you used taxpayers’ money?
—Order! Senator Evans!
—He promoted the fact that he had brought into the parliament a thing called the Local Community Input into Renewable Energy Developments Bill 2003. This was Christian Zahra’s private member’s bill, which I presume, if it had got to the Senate, Senator Evans and Senator Wong would have voted for. This bill would have ensured the very big subsidies that the federal government provides to wind power. I remind the Senate that this is a government that has supplied $3 billion worth of subsidies to produce 600 wind turbines. This government is, in fact, the best friend the wind energy industry has ever had. But Christian Zahra, a member of the Labor Party, made it very clear to his constituents—
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. It is very interesting hearing about the minister’s interest in someone who was once in the parliament, but the question was a very specific one, about one sentence in the Biosis report that the minister has conveniently edited from all of his answers in defence. It was a very specific question. The minister has made very little, if any, attempt to address the issue in the question. I ask you to remind him of relevance.
—On the point of order, Mr President.
—Yes, on the point of order, Senator.
—The senator’s question related to whether this was a political decision and I am addressing the issue of the politics. Furthermore, she says that I deleted one aspect from my defence. In fact, unlike Minister Hulls, I published the whole of the Biosis report on the internet and I call on Mr Hulls to publish his advice.
—I hear the points of order.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. It goes to the minister answering questions that are directed to him about his responsibilities. While he may be interested in Victoria—he may want to move to Victoria; he may want to have a personal relationship with Mr Hulls—the point is he is here as the responsible minister to answer for his decisions. He is making no attempt to answer and defend those decisions.
—I hear your points of order. We have had three points of order, which will mean that the opposition gets fewer questions today. Senator Campbell, I would remind you of the question and remind you also that you have a minute and a half to complete your answer.
—I was talking about the fact that Christian Zahra had reminded his constituents that there were very big subsidies paid by the federal government—and I am quoting from his brochure—to wind power generators and his bill would ensure that those subsidies would only go to those wind developments built in areas where the local community supports them. Without the federal government subsidies, these developments would not be economically viable. Christian Zahra was quite right on that.
—That’s what you said in Denmark when you were playing politics.
—Order, Senator Evans!
—Yes.

Senator Chris Evans interjecting—

—Senator Evans, I will not call you again. If you keep interrupting, I will warn you.
—I certainly hope that Senator Wong will ask a supplementary question because I still have a lot of material here to address. Mr Zahra asked all of his constituents in the Bald Hills area, ‘Do you think that the growing number of wind power station developments will damage the beauty of the South Gippsland coastal area, yes or no?’ Then he said, ‘Do you support Christian Zahra’s private member’s bill, which will give local communities a bigger say as to where the wind turbines are built?’ When Senator Wong asks her supplementary, which I hope she does, I hope she will also say whether she would have voted for Christian Zahra’s bill if it had come before the Senate. Would Senator Faulkner have supported Christian Zahra’s bill? Would Senator Evans?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Wind Farms</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer
"Campbell, Sen Ian",NA,2006-08-09,"—The answer is yes. The Commonwealth government has spent in excess of $1 million on orange-bellied parrot recovery programs. The Victorian government, working in cooperation with the orange-bellied parrot recovery team, has in fact either stopped or moved 12 other developments in the potential habitat area. So there is substantial work going on to address all of those. I think that Senator Wong should refer to Christian Zahra’s pamphlet, which says, ‘There are many important industries in our area which can be badly affected by wind power station developments, like tourism, and appropriate—
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The minister was asked a question about the Biosis report and he is answering in relation to something completely different—a petition. How on earth can that possibly be relevant? I understand the minister does not want to answer the question because he has no answer.
—On the point of order, Mr President.
—Yes, on the point of order.
—You cannot ask a question that accuses me of making a political decision and ignoring science and then not address both issues in the answer. If the senator wants to ask me a question, she cannot then dictate how I answer it. I will answer it and address the accusations she has made and address the question she has asked.
—On the point of order, I think everybody would have heard, if they could hear over the noise in the chamber, that the minister did answer the second part of the question. He has 24 seconds left to complete his answer to that supplementary question. I remind all senators that interjections across the chamber are disorderly. Today has been rather noisy and I hope that you will cease making these interjections across the chamber.
—I want to conclude by making the case that the Labor Party’s hypocrisy on this knows no bounds. The former Labor member for McMillan was going around telling constituents that many business groups and businesspeople are concerned about the effect of wind power stations and that the Foster chamber of commerce recently passed a motion objecting to the establishment of further wind power stations. The reality is that, if Christian Zahra had been re-elected, this mob would have voted to stop the Bald Hills proposal. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-08-09,"—My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, and relates to a matter causing serious concern to Aboriginal communities throughout Far North Queensland. I draw the minister’s attention to a recent report in the Cairns Post quoting the CEO of Hope Vale Aboriginal community calling for a crisis meeting between all of the councils on Cape York and the federal Department of Employment and Workplace Relations over what he described as ‘profound problems with the changes made to the Community Development Employment Project that have created a nightmare for the cape’s Aboriginal communities.’ Is the minister aware of similar criticisms by the CEO of Lockhart River Aboriginal community, and the councillor at Meppoon community on the west of the cape, that the CDEP changes have undone years of work building up a ‘no work, no pay’ ethic in the community and that the government’s changes have resulted in sit-down money being paid in the community for the first time in years? What is the government’s response to these concerns? What action has the government taken to meet with Aboriginal people at the community level to work through the problems being caused by the CDEP changes to ensure they do not negatively impact on the economies and communities of Cape York?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Indigenous Communities</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-08-09,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his response and I acknowledge the previous problems with the CDEP that he described. They were not just expressed by former Senator Ridgeway but by Cape York communities themselves. I ask the minister: how does so-called improving or reforming a program in a way that ends up giving people sit-down money help to address those problems which have been widely acknowledged? How does taking resources out of Aboriginal communities help to improve things for individuals in those communities? I also ask the minister to address one of the other concerns relating to this matter. Many Aboriginal people in the communities on the cape are asking whether there is a hidden agenda of the federal and state governments to close down some remote communities. Given the difficulty in improving your community, you may be wondering whether the government desires to close the community down the track. Can the minister give the Senate an assurance that there is no agenda or plan to do this?
An honourable senator interjecting—",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Indigenous Communities</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-08-09,"—I can inform Senator Bartlett and the Senate that the minister is aware of the views that Senator Bartlett has expressed in his question. We are, of course, widely recognised as a consultative government; and so, of course, we will listen to those people that have concerns in this particular area. I should also say that, because we are a consultative government, we listened very carefully to some of the concerns about the way CDEP was being administered. Comments such as:
CDEP was ... a poor substitute for real jobs and not enough was done to provide the pathways for real outcomes. It sat there for 25 years and longer and the governments, irrespective of their persuasion, didn’t look ... beyond that.
They are the words of former Australian Democrats Senator Aden Ridgeway.
We as a government said CDEP should be put out to a competitive tender process. The organisations that have complained about the outcomes are, not surprisingly, those organisations that were not successful in that competitive tender process. I am advised that the competitive tender process was done on the basis of the normal sorts of qualities that are looked for—issues of governance, financial capacity and viability.
The government and the minister in particular make no apology for the fact that with our CDEP funding we are concerned about the individual outcomes for individual participants in the CDEP schemes. We are not about providing funding to particular organisations; that is not the aim of using taxpayers’ money. We want actual outcomes for individual participants. We want to engage those individual participants in a meaningful way in self-help, in community projects and in ensuring their genuine job readiness so that they can participate in the ever-growing employment market in our country.
So whilst on one hand the government accepts that there will be concerns expressed by those organisations that did not successfully tender, on the other hand there are organisations that were successful and that are confident that they can deliver for the benefit of the Indigenous communities for which this money was made available. As to whether the minister would seek to have further discussions with the Aboriginal communities referred to by Senator Bartlett, I am willing to see whether the minister is desirous of adding to the answer that I have provided. If he is, I will get back to the honourable senator.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Indigenous Communities</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-08-09,"—I am not sure who interjected that Senator Bartlett was doing well until he came up with the suggestion of a hidden agenda. Really, I do not think that suggestion does him any justice. I indicate to Senator Bartlett and the Senate that this is not about taking money out of the communities of Far North Queensland. Indeed, as part of our changes, the remote area exemptions were lifted, which means that more money for the CDEP schemes is being delivered into areas such as Far North Queensland. So rather than taking money out of these communities, I am advised that in fact extra money is going into those communities. Of course, the money is going in via a different service provider. I think that is at the heart of the difficulties regarding some of these organisations—they feel aggrieved that they are no longer going to be the service providers. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Indigenous Communities</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-08-09,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate censures the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Ian Campbell) for:
abusing his powers under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999;
undermining the administration of the Act; and
exposing the Commonwealth to legal and financial risk.
In doing so, I indicate that Labor have rarely moved censure motions against ministers in this chamber. I think this is the first one we have moved following the last federal election. I regard it as a very serious charge and a very serious resolution. While government senators may not like the Senate seeking to hold ministers accountable, I would argue this is one of our core functions.
What we have seen over the last few weeks is confirmation that the process of approval of the Bald Hills project was politically corrupted. The minister did not exercise his judgement and his responsibilities according to the law; he exercised them according to the political needs of the Liberal Party. This is a classic case, a terrible case, of an abuse of the minister’s function and an abuse of his ministerial responsibilities, and the minister stands condemned for it.
Day after day the minister has been given the opportunity to defend himself. The minister was given an opportunity in question time yesterday and he could come up with no defence. He was given the opportunity to defend himself on an urgency motion yesterday, and it was the most pathetic attempt at a defence for a decision by a minister seen in this parliament. It was absolutely pathetic. He sought to discuss Senator Kim Carr, the Victorian Labor Party and a whole range of matters but he offered not one iota, not one shred, of defence for his decision-making process. Again in question time today the minister ignored every question, refused to answer and instead talked at length about a former Labor member of the House of Representatives and his activities, not once trying to deal with the issues.
The issues are clear and obvious to all. The minister failed to do his duty as minister. He is no longer able to hold this important office, he ought to be sacked and he ought to be censured by this chamber because he failed to exercise his duties as he should have. It is an open-and-shut case to which the minister has no defence.
I invite people to have a look at his 10-minute contribution yesterday. It was pathetic. It had no basis for a defence at all. He even admitted that today by complimenting Senator Brandis for his defence of him. I thought Senator Brandis’s defence, a typical lawyer’s effort, was not bad given the material he had. But quite frankly it was outstanding compared to Senator Campbell’s effort. He fumbled around with no idea how to defend his decision because it is absolutely indefensible.
We know what is at the heart of this decision. We only have to go back to his letter to the residents of McMillan which was put out just before the last federal election—a letter from Senator Ian Campbell on official letterhead in his capacity as minister. We still do not know who paid for this campaign letter. We have not been able to ascertain from Senator Campbell how this was funded and I hope he might, during this debate, let us know. But Senator Campbell wrote a totally political letter which starts off discussing the election, makes a cursory reference to mandatory renewable energy targets and then he is into it by the third paragraph:
Labor’s Christian Zahra is sworn to support Mark Latham’s policy and that means many more wind farms in South Gippsland.
The minister sets himself up as the opponent of wind farms in South Gippsland. He goes on to say that unless you vote for us these developments will pick up. He goes on further to say:
... that when the Howard government is returned to office I will also ensure that the funding of any future renewable energy programs are contingent upon community involvement and support.
That is a direct message to those campaigning against wind farms in the seat of McMillan. Further, he goes on to say:
... should Christian Zahra, the Labor candidate, be elected that will be a sign that you are happy to play host to increasing numbers of wind turbines in your region.
In other words, ‘Vote for the Liberal candidate and I will make sure they don’t happen. I will put in the political fix.’ The now member for McMillan, Russell Broadbent, went around the electorate saying, ‘I’ve got a promise from Senator Campbell. He’s assured me the Bald Hills project will get knocked off if we get returned to government.’ The minister for the environment, in his capacity, wrote to everyone saying that he would be making sure that these developments did not occur. The Liberal candidate campaigned on it, it was reported in the press and the community members were all advised.
So you have the minister already committed to a course of action in relation to this project. When it comes before him, does he declare his interest? Does he make it clear that he is in no position to make an independent decision because he has already committed himself to a course of action? No. He abuses his position, does not stand aside and he sets himself up to make a decision on a proposition that he has already campaigned against. He has already promised the electors of McMillan that he will not be supporting propositions like this.
We have a minister who should have stood aside from making that decision in accordance with proper processes but he did not. What he did was wait 450 days when he was required to act within 30. What happened in that 450 days? He went in search of a dead parrot, something that would allow him to hang a defence around. Why did it take him 450 days? Because there was not a defence; he could not find one. For 450 days he tried to avoid making the decision. He commissioned report after report after report. They all said to him, ‘There is no basis for that decision. You ought to approve it.’ Report after report, advice after advice. Why did he keep looking? The advice was not inconclusive; the advice was very conclusive. The advice said, ‘Approve the project.’ The advice said, ‘You have no basis for knocking it back.’ So what did he do? He said he needed another report. That report came back with no basis for knocking it off. He said he needed another report and said, ‘I will keep looking for 450 days until they force me into the courts before I make a decision.’
Finally he was dragged into the courts because he had failed to exercise his duties as minister. He had deferred making a decision. Finally he was called in and forced to come to a decision. His last roll of the dice was the Biosis report which we have obviously heard a lot about in recent times. The Biosis report again does not support the minister’s decision. Constantly he has misrepresented the report in this chamber and outside by selectively quoting. He could not even bring himself to finish the paragraph that he uses in his defence. Why? Because it undermines his whole case.
For the record, the remainder of the Biosis paragraph is this:
Our analysis suggests that such action—
that is, blocking wind farms—
will have extremely limited beneficial value to the conservation of the parrot without addressing the very much greater adverse effects that are currently operating against it.
In other words, knocking this wind farm over will do nothing to save the parrot. There are a whole range of measures that could be implemented but they do nothing to save the parrots, and this is the basis upon which he knocked off a $220 million project. This is the minister who is entrusted by parliament and entrusted in law to exercise his discretion according to law. He did not do that. He exercised it according to his desperate search for an excuse to defend his exercise of another science—not science as we understand it, not environmental science and not the science pertaining to the threat to endangered species, but political science: the political science of winning McMillan. That was the only science that underpinned this decision and the only thing that motivated the minister.
So, after 450 days and being dragged into court, he hangs on to one paragraph of a report that clearly says there is no defence for his decision. When that comes to a head he finds that only one parrot will die in 1,000 years. I suspect quite a few more will die of old age in that period. There is a 0.001 chance that, of the 15 parrots that might fly into the area each year, one may be killed in a collision with a turbine. The risk is minuscule. There are threats to the parrot but this is not one of them. The minister had very clear advice about that.
The thing that really condemns the minister is his own department’s advice, because they were very concerned about the path he was going down. They urged him time and time again not to go down that path because they knew that this would be subject to legal challenge, that it would be exposed for a rort and that the Commonwealth would be liable to be sued for damages. They gave him advice all right—senior advice signed off by a senior departmental officer in March this year. It recommended that the project should be approved. The senior officer, Gerard Early, advised that there was no evidence of any direct impact on the parrot and under the act there were no grounds to oppose the project.
That is not equivocal. That is not: ‘Minister, you can choose one path or the other.’ There are no grounds to oppose the project; there is just clear unequivocal advice from his department. It was not some mad left-wing scientist or someone with a vested interest in the issue but his own department exercising its responsibilities under the act. Mr Early’s advice specifically noted the significant consequences of using the Biosis report to block the project. To do so would cause serious uncertainty for coastal development along thousands of kilometres of coastline. It would dramatically lower the threshold of ‘significant impact’ under the environmental act—a case that Senator Brandis tried to argue yesterday, which was specifically rejected by the department. It was made very clear that by taking this action the minister undermined the operations of the act, undermined the threshold for ‘significant impact’, was putting at risk the department’s role in a whole range of other applications and was making its position totally inconsistent with other decisions it had made. For those reasons, the department strongly recommended that the project be allowed to proceed.
But the minister knows better. He says, ‘I am no Yes Minister.’ That may be true; he is no minister at all. No minister could act in the way he has. All the advice and all the reports said that this project ought to proceed. He had obligations to the Australian taxpayer and to this parliament under the act. All of those were swept away as he pursued his narrow political interests and those of the Liberal Party. When did it come to a head? It only came to a head because the proponents were again forced to go to court to get him to do his job and to seek to overturn his decision. What happened? Just as the case was starting the minister signed up to a deal that said he would reconsider the proposal. If you were so confident in your position and your processes and if you had the swagger and the global responsibilities and vision that the minister has, why would you fold at the first grapeshot? Because you did not have a case. The minister’s legal advice was that he had done the wrong thing, that he was going to cost taxpayers millions of dollars and that he ought to get out of it before it got so damaging that he was forced to resign.
So he got out of it. He did a deal with the company, which was obviously keen to pursue its claims. It just wants to get ahead and do business, so it settled on the basis that the minister would reconsider the decision on the basis of the law—the thing that he should have applied in the first place; the sort of advice that was provided by the department. They acted according to the law and they said that there was no basis whatsoever for the minister to proceed as he did. They knew the law; they knew the propriety; they knew what was expected of them in exercising their obligations under the act. But this minister did not exercise his obligations under the act; he sought to pursue the narrow political interests of the political party at the expense of doing his job. This is clearly established and on the record.
The pathetic defence that the minister has offered this week confirms that there is no defence. It is why he ran up the white flag at court on the first day and agreed to pay costs. He agreed on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia to pay for his arrogance, for his contempt and for his abuse of process. Every taxpayer listening to this ought to know that they are going to be digging into their pockets to pay to get this bloke out of trouble because of him putting in the political fix. We are all going to pay for it and, if he does not approve it next time, we will be paying damages. I have a funny feeling that at some stage the minister will find that the parrot has been saved by some other method. Perhaps mouth-to-mouth resuscitation by the minister will solve the problem and the wind farm can go ahead. I may be wrong, but I suspect that the legal advice is that he has to approve it this time or otherwise the damages claim will be so large that investment in this country will be threatened for a long time. The minister does not have one shred of a defence, other than to misquote and selectively quote a report that recommended he approve the project. He ignored advice after advice and report after report. For 450 days—a year and a half—he searched around, and the best he could come up with is that one parrot might get killed in 1,000 years.
I am an environmentalist. I do not pursue global quests quite as often as the minister does, and I do not big-note myself quite as much about that, but quietly, in my own way, I want to see species protected, apart from Liberal Party ministers. They are the only species that I think ought to be made extinct. Being an environmentalist is one thing, but it does not mean knocking back $220 million of investment on the possibility that one parrot every 1,000 years might fly into a rotor blade. It is complete nonsense! I know we should not go down the Monty Python road, and I will not, because the Long John Silver jokes, the dead parrot jokes and the cartoons have been done before. I could do it but it would just be mean, and it would distract from the fact that this is important. This is a very serious abuse of ministerial power and a very serious issue. The Commonwealth government and the taxpayers of Australia have been exposed to serious financial and legal risk. The proponents have twice had to go to court to get fair treatment. They have been denied natural justice time and time again by this minister because he does not want to have to give in on his political promise. I pay due credit to Senator Campbell. The one thing that he has been consistent on is that he is going to honour the political fix; he puts that above all else. He will not renege, until the next decision he has to make. Until the last ditch, he has been unprepared to ditch the political promise that he made. It is arrogance, it is an abuse of his power and he ought to be censured by this Senate.
Senator Campbell has abused his responsibilities under the act. He has abused the administration of the act. What credibility can the environment minister and the department have after this decision? If you are looking to get a decision out of this minister, the first thing you do is look up the electorate map of Australia and see where you might put something and whether it suits Senator Campbell’s interests. He is pro wind farms in certain seats, and he is very anti them in the other. He makes a big man of himself down in Denmark, in the south-west of WA, when it suits his political interests, but when it suits other interests he is all for wind turbines. The inconsistency of the decision making is just amazing. He says in his defence, ‘Labor would put more wind farms in McMillan than we would, but I have approved 600 in the last few months.’ Is he for wind farms or is he against? Are there going to be more under us or more under him? He is just totally selective. The only criterion he applies to applications for wind farms is politics. Political science is the only basis for the decisions he has taken.
Now the minister is going to reconsider his decision. The bloke that delayed for 450 days, who put the fix in and who refused to apply the act, is now, under the Howard government, going to be asked to make a fair decision according to law. You would have a lot of confidence in that, wouldn’t you? Will he stand aside this time? I guess not. This is the clearest example of a minister failing the parliament. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,8,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-08-09,"—I have had the distinction of sitting here over a few years and listening to the odd censure motion by the Labor Party against Liberal ministers and I have had the odd opportunity in opposition to listen to opposition censure motions against Labor ministers, and I have got to say that that was probably the most limp-wristed and pathetic first speech in a censure motion that I have ever heard. I was sitting here waiting to see if they have got some reason to censure me, and during 20 minutes of bluster and repetition I sat here with my notebook waiting for Senator Evans to say something that I could actually take a note of and respond to, and the notebook is basically as blank as it was when he started.
—Don’t you wish you were still in the Democrats?
—It does give me the opportunity, however, to run through the process and the reasons.
—See no evil; hear no evil.
—We know that the Labor Party are not interested, because they have got very serious difficulties with the hypocrisy that is going on on their own side on this issue.
—Two minutes of your defence and you are already off track!
—Mr Deputy President, I look forward to being able to respond to this censure motion, but it is very difficult unless the other side maintains some sort of order. I note that Senator Carr has already been named in this session. One of the accusations is that the legal process was somehow not abided by, but the reality is that the legal process was gone through meticulously. The only reason that the proponent went to the court last week—and in fact approached us the week before and said, ‘We don’t want this to be in court anymore’—is because they did not have the chance before I made the decision to review the Biosis report. I happen to think that their having access to the Biosis report was an entirely fair thing.
I will repeat this; I did say it yesterday, but Senator Evans either is a slow learner or does not listen very well: the only reason they did not have access to the Biosis report—the cumulative impact assessment report, which is the report that assesses the combined effect of wind farms along that coast—was that the Biosis report was before me. The proponents knew it was before me; we told them very openly that I was considering this report. They did not seek a copy of the report. What they did was tell us that they intended to go to court to force me to make a decision. We said to them: ‘Look, there’s no need for you to go to court; I am reading the report at the moment. I should have completed reading it within a couple of days and, having read the report, would be happy to make the decision.’ That is the only reason—
—Did they go to court? Did they put any documents before the court?
—It is very hard to speak when you—
—Senator Carr, I have you on the speakers list; you will have your opportunity to raise those issues then. Senator Campbell is entitled to be heard.
—The only reason they did not have access to that report was because they forced me to make a decision before they possibly could have access to it. I think it is entirely reasonable that they have access to that report, and that is why, when they approached me last week and said, ‘We would like to get this out of court so we have time to consider the cumulative impact assessment report on the basis that you would receive a new submission from us,’ I thought that was an entirely reasonable and sensible thing to do. So for the Labor Party to seek to make some sort of political mileage out of an agreement between the government and the proponent—a consent order to say, ‘Let’s move the process along; let’s ensure we have the opportunity to review this report’—is quite silly. It is hypocrisy to accuse me of using politics in this process when in fact it is the Labor Party who is trying to politicise it.
In terms of the departmental process, the Labor Party accuses me of taking a long time and of shopping around for a report. The department came to me with their advice and said, ‘Minister, it would be appropriate to have a look at the cumulative impact of wind farms.’ They gave me the advice; it was their idea. They said, ‘We should commission a report.’ They said this in about May of 2005. In 2005 the department advised me that we should commission a report on the cumulative impact assessment. That seemed reasonable to me, and it would probably seem reasonable to any sensible person. One person who I am not sure is sensible or not, and who would be a lot closer to Senator Evans, politically, than I, made a statement in the House of Representatives a couple of years ago when he looked at the issue of wind farm development in the Gippsland area. He quoted the Australian Wind Energy Association, that said:
... 62 wind turbines are dotted along the Victorian coast, but plans have been lodged for about 1,000 to be operating between 2005 and 2006.
So we have 62 wind turbines dotted along the Victorian coast now, according to this—

Senator Sherry interjecting—

—It is actually Christian Zahra that I am quoting from. He said in the House of Representatives in 2003 that there are likely to be 1,000 wind farms operating along that coast. The department, Christian Zahra and the Australian Wind Energy Association agreed on the incredibly sensible position that, with the cumulative impact of wind turbines on that coast, it was an important way to go. So the department advised me to do that. You can accuse me of some abuse of the process. So I said, ‘Yes, let’s do a cumulative impact report’, which they did, which then came to me in about March or April of this year.
—Table all the advice.
—Everything has been tabled in the court. Everything is out there. Senator Sherry says, ‘Table the advice.’ All of these documents are entirely before the Australian public. The only other document—if we go back to the capital ‘h’ hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this—is the advice to the Labor Party government in Victoria which said exactly the same thing about the cumulative impact on migratory birds of wind turbines on the Gippsland coast. That is a report from the Department of Sustainability and Environment in Victoria. It remains a secret report and it comes to the same conclusion that the Biosis report does, and that is that orange-bellied parrots transit through this location, that the turbines would be a substantial threat to the survival of that species and that a conservative approach needs to be taken to the development. That is the advice that the Labor Party are very embarrassed to see. We know that Mr Hulls will not release it. We know that the Labor Party’s hypocrisy on this knows no bounds.
The other point that needs to be made, when you have the Labor Party windbagging on about this issue, is that Christian Zahra’s bill remains, I presume, the Australian Labor Party policy. I think it would be in the interests of full disclosure of all the events for me to table the Local Community Input into Renewable Energy Developments Bill 2003. I will do so. I am sure that the Clerk of the Senate is wondering whether or not it is appropriate to table a House of Representatives bill that may have expired.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Evans and Senator Sherry, Senator Campbell is entitled to be heard.
—This is Labor’s policy. This is the policy supported by the Labor leadership. It has not been repealed, as far as I know. It says that it would repeal the section of the renewable energy act, a law of this parliament, and require that a power station, to be eligible for accreditation—that is, to receive the $3 billion worth of subsidies to the wind energy industry that Christian Zahra refers to—would need to meet a couple of conditions. One of the conditions is that, if a local power station were to be eligible to receive renewable energy credits, it would have to—and I quote from clause 1(2)(c) of the Labor Party’s legislation—receive approval of ‘the relevant local council or councils’. The relevant local council or councils did not approve this development, nor do any of the councils in the area. If the Labor Party’s policy had been in place, they would have stopped the Bald Hills wind farm. It was actually Christian Zahra’s policy, Mark Latham’s policy and, we presume, Kim Beazley’s policy to stop the Bald Hills wind farm.
What is the accusation against me? I assessed the proposal under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, I made a determination that it would have an impact on a threatened species under the relevant section of the act and I said, ‘No, the development should not go ahead.’ The Labor Party were not going to go through an existing law; they were going to come in here, if Mr Latham had become Prime Minister—we presume that they would do that if Mr Beazley were to become Prime Minister—and bring into being the Local Community Input into Renewable Energy Developments Bill. They would have brought a whole new law into place. They would not have used an existing law and gone through a proper and correct legal process. They would have actually changed the law and effectively brought in retrospective legislation to stop the Bald Hills wind farm. You cannot really see greater hypocrisy than that.
The other point that needs to be made is that there is a substantial issue in Australia that does need to be addressed. Christian Zahra was right and the Australian Wind Energy Association is right. There are going to be more and more wind developments around Australia. We do have a substantial issue with climate change to address. It needs to be managed well. Wind energy does have a part to play. This government has, in fact, supported the construction of 600 wind turbines across Australia, and by and large they make a great contribution to a cleaner and more secure energy future for Australia.
The government have a comprehensive policy to address climate change. We do want to ensure that solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, geosequestration, capture and storage of carbon from coal—all of the prerequisites to a comprehensive climate change management program—are put in place. And wind will be a part of that strategy; it needs to be a part of that strategy. With the Labor Party we see this sort of crass politicisation of wind energy that is taking place. You have the Australian Labor Party down in Victoria saying, ‘We can’t have a wind farm in a Labor electorate. We cannot have a wind farm at Ballan, we cannot have one at Port Fairy, but we want one at Bald Hills.’ There is no science, no justification for it. They just say, ‘We’ll stop it if it’s in a Labor electorate and we’ll approve it if it’s in a Liberal electorate.’ It is pure politics—no interest in the environment, no interest in sensible and rational climate change policy, just pure politics and hypocrisy from the Labor Party.
The coalition government’s credentials on preserving habitat and putting in place recovery programs for a range of species are now substantial. I think it was a very fair question today from Senator Wong when she asked: ‘What are you doing to address other issues? Are you in fact being selective and just saying, “We’ll stop a wind farm”?’ In fact, the coalition’s record is clear on its investment to seek to ensure that the orange-bellied parrot has some chance of survival. I remind the Senate that this is a species that is down to 50 breeding pairs. Before this debate hotted up and became controversial, most Australians probably would not have been aware of the impact that wind turbines have on migratory birds. It is in fact the case that wind turbines of the size of the Bald Hills ones will kill around 100 birds a year. That is one every few days. We have recently seen an assessment done of the Woolnorth wind farm in Tasmania. It was assessed that that wind farm would kill one wedge-tailed eagle a year, and it has killed one a month in the last three months. The wedge-tailed eagle is a highly threatened species, with only 130 breeding pairs left. So that is a massive impact on that species.
We have had a comprehensive policy put in place to ensure the recovery and viability of the orange-bellied parrot population. This has involved in total around $1 million of investment from the Commonwealth government. There is $80,000 a year for orange-bellied parrot recovery programs and $492,800 over three years to find and conserve key mainland habitat for the orange-bellied parrot. Further comprehensive work is being done on the King Island multispecies recovery plan to assist the orange-bellied parrot and there is a $29,000 program to bring cats under control on King Island. There are also orange-bellied parrot captive breeding programs. There is a range of programs adding up to over $1 million. So this is not a government that has just taken a recent interest in the orange-bellied parrot, unlike the Labor Party, who have chosen to make cheap politics out of it.
—You are accusing us of making cheap politics out of it! What a hypocrite!
—Senator Evans, withdraw that comment, please.
—I withdraw, Mr Deputy President.
—This government has a longstanding record of work on not only this threatened species but also a range of species. I believe that we do have to ensure that communities are part of decision making when it comes to wind farms. Christian Zahra was quite right on this, though I think he chose to go about it the wrong way. I think retrospectively changing the renewable energy target program and effectively banning Bald Hills retrospectively, which is what the Labor Party pledged at the last election, was the wrong way to go.
The reason that I think communities should be engaged is that these wind farms do have a significant impact. They can have a significant impact on property values and a significant impact on tourism. Communities should be engaged. That is why I have proposed a national code for wind farms and I have put out a discussion paper. Every single state government has opposed it—and you do not wonder why when you have an environment minister like Mr Mark McGowan in Western Australia, who says in relation to community consultation on wind farms: ‘Sometimes when local communities don’t agree you have to roll over the top of them.’
—Who said that?
—He is the WA Labor minister for the environment. He said: ‘Sometimes when local communities don’t agree you have to roll over the top of them.’
—Can you prove that?
—Order, Senator Sterle!
—In relation to the siting of wind farms in his own state, Mr McGowan, the WA Labor minister for the environment, said: ‘Sometimes when local communities don’t agree you have to roll over the top of them.’
We believe that wind does have a future in Australia. We believe that it can make a contribution to renewable energy, but we also know that these large industrial wind farms do have massive impacts on communities and potentially massive impacts on the survival of threatened species. You can in fact have a renewable energy policy that builds renewable energy facilities that do make a positive contribution to the environment and minimise their environmental damange. You can in fact have a win-win if you manage it well. But if you do as Labor does and just play cheap politics with this issue, you will actually destroy the chance of the wind energy industry in Australia for all time. I want to work with that industry. I want to make sure that they have a sustainable industry here. Labor obviously wants to work against them.
—Senator Ian Campbell, when you were addressing the chair you were referring to a document and you may have interpreted the response of the Clerk as being that that document could not be tabled in the Senate. I inform you that it is possible to table it.
—I table the document.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,8,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-08-09,"—If ever there were a case where a minister should not just be censured but also be sacked, it is this one. If we look at the speaker’s list for this debate today, we can see from the list of government speakers that those on the other side of the chamber know this to be the case as well. I have no doubt that Senator Ian Campbell would be somewhat disappointed. Over the six years that he was a parliamentary secretary, he would have had to come in here time and again and defend ministers and he would have seen ministers defend ministers. But, when a censure motion is moved against him, not one minister is put on the list to defend his actions.
The Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Minchin, is not on the speaker’s list. There is no minister from that frontbench on this list to defend the miserable action taken by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell. Why? I put it to you, Mr Deputy President, that it is because they know that there is to be a fundamental redistribution of the frontbench as a result of this minister’s action. They know the truth of this matter—that is, that this minister not only deserves censure but also deserves the sack. It is only a matter of time before the Prime Minister sees the truth of that as well. They know the truth of the matter. Senator Minchin has not come in here to defend his colleague because he knows the truth of this matter.
The Australian political system and its environmental legislation provide for considerable latitude in the actions a minister can take—if he acts in accordance with the law. For example, he can draw upon precedents. In the case of this government, there were five other decisions by ministers for the environment to approve wind farms which carried out management studies. There was a case in South Australia involving the Stanwell Corporation. There was a case back in 2001, when the then environment minister, Minister Hill, approved a 130-megawatt wind farm at Woolnorth in Tasmania on the condition that the Hydro-Electric Corporation ‘prepare a plan to repair or mitigate damage to the habitat of the orange-bellied parrot’. The management plan approved by the minister allowed for six parrots to be killed every two years.
Minister Kemp approved a 150-megawatt wind farm in 2002, on 17 October, for near Portland in Victoria. He did so on the specific condition that Pacific Hydro prepared a management plan that mitigated against impacts in the event of orange-bellied parrot mortalities as a result of collisions with turbines. In 2002 and 2003, various ministers approved wind farms near Port MacDonnell in South Australia and Jims Plains in Tasmania—again with management plans attached. So the minister had plenty of precedents to call upon. In fact, the circumstances are such that this government has managed to ban wind farms where there are no orange-bellied parrots but to provide permission for wind farms to be developed where there are parrots.
We have a situation where the minister can also rely upon the advice of his department. We have here a clear case where Mr Gerard Early—a man who I have observed over many years at Senate estimates committees to be of considerable reputation within the Australian Public Service and a person who is known to not be a red hot radical but rather a moderate, considered and conservative public servant—advised the minister not in any equivocal way but in an unequivocal way that there were no grounds for him to act on this matter. In fact, the advice was that if he did he would be opening the government to legal challenge over a whole range of developments around the south-east coast of Australia. The minister chose to ignore that advice as well.
The minister, however, accepted the advice that he himself gave to the electorate of McMillan back in October 2004, during the federal election. It is clear what occurred. As we know, there was a federal election on 9 October 2004. On 12 October 2004, the local newspaper in McMillan, the Great Southern Star from Leongatha, provided us with details of the Liberal candidate saying, ‘When Ian Campbell arrived, the whole complexion of the campaign changed for me.’ Senator Campbell gave a commitment to do everything within his power under the EPBC Act to veto the Bald Hills project. That was a position that he made clear three days after the election. A statement was made in the local newspaper to that effect. It follows the articles that were published in other newspapers at the time and the letter that the minister distributed throughout the electorate during that election campaign. It is quite clear that the minister acted not on the basis of legal advice, not on the basis of departmental advice, not on the basis of precedent but on the political basis that he had committed to a position before he had considered the evidence.
The illusions of this minister, like so many broken pieces of china at a Greek wedding, were smashed by Justice Weinberg on 4 August, when he said that the decision of the respondent dated 3 April was to be set aside. He said that the matter was to be remitted to the respondent for reconsideration ‘according to law’ and that the respondent should pay the applicant’s cost, to be taxed in default of agreement. The minister has confirmed that that is the commitment he gave.
—It was a consent order.
—As the senator representing the Perry Masons of the backbench has indicated, it was a consent order. And he caved in; he surrendered to it. That was the legal advice that he was finally forced to accept, because he had no defence at law for his actions and had to give in and agree that his position was indefensible, which was clear for anyone else to see. That position was clearly spelt out in the Senate estimates. It was clearly demonstrated in the Senate estimates that the minister’s position was totally indefensible.
What strikes me here is that the minister’s obligation to be fair and transparent in the way in which he administers the duties of his ministerial office has been fundamentally corroded by the political commitments that he gave during the election campaign. He has prostituted his office as a consequence of making those commitments to the electorate of McMillan, as part of the marginal seat strategy of the Liberal Party, rather than undertaking his office on the basis of the integrity and legitimacy of the legislative and regulatory processes that are available to him as a minister within this government.
Quite simply, we take the view that this minister has to go. Any analysis of the extraordinary events over the past two years makes it very clear that there are three basic problems in the way in which he has behaved: firstly, he has corrupted environmental approval processes for party political gain; secondly, he has twisted and misused scientific evidence provided to him in the approval process and he has been caught out doing so; and, thirdly, he has now been forced to backflip in the Federal Court and has exposed the Commonwealth of Australia to the potential of considerable legal liability. These are all serious failings for any minister and collectively they are grounds for dismissal. This Senate ought to censure this minister and the Prime Minister ought to sack him.
Let us go through the issues that I mentioned. On the matter of misusing his office for political advantage, it has become quite apparent that Senator Ian Campbell pursued these policies following the commitments he gave in McMillan during the election campaign. He saw an opportunity to use his office to swing a marginal seat in Victoria to the Liberal Party. Before he had even sighted scientific analysis against this proposal, he publicly announced that he would do everything in his power as a minister to halt the Bald Hills project.
The scientific evidence is that there were no parrots identified in the surveys undertaken. Over a 12-month period, the consultants undertook a study, and 10,441 birds were seen, but not one single orange-bellied parrot was spotted. There was no record of the orange-bellied parrot at Bald Hills. There was identified, 20 kilometres away, a habitat for the orange-bellied parrot. There was in fact a sighting 40 kilometres away from the proposed wind farm site, but there had already been a wind farm approved for that site. But in the case of Bald Hills the scientific facts were very clear. The minister commissioned advice, it did not suit his purpose and he chose to ignore it. He sought advice from the department and that did not suit him, so he ignored that. He ignored the legal precedent established by his own colleagues in previous Howard governments. He sought to buy time, 450 days of time. He sought to avoid the fact that he had to make a decision within 30 days. He chose to ignore that in his desperate bid, his desperate worldwide quest, to find a parrot that would suit his purposes with regard to Bald Hills.
The second line of defence that he chose to use was to white-ant the approval process. Despite his very best efforts, he could not find a mechanism to do that, because his own department confirmed the validity of the Victorian approval processes. Independent experts retained by his department reached the same conclusions. In fact, his expert went further, to an unwelcome extent. She argued that the analysis was clear and that further research would be of no use to him. This is exactly what Senator Campbell did not want to hear. He did not want this project to proceed, no matter what the science said, and it did not suit him to have his own departmental officials tell him that he was dead wrong. That is what occurred. He went ahead anyway. He commissioned further advice, this time a general study of the possible impact of wind farms. He chose to look at 23 separate examples and still did not come up with the result that he wanted. This process was, of course, an attempt to buy time and defer decisions, but the proponent intervened with court action and forced him to make a decision. That decision was made, and it went against the company. It was finally overturned by the Federal Court on 4 August.
There is a problem here of a minister ignoring scientific advice, and we know that in this portfolio it is particularly important for the minister of the Crown to pursue evidence based policy. That is exactly what we have not got in this case. We have got a decision being taken by the minister on political grounds, not on scientific grounds. He wilfully defied the scientific advice, on the basis that he had already made a political decision. He sought to reinterpret that advice, to misrepresent that advice, to take evidence out of context, to twist it to his political advantage, and he has been caught out on that score as well. His hand-picked advice, the Biosis report, said that ‘almost any negative impact on the species could be sufficient to tip the balance’ against the parrot. However, the fundamental problem was to address that question at source, not by the rejection of this particular wind farm. That is what his scientific advice told him:
Our analyses suggest that such actions will have extremely limited beneficial value to conservation of the parrot without addressing very much greater adverse effects that are currently operating against it.
The real question that arises is: what action did the minister have to take to support his conclusions? He had no evidence to back up his decision, which had already been made. He fell back on twisting the evidence and relying on half-truths. Evidence was presented from the scientific research, and I quoted from it yesterday. Ashley Stephens, an officer of the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment, wrote to the authors of the Biosis report, asking whether the multiplied effect from tables 3 and 4 of the report meant that there was a mortality rate of one bird every 1,000 years. The senior zoologist confirmed on 7 April 2006 at 10.28 am, in an email response:
Yes you’ve calculated correctly.
So there was just no question about what the evidence was and what it meant, except for this minister. It fundamentally contradicted his major proposition. In the May estimates hearings, what did he try to do? He tried to bluff his way out of the situation again. He sought to abuse and denigrate members of the opposition. If I recall rightly, when I tabled that particular email he went so far as to suggest that I had acted improperly. I recall he even said that I was gutless. Whatever claims have been made against me, that is one that would not fit.
However, the Prime Minister has expressed some concern about the actions of this minister. For instance, on the Neil Mitchell program, which is broadcast on Southern Cross Radio, earlier this year Neil Mitchell asked the Prime Minister: ‘What about the moth?’ John Howard said to him, ‘The moth?’ The conversation continued:
NEIL MITCHELL: You’re going to stop a residential development at Melton because of a moth—the golden sun moth.
JOHN HOWARD: Who said that? I’m not aware of that. Who’s stopping it? A residential…
NEIL MITCHELL: You are.
JOHN HOWARD: I’m stopping it?
NEIL MITCHELL: Well, your minister.
JOHN HOWARD: My minister is?
NEIL MITCHELL: Ian Campbell is.
JOHN HOWARD: Well I will investigate that. He hasn’t taken any decision has he?
NEIL MITCHELL: No, he’s looking ... he’s considering whether the future of the moth is jeopardised.
John Howard then said: ‘Yeah, all right. I’ll have a look at it.’ Of course, the statement was made shortly thereafter that the housing development in Melton could go ahead.
We had a court fiasco, which was predicated, of course, to follow from such a trend of events. It was inevitable that the minister would get himself into such trouble. The end game is that it has highlighted the scandal within this government. The scandal within this government is that the minister for the environment is prepared to misuse his office, to prostitute his office, for political advantage and to do so to try to advance the marginal seat objectives of the Liberal Party in the state of Victoria. He has sought to ignore the clear precedents of previous ministers within the same government. He has sought to ignore the legal advice given to him. He has sought to ignore the unequivocal departmental advice given to him. He has now placed himself in the position where a Federal Court judge has told him that he must reconsider this matter according to law.
The wind farm has been set aside. He has agreed to pay the plaintiff’s costs. We all know that that does not occur in the Commonwealth of Australia unless the Commonwealth of Australia knows how weak its position is. I noticed in the press today, and the minister confirmed it in question time, that the very same project is now to be approved on the basis that the proponent comes back with a management plan, which, of course, is the position that should have been taken 450 days before the minister made his ill-fated decision on 3 April. The minister has found that his whole argument has been torn to shreds by the court in this country. The half-truths, the misrepresentations, the political hyperbole, have been exposed for the lies that they are. The minister’s position has been overturned at great expense to the Commonwealth. This is a clear case of there being no principles at stake because the minister has acted without principle. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,8,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2006-08-09,"—I have been sitting here for the last 20 minutes listening in utter fascination to Senator Carr constructing for himself an evermore implausible, elaborate, Byzantine conspiracy theory. As Senator Carr’s time counted down, I thought: ‘What a pity Senator Carr’s time is expiring, because, if he had another 10 minutes, I am sure he could have worked out a way to persuade himself that Senator Ian Campbell had something to do with the Kennedy assassination.’ Of course, Senator Carr, being an old-fashioned Stalinist, loves conspiracy theories. For Senator Carr, everything is a conspiracy. Senator Carr, I do not have any doubt that you believe it but, as the great Sir Isaiah Berlin once famously said, there is no a priori reason to believe that the truth, when discovered, will turn out to be interesting. Senator Carr, although I listened with rapt fascination to your elaborate baroque conspiracy theory, I am afraid the truth is much more prosaic.
What I am going to do in the time available to me is to take the Senate carefully, methodically, through the prosaic truth of the matter. But before I begin to do that—
 (Senator Troeth)—Order! There is an enormous amount of talk and laughter coming from the opposition benches. The Senate would be obliged if that ceased. Please resume, Senator Brandis.
—Before I do that, let me at once nail the misconception upon which Senator Carr’s—and indeed Senator Evans’s—entire case against Senator Ian Campbell seems to rest, and that is that there was a determination by the Federal Court of Australia against the minister’s decision last Friday. That is not right. What there was last Friday was a consensual settlement of the litigation between Bald Hills Wind Farm Pty Ltd and the Commonwealth on the basis of which a Federal Court judge made a consent order—the most commonplace routine form of legal order—
—What about a costs order?
—which, as you well know, Senator Wong—because unlike Senator Carr you do know a little about this—does not constitute, never constitutes, a determination by the court on the merits. Let us lay this to rest at the start. There has been no determination by any court on the merits of this case. What there has been is a negotiated resolution embodied in a consent order, and the use, as I tried to explain yesterday, of a formulaic expression in the consent order that it be remitted for determination according to law, which is purely a legal formula, does not constitute a decision by a court turning its mind to the merits of the question one way or the other.
Let us go back to the process, because the one thing that Senator Evans and Senator Carr did get right is that this is a question of process. The question on which Senator Ian Campbell stands or falls is the question of proper process. It seems to me that within that question there are three issues. The first issue is this: was the minister bound to follow the initial departmental advice, which it is common ground he did not follow? Plainly, the answer to that question is no, and I will explain why in a moment. The second issue is: was the minister entitled to commission and, having commissioned, to rely upon the study by Biosis Research Pty Ltd? Plainly, the answer to that question is yes. The third issue is: did the findings of the Biosis report support the minister’s conclusion? Plainly, once again, the answer to that question is yes.
—There’s a fourth question: why didn’t you ask the parrot?
—You can satirise this, Senator Forshaw, but if you are reduced to satire and the sort of Monty Python burlesque on which the Labor Party has gorged itself throughout question time rather than turning your mind to the legal, factual and scientific issues that are raised by this debate then no doubt those who listen to the debate will judge your contribution accordingly.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: Senator Brandis should be addressing his remarks through the chair and not to me directly, and it was Senator Brandis who raised Stalin and the Kennedy assassination.
 (Senator Troeth)—Senator Forshaw, in response to your point of order, Senator Brandis has referred his remarks through the chair and it is my understanding that he referred to you in the third person, which would indicate that it was through the chair. At this point I also ask opposition senators to refrain from interjecting.
—Thank you very much indeed, Madam Acting Deputy President. I was not satirising Senator Carr when I made that remark either. What Senator Ian Campbell was obliged to do was discharge a statutory obligation set out in quite elaborate detail by the terms of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. What he in particular was obliged to do was to make a determination under part 9 of that act as to whether the particular project that was before him for consideration, the Bald Hills wind farm project in southern Gippsland, on the coastline of Gippsland, should be approved. But he did not have carte blanche in making that determination. He was governed by certain statutory criteria.
In particular, he was governed by the criteria in section 18, which is one of the core provisions of the act and which contains the scheme for the protection of endangered species. It is common ground that the orange-bellied parrot is an endangered species. It is listed on the appropriate lists of endangered species. We are told—and nobody has called this into question—that there are only 50 breeding pairs of this particular animal left. Apparently, most of them are in southern Victoria. So nobody is arguing that this is not an endangered species.
Therefore, the protective obligations under section 18 of the act calling for a ministerial determination under part 9 of the act are invoked. Section 18(3) of the act, dealing with endangered species, says:
A person must not take an action that:
(a)      has or will have a significant impact on a listed threatened species included in the endangered category; or
(b)      is likely to have a significant impact on a listed threatened species included in the endangered category.
The act then provides for an elaborate process by which such a determination may be assessed. In particular, the minister is required to commission one of five different varieties of assessment. That is an obligation that lies on the minister or his delegate under section 87 of the act.
The minister, by his delegate, adopted one of the five alternative courses of action that were open to him under section 87 for the purpose of making an assessment. That was, under section 87(4), to decide to commission an accredited assessment process. Nobody doubts or suggests that the minister, by his delegate, was doing the wrong thing in doing that. What happened—because this is the way in which the act is administered—is that the accredited assessment process was commissioned by the Victorian government. That is the commonplace way in which this act is administered. State government environment departments are accredited authorities for the purpose of assessment processes under section 87(4) of the act. That was done.
On 19 August 2004—and hold that date in your mind, Madam Acting Deputy President, because something important turns on it in a moment—the Victorian Minister for Planning wrote to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, providing a copy of the assessment report for the Bald Hills wind farm. It was on the basis of that assessment report, itself a document generated within the Victorian government, that the department, through Mr Early, the senior officer of the department, provided the initial advice to the minister that it seemed that the Bald Hills wind farm project should be approved, subject to conditions, and made that recommendation.
Nevertheless, the minister, in consultation with the department, considered that the assessment report provided by the Victorian state government was insufficient. So, on 25 May 2005, on the advice of his department and in consultation with it, the minister commissioned another report, the report from Biosis Research Pty Ltd, to address a different or more particular issue which had not been addressed sufficiently in the assessment report generated by the Victorian government. That was to undertake a study to assess the cumulative impacts of bird strike from wind farms, including the Bald Hills wind farm, on priority Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act listed bird species, which included but was not limited to the orange-bellied parrot.
The minister, on the advice of his department and before making his decision, commissioned this further, more particular study. Why? You know, Madam Acting Deputy President, as a Victorian senator that there have been quite a number of these wind farms built along the shore of the Gippsland Peninsula. Whereas one wind farm in isolation might not pose a significant risk to migratory bird species whose routes of migration track through that area, if you build a multiplicity of wind farms along the migration path, depending on the heights at which the birds fly, trajectories and a range of other considerations that scientific experts know about but we do not, the greater the accumulation of wind farms in a given migratory bird area, the greater the risk to migratory bird species.
I think Senator Campbell was wise to heed the advice of his department to commission the further study by Biosis. The Biosis report was received, and this was its conclusion in relation to the orange-bellied parrot. I will read from page 47:
Given that the Orange-bellied Parrot is predicted to have an extremely high probability of extinction in its current situation, almost any negative impact on the species could be sufficient to tip the balance against its continued existence. In this context it may be argued that any avoidable deleterious effect—even the very minor predicted impacts of turbine collisions—should be prevented.
Rather than the one birdstrike in a thousand years that the Labor Party kept citing, if you read the relevant sections of the Biosis report, as I have done, you will see that under three alternative models the authors of that report predict a likelihood of about one birdstrike a year from wind turbines built in this locality. Under the three different models, there is one study that suggests fewer than one a year—about 0.87 a year; one that suggests about one a year; and one that suggests a greater frequency than one a year.
That is what we are talking about. We are talking about the likely incidence of one turbine collision producing the loss of an orange-bellied parrot per year; this being a species in which there are only 50 breeding pairs left in the world. I think most people would consider that the avoidable loss of one per cent of the population of this endangered species per year was something which, to apply the statutory words in section 18 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, would ‘have a significant impact on a species’.
Relying on the Biosis report, and also relying on all of the other matters, Senator Campbell made an adverse determination. In doing that, he was acting within his statutory obligations. I do not want to embarrass Senator Carr in the eyes of his more intelligent colleagues such as Senator Wong, but Senator Carr would have had us believe that one of the mistakes that Senator Campbell made was that he did not follow the precedents. But you, Senator Wong, and you, Senator Kirk, both of whose legal skills I have considerable respect for, do not need to be told that an administrative decision maker always has to address the question before him on the basis of its own particular facts, and not be governed by precedents emerging from other circumstances in which there are materially different facts. He may have regard for guidance to precedents, but the one thing that is guaranteed to ensure that the decision of an administrative decision maker will be overturned is if the decision maker addresses his mind to the wrong question by slavishly applying a precedent involving different material facts to the determination of the very question before him.
Senator Campbell did the very thing he was meant to do. He addressed himself to the particular case before him. He did not slavishly say, ‘Because we approved a different wind farm in a different part of the country, lying on land with different environmental characteristics in the past, we have to approve this one now.’ That is what he avoided doing, as he should have done. In making his determination to refuse the application under section 133(7), Senator Campbell was in fact fulfilling his statutory duty under section 136 of the act, which says, among other things, in subsection (2):
In considering those matters—
that is, applying the statutory criteria I read before—
the Minister must—
I interpolate to emphasise the word ‘must’; he does not have a discretion—
take into account:
(a) the principles of ecologically sustainable development; and
(b) the assessment report relating to the action; and
                  …         …         …
(e) any other information the Minister has on the relevant impacts of the action ...
In the published decision which he made on 5 April 2006, Senator Campbell does list the various matters to which he had regard in the discharge of his statutory obligation under section 136 of the act—to have regard to the assessment report, but also to have regard to the other information available to him, which included the Biosis report. Ask yourself the question, Madam Acting Deputy President: if a minister has a statutory obligation to make determinations for the protection of endangered species, which include refusing applications for controlled projects, to use the statutory expression, ‘which may have a significant impact on a species’, and if he is seized of scientific conclusions to the effect that I have read to you, is he entitled to arrive at the conclusion that the project should not be approved? Of course he is. He might have been entitled to arrive at a different conclusion; I do not address that matter. But was he doing the wrong thing? Was he acting irrationally? Was he acting extra-jurisdictionally? Was he acting unlawfully in arriving at that conclusion, being seized of that scientific advice? Of course he was not.
There is one codicil to this story and it is this. You might remember, Madam Acting Deputy President, that I asked you to keep in mind that date—19 August 2004, the date on which the Victorian government’s environmental assessment, which became the assessment report, was transmitted to the minister. That is put forward as the case in favour of approving the Bald Hills wind farm. You saw the pile of papers he had before him in question time; it was about two-foot thick. It was all the material that was sent to him by the Victorian government, but what was not sent to the minister by the Victorian government and in fact was not before him at the time he made that decision was a submission received by the Victorian government on 19 December 2003 from the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment. That was something to which the author of the assessment report had had regard but it was not provided to the minister. This is what it said about the orange-bellied parrot:
The Bald Hills wind farm proposal will increase the level of threat to the orange-bellied parrot, an IFG listed species. The department agrees that the orange-bellied parrot is unlikely to utilise the site; however, it is highly likely that the OBPs commuting between habitat patches in South Gippsland will fly across the site. Their commuting flights are often at heights encompassed by the rotor swept area.

",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,8,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-08-09,"—I rise today because I think that people across Australia must be asking themselves if the minister has really seriously taken into account his responsibilities under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to make sure that:
A person must not take an action that:
(a) has or will have a significant impact on a listed threatened species included in the endangered category; or
(b) is likely to have a significant impact on a listed threatened species included in the endangered category.
They would be asking themselves today: why is it that every single day threatened species, endangered species, across Australia are going to extinction and the government is not doing anything? I wonder if the government has asked itself why people are so sceptical about the minister’s decision in this case. It is because of the hypocrisy that is involved here.
If the minister was serious about his statutory obligations under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act he would rip up immediately the bilateral agreement he has with Tasmania. The EPBC Act accredits the regional forest agreement as taking into account, and fulfilling, all the responsibilities of the Commonwealth in terms of threatened species. As a result, as I stand here today there are chainsaws ripping down old-growth forests in Tasmania and sending any number of endangered species further towards extinction.
I have heard the minister say a couple of times that he is concerned about the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle. I have not seen him take any action to prevent the wedge-tailed eagle going to extinction, or the swift parrot for that matter. The minister will have an opportunity very shortly to show his real commitment to endangered species, and he will be able to stop the marina development put forward by Walker Corporation for Ralphs Bay. On the argument Senator Brandis has put forward today about the minister’s statutory obligations it will not be a problem. Under the EPBC Act the spotted handfish is critically endangered. It is listed under the Commonwealth act and it is in the vicinity of Ralphs Bay. I hope the minister will commission report after report in the same way he did in relation to this, and make sure that that development does not proceed because it will further endanger the spotted handfish.
The same goes for the pulp mill. We have very clear evidence that logging across Tasmania is sending these species to extinction. In fact, on 6 July Forestry Tasmania announced late in the day that an endangered wedge-tailed eagle’s nest had been cut down and destroyed by the logging industry. It shows that, regardless of whether the industry had best intentions or not, it is still destroying the breeding habitat of endangered species. At the moment in the Federal Court we have the case of Brown versus Forestry Tasmania, which is challenging the logging industry’s exemption from the federal threatened species legislation under bilateral arrangements with Tasmania. My colleague Senator Brown, when the EPBC Bill came into the parliament in 1999, stood up here and said:
In future, the great environmental issues of the day in Australia will be determined by what are called bilateral agreements. These are bilateral sell-outs of the environment, and I will tell you why. They involve the federal government entering into an agreement about such things as forests with the state and territory governments involved. It is a process of the lowest common denominator dictating national policy.
That is precisely what has happened. Threatened species legislation in Tasmania does not exist because it comes under the auspices of the regional forest agreement, which is delivered on the ground by forest practices which allow for and see the destruction, as it has turned out, of an active breeding nest of the wedge-tailed eagle. In fact what has become apparent is that the timber industry is reducing the habitat of the eagles to the point where Forestry Tasmania is trying to substantiate its claim that there are 457 breeding pairs of eagles left in Tasmania. But the expert, Mr Mooney, estimates that, whilst there may be a total number of 457 pairs, breeding is severely compromised by habitat loss and disturbance. The expert estimates that there are only 250 active territories. That is the situation at the moment.
What is Senator Campbell, if he is really concerned about endangered species, doing about the fact that every single day in Tasmania that is the case? The wedge-tailed eagle is getting closer and closer to extinction. He has been standing up here today telling us that every month another wedge-tailed eagle is going into the turbines in north-western Tasmania. When that was drawn to the attention of his colleague Senator Hill, the former minister for the environment, Senator Hill went ahead and approved that wind farm regardless of what people said about the impact on migratory species and the wedge-tailed eagle. That was clear in the evidence given at the time.
Why people are so frustrated about this example is that it is a clear use of the EPBC, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, for cynical political purposes. There is no consistent application of the act, and the bilaterals with the states make it a joke anyway. In a sense I am grateful to Senator Campbell for exposing to the whole Australian community what a joke, how fundamentally flawed, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is. It is irretrievable; you cannot amend it to fix it up. We need new legislation in this country that genuinely gives protection to rare and endangered species. All the claims made about this legislation for the last five or six years have come to absolutely nothing. There have been several assessments of it. One such assessment was done by Andrew Macintosh of the Australia Institute. He pointed out that, of the 1,913 development proposals referred to the minister from 2000 to 2006, only 462 were declared to be controlled actions. In fact, the overwhelming majority of them were declared to be exempt.
The Australian community is being told by Senator Brandis and Senator Campbell that they take endangered species so seriously that they apply the principles of ecologically sustainable development, one of which is the precautionary principle. Where do I see that being applied in relation to logging in Tasmania? I do not. Where do I see it being applied in relation to the Walker Corporation proposal at Ralphs Bay? I do not. Where have I seen it being applied to a whole range of other developments that have come before this assessment authority? I have not seen it being applied. It is only being applied here because of a political situation in Victoria.
What I thought was interesting was hearing Senator Brandis quote from the conclusion of the Biosis Research report. Let me add the final sentence which Senator Brandis did not read out. Let me read the whole conclusion. They said:
Given that the Orange-bellied Parrot is predicted to have an extremely high probability of extinction in its current situation, almost any negative impact on the species could be sufficient to tip the balance against its continued existence. In this context it may be argued that any avoidable deleterious effect—even the very minor predicted impacts of turbine collisions—should be prevented.
That is where Senator Campbell and Senator Brandis stopped. The final sentence says:
Our analyses suggest that such action will have extremely limited beneficial value to conservation of the parrot without addressing very much greater adverse effects that are currently operating against it.
So I put to the minister, to Senator Brandis and to anyone else from the government who is prepared to stand up and defend Senator Campbell: what action is the government now going to take to address the very much greater adverse effects that are currently operating against the orange-bellied parrot? What are they going to do to look at this issue? Or are we just going to see this as a sufficient reason to somehow suggest that the Commonwealth is taking the plight of this bird seriously?
The government knows full well that it can quote this report. It is not choosing to quote other reports that it got, such as the Latitude 42 Environmental Consultants report which found that the impact of the wind power project was likely to be minimal on local bird populations and that further species-specific studies were unwarranted. It looked at all sorts of things.
The department looked at it as well. The department’s point is that to veto the wind farm on the basis of the low likely impact on the orange-bellied parrot would be inconsistent with the approach taken to approve wind farms elsewhere. The department knows that Senator Hill and Senator Campbell, the minister, never ever took the same attitude to other wind farms. The department was rightly highlighting the fact that if you go down this path you will open up every other wind farm that you have approved to the same kind of scrutiny and questions will be asked about whether the minister took the same action with them that he has in this case—that is, to commission report after report. If those reports said that one per cent was going to be affected, why didn’t they stop those wind farms if they are going to stop this one? In fact, that is where this is likely to go. That is why the department is saying, ‘You’d better be consistent about what you’re doing here.’
As I pointed out in this chamber yesterday, when the wind farm at Woolnorth in north-western Tasmania was first approved, Senator Hill, as minister for the environment, refused to assess it on the basis of the cumulative impact of the wind farms then proposed for north-west Tasmania, South Australia and Victoria. He said he did not have and would not take responsibility for cumulative impact and he was looking at each one as a specific and separate case, which I pointed out at the time was completely ridiculous. When you have an endangered species which has a clearly defined migratory path, you cannot look at development applications as one-off applications; you do have to look at the cumulative impacts. Senator Hill, the minister for the environment of the day, said no.
Senator Campbell has now opened up a real can of worms. He has brought into question the appropriateness of previous decisions that ministers have made. He has demonstrated that he has been prepared to use the EPBC Act for political purposes. He has been prepared to commission extra reports on some bases but not on others.
Down at Recherche Bay, where we had the Southport Lagoon conservation area, there is a critically endangered plant there, the swamp eyebright. It exists in an area of less than 100 square metres. The minister was prepared to let a road go straight through that area, knowing full well that a road would lead to the extinction of that plant because people travelling on that road leave the road. It is a complete mess from four-wheel drives, as any Tasmanian senator would be aware. Senator Campbell knew full well about the swamp eyebright. Why didn’t he stop that road going through the conservation area? That would have protected Recherche Bay because without road access they could not log it. But did he take any notice of that? No, he fell back quickly on his bilateral agreement with Tasmania saying, ‘Under the regional forest agreement I don’t have to assess a logging road,’ even though the swamp eyebright is critically endangered. It is the one small place on the whole planet where it exists and it is going to extinction. What did he do about it? He did zero, zilch, nothing.
People are so critical and cynical about him because he has been so selective in what he does about endangered and threatened species. But what he has now done—and I am grateful for this—is open himself up in regards to every single threatened and endangered species across Australia. Senator Brandis so admirably read out the minister’s responsibilities as follows:
A person must not take any action that:
(a) has or will have a significant impact on a listed threatened species included in the endangered category;
On any endangered species in the country, if anyone takes any action any resident can come to this minister and say, ‘Why have you got a bilateral agreement with that state government which exempts you from taking this statutory responsibility under the act?’ That is what is flawed. Until he rips up those bilaterals that allow the logging industry in Tasmania to send these species to extinction, he has no credibility whatsoever. I am looking forward to the residents at Ralphs Bay asking him to take into account the critically endangered spotted handfish and to apply the same level of concern he has with the orange-bellied parrot at the Bald Hills wind farm to that particular development application.
Like the seat in question in Victoria—that is, Mr Broadbent’s seat—I am looking forward to the minister doing the same in Bass, because it is a very marginal seat in next years federal election. We have the proposed pulp mill there. Even though the minister is happy to have the bilateral that excludes assessing the logging and the impact it is going to have on threatened species, in the pulp mill’s own assessment report it identifies the endangered wedge-tailed eagle and swift parrot as being on the site. The Commonwealth has a role in assessing this project. It has exempted all the forestry activities associated with the project but they have to assess the project at its own site.
I am looking forward to the people of Bass contacting this minister and saying, ‘These are endangered species under the act. They exist on the site. You stopped this wind farm in Victoria because it might have an adverse impact of one mortality per year from all sites. What we know is that 12 species listed as threatened under the Commonwealth EPBC Act have been recorded or have the potential to occur within or adjacent to the proposed development areas.’ Michael Ferguson holds Bass by what, one or 1.5 per cent? It is something like that. So here we are in Bass and it is a marginal seat, and yet we are going to that find this passion from both the Liberal and Labor parties in this place evaporate when it comes to the plight of the endangered wedge-tailed eagle, the white-bellied sea eagle and also in relation to the swift parrot.
If you are so concerned, all of you, about the cynical way in which this minister has used the act, I look forward to seeing the same enthusiasm about rejecting the Gunns pulp mill proposal in Northern Tasmania because of the impact it will have on endangered species in Tasmania at the site. I look forward to the tearing up of the bilateral, because what has been said in this place today from both sides says to me that both Liberal and Labor recognise that that bilateral agreement under the regional forest agreement is sending species to extinction in Tasmania.
The minister himself has said that they are going to extinction. He has said that they are highly endangered. Let members and senators take the action they need to take. This minister has sent shockwaves through the whole development community in Australia because what he has done is said that there is no certainty at all under EPBC legislation. He has opened up to communities, as it should have been all along, the right to take this minister and this government to task about development applications that do threaten endangered species across this country.
Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, has let down all Australians in relation to endangered species but he has, to his credit, totally exposed this legislation as the joke that it is. Anyone who looks at the trends on endangered species and loss of habitat around the country would have to say that there is not one single environmental indicator that has improved since this legislation came into being some seven years ago.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,8,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-08-09,"—The problem in this instance is not with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. In fact it is a very powerful piece of legislation and it fixes a long-term problem that there was in this country: that the federal laws to do with the impacts of development on sites of national significance or on species that were threatened and endangered were very weak. The problem with this legislation is that there is enormous ministerial discretion, and that is what you would expect in decisions that are as far reaching as matters to do with national significance are.
But this minister has used the act for political purposes, and that is why we are here censuring him today. He has used it cynically and in a way which has nothing to do with orange-bellied parrots, wedge-tailed eagles or any other animals which deserve protection. He has used it in a way that he has not in the past on worthy cases against development. In fact, as I said yesterday, 2,745 projects have been referred to the environment protection and biodiversity conservation laws and only four applications have not been approved. That is less than 0.15 per cent of those that have been brought to the minister. A significant number of those 2,745 projects involved threatened species, but the minister has been reluctant to knock back those projects. Instead, for the most part, he and ministers before him have put conditions on the projects to minimise the impact on threatened species.
What are the real threats to the orange-bellied parrot? I can remember debates about this in Victoria. Madam Acting Deputy President Troeth, you may also remember when the state government wanted to put a chemical storage facility just past Corio Bay, which was a habitat. The foreshore was a place that orange-bellied parrots are seen on a regular basis, and the state government was considering putting the Coode Island chemical storage plant down there. There was quite a lot of community backlash and a great deal of interest in this issue. That did not go ahead because of community concern about it and because it would have been a very serious threat to the orange-bellied parrot.
But you cannot say the same thing about the wind farm at Bald Hills. Enough has been said here already today about the report which was done for the minister which he used selectively, about the advice which was given to him by his department which he totally ignored, about the process that had been gone through by the state government and so on. We know that the threat to the orange-bellied parrot was very minimal indeed. The real threats are fragmentation and degradation of over-winter habitat by grazing, agriculture or urban development; competition with other seed-eating birds; foxes and feral cats; disease; and disorientation during migration from brightly lit fishing boats. These are the real threats, but is there anything in Minister Campbell’s actions which would ameliorate any of those threats? No. The other big problem for threatened birds is climate change, and it is ironic that here we have a project which might do something about climate change. In fact, it would reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are produced in Victoria by 435,000 tonnes a year. This project, which might in some way assist to limit the threats on the orange-bellied parrot, is being used by the minister for political purposes. Through this decision, he is effectively sacrificing the orange-bellied parrot rather than protecting it.
Rather than knocking back this project, what might the minister have done? He could have required that the wind farm minimise the impact on the habitat. The wonderful thing about wind farms is that they have very little impact indeed. In fact, you see photographs of cows grazing up to the base of the turbines. Given their size and their importance, they probably have the least impact on the environment of any development I can imagine. Nonetheless, the minister could have required there to be a minimisation of habitat disturbance. The minister could have said to the wind farm proponents that a percentage of the revenue from the wind farm was to be used on other sites to restore habitat or to create new habitat for the orange-bellied parrot. Mind you, they would have to be quite a way away from the Bald Hills wind farm because, as I understand it, the orange-bellied parrot does not move too far inland. I think two kilometres is about the maximum range from the shore and the Bald Hills site is a little further inland than that. Money could have been used to create more winter-feeding habitats and secure current habitats, but there is very little by way of understanding of what those actual threats are and where we could improve the long-term chances of survival of the orange-bellied parrot. The minister has effectively been very arbitrary in this whole approach. It is all about seats and appeasing the handful of people, as I understand it in this instance, who opposed the wind farm and who will always oppose wind farms. For some reason, these people see them as a blight on the landscape. I do not; I find them to be amazing pieces of technology which seem to me to be most elegant, and in that landscape I am sure I could point to many other constructions which are more offensive than a wind turbine.
One of the most problematic aspects of this decision is the damage that it has done to confidence in the wind industry. It has set the wind industry back I do not know how many years, but it would have to be a substantial period of time. I think wind farm developers are still reeling with the shock of this decision, knowing that future approvals might also be dealt with in this arbitrary political way and that there will be no certainty about what might be able to proceed and what might not. It costs a great deal of money to find a site and to get to the point where you can make an application for approval, and this would most definitely be a very strong deterrent on such developments into the future. A number of people from the wind industry have been quoted in the media over the last few months of this debate talking about the process. Mr Bracks, for instance, said:
[The minister] took so long to do it that he had to find the most flimsy of pretexts. This will not stand up to scrutiny.
The chief executive of the wind farm developer Wind Power said the company had spent millions of dollars on the project and was seeking advice about any potential legal action. As we know, that legal action was commenced. This obviously panicked the minister and forced him to start to think a bit more about this and negotiate with the wind farmer and the wind farm developer. He has offered them another chance to make an application, which is very generous indeed. I understand that that application is no different from the one that went before. So this is just a face-saving device on the part of the minister.
We are talking about this issue because his decision making has been arbitrary, capricious and political. We do not need that kind of decision making from our ministers; we expect better of them than that. Despite the fact that the Democrats very strongly support the EPBC Act—we are also very keen to see the minister use it more effectively than he has in the past and we would like to see a few more projects knocked back that threaten species in many ways—I cannot in any way endorse what the minister has done. I think it is unacceptable. If it was a minister in any other portfolio we would do likewise, but the particular arguments in this case make it clear to me that he has misused his ministerial powers. It is appropriate for the Senate to remind him of that and to have this debate.
It is very disappointing. We would like to have an environment minister who took his role seriously in protecting endangered species. This minister has not done that. When he comes to this chamber and says, ‘This is what I’m going to do for the orange-bellied parrot; this is how we will make sure that it doesn’t become extinct,’ then we will be the first to applaud him for that. But stopping a wind farm where no orange-bellied parrots ever go is not a way of doing that. If he is serious about promoting himself as a minister who looks after the environment then we would be happy to congratulate him for doing that, but it is certainly not possible to do that in this case.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,8,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2006-08-09,"—What a fine speech by the Leader of the Democrats here today. I am a little cynical about censure motions, and I have expressed that cynicism before. I have seen really good censure motions in this chamber, with unimpeachable evidence, and then the political vote comes in and the motion goes down. On other occasions I have seen very shaky cases mounted in this chamber and the censure motion has carried. We have always said that it is not really the end result of the censure motion but the process that counts. Anyone listening to Senator Campbell’s defence of his actions today, both at question time and in this censure motion debate, has cause to worry. How could someone become a minister in cabinet yet perform in this chamber so incompetently and so abysmally? It is really scary. It frightens me. I like to see politicians be professional. It is not true that we always like to see them humiliated. But humiliated is what we have seen today.
When did all this begin? I can tell you precisely when this issue began. It began the day the Australian Electoral Commission handed down the new and final boundaries of McMillan that turned it from a 53 per cent Labor seat to a 52 per cent Liberal seat. That is the genesis of this decision: when it became a marginal Liberal seat. If you want to see how political this issue is, go back to the grubby correspondence that Senator Campbell had distributed in the electorate of McMillan back in October last year. This is on a letterhead; this has got the coat of arms on it. Under that it says, ‘Senator the Hon. Ian Campbell, Minister for the Environment and Heritage’. It is then signed at the bottom, ‘Senator Ian Campbell, Minister for the Environment and Heritage’. We know this was not paid for by the Commonwealth, because if it had been he would be in breach of proper accounting and legal processes. This was paid for by the Liberal Party. This is a political letter, and as grubby a political letter as I have ever read. Let me just quote one part of it:
If Christian Zahra really cared about his community, about you, he would have protested the issue with his Victorian Labor mates. If he was serious about protecting the visual amenity of the region that elected him, he would have moved an amendment to the renewable energy legislation when it came before the parliament in 2002. If he really wanted to stop inappropriate wind developments he would be fighting Mark Latham on this issue instead of jockeying for a position on the front bench.
It was all about politics. It was never about the national interest and never about the right thing to do. It was all about politics—not surprising when you consider Senator Campbell’s background in Western Australian politics. He was in the Crichton-Browne machine and then denied them and set up his own operation in Western Australia.
Look at the actual decision making: Senator Campbell went through 450 days on this particular project. Others are decided in half a minute and flicked off. But what he did, very clearly, was not only to ignore his departmental advice, which is his right; but I bet he never confounded that advice. He simply argued for more and more reports until finally a sliver of hope arrived and he ticked it off to meet his political requirement.
I pointed out in question time today the analogy of the Wonthaggi decision about a wind farm 20 minutes drive away. I do drive pretty fast, but I think for anyone it is 20 minutes from Bald Hills. So it is not far away. In that decision that Dr David Kemp had to make, there were orange-bellied parrots sighted near the Wonthaggi site. But, when that minister granted approval to go ahead, no conditions whatsoever were put on. Compare that with Bald Hills, where they have never sighted an orange-bellied parrot and one will probably never go near it. So why the difference in decision making? Is it true that Dr Kemp was an incompetent environment minister not attuned to protecting endangered species? I have not always been a fan of Dr Kemp, but I tell you what: as he is the smarter brother of the two, I would always rate him well and truly ahead of the political Senator Ian Campbell. You could not get a clearer contrast in decision making than what occurred then.
This really begs the question: who in this country is really serious about alternative power sources? Coming from Victoria, I can tell you that the Victorian government has been very serious about them. The Victorian government is leading the way in Australia in terms of solar development. Some new and exciting projects are under way in Victoria that are cutting edge world wide. The Labor Party have led the way—and we do not apologise for it—in endorsing wind power. Senator Ian Campbell comes into this chamber and says, ‘If you vote Labor, you will get five wind farms for every two the Liberals will approve.’ That is right, and we are proud of it. We are proud of the fact that we will support alternative power. We are also at the cutting edge of changing the technology from the use of brown coal in Victoria. By far the heaviest polluter Australia wide is brown coal electricity production. We are at the cutting edge of technology that could cut the output of pollutants by up to 40 per cent in that particular area. The Victorian government has been serious about this.
This also raises the economic development issue. How often have we heard Senator Minchin come into this chamber and say, ‘Labor is anti-development. Labor does not support economic growth’? I will tell you what: we do not sell out a $220 million project just for a few political reasons—to prop up someone in a marginal seat because a minor sector of that seat may change their vote on it. That is real weak politics.
I heard Senator Ian Campbell say today, ‘Why did the company approach me to remit the decision, to think about it again? Surely that shows that the company thinks I am a fair person.’ Can’t you just imagine going in to see Senator Campbell and saying, ‘We want to withdraw from the court case,’ and the first thing that Senator Campbell says is: ‘We’ll pay your expenses’! What a ridiculous proposition to put to this chamber.
I was rather amazed at the editorial in the Australian on Monday. The Australian is hardly a red rag; it is not noted for its Labor leanings and it is not a closet socialist publication. I do not have time to read the entire editorial, but let me read the last paragraph. It says:
It adds up to a confused message from the federal Government when it comes to wind power and a shambolic regulatory environment that can only discourage investment in renewable energy. As a first measure towards restoring confidence in the federal Government’s policy on renewable energy technology, John Howard should sack Senator Campbell as Environment Minister.
Hear, hear! It continues:
In his mishandling of the Bald Hills affair, Senator Ian Campbell has shown not only that he is inept when it comes to decision making but that he is willing to allow political considerations to influence his ministerial judgment. After dealing with Senator Campbell, Mr Howard must appoint in his place a minister who is committed to upholding a transparent process for assessing the environmental impact of development projects—whatever their nature—with the best interests of all Australians in mind.
Come on down, Senator Colbeck! Time for you to move up! Time for you to become a minister! At least we would know that the national interest would be protected, not just the petty political interests of the Liberal Party.
If you want to have a look at this political theme today, I ask you: did Senator Ian Campbell try to address any of the serious questions put to him? No, he did not. He spent most of question time and most of his defence on the censure motion talking about Christian Zahra—a Labor member who has lost his seat. It is as though Senator Campbell is excused from any misbehaviour whatsoever if that Labor member had a particular view. There is a massive difference between the behaviour of backbenchers who are trying to protect their own political interests and the national interest. One of the first things you learn in politics is: always put the national interest first—not out of principle, although that would be good, but out of self-interest—because putting the national interest first is what protects a ministerial career.
A lot of us on this side of the chamber wondered why Senator Ian Campbell was a parliamentary secretary for six years. We wondered why so many others came off the back bench—like Senator Ellison and others who are more advanced in their political careers—ahead of Senator Campbell. Now we know. We now know that the Prime Minister was highly suspicious as to how well Senator Ian Campbell would perform as a minister. His insight was, for once, very accurate. We in this chamber have all known that Senator Ian Campbell is a person who is subject to temper tantrums, to immature political behaviour and to the absolute bottom end of puerile approaches to politics. We all hoped that he would make the step up and that, having been given a ministry, he would actually mature and leave the political never-never land that he was in and that he would actually become a proper political and ministerial performer in this chamber. He has failed the test and he has failed it absolutely.
You have got to ask yourself: where is the pastoral care in the Liberal Party that allows this behaviour to occur? Where is the guidance and leadership that should be guiding this minister down a proper path? It does not appear to exist. Apparently, you are just thrown into the deep end and you either swim or drown. This is not really just Senator Ian Campbell’s responsibility; it is the responsibility of Senator Minchin and the Prime Minister to give him some guidance in order for him to perform properly.
What this issue is all about is a minister behaving like a third-rate ward heeler, totally ignoring advice from his own department, manufacturing advice and misinterpreting it for political purposes—and we have to put a stop to it. But I will make one last prediction: I will bet anyone in this chamber that Senator Ian Campbell reverses his decision in the next few weeks. It does not take much courage to say, ‘You heard it here first’. He will change this decision because, if he does not change this decision, he will change portfolio in very quick order. I have this advice for the Prime Minister: make him change the decision and then remove him from the portfolio. I am not sure which one he is capable of handling, but it is certainly not the environment. We need an environment minister who is committed to the national interest, who will be fair and reasonable and who will put the best interests of Australia and its biological diversity well ahead of his own political interests.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,8,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2006-08-09,"—I rise today to speak to a censure motion that effectively has asked that this chamber censure the Minister for the Environment and Heritage for his actions in blocking the Bald Hills wind farm on the basis of its first application. I would like to congratulate Senator Brandis because he has led not only this chamber but also the Australian people very carefully through a step-by-step process, which was very easy to understand—no conspiracy—about how this minister has stuck very closely to the process and has followed the requirements under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to the letter.
In fact, if the minister has failed in any way, he probably failed to automatically place a project—the value of which we just heard from Senator Ray—worth $220 million ahead of environmental considerations. Yes, he probably failed to do that, but his job is to ensure that he finds the balance—not just some vague balance you can pull out of the air—that is prescribed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. What we heard from Senator Brandis in this chamber today is that the minister absolutely held to the letter of the law of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity and Conservation Act.
We have had people from the other side stand up and say, ‘We can quote people like Mr Early.’ What was he relying upon? That is right: he was relying upon the Victorian government’s material, which we have now exposed today to be, whilst voluminous, missing a couple of important points. I note Senator Ray’s criticism of the previous environment minister, Dr David Kemp. Perhaps the mistake that former minister David Kemp made was that he also relied on the Victorian government. In hindsight, perhaps he should not have relied on that information to make the decision on Wonthaggi—only 20 minutes away from Bald Hills. I am quite sure that, if that minister were here today and heard about the disingenuous way that the Victorian government provided that information, he would think that he should have been more cautious about what weight he put on the Victorian information.
The Minister for the Environment and Heritage thought that there were obviously some bits missing in the report, so he said, ‘This is in relation to quite a specific context, but there is another context under which I need to be provided advice.’ It is quite clear under section 133, part VII, of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act that it is the minister’s responsibility to seek further information. That is what he did. He said, ‘We will commission something that specifically prescribes what the impact of these wind turbines will be on four particular species’—one of which was the orange-breasted parrot. He sought the very best information—the very latest, most scientific information—which was obviously far more comprehensive and specific than the information provided by the Victorian government. After he considered that very specific information—the very best available—he made a decision based on good science. I do not understand why those on the other side are somehow criticising our minister for using the very best, very latest information that was based on the best science.
—Rubbish!
—It is not rubbish, Senator Forshaw. It might be absolutely beyond your ken that a minister would put aside financial and development pressure and considerations and put aside making arbitrary decisions and actually make a decision based on science. That might not be the way you do business, but it is the way we do business on this side. That is why we consistently have the support of the Australian people on these matters.
This minister and this government have a long history of following the process and making sure we get it right. Senator Forshaw, I know you are interested in this matter. From your wide reading on these matters, you will no doubt understand that it is a very delicate balance that one has to find between the pressures of development and the need to provide good environmental protection. The government, under successive ministers, including Minister Campbell—have very carefully sought information to get this balance right.
For your benefit, Senator Forshaw, the way the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act works is that we follow a series of steps. I will mention an example which is perhaps a little out of your jurisdiction—the dugong recovery plans. This was a process that was laid down very prescriptively. Under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, an application needed to be made to continue a number of fisheries that interacted with the dugong. A specific amount of time was given. It was said, ‘Under the current circumstances, that sort of fishing will not be allowed to continue for a certain time until a specific recovery plan is implemented.’ That is how the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act works—just for your benefit, Senator Forshaw. Of course, that is quite consistent with the decision that the minister has made today.
—Why didn’t he bring in any conditions?
—At the moment, all he has to do is simply refuse it. We did not make up the conditions for the Queensland barramundi industry, Senator McLucas. You should be aware of that. They decided to make another application. That is exactly what happened. You have to understand the process. I know it is difficult, but stick with us.
Senator McLucas, I know that another thing that you are very keen on in Queensland is the turtle recovery plan. Exactly the same process was used for that. The very best and most recent scientific information was used. Several of those steps took place. This is not something that is completely new. What we are talking about here today is exactly the same process that has been used consistently by this government, this minister and ministers before him.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—While people on the other side may make turtle and dugong jokes, I say that this is a very important issue, because these are iconic species that we are talking about. That is why we care about this. If these were house sparrows, we would not be bothered. That is why the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is there: to directly protect some of our iconic species. Another recovery plan that I would point you towards is the albatross recovery plan, which very clearly laid out the specific pieces of information required. There were no less than three applications from the seafood industry, because this government said, ‘You will not be able to continue to catch tuna unless you come up with an amelioration plan.’
What is happening now is that in exactly the same circumstances the proponents of the Bald Hills wind farm are being asked to come up with a mitigation plan. I understand that that mitigation plan is coming in the near future. Senator Ray made a huge prediction that we will change our mind on this. This is a process that identifies changes in behaviour. If you change your behaviour and mitigate the damage towards the orange-bellied parrot then the application will get the go-ahead. That is a process that has been consistently applied by this government over time. I will add here that I admire very much Senator Brandis’s use of the English language. He has coined a new phrase: ‘the Monty Pythonesque burlesque from the other side’.
There are a lot of threats to this bird that have not been discussed in this place. You would think that the only threat to this bird was from the wind farm. People keep saying, ‘One in 1,000 years.’ Let me tell those on the other side that they can giggle and they can laugh but to be associated with such a disingenuous comment should bring shame on them. One in 1,000 years is, according to the survey, absolute rubbish. There has not been any evidence to show that that is the case. Senator Carr got up and said, ‘One parrot in 1,000 years.’ That is absolute rubbish.
Senator Brandis talked about some modelling that was done in the Biosis report. This is a very recent report. The reason that you have to apply the precautionary principle is that reports like these normally provide a whole range of circumstances. In this report, the range was from 0.87 of a parrot—which is probably not really a parrot but a parrot with a bit missing—in one set of circumstances, to about one parrot in the next set of circumstances, to 1.39 of a parrot.
Honourable senators—Is that an Alan Jones parrot?
—Negative. If you look at the science, the interesting part of this is that the variability is in the capacity for a parrot to avoid the strike. It is called ‘avoidance’. In this report, it was worked out that there will be 98 per cent avoidance. There are other behaviours of this parrot, however, that may alter that. The reason that it is so hard to know how many there are is that it may migrate at night. This report clearly indicates that that may well be a scenario and that any impacts at all on this parrot are going to be extremely deleterious to its continued survival.
If you look at the whole range of scientific impacts discussed in this report and apply the precautionary principle, if it migrates at night there will not be 98 per cent avoidance. I have not had the opportunity this afternoon to do the numbers on that, but one would think that the number of parrots—or half parrots—endangered would increase substantively. This continued use of the phrase ‘one in 1,000 years’ is disingenuous. I will quote the study:
Given that the Orange-bellied Parrot is predicted to have an extremely high probability of extinction in its current situation, almost any negative impact on the species could be sufficient to tip the balance against its continued existence. In this context it may be argued that any avoidable deleterious effect—even the very minor predicted impacts of turbine collisions—should be prevented.
Senator Carr went on to tell me that parrots are very hard to find. We got plenty of parrot jokes from Senator Carr. He said that they are particularly hard to find. He said that we have only seen one 40 kilometres from Bald Hills. It is not the information that he provides but the information that he leaves out that is important. I would have thought that he would have read the report. The reason they are so difficult to observe is very specifically laid out in the report. Not only are there very few birds in the extended population but there are only a very small number of ornithologists able to identify the bird. Further, the terrain along much of the west coast of Tasmania—its habitat—is very difficult, and access to that terrain is also very difficult. Also, often when it is seen in the open it is because it is flying across Bass Strait, and unless you happen to have the right sort of ornithologist on the boat at that moment it is obviously going to be pretty difficult to observe. Further, the size of its habitat along the coastline of Tasmania is extremely large. Again, I point out the fairly disingenuous arguments being made by the other side. They are trying to provide real scientific evidence and failing. It is absolute gammon; it has absolutely no scientific substance.
We make a lot of fun of the orange-bellied parrot but the Victorian government’s own website states that several proposals over recent years have been stopped due to the risk to the orange-bellied parrot. In fact, the Victorian government ranks the orange-bellied parrot among the rarest and most endangered of world wildlife, alongside the giant panda and the Siberian tiger. The precarious position of the orange-bellied parrot was recently recognised by the World Conservation Union, which has included the bird on its red list of critically endangered species. It is extremely endangered.
—That’s why you’ve got to have a management plan.
—Indeed, and thank you for the interjection. We are now still waiting for a management plan to arrive. When the minister considers it, it is a possibility—as Senator Ray so wonderfully predicted—that it may be approved, as is the case with every one of these processes. If it is not, we would encourage people to look at some other way of ameliorating the situation and to make another application. As I said, it took several applications for the albatross, the turtle and the dugong, and the amelioration processes regarding the orange-bellied parrot and the turbines may well involve a series of steps.
I wonder exactly what we are doing here. What is the notion behind having this censure motion? This is the big issue of the day for the Labor Party. I wondered what the big issue for the Labor Party would be today. It has been the orange-bellied parrot and wind farms for the first two days we have been back after the recess. As I mentioned yesterday, I think there is probably a little bit more to this. The key should have been when Senator Carr—the love child of the Victorian government—stood up. This is just a cover-up of the complete hypocrisy of the Victorian government and its complete failure to deliver any environmental outcomes.
Wind energy, which we are talking about with the Bald Hills project, is actually being developed simply because this government, the Australian government, has provided the mandatory renewable energy targets program. That is why it is being developed in the first place. As was mentioned earlier, the Bald Hills wind farm would actually have only mitigated about 175,000 tonnes of carbon every year. Talking about the benefits of wind farms, Senator Carr stood in this place and thumped his chest and said, ‘What a great job the Labor government is doing in Victoria.’ That is what this is about, isn’t it? It is about talking up the wind farms. Only a cynic like me would think about the Victorian government’s very recent decision to extend the life of the Hazelwood coal fired power station, which is going to see another 445 million tonnes of carbon going into the atmosphere. That has nothing to do with this debate at all—nothing at all! If you want to talk about a conspiracy, I think this is just trying to divert the public’s attention from the complete inadequacy of Victoria’s Labor government to provide a single environmental outcome in this matter.
The renewable energy target will put another 400 turbines into the Gippsland area and yet the net benefit will be only 27 million tonnes of greenhouse gases. Today’s sham of a censure motion is an absolutely pathetic attempt by Senator Carr to assist the Victorian government in diverting the public attention away from its abysmal record on both climate control and environmental protection. Instead of censuring the minister, we should congratulate him for holding to the process, for making sure that he was not influenced by development and for ensuring that we continue to deliver consistent outcomes and continue to protect our environment.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,8,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-08-09,"—I want to speak to a few of the issues that are perhaps being lost in the flames being thrown backwards and forwards in this debate. We have before us a censure motion against the Minister for the Environment and Heritage with regard to a decision he made about a wind farm in Victoria. I have of course been quite critical of Minister Ian Campbell a number of times publicly, as he and anyone else who bothered to listen would know. I think he has acted in various ways across his portfolio somewhat erratically, inconsistently and in a contradictory fashion. But that in itself is not grounds for censure.
There are a few mixed messages here that I want to take the opportunity to correct, particularly with regard to the nature of the EPBC Act. That act was actually opposed by the Labor Party and the Greens, and indeed we heard Senator Milne saying that the Greens’ view is that the EPBC Act should be repealed. Of course, the Greens opposed it in the first place. The simple fact is that if they had been successful in that position—and the Democrats had followed their line and not supported the heavily amended EPBC Act—then we would not be having this debate, because the federal minister would not have the power to do anything with regard to endangered species. So I think it is completely the wrong tack to attack the EPBC Act. Nobody, least of all the Democrats, has ever suggested it is perfect, but it certainly provides a mechanism for review of projects and proposals to see whether or not they impact on key national matters of environmental significance, including endangered species.
Another key part of that act, which did not exist previously, is the scope for third party rights, for other people to have standing. Again, we would not be having this debate if it were not for the strengthened federal environment laws, because it would not have been possible to take court action against the minister’s original decision. Court action is not ideal—it is very expensive—but the fact that people have the right to challenge a decision by the minister in this area is very important and it is a key protection that the Democrats put in.
Using this example to attack the EPBC Act is, frankly, misguided—unless it is just a deliberate attempt to run a political agenda. But it is a bit strange that we have the Greens saying the EPBC Act should be repealed. According to what Senator Milne said yesterday, it always depends entirely on the whim of the minister whether he is going to apply the act appropriately or otherwise. Well, this case proves that that is wrong, because there was the opportunity for court action to be taken to generate a situation where the minister agreed to review his decision, and his decision was set aside by mutual agreement through the court. It is particularly strange because, at this very moment, as Senator Milne herself knows and indeed alluded to, her Tasmanian colleague Senator Bob Brown is running an extremely comprehensive court case in Tasmania using the EPBC Act to try and protect some endangered species. It baffles me how this act can be completely hopeless, terrible, useless, appalling and should be repealed, and yet it is being used to attempt to protect endangered species.
I support Senator Brown’s court action, as does the Wilderness Society. They are on the record as saying that it is an important test case, that if it succeeds it will have very positive effects for the future of biodiversity and native forests throughout Australia. I do not know if it will succeed. It is attacking a particular component of the act. All I will say is that it is certainly not a sure thing but I hope it does succeed. If it does then we will have one Green Tasmanian senator using this act to make, according to their own words and those of the Wilderness Society, a major advance in protecting biodiversity and threatened species in forests around Australia, and we will have the other Tasmanian Green saying that the act should be abolished.
I think people need to move forward from their politically driven and politically motivated opposition to the EPBC Act from 1999. I will again use Senator Milne’s own statistics, which came from the Australia Institute report. I know that report, and I know the author quite well and broadly agree with his conclusions. The government has not been using the EPBC Act enough and it has not been using it strongly enough. Nonetheless, there were 1,913 proposals, according to the figures Senator Milne gave, and 462 of them were controlled actions. That is over 450 more actions and proposals than were previously overseen or intervened in by the federal minister. Out of a number of those controlled actions, many were approved, but many of them were approved with extra conditions.
I think Senator Scullion outlined the process of going through this approval mechanism using controlled actions, negotiating and assessing the potential impacts under matters of national environmental significance and how, even if the proposal still goes ahead, that can and has led to very significant pluses in environmental outcomes. Certainly, where conditions have been applied as a result of that process, that has also meant in some cases significant environmental outcomes. So, the very statistics that are being used to say the act is useless actually reinforce the fact that it has had some positive results.
I do not for a minute say that it is perfect, as I said. I certainly think it needs to be used far more often and far more strongly. But the simple fact is that it is an extra mechanism that would not otherwise exist at all and which would allow a lot of these actions at state government level to go ahead and be put through without any decent assessment at all. It is a completely wrongheaded approach and it is not helpful in the context of this debate. Indeed, one could suggest it is somewhat ironic that people are complaining about how the minister does not use his powers to stop inappropriate developments and the one time he does use them he gets hauled over the coals for it.
There is no doubt, in my mind anyway, that there is a lot of politics involved in this—obviously from all sides but particularly in the decision that the minister came to—but the key thing, when you are looking at law, of course, is whether or not under law his actions are able to be justified. If they are not—if he did just pluck it out of the air with no justification, purely for political motivation—then of course there are grounds for a legal challenge, and that is what the proponents of the wind farm did. By agreement, the original decision has been set aside and there will now be further examination of it. All of that has actually shown a situation where the act has worked. I agree that the minister has certainly taken way too long in coming to a decision. That is certainly the case, and that is clearly problematic.
There was advice from the environment department about non-approval potentially having implications for coastal development. I am on record in this place a number of times calling on the minister to use the act more frequently with regard to coastal development. Certainly, in my own state of Queensland, we need better protection, and we need the environment minister intervening more to stop some of the coastal development, because communities and environments are being decimated. There are lots of places up on the Queensland coast—I have spoken about Mission Beach and Airlie Beach and other areas before in this place—where this not just massively impacts on communities but also causes real damage to threatened species and icon species, like the cassowary, and causes fragmentation of habitat. I want the minister to use his powers to stop coastal development more often—obviously, on a scientific basis. I do not want him to do so capriciously, but I think there is clearly a death of a thousand cuts happening with a lot of coastal developments, many of which are being referred as controlled actions under the federal act but which are nonetheless still going ahead. I think the cumulative impacts of all of those do need to be more strongly assessed.
Senator Milne also called on the minister to make the same decision on the spotted handfish with regard to a development in Tasmania. Again, I concur with her on that. The trouble is that she is attacking his decision on the orange-bellied parrot, which makes for a bit of an anomaly. She opposes the EPBC Act and wants to abolish it. If it were not there, if it had not been passed by the Democrats in 1999, there would be no power for the federal minister to do anything about the spotted handfish, whether he wanted to or not. So I do think it is important to clarify some of those inconsistencies. The situation now is that the decision is being reviewed by the minister and will be remade. Obviously, people will be watching that closely. I do not think that anyone could possibly suggest that a decision in this context is not going to be political, because it has political ramifications one way or the other.
People use ‘political’ in this context as a dirty word. That is understandable, but the word ‘politics’ has a lot of different meanings. There is another meaning to it, which is paying attention to community views. As I have also said in this place a number of times, at the moment the Queensland government is planning to build a couple of—and one in particular—extremely destructive dams. The local community is very strongly opposed to this, as am I. It will clearly have heavy environmental impacts as well as social impacts, and it is economically stupid—not that you can appeal about that under the environment law. I think in these circumstances we need to have the safety net of the federal environment act that can ensure a minister moves in.
Of course, the act is not perfect and, of course, we will always be in a situation where the minister has some discretion. But, frankly, the minister has to exercise his discretion according to law. That always leaves a lot of leeway, but it is not a total blank cheque. There is a loophole in the act with which he can just exempt himself from it, as happened with Christmas Island, and that is unsatisfactory. But the minister does not have open slather under the act. He has to make his decisions according to the law, and if somebody believes he does not then, if they have standing, they can challenge them. I suggest that that situation is as it should be.
The attempts to link the minister’s less than perfect actions on this particular issue to the flaws in the EPBC Act are wrong and, frankly, unhelpful. We do need to strengthen that act. We do need to strengthen the actions of the minister under that act. But simply discrediting the act and discrediting the times when the minister does use his powers will not be particularly helpful. I should also emphasise that the statement made that the act has proved to be useless is simply not correct. It may have proved to be useless in terms of what people want to do in Tasmania—I do not know—but it has certainly proven on a couple of occasions to be very powerful in situations in Queensland.
An example is a decision made by the former environment minister in regard to another dam, the Nathan Dam, in which, because of the EPBC Act—and it would not have been able to happen otherwise—people were able to take that action to court to challenge it, and the action was successful. Because of that, it was made clear that under law, contrary to what has been said in this debate by some on this side of the chamber, the minister is required to consider the cumulative impacts of any proposal including, of course, the Nathan Dam. That principle was not challenged by the government, not appealed, so it now applies at law with regard to any other proposal, including the new dams that are being planned in Queensland. So the act has demonstrated significant benefit already. That is not to say that the Nathan Dam will not go ahead eventually, but it has certainly been held up for two or three years. It is a dam that both major parties supported. I did not. I hope it does not end up going ahead, but it is one case in which the act has proven to be very useful.
Another case is with regard to spectacled flying foxes in North Queensland, where a court challenge under the act was able to have direct positive consequences for the prevention of the slaughtering of that particular endangered species. More court actions have continued subsequently with regard to that. The third party rights of standing provisions in the federal act were forerunners that were key to ensuring that similar provisions are now in place under Queensland’s Nature Conservation Act, which have now been successfully used once again to try and protect continued threats to the spectacled flying fox by orchardists in that area. I do think those aspects of the debate need to be put in place and put on the record. There have clearly been politics with regard to this decision, and that is perhaps not surprising because we are all politicians. Certainly, it took a lot longer than is desirable.
As to the issue of industry certainty, I am certainly a strong supporter of the wind industry, but I actually do not want industry certainty for coastal developments, for tourism resorts or for canal estates. I want them to know that they might not have success, I want them to think twice and three times before they go ahead with proposals and I want those proposals to be thoroughly examined by the strongest environmental mechanisms. We still need to strengthen this federal law, but it is a lot stronger than what was there before. That is directly a result of the Democrats strongly improving the EPBC Act in 1999 and not caving in to the, frankly, hysterical crusade launched against those who supported the legislation at the time which, judging from some of the comments made in the last day or so, is still continuing today. The minister’s decision, as I said, is one that has aspects that are problematic. Whether or not it undermined the administration of the act and he abused his powers is a rather more open question than what many others in this debate have suggested.

At the end of the motion, add:
“and, in respect of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2006, the bill be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 10 October 2006”.
Acting Deputy President Crossin, you will see that the committee did look at this referral but was unable to make a decision. The bill that is the subject of this amendment is a very important one. In effect, it takes away the authority of the legislature. Currently, the Howard government, in counsel, can override laws made by the elected government of the Australian Capital Territory. The bill would, of course, leave that power available to the Commonwealth parliament. It is an important piece of legislation and it ought to be before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. It ought to be there, amongst other reasons, for there to be public input before the Senate considers the bill.
It is a very important case. Here is a piece of legislation which ought to and must have public input. It is a constitutional matter. It involves the balance of powers between the elected government of the Australian Capital Territory and the elected government of the Commonwealth of Australia. The contention in the legislation brought forward by the Greens is that only the parliament should override the Australian Capital Territory when its legislature makes laws—that that should not be a power held by the government of the day, the cabinet of the day, the Prime Minister of the day, the minister of the day; it should be a matter for parliament. It is a very serious matter when the Commonwealth government moves to override legislation which has been duly passed by another elected parliament in Australia. It should not be something left to just the government; it should be something that has to come before both houses of this parliament.
The committee ought to have made the decision to put this legislation before a proper committee for inquiry. You will remember that, quite recently, the Commonwealth moved to override the legislature on the business of same-sex unions and the laws that the ACT brought forward. There have been a number of other episodes where that has happened. On that occasion, it came before the parliament—it must come before the parliament—and we should make it clear that it can be only the parliament of Australia that can take such a serious move. I do not know what debate took place in the committee and I do not know what the vote in that committee was, but, quite properly, this matter is now before the whole of the Senate. I think it is a pure and good process, an essential process, that this Senate votes in a situation where a committee have been unable to make up their minds on a matter.
I am proposing, of course, that the government, the opposition and the other parties should join the Greens to ensure that this important legislation goes before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for consideration. We are not making a judgement on the legislation, as you will understand, Acting Deputy President; we are simply saying: ‘Let’s have this legislation put before a committee for due consideration and to report back to the Senate. Let the people of the ACT and, indeed, the people of the Commonwealth of this great country of ours exercise their right to have a say. Let us be informed before we consider this piece of legislation.’ It is my intention to ensure that the legislation is considered before the end of this year. I appeal to the opposition and the government to support this amendment so that the committee can look at the bill.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,10,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-08-09,"—From Labor’s perspective, I say at the outset that we make no comment with respect to the content of the bill itself. That is a matter for Senator Brown. But, in terms of the process, we do support that the matter should be referred to a committee. Clearly, before this government took control of the Senate, these matters would have been, by agreement, referred to a committee for examination, but, since this government has gained the majority, it is now exercising—arrogantly, may I say—its authority to deny references to committees. Even with respect to this matter, Labor would have liked the opportunity to hear from the various interested parties and allow them to participate in the committee process.
As to the final outcome of a committee, sometimes we do not know where they might go. That is the purpose of a committee: to actually hold an inquiry and allow public input. But this government does not want public input into committees. This government does not want references to committees. In fact, this government not only denies references to committees—and it has a record in the last 12 months of denying more references than it allowed—but also has a record of foreshortening committee inquiries to ensure that proper scrutiny cannot be had.
This government needs to be held to account. Regarding the committee process, it should have agreed to allow this matter to go to the committee for examination and report, but the government is now exercising its might rather than its right and says no. There are other references that will come forward. Labor will bring forward other references either this week or next week, and again this government, I suspect, will take the same view and deny the Senate the ability to inquire into matters of importance—matters that should be looked into. Senators have a right to be able to bring forward reasonable references. This is not a reference in respect of a wide-ranging matter; it is a reference in relation to a private member’s bill. We have had references before that allowed committees to examine private member’s bills in this way. I am waiting for a response from the government as to why it has denied this reference in this way.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,10,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-08-09,"—I am waiting for a response as well. The Democrats support this reference, not because we do or do not support the legislation but because we operate on the principle that, frankly, if any senator wants to refer legislation to a committee then, unless there is an extremely good reason not to, they should be able to. My understanding, going back quite a long way now, is that that has been the general convention. If there is a clear reason, like it has already been referred once before or it has already been passed through the chamber, then you do not refer it, but otherwise you do. I should emphasise that this is one of those practices which is very important, because it is a mechanism that ensures that the whole place does not become just a number-crunching tyranny of the majority. It is one of those circumstances where an individual can make a request. I am sure it has just been at the request of an individual senator that we have in the past sent legislation to a committee, including, sometimes, private senator’s bills.
To start putting in place a practice of refusing reasonable requests for legislation to be referred to a committee is, firstly, quite a dangerous precedent, in my view, and, secondly, yet another mechanism, and another example, of the Senate being slowly strangled. If any alternative views, any variances of opinion or, frankly, any different ideas are put forward that do not come from the government side, they are just dismissed as being of no significance at all. I think that is a very dangerous practice and it is a very dangerous direction that we are going in. Of course this is not the first example of it. It is just the latest example in what is becoming a very long list of treating the Senate with contempt, treating senators with contempt and treating anybody out in the wider community who is not part of the government with contempt.
It is also an unfortunate precedent. Of course, politics being politics—and I for one would love it to change dramatically in some of its fundamental aspects, but I do not hold out a lot of hope that that is going to happen quickly—the day will come when the current mob will not be in government and the other mob will be, and they will point to things like this and say, ‘You’ve done it; it’s now established practice,’ and everything moves one little notch lower. That is what we are doing here on a whole range of things: we are moving democracy down one little notch each time. Each notch lower that things are moved to, the harder it is to get them back up again and the more difficult things are to reverse. This is another example of that, and I think it is a very unfortunate example—and completely unnecessary.
What possible damage and harm could it do to the government to allow this sort of issue to be examined? We are supposed to be rethinking Federation at the moment. We are supposed to be rethinking the whole power structure between the states and the federal government. The powers and the role of the Australian Capital Territory and how it relates to the federal government are also important issues. Let us start looking at these things. Just because the bill itself is not going to pass does not mean that it is futile to examine the issues it raises. All these things contribute to the public debate—or they would, except for the actions of the government, which are basically to try and minimise public debate through the parliamentary arena, unless it is an area that they control.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,10,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-08-09,"—I think enough of the Senate’s time has been wasted this afternoon by the spurious censure motion against the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, so allow me to be brief but also to inject some reality and fact, as opposed to the hyperbole we have just heard. The simple fact is that the Australian people, in voting for the Constitution, clothed the Commonwealth with a power to make laws in relation to the territories. I invite honourable senators to check out section 122 of the Constitution. Following on from that, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, the self-government act, entrenches the Commonwealth’s constitutional power to disallow ACT law through the Governor-General.
I might just ask, rhetorically: who was in power in 1988? I think it was Labor legislation. The Labor Party itself thought it appropriate that laws made by the ACT should be disallowable through the Governor-General. We have the situation once again where the Labor Party—for opposition’s sake; I do not know why—is willing to do a backflip on its previous principles and is willing to engage in what would be quite a fatuous discussion and investigation. The self-government act provides a simpler method of removing a law than the method suggested by the Greens which would require the making of other laws to override an unacceptable law. What currently exists is that the—
—You’re talking to the content.
—Senator Ludwig, I listened to your contribution in silence. I would invite you to listen to mine in silence as well. The simple fact is that the parliament still has a say in relation to these matters by virtue of a disallowance motion. So if the parliament is of the view that the decision of the Governor-General, in overriding an ACT law, happens to be wrong in principle, or whatever, it is open to any senator to move a motion of disallowance and have it debated in the Senate. Indeed, that is what excited the interest of the Australian Greens with regard to the civil unions legislation in the ACT. We actually debated it in the Senate, and as representatives of the Australian people we said, ‘We happen to agree with the government’s decision in overriding that legislation.’ The parliament and every single senator in this place got a vote on that very issue.
So let us not have any nonsense or this hyperbole that somehow we are denying the democratic rights of this parliament to have a say and a vote. The structure that is in place, starting with section 122 of the Constitution, which the Australian people voted for, gives us the power. Then there is the legislation that was passed here about 20 years ago under a Labor government. It has been fully accepted until now, when we happen to have debated it and dealt with it in relation to civil unions. It has excited the attention of the Greens and others. We are of the view that there is an appropriate mechanism here and that further consideration of Senator Brown’s amendment is simply not warranted. It is a question of priorities. What should the Senate be spending its time on? What should the Senate committees be spending their time on? Senator Brown is undoubtedly looking to develop a mechanism whereby the overriding of the ACT civil unions legislation can somehow be undone. We as a government are very firm in our view and stance on marriage and our position is clear. The great thing about Australian democracy is that people will be able to cast a vote on these matters at the next election.

That the report be adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,10,2,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-08-09,"—I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
“and, in respect of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment (Disallowance Power of the Commonwealth) Bill 2006, the bill be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 10 October 2006”.
Acting Deputy President Crossin, you will see that the committee did look at this referral but was unable to make a decision. The bill that is the subject of this amendment is a very important one. In effect, it takes away the authority of the legislature. Currently, the Howard government, in counsel, can override laws made by the elected government of the Australian Capital Territory. The bill would, of course, leave that power available to the Commonwealth parliament. It is an important piece of legislation and it ought to be before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. It ought to be there, amongst other reasons, for there to be public input before the Senate considers the bill.
It is a very important case. Here is a piece of legislation which ought to and must have public input. It is a constitutional matter. It involves the balance of powers between the elected government of the Australian Capital Territory and the elected government of the Commonwealth of Australia. The contention in the legislation brought forward by the Greens is that only the parliament should override the Australian Capital Territory when its legislature makes laws—that that should not be a power held by the government of the day, the cabinet of the day, the Prime Minister of the day, the minister of the day; it should be a matter for parliament. It is a very serious matter when the Commonwealth government moves to override legislation which has been duly passed by another elected parliament in Australia. It should not be something left to just the government; it should be something that has to come before both houses of this parliament.
The committee ought to have made the decision to put this legislation before a proper committee for inquiry. You will remember that, quite recently, the Commonwealth moved to override the legislature on the business of same-sex unions and the laws that the ACT brought forward. There have been a number of other episodes where that has happened. On that occasion, it came before the parliament—it must come before the parliament—and we should make it clear that it can be only the parliament of Australia that can take such a serious move. I do not know what debate took place in the committee and I do not know what the vote in that committee was, but, quite properly, this matter is now before the whole of the Senate. I think it is a pure and good process, an essential process, that this Senate votes in a situation where a committee have been unable to make up their minds on a matter.
I am proposing, of course, that the government, the opposition and the other parties should join the Greens to ensure that this important legislation goes before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for consideration. We are not making a judgement on the legislation, as you will understand, Acting Deputy President; we are simply saying: ‘Let’s have this legislation put before a committee for due consideration and to report back to the Senate. Let the people of the ACT and, indeed, the people of the Commonwealth of this great country of ours exercise their right to have a say. Let us be informed before we consider this piece of legislation.’ It is my intention to ensure that the legislation is considered before the end of this year. I appeal to the opposition and the government to support this amendment so that the committee can look at the bill.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,10,2,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-08-09,"—From Labor’s perspective, I say at the outset that we make no comment with respect to the content of the bill itself. That is a matter for Senator Brown. But, in terms of the process, we do support that the matter should be referred to a committee. Clearly, before this government took control of the Senate, these matters would have been, by agreement, referred to a committee for examination, but, since this government has gained the majority, it is now exercising—arrogantly, may I say—its authority to deny references to committees. Even with respect to this matter, Labor would have liked the opportunity to hear from the various interested parties and allow them to participate in the committee process.
As to the final outcome of a committee, sometimes we do not know where they might go. That is the purpose of a committee: to actually hold an inquiry and allow public input. But this government does not want public input into committees. This government does not want references to committees. In fact, this government not only denies references to committees—and it has a record in the last 12 months of denying more references than it allowed—but also has a record of foreshortening committee inquiries to ensure that proper scrutiny cannot be had.
This government needs to be held to account. Regarding the committee process, it should have agreed to allow this matter to go to the committee for examination and report, but the government is now exercising its might rather than its right and says no. There are other references that will come forward. Labor will bring forward other references either this week or next week, and again this government, I suspect, will take the same view and deny the Senate the ability to inquire into matters of importance—matters that should be looked into. Senators have a right to be able to bring forward reasonable references. This is not a reference in respect of a wide-ranging matter; it is a reference in relation to a private member’s bill. We have had references before that allowed committees to examine private member’s bills in this way. I am waiting for a response from the government as to why it has denied this reference in this way.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,10,2,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-08-09,"—I am waiting for a response as well. The Democrats support this reference, not because we do or do not support the legislation but because we operate on the principle that, frankly, if any senator wants to refer legislation to a committee then, unless there is an extremely good reason not to, they should be able to. My understanding, going back quite a long way now, is that that has been the general convention. If there is a clear reason, like it has already been referred once before or it has already been passed through the chamber, then you do not refer it, but otherwise you do. I should emphasise that this is one of those practices which is very important, because it is a mechanism that ensures that the whole place does not become just a number-crunching tyranny of the majority. It is one of those circumstances where an individual can make a request. I am sure it has just been at the request of an individual senator that we have in the past sent legislation to a committee, including, sometimes, private senator’s bills.
To start putting in place a practice of refusing reasonable requests for legislation to be referred to a committee is, firstly, quite a dangerous precedent, in my view, and, secondly, yet another mechanism, and another example, of the Senate being slowly strangled. If any alternative views, any variances of opinion or, frankly, any different ideas are put forward that do not come from the government side, they are just dismissed as being of no significance at all. I think that is a very dangerous practice and it is a very dangerous direction that we are going in. Of course this is not the first example of it. It is just the latest example in what is becoming a very long list of treating the Senate with contempt, treating senators with contempt and treating anybody out in the wider community who is not part of the government with contempt.
It is also an unfortunate precedent. Of course, politics being politics—and I for one would love it to change dramatically in some of its fundamental aspects, but I do not hold out a lot of hope that that is going to happen quickly—the day will come when the current mob will not be in government and the other mob will be, and they will point to things like this and say, ‘You’ve done it; it’s now established practice,’ and everything moves one little notch lower. That is what we are doing here on a whole range of things: we are moving democracy down one little notch each time. Each notch lower that things are moved to, the harder it is to get them back up again and the more difficult things are to reverse. This is another example of that, and I think it is a very unfortunate example—and completely unnecessary.
What possible damage and harm could it do to the government to allow this sort of issue to be examined? We are supposed to be rethinking Federation at the moment. We are supposed to be rethinking the whole power structure between the states and the federal government. The powers and the role of the Australian Capital Territory and how it relates to the federal government are also important issues. Let us start looking at these things. Just because the bill itself is not going to pass does not mean that it is futile to examine the issues it raises. All these things contribute to the public debate—or they would, except for the actions of the government, which are basically to try and minimise public debate through the parliamentary arena, unless it is an area that they control.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,10,2,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-08-09,"—I think enough of the Senate’s time has been wasted this afternoon by the spurious censure motion against the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, so allow me to be brief but also to inject some reality and fact, as opposed to the hyperbole we have just heard. The simple fact is that the Australian people, in voting for the Constitution, clothed the Commonwealth with a power to make laws in relation to the territories. I invite honourable senators to check out section 122 of the Constitution. Following on from that, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, the self-government act, entrenches the Commonwealth’s constitutional power to disallow ACT law through the Governor-General.
I might just ask, rhetorically: who was in power in 1988? I think it was Labor legislation. The Labor Party itself thought it appropriate that laws made by the ACT should be disallowable through the Governor-General. We have the situation once again where the Labor Party—for opposition’s sake; I do not know why—is willing to do a backflip on its previous principles and is willing to engage in what would be quite a fatuous discussion and investigation. The self-government act provides a simpler method of removing a law than the method suggested by the Greens which would require the making of other laws to override an unacceptable law. What currently exists is that the—
—You’re talking to the content.
—Senator Ludwig, I listened to your contribution in silence. I would invite you to listen to mine in silence as well. The simple fact is that the parliament still has a say in relation to these matters by virtue of a disallowance motion. So if the parliament is of the view that the decision of the Governor-General, in overriding an ACT law, happens to be wrong in principle, or whatever, it is open to any senator to move a motion of disallowance and have it debated in the Senate. Indeed, that is what excited the interest of the Australian Greens with regard to the civil unions legislation in the ACT. We actually debated it in the Senate, and as representatives of the Australian people we said, ‘We happen to agree with the government’s decision in overriding that legislation.’ The parliament and every single senator in this place got a vote on that very issue.
So let us not have any nonsense or this hyperbole that somehow we are denying the democratic rights of this parliament to have a say and a vote. The structure that is in place, starting with section 122 of the Constitution, which the Australian people voted for, gives us the power. Then there is the legislation that was passed here about 20 years ago under a Labor government. It has been fully accepted until now, when we happen to have debated it and dealt with it in relation to civil unions. It has excited the attention of the Greens and others. We are of the view that there is an appropriate mechanism here and that further consideration of Senator Brown’s amendment is simply not warranted. It is a question of priorities. What should the Senate be spending its time on? What should the Senate committees be spending their time on? Senator Brown is undoubtedly looking to develop a mechanism whereby the overriding of the ACT civil unions legislation can somehow be undone. We as a government are very firm in our view and stance on marriage and our position is clear. The great thing about Australian democracy is that people will be able to cast a vote on these matters at the next election.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-08-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This document is the statutory funding agreement between the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Australian Livestock Export Corporation, often known just as LiveCorp. It details fairly briefly the amount of money involved with regard to section 68C of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act.
I believe that it is important to emphasise some of the facts surrounding the live export trade, because it is certainly an area where there is a lot of community concern. That concern has been raised many times in the mainstream media as well as in the wider media, and of course it has been raised a number of times in this chamber by me and other Democrats over the years. I note that the LiveCorp website shows some of the things they are spending their money on, one of which is another report which seeks to detail what they say are some of the facts with regard to the live export trade, particularly focusing on how many jobs they state the export trade generates.
According to this report through the LiveCorp website, the industry generates an estimated 9,000 jobs in rural and regional Australia. The numbers of live animals exported last year were: 573,000 cattle—over half a million—the majority to South-East Asia; and well over four million sheep, exported to the Middle East. Many senators and members of the public would recall some of the footage shown on 60 Minutes—indeed, I think it was one of the final stories done by the late Richard Carleton—detailing unbelievably cruel conditions in abattoirs in Egypt that Australian cattle were subjected to when they were sent there. The trade to Egypt was subsequently suspended while the government said they would look into it.
I would not be surprised if, having made that token effort, the government now recommence the trade with very little by way of significant changes occurring. The reason I believe that is that history shows that that is what happens. Time and again there is a particular incident that comes to the public attention, there is a huge outcry and there are initial government and industry denials and eventually the evidence is so overwhelming that the government have to accept that with that particular incident there is a problem. They then suspend the trade or have an inquiry or do something else and use that to say that everything is fine. They will run the line that everything is fine until the next crisis happens. This has been a pattern that has been repeating for around 20 years.
I would like to examine the claims in the LiveCorp report, which was produced by Hassall and Associates, as I understand it. LiveCorp also had a report from Hassall and Associates five or so years ago. I might note that a long-time director of Hassalls is Peter Frawley, who is a former chairman of LiveCorp, although he is not a director at the moment. Perhaps that is coincidental. But certainly there are very contrasting figures that have been put together by independent agricultural economists Dr Selwyn Heilbron and Dr Terry Larkin. They found that the live sheep export industry directly competes in the same Middle East market with Australian chilled or frozen sheepmeat industry products. We have this continual suggestion that, if we phase out live exports, there is no other alternative. Well, there is an alternative, because it already operates. Indeed, when the trade was previously banned in Saudi Arabia for a while, there was a massive increase in chilled meat exports.
The other aspect is the 9,000 jobs. This report suggested that the majority of those 9,000 jobs are for sheep farmers, stock hands, stock transport drivers, shearers et cetera, and they would continue to exist. That report also concluded that, if the sheep and cattle currently exported live were instead processed in Australia, a further $1.5 billion would be added to Australia’s GDP and an extra 10½ thousand jobs would be created. So the fact is that the live export industry is costing us jobs as well as involving enormous cruelty, and it is time that those facts were acknowledged instead of covered up. (Time expired)

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2006-08-09,"—I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate tonight some facts about the impact of the government’s so-called VSU legislation, legislation that prevents higher education institutions from collecting a universal fee for student services. It is now some eight months since this extreme legislation was rammed through the Senate after a guillotine debate. In the 12 months I have been a senator, there has been a lot of legislation go through the Senate chamber that I have disagreed with, but I think the so-called VSU legislation was a stand-out in terms of the government using its Senate majority to secure a particularly insidious outcome that might have satisfied a few government senators and members but which the majority of Australians did not ask for and indeed have never asked for.
Some people say that those members and senators who supported the legislation were motivated by revenge because they could not control the student organisations of which they were members, and active members at that. There is no doubt some veracity in that view, and it is a view that I have expressed myself, but with the benefit of a bit more experience in the Senate chamber I now take a more expansive, more generous, view of their underlying motivation. I believe that the legislation was part of this government’s multifaceted agenda to create an Australia where fear rules in the workplace, where education only serves capital and is not seen as a social good in and of itself, where you are punished for being different and where government senators and members use their power to doggedly pursue a dreary, narrow-minded conservative ideology.
As we have seen time and again, when government members vote to restrict debate in this chamber or vote to refuse or curtail references to Senate committees, this government does all that it can to curb dissent, and shutting up the nay-sayers is of course a major tool in the armoury of extremist conservative governments like this one. Where were the traditional repositories of dissent against conservatism in this country? Student organisations and trade unions. Which organisations have been targeted by this government? Student organisations and trade unions.
I would like to speak a bit about the effect of the government’s legislation on student unions in my home state of South Australia, where we have some 67,000 students enrolled in our three universities. I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge that, for one of our universities, Flinders University, 2006 is their 40th anniversary. Flinders University was named after a visionary and bold explorer, Matthew Flinders. It still has a deserved reputation for providing a progressive education experience for its students. During its 40 years, both staff and students at Flinders University have also participated in social activism in a way that has sometimes been, I have to admit, a little confronting for staid South Australians.
The infamous month-long occupation of the administration offices of the university in 1974, when students protested over assessment and disciplinary matters, springs to mind. The key role that Professor Brian Medlin and Flinders University students played in the Vietnam War moratoriums a few years earlier is another example of the engagement of students in progressive social movements. No doubt Professor Medlin, who unfortunately died last year, would be appalled to see what is happening to the student organisations at his former university.
With the introduction of the VSU legislation, the six student organisations at Flinders University have agreed to amalgamate into one organisation. Inevitably there have been job losses as a result, with the concomitant loss of a number of experienced and knowledgeable staff. But, as we know, the government do not care about people losing their jobs. We saw that when they introduced their ‘sack anyone for any reason, whenever you like,’ Work Choices legislation.
From the amalgamation of the student organisations at Flinders University the objective of both the university and the student body is that they continue to provide as many essential services as possible without having to charge students on a fee-for-service basis. These essential services—primarily welfare, financial counselling and advocacy—will rely on university funding to continue, funding that the university would previously have spent on actual education delivery. Unlike the government, the university and its student body understand that some students will always need additional non-academic assistance to continue and complete their degrees. Unlike the government, the university and its student organisations understand that those kinds of services will not be supported by private enterprise, and students who need welfare or financial counselling advice are unlikely to be in a position to pay for that assistance.
Students at Flinders University have also lost food discounts, some catering services and the staff support and research provided to student advocates to enable those advocates to represent student interests at the university, higher education and community forums. Sadly, the future of the student organisation’s very innovative parent centre is in doubt. This centre provides low-cost occasional child care for students who are unable to access more regular child care because of their economic or other circumstances. Of the students who use the parent centre, more than 30 per cent come from identified low-socioeconomic backgrounds and would not be able to attend university if they did not have that childcare facility.
Whether the free employment services that each of the three university student unions provide for students will continue to be provided is also doubtful. Flinders and Adelaide universities are looking to merge their employment services, but they have to do this in a climate where there is no guaranteed income and where the $80 million too-little-too-late VSU transition fund that bought the vote of the doormats in the National Party is not being released until 2007 and is anyway being limited to sport and recreational facilities. The additional $10 million to encourage local businesses to maintain key services at regional campuses is simply an admission by the government that providing services to students on campus is a difficult proposition because students are sometimes on campus for fewer than 40 weeks a year. Student organisations had figured that out a long time ago and had adapted their business to suit the academic year. But now the taxpayer has to fork out another $10 million to prop up private businesses, all because of the government’s incompetence.
One of the very important services that student organisations provide is their annual orientation programs for new students. In my experience as an administrator in a student union, it is students from regional and rural areas and from overseas who most benefit from orientation programs and so it is those students who will be most disadvantaged when programs are inevitably cut because they can no longer be funded. Student organisations will find it difficult to provide the free or subsidised social and information events that are part of the orientation programs specifically designed to assist students in adapting to life away from home.
One of the earliest and, in my view, most disturbing casualties of the push to wreck student organisations is the curtailment of the ability of student unions to continue regularly publishing, or publishing at all, their student newspapers. At the University of Adelaide the student publication On Dit has a long and proud history of challenging the status quo—sometimes outrageously, I have to admit—but always from the point of view that if someone does not challenge the status quo progress is not possible. I find it very satisfying that many members of the press gallery in this building today were contributors to, or editors of, On Dit when they were students at Adelaide university. I do not think they are quite as radical now as they were then, but at least they still care about the responsibility they have to influence public opinion through the media.
At Flinders University the Empire Times also has a radical tradition. There is no doubt that student organisation newspapers sail close to the wind in terms of acceptable reporting, tastefulness and relevance from time to time, and conservative critics will find plenty of ammunition if they want to run the line that either On Dit or Empire Times have, at times, reported irresponsibly on important issues or, indeed, reported responsibly on very unimportant issues. However, the fact that student newspapers generate that debate is the important thing. In the past they have made us contemplate what is and is not the role of media in society. Empire Times has been in publication for 37 years and, if it survives at all, On Dit will have been in publication for 70 years in 2007. That is a tradition that we should value; we should not be acquiescing to destroying it. To survive, student newspapers will have to become different kinds of publications and will undoubtedly have to accept advertising. And that, of course, will compromise their independence.
It is early days in terms of the impact of the VSU legislation on our student organisations and on our universities and the students who attend them. The full impact of this legislation will not be apparent until 2007 and beyond. In preparing this speech, I was heartened by the ‘never say die’ attitude— (Time expired)

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-08-09,"—The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:

The Combined Registry is an initiative of the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Magistrates Court that has the support of the Australian Government. As both courts are responsible for the initiative they have provided the following responses to the questions:

The purpose of the Combined Registry initiative is to reduce confusion for clients negotiating the family law courts, and to minimise duplication of administrative work to support the operations of the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Magistrates Court. The role of Family Court staff has evolved over time, and will continue to evolve, in response to changing client needs, but not as a direct result of the Combined Registry initiative.
The Courts will continue to review basic registry functions and look for efficiencies that will allow for a realignment of resources to place a greater emphasis on the needs of clients. The Combined Registry Program includes the ‘Alignment Project’, that will consider registry functions to ensure the alignment of staff support to the Combined Registry Model. The project will ensure that resources are aligned to meet the needs of judges, federal magistrates and clients.
There are no proposals for shedding jobs under the Combined Registry initiative. There is no reason to expect that the number of applications filed in the Courts will diminish due to this initiative, so the volume of family law work for the Courts should be unchanged, pending the incremental establishment of the Family Relationship Centres. However, the Courts will continue to review their systems and processes over time to identify new efficiencies and continuing improvements in service delivery to maximise the value of the taxpayer funding allocated to administer the Courts. As has been the case in the past, for the Family Court and for many other agencies, this may result in a review of staffing structures and numbers over time.
Under the Combined Registry initiative, client service officers will continue to provide client services to clients of both courts, but with a greater focus on the administrative needs and requirements of federal magistrates. Judicial support staff will continue to support the judicial officers of each court. It is anticipated that the Family Court’s registrars will play a greater role in supporting the work of federal magistrates, whilst still fulfilling a pivotal role in support of the Family Court’s judges, and the role of the Family Court’s mediators is retained and enhanced under the changes to the Family Law Act 1975 (contained in the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Act 2006 that will come into effect on 1 July 2006.
Early project results are encouraging, and indicate significant improvements in the nature of staff’s work. For example, the establishment of the National Enquiry Centre to answer general Court enquiries has resulted in a reduction of more than 50% in telephone traffic to registry staff. Concurrently, the Family Court’s new less adversarial approach to hearing children’s cases has resulted in a reduction of more than 50% in the number of affidavits and subpoenas filed in children’s cases with the Family Court. Together, it is intended that these and similar efficiencies will enable the Court’s staff to focus less on general information enquiries and internal paper processing, and more on client relations and case coordination.
The following staff consultations were conducted during the development of the Combined Registry initiative:
•       September/October 2004 staff consultations – meetings held at the various registries;
•       April to July 2005 – consultations with staff regarding the Combined registry Model – the meetings were held at most registries with some registries attending by video link;
•       Courtside/Knowledge Matters articles – newsletters of the FCoA & FMC respectively;
•       Staff Bulletins – Combined registry updates from the Program Managers; and
•       The CEO of the Family Court of Australia toured all registry locations during April and May 2006 to deliver in person a ‘Future Directions’ presentation to staff, and to discuss with staff the implications of present reforms, including the Combined Registry initiative.
The development and implementation of the Combined Registry initiative must be considered in the present context of much wider and significant reforms in family law. Contemporaneously, the Courts are adjusting to significant legislative changes, the establishment of Family Relationship Centres, and the Family Court’s less adversarial approach to hearing children’s cases. Each of these programs alone could be expected to have an impact on staffing.
In terms of the Combined Registry initiative, the scope of the initiative is significant, and involves a program of 16 individual projects to manage the proposed changes, as presented in Diagram 1.
