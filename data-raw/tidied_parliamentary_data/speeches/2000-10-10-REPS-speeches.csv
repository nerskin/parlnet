"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-10-10,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, isn't it a fact that your new system of assessing schools' needs takes no account of facilities such as rifle ranges, aerobics studios and equestrian centres, takes no account of school fees as high as $12,000 a year, takes no account of multimillion dollar donations and treats some millionaires as though they were poor? Prime Minister, isn't this the reason why your new system delivers the biggest increases to the richest schools?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Education: Funding for Non-government Schools</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2000-10-10,"—The new system is a fairer measure than the one that it replaced. The new system, for example, accommodates, in a way that the old system could never accommodate, for the fact that many independent schools in country areas of Australia have lived through the phenomenon of having had, 30 or 40 years ago, a far wealthier parent body than they now have, because of the changed circumstances in rural Australia. But, because of the historic funding formula that was entrenched in the ERI system adopted in 1985, those schools and those parents were unable to get additional assistance. In this whole debate, the difference between us and Labor is that we believe in choice. We do not believe that independent schools should be available only to a limited section of the Australian community. We believe people should be able to exercise the right of choice, and I totally reject the class driven claims of the Leader of the Opposition.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Education: Funding for Non-government Schools</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,answer
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2000-10-10,"—Mr Speaker, earlier in question time, I tabled the document `Handle with Care', an ACTU publication acknowledging the work of the Remuneration Planning Corporation. I was previously asked on 6 September whether I had met with the Remuneration Planning Corporation during 1999. I think I was asked that by the member for Lowe, and I tabled with the document `Handle with Care' a memorandum of 7 September from the Remuneration Planning Corporation saying that neither I nor the Assistant Treasurer or our staff had met with them during 1999 or 2000.",REPS,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Employee Share Ownership Schemes: Potential for Abuse</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,speech

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-10-10,"—Mr Speaker, it would be impossible for me to convey to you how deeply I resent the way in which this government has handled the issue of resources to private schooling in this country. This government has undermined a fundamental principle, an educational and equity principle, put in place by the Australian Labor Party when we legislated for the first time funding directly to schools on a per capita student basis back in the mid-1970s under Gough Whitlam as Prime Minister and my father as minister for education.
The Prime Minister likes to point out that, during the 1960s, the Menzies government put forward propositions for science labs in schools. As important as those science labs are, they were bagatelles in the expense of conducting education in the private sector. They were there for Menzies not so much to do something serious about the needs or the equity problems associated with the then some 25 per cent of Australians who sent their kids to private schools but to embarrass the Labor Party politically.
It took the Labor Party's coming to office, with its commitment to education and its commitment to access and equity opportunities, to actually put in place direct funding—real choice for working-class Australians on whether or not they would find themselves in private schools. It was us; we did it. And you opposed it. The Liberal Party opposed the Labor Party's position. They opposed it in the Senate. They opposed it in the House. Fraser, the Liberal Party education spokesperson, sat across the table from my father and said that we would not get our bill and we would not get assistance on this basis with private schools. What was their position? Their position was that, whether you went to Geelong Grammar or Our Lady of Lourdes School, you should get exactly the same per capita funding basis. 
The Prime Minister stands in here and prances about, lecturing us on needs based funding, whilst he moves the system decisively in the direction that they wanted in the mid-1970s, which was to treat a child who goes to a school with the massive resources of Geelong Grammar the same as a kid who goes to school with the utterly inadequate resources of the average Catholic parochial school—or, for that matter, the average parochial school, be they associated with a Catholic religion or any other—in this country. That was their position then, and a decisive shift is taking place now in the same direction.
There is an interesting debating point being made by George Bush in the American presidential campaign, and I intend from this point until the day of the next election to shamelessly plagiarise it. Bush has—I think in all probability inaccurately—characterised the situation in the United States as an education recession. He said the Americans were experiencing an education recession. They may or may not be, but there is no doubt about it here. There is an education recession in this country. The Commonwealth public commitment to education is falling, and we are the only nation in the industrialised world where that is happening.
It is possible that that position might actually come back into equilibrium over the next four years. Why? Because of the loot being ladled out to the category 1 schools. That is not an education decision but a class decision. At least part of decent education policy has to be about access and opportunity for those who cannot necessarily afford it from within their own means, and choice and freedom of conscience is closely bound up in all of that. Proper needs based funding is essential to ensure that that actually takes place. That is an education principle. Shifting resources into schools with the dimensions of Geelong Grammar and ripping it out of the state system on the way through is not an educational principle but a class principle.
I have nothing against parents who send their children to the King's Schools and the Geelong Grammars—nothing at all. They love their kids just as much as anyone who sends their kids to public schools, or to parochial schools, or to Christian schools, or to Muslim schools, or to Greek schools, or to Jewish schools—all of those schools that got funding when the Labor Party was an office and did not get a brass razoo from Liberal governments. They care just as much for their children as the parents of the kids that go there, but they have the resources to care even more. They have the resources to pay $11,000 a year fees, $12,000 a year fees. The minister got up and said one of these schools has in fact lowered the fees on the basis of what the minister has done—lowered them from $11,000 a year to $10,800 a year. The working class will be marching through the portals of that school in droves on the basis of that reduction—there is no doubt about that at all! The point about all of that of course is—
—They will be joining the children of the Labor leadership, will they?
—What are you doing bringing family into it? You are a grub.
 (Mr Nehl)—Order! The minister and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease cross-talk.
—that they actually have the resources. We did say that it is not unreasonable for some small contribution to be made to the schools where the parents of those kids pay 11 grand a year. We said that it was reasonable for some small amount to be paid in. We thought: they are paying taxes; that ought to be done. Every kid was entitled to some degree of public subvention. But that act of generosity that produced a level of funding—which the Prime Minister at the start of this debate had approved but has now abandoned—has been taken to the nth degree by this government. 
The term `category 1 school' needs some explanation here in this chamber. I thought I might take a Western Australian example, just so at least those people in my home state can understand exactly who is getting these resources. If you start up Stirling Highway from Fremantle you will see on your right Methodist Ladies College and Christ Church Grammar School—beautiful buildings, beautiful fields. They are not category 1 schools. Then you continue onto the South Perth freeway into South Perth and you will see Wesley College and in the neighbouring suburb of Kensington its sister college, Penrhos. You will see magnificent arts resources, particularly in Penrhos, magnificent playing fields, but they are not category 1 schools. You can then go further down the highway to Salter Point, to Aquinas, and you can see magnificent playing fields in a great school, but it is not category 1. Then you can turn back up the Great Eastern Highway and head out through historic Guildford and you will see magnificent historical buildings, beautiful playing fields on the banks of a river, but it is not a category 1 school. If they are not category 1 schools, what are?
What we find here is one of those category 1 schools—Geelong Grammar—under this new government formula, not in the top 50-odd schools in this country. I strongly suspect that they would deny they are outside the top 10—and, if you actually listened to one or two of the graduates of Geelong Grammar, they would deny that they are below the top one. On this government's formula, Geelong Grammar is at 217. Why is it? It is for this reason, I say to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, who is at the table—and it does not matter whether the ERI formula needed to be changed or not; anything that is in place for a period of time probably needs reform. But you supported that, right through the 1980s and early nineties. It is because your formula takes no account of the fees paid; $11,000 is irrelevant in your formula. It takes no account of the facilities which are there, facilities such as those at Geelong College: two magnificent ovals, an all-weather synthetic hockey field and tennis, netball, basketball and squash courts. In addition, there is the new recreation centre, featuring a 25-metre indoor swimming pool, with eight lanes for FINA standards, a separate diving pool, a fully equipped gymnasium with a weights room and an aerobic studio. All this was paid for, no doubt, by generous donations. Again, no account was taken of that in your funding formula. No account was taken of any endowment or private income associated with that school. None of that features in the formula in any way whatsoever. That is why the very wealthiest schools in this country are now going from a reasonable contribution, given the fact that their parents pay taxes, of about 13 per cent of average government school costs up to about 40 per cent of government school costs now. All those things are eliminated from the formula.
 They say that they are supported by all in the private sector. I would encourage everybody in the private sector to support whatever government is in—your job is to get on with education. Take what you get and get on with that. Do not worry about the politics; leave it to the politicians. But no person has been more vehemently verballed in this place than has the Deputy Chair of the National Catholic Education Commission, Father Tom Doyle. When Father Tom Doyle was appearing before the Senate committee—remember that he said `We accept the formula of the government' in one of the answers that the Prime Minister gave—he said:
We would still maintain that the SES model in itself is not sufficient and that it needs modification ...
					...			...			...
That is where we talk about SES plus things like resource indicators—
I ask myself whether it was from the old education resource index—
and resource availabilities. The pure SES model does not allow for that anomaly.
We are now seeing how much that anomaly is, because when Tom Doyle was speaking I bet he did not know at that time that the massive amount of funding money that was going in to King's School and the other schools was going in so disproportionately. We have heard of those enormous amounts going in—up to $2,000 extra per pupil for Geelong College—when the Tyndale Christian School at Blacktown got an extra $144; Our Lady of Mercy College, a low fee Catholic school in Parramatta, had no increase whatsoever; Our Lady of Lebanon High School, a low fee Maronite school in nearby Harris Park, where the working class are going, got $163 per pupil; and the St George College in Adelaide got an extra $253, one-eighth of that received by schools like Geelong Grammar. What has been happening here is a massive undermining of the needs based principle, which is the only educational principle on which this distribution of funds ought to be made. It is a deliberate undermining of the principle—an undermining that has been concealed as this minister resisted every effort, until he could do so no longer, to tease out from him what exactly it was he was doing for the wealthiest private schools in this country. 
The Catholic system happens to cover 70 per cent of the young people in private schools here. You say they accept your system: the Catholic school system is out of it. They do not distribute funds and resources—and you have agreed to it—on the basis of your SES model, which they believe is deeply flawed and would result in injustices inside their system if they were to apply it. But you apply it to the other 30 per cent. They have opted out and made a sacrifice to do so—70 per cent of the kids in private schools—but you apply it elsewhere and to the detriment of the public school system and the education system overall. Your policy, Minister, is based on class, not on education. It is based on making up for your bitterness at having lost the battle in the middle of the seventies on the issue of a needs based principle. You have undermined it, you have wasted positively millions of education dollars in doing so, and we are going to pursue you right down to the next election on it.

"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,2000-10-10,"—We can see why the Leader of the Opposition has no credibility in the education debate from that pathetic address. Here we have seen the Leader of the Opposition desperately defending a system which has been abandoned by everyone who was subject to it in the non-government sector. It is very sad to hear the Leader of the Opposition trying to explain category 1 when category 1 has got three months to go and when everyone recognises that category 1 is part of a totally misleading and corrupt system, because that system has been manipulated by Labor again and again over the years. 
This matter of public importance highlights the absolute hypocrisy of the Labor Party. Labor's view of schooling has been to continue to drive up school fees wherever parents make a contribution. The Leader of the Opposition says he cares about the parents at all schools. He only cares until they show that they are prepared to make an effort to build up the resources of those schools, and then, under his funding system, once they have equipped their school, he comes in and slashes their funding. And what do they do? They are forced to put up fees, to narrow access to their school.
That is the way Labor's system worked for 15 years, and it is a sad commentary on the Leader of the Opposition that he stands up in this House and attempts to defend a system which is narrowing access to well resourced schools in the private sector. Let me say it did not exclude everybody from access, because people like Bob Hawke, Paul Keating, Kim Beazley, Simon Crean and Graham Richardson all accessed those schools—even though Labor's policy was pushing up fees. Our policy gives many more parents and families the chance to enjoy the opportunities which the Labor leadership claimed for themselves. Our policy is designed to provide a downward pressure on fees at schools which are well resourced.
The Leader of the Opposition has a very bad record in education. When he was Minister for Education 30 per cent of young people could not read and write properly, and he did nothing about it. When he attempted to devise an education policy at the last election it was so bad that his shadow minister for education resigned and still sits on the back bench. He has no grasp of these issues. If we pursue the logic of what he is saying—that somehow or other we should not be taking into account the needs of families and parents but we should be taking into account the grounds, buildings, gymnasium and swimming pool to decide who is going to get access to those schools—the inevitable consequence of his policy is going to be to narrow access. If ever you want to see a class based education policy, that is it. It means that well resourced schools become the privilege of the rich and the Labor leadership, and everybody else is shut out. 
Let me ask the Leader of the Opposition what he thinks is fair funding for this school; let me just give the Leader of the Opposition an example of a school with significant resources. It is a school with its own purpose-built drama complex, complete with stage, curtains, sound and lighting facilities, and it has a college camp site set on 20 acres of land at Lake Eppalock to provide students with the privilege of an annual camp at the modern ski lodge type facility; two 25-seat minibuses to facilitate the school's extensive camping and sports programs; a modern, well-equipped gymnasium which caters for a wide range of both winter and summer sports, including full-sized basketball and netball courts, three volleyball courts, indoor soccer and cricket, as well as maintained gymnastics equipment; a 20-metre indoor heated pool which allows students to undertake swimming as a subject during PE and sports sessions and is also available to students at lunchtime; and four classrooms full of computers, as well as 12 computers in the library available to students. What is a fair funding level for a school with resources like that? Do you think a school like that sounds like a category 1 school that should be funded at 13.7 per cent of the average government school cost?
—It sounds more like Aquinas.
—More like Aquinas. Let us just see how serious the opposition are about taking resources into account. That school will be funded at 100 per cent of the average cost of educating a child at a government school. In 2004 the parents at that school could receive an estimated $8,172 for every secondary school student compared with the King's School in that year which will receive only $2,500 per student—that is $8,172 versus $2,500. Why is that? Because this school is an example of a well resourced government school. Are the opposition suggesting that this government school should receive—
—They do not like this. Are we saying that the resources of this school should affect the funding for that school? Are we saying that somehow or other this school should be accessed only by the wealthy, or should everyone have access to this school? Of course our view is that there should be the widest possible access. What is this school? Is this school an exceptional school? Is it Melbourne High School? Is it North Sydney Boys High? Probably the member for Calwell might recognise it if he were in the House because this school is Erinbank Secondary College in Broadmeadows in Melbourne's north-west. This is a government school, funded under government schooling policies, which provides outstanding resources to its students.
But the Leader of the Opposition applies a double standard. In the public sector resources have no impact but, if parents build those facilities, that school should be solely for the rich—we should not provide support to those parents. They pay taxes, but he does not even grasp the argument because he is totally out of his depth in this area. He thought it was a private school; he thought it was Aquinas. He did not even recognise it as a government school. That is because an accurate description of the government's policy has never passed his lips. He uses this rhetoric: `This is a policy which rips resources out of government schools.'
Well, what does it do for government schools? Over the next four years this policy provides government schools with an extra $1.4 billion. This year government schools are receiving $402 million more than they received when Labor was in office. Government school funding has gone up 26 per cent under this government. This is a policy that he represents as ripping money out of government schools. This is a man who is living in fantasy land. He seems to spend his evenings sipping chardonnay with the officials of the Australian Education Union who feed him these lines and he comes into the House trying to sell these lines. For heaven's sake, get your staff to do an analysis of what the government's policy is actually about. Try to get some logic into what you are saying about school funding policy. 
The irony is that the Leader of the Opposition gets up in this chamber and says that our funding system is unfair, when everyone who is subject to it says that it is fair and when they are urging the opposition to pass this bill.
—No, they don't!
—I do not know who advises the Leader of the Opposition, but everything he says is so inaccurate that you cannot place any weight on it. Let us go straight to the National Catholic Education Commission. The Leader of the Opposition has just interjected and said that they do not support the government's legislation. The first sentence of the press release issued by the National Catholic Education Commission on the government's bill is the following:
The Senate should pass the State Grants Bill 2000 intact.
`Intact.' Everyone who is subject to the government's funding system says this. The Reverend Tom Doyle said:
... a very good and equitable package ... The new system is fair, open to scrutiny, yet doesn't drain resources away from government schools. 
Father Doyle has read the government's legislation and he is accurate where the Leader of the Opposition is not. He says that it: 
... doesn't drain resources away from government schools. In a caring and democratic Australia, it is vital that we recognise everyone's right to choice.
The right of choice to well resourced schools is not something that is the sole possession of leaders and senior members of the Labor Party—it is the right of other Australians as well, and this bill will give more Australians access to the schools which the Labor Party leadership likes to use for itself. 
Some extraordinary statements—outrageous statements—have been made by Dr Ken Boston, the senior official of the government school system in New South Wales. Dr Boston has presided over, with the Carr government, the most unsuccessful education policy in Australia. If you measure the success of the education policy of those who run the government schools by the attitude of parents, then there is no state system in Australia which has a greater vote of no confidence against it than the New South Wales government system, with 20,000 students leaving that system in the last four years. 
The reasons for this are several. Dr Boston has failed to persuade the Carr government to invest properly in building up the school buildings and the equipment of government schools in New South Wales. There is no state government on mainland Australia that relies so heavily on the Commonwealth government for the money it puts into building up government schools. Government schools in New South Wales have received increases over the last four years of some $121 million from the Commonwealth and yet Dr Boston, supposedly a responsible school official, has written that the Commonwealth government is cutting funding to government schools in New South Wales. That is totally false, and it shows that when you get a fair, objective, non-political basis for funding schools according to the needs of students it goes very deeply to the heart of Labor's left wing ideology.
In the end, they hate parent choice. All that Labor has ever come up with to try to defend public schooling in this country it to stop parents, particularly low income parents, choosing the school that they want for their children. They have not bothered about raising literacy standards, they do not worry about proper reporting to parents, they do not worry about broadening the senior curriculum with proper vocational courses. All they say is, `We'll protect you union officials in the government school sector by stopping people leaving the sector. We'll shut the doors; we'll stop new schools from being properly funded at their level of need. We won't fund the Catholic parish schools at their level of need. We won't have an objective system.' 
—Their fair system, as he said, funded Loreto Kirribilli at 40 per cent of the cost of educating a child at a government school. It gets $2 million more under their system than it gets from us, and yet they say that our system is unfair. This is the most important and generous funding legislation for Australian schools that any federal government has ever brought down. It is a massive investment in the future of young Australians.

"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,2000-10-10,"—I would like to focus on four aspects of this debate: the historic precedents for advantaging the already privileged, real choice, real equity and the real response of the non-government sector. History and precedence have lessons for this minister and this corrupt oligarchy that calls itself the Howard government. This Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has just given another truth-defying exposition on advantaging the already privileged at the cost of the disadvantaged in the public sector. This minister for education—this minister for doublespeak in true Orwellian terms, the dodgy brother of the Australian parliament—is, as you would expect, an entirely predictable fellow. His strategy is truth reversal. Simply state an untruth and repeat it over and over again.
A letter in the Australian newspaper today said that David Kemp is to statistics what George Bush is to pronunciation—got it in one, Andrew Cave of Queensland. However, as Lewis Lapham pointed out in his essay `Waiting for the barbarians,' oligarchies like the Howard government have, throughout history, changed from ideals of virtue and fairness to concentration on advantaging the already privileged. There is nothing new in this minister, it has happened throughout history and it is happening now.
Sooner or later—
Lapham writes—
men become pigs ... Aristotle likened the character change to that of `the prosperous fool', a man or class of men—
like the frontbench of the government, half of whom went to these category 1 schools—
so bewildered by the faith in money that they imagine there is nothing it cannot buy. Once the oligarchy has been made stupid with insolence and greed it is only a matter of time ...
But more of that later. Aristotle of course derived his understanding of politics from his studies of Greek society in the fourth and fifth centuries BC, which encompassed the rise and fall of the Periclean aristocracy. As Lapham explains, the oligarchy at the time gave more and more to the already privileged—the `prosperous fools'—of Athens. The oligarchy that ruled Athens divided the city into rich and poor and, as a consequence, was unable to withstand the barbarians from the mountains of Macedon. As an aside, Aristotle mentions a faction of especially reactionary oligarchs who took a vow of selfishness by the swearing of a solemn oath:
I will be an adversary of the people—
that is, the Commonwealth—
and in the council I will do it all the evil I can.
Isn't that just you, Minister? A quote from thousands of years ago captures you and your government to a tee. Include the Prime Minister and the cabinet and what an evil little oligarchy we have. And of course there are plenty of other historical precedents, for instance, Roman emperor Honorius on 10 August in the year 410. Do you remember him, when King Alaric and 100,000 Visigoths came down with their bronzed battering rams to the walls of Rome? The Catholic popes of the late Renaissance, Louis XVI of France, Tsar Nicholas of tsarist Russia, Fritz von Papen in the then soon to be Nazi Germany: there is nothing original in this, Minister. In four short years you have transformed yourself: you have gone from the election platform of governing for all Australians—which you went to the people on in 1996—to openly supporting the privileged to the detriment of the polis, the public.
This minister and this Prime Minister seem extremely keen on reversing the accepted concepts of choice and equity. Perhaps their arguments might have a smidgin of credibility if in fact choice and equity were a viable choice in an increasing rather than a decreasing number of Australian families. In this so-called strong Australian economy we are fast approaching the rich/poor divide noted in the failed oligarchies of the past. On top of seven per cent unemployed we have seven per cent underemployed, seven per cent hidden unemployed, seven per cent in full-time work but who are living in poverty and 22 per cent of our work force casually and precariously employed. That adds up to 50 per cent of the available work force. Are $11,000 fees a choice for these families? I think not. 
This minister must live in a cocooned world, oblivious to what is happening around him. Like the United States, we are increasing the number of low skill and low productivity jobs. What is revealed about choice in the United States is mirrored in this country. Over the last 20 years the number of people earning high wages has fallen from 28 per cent to 21 per cent; the number of people earning middle ranging wages—those aspirational voters—has fallen from 37 per cent to 16 per cent; and the number of those on low wages has grown from 35 per cent to 63 per cent. This information is from Dr Linda Barrington, a labour economist, of the Conference Board. Extending choice, Minister? Codswallop! Bulldust! Just plain and ordinary misrepresentation of the truth. That is your game.
And what about equity for families whose children have debilitating conditions like cerebral palsy, who require attention for 24 hours a day? What about equity for families of children whose behaviour is so extreme and dysfunctional that it wrecks relationships and physically destroys homes? What about equity for families of children who are at risk of committing suicide? What about equity for families who are at risk of severe substance abuse? What about equity for children who are at risk of being physically, sexually and emotionally abused? And what about equity for children who go to school hungry, come home hungry and who are inadequately fed, clothed and housed? Can't you see that in your own state? You see it in the main streets of Melbourne. Minister, is the giving of millions of dollars to the most privileged people in the country, whilst ignoring your fellow Australian families in desperate need your definition of equity? The intent of this minister is evil.
This minister gets up in this chamber and states that his model of SES funding for the non-government school has the overwhelming support of the private school community—that is what you said just a while ago. But it ain't necessarily so. Jeff Kennett used to say that about business in Victoria until they were sick of his high-handed, selective, dictatorial exclusions, and they worked to remove him much sooner than any pundit ever predicted. 
I come from South Australia where there has generally been a productive relationship between public and private schools; it has been a good relationship. That is doomed by the actions of this government—and they are the words of the non-government sector. I have had many principals write to me supporting the passage of the states grants bill and, as you would expect, parroting your words from second reading speeches—with one exception, and I will come to him later. I decided to ring them instead of writing because, as a former school principal, I know many of these people. I have worked with them; I have known some of these people for over 30 years. All but two took my call. They begged me not to name them or their schools, except one. I agreed I would never do it, but nevertheless I wrote down pertinent parts of the discussions, of the phone calls. Without exception none—not one—would defend or support the outlandish funding for the elite schools. Not one. All agreed—they are not stupid—that it was just a tricky transfer from public school funding via the enrolment benchmark adjustment. That is not what you are telling this parliament, Minister. 
And what else did they say? They said: `Pushing the envelope too far'; `I fear the inevitable backlash which unfortunately for us will have just cause'; `Advantaging non-government schools with funds from a discredited financial arrangement like the EBA and then denying it does not come from public schools is indefensible'; `I am very comfortable'—in my school—`financially. I am very, uncomfortable morally'; `My parent body would sack me if they knew my real views'; `Dr Kemp presents arguments that are a real threat to Australian democracy as we know it'; `Rewarding the elite schools at the obvious expense of public education will fool no-one'; `It encourages all to play a game. Unfortunately some non-government schools are better equipped to play the game than others'; `To advantage the privileged against the needy is to deny God's teachings'; `The Bible tells us we cannot worship God and money at the same time'; `This funding regime will push the more difficult to educate children'—the real test of competent teachers—`to poorer and less resourced schools'. And we should all worry about that. And, finally, `There is no encouragement at all for schools to have low fees'. That is not an overwhelming endorsement, Minister. There was one principal who did not want his comments on the record, and I seek leave to table his comments without identifying his name and his school. 
Leave not granted.
—Okay, I will read it. It states:
The rich-poor divide. There is no encouragement for schools to have low fees at all; only for the easier to educate from poor areas. There is indeed incentive for schools to charge as much as they can from the community they serve, highlighting the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. By charging more, their government funding is not affected. 
When silly little oligarchies like this minister and this government redefine the virtues of equity and choice as evil intent, they will suffer the same fate as every other miserable oligarchy throughout the world.

"Lloyd, Jim, MP",LP,2000-10-10,"—I am pleased to rise on this MPI this afternoon and I hope that my comments will be more relevant to the parents and students of the Australian community than those of the previous speaker, the member for Port Adelaide. I am very angry about the attack the opposition have waged on public schools and non-government schools in Australia. They are the ones who are divisive. They are the ones who are undermining the confidence in public schools throughout Australia. They have embarked on a campaign of misinformation, untruths and hypocrisy in these arguments. When I came into this parliament nearly five years ago, I expected that debate would be well researched, based on factual information and based on what people truly believed when they came into this parliament. But this debate that the opposition have waged on education is nothing about those principles; they have no principles. They have used misinformation and untruths throughout. The facts are that the Commonwealth government is spending more on government schools than ever before—these are facts—that Commonwealth spending on government schools will rise by 21 per cent over the next four years, and that this year the Commonwealth government is spending $402 million more on government schools than in 1996, an increase of 26 per cent. Yet you hear the opposition saying that we are ripping money out of the government schools. All those comments are doing is undermining the confidence of parents and teachers in government schools. The school system in Australia is a good system. All that the opposition comments do is undermine the confidence in government schools. They also undermine the confidence the teachers have in government schools. Government schools are privileged to have many hardworking and dedicated teachers, but they never get any support from the likes of the Labor opposition.
One of the things which is dishonest in the opposition's argument is when they compare dollar figures about extra funding that goes into government schools and non-government schools. It is one of the things that the shadow minister often likes to do—that is, to compare dollar figures—and the Prime Minister picked him up on it yesterday, saying it was a totally dishonest argument. You must remember that state governments are the main funders of government schools; it is their responsibility. The state governments fund 85 per cent of the cost of running government schools. If we have a problem with government schools, as we do in many areas of New South Wales, we should be talking to and working with the state governments and finding out what the problems are. The Labor opposition should be asking the state governments, particularly in New South Wales, what they are doing to resource government schools. There is a problem in many areas of New South Wales with resources for government schools, but it is not for lack of funding from the Commonwealth government. What is the New South Wales government doing to resource government schools? That is a question I never hear from the Labor opposition in the federal parliament. 
The two million government school students in this country are supported by an annual budget of combined Commonwealth-state government money of around $13.4 billion. The one million non-government students are supported by public funding of about $3.7 billion. We have two well-funded and well-resourced systems of education in Australia, and that is something the Labor opposition should be trying to support. They should be looking at ways to encourage the system that has worked well for Australia, not trying to divide the community and run down particularly government schools. I mentioned the New South Wales state government. They certainly have not answered any of the questions we have put forward about resourcing and why the money that the Commonwealth is providing is not going to the government schools in New South Wales. There are many schools in my electorate that are desperately under resourced, and it is not for lack of funding from the Commonwealth government. We cannot get answers out of the New South Wales government.
I want to make some comments, as the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs did earlier, about this outrageous article in the Sydney Morning Herald of Tuesday, 10 October written by Dr Ken Boston, who is a public servant and Director-General of Education and Training in New South Wales. He should be the one asking questions of the New South Wales government about where the funding is for New South Wales schools. I understand that he has distributed this article to all the schools in New South Wales and asked the teachers and headmasters to circulate it. The article itself is totally untrue. Dr Ken Boston wrote: 
Under the EBA, the Commonwealth reduces funding for government schools as the proportion of enrolments in non-government schools increases. NSW has already lost $21 million as a result ...
This is a total untruth coming from the Director-General of Education and Training in New South Wales. He is prepared to go out and continue to produce these untruths about money coming from state schools and being put into private schools. He should be asking questions of the New South Wales government. There is a lot of support in the community for this new proposal. I quote from Heather and David McAlpine from Victoria:
As a family already electing to educate our children in an Independent School, we note with interest the imminent presentation to the Senate of the proposed SES education funding legislation. We consider the successful passage of this proposed legislation as absolutely essential in order to retain at least some choice in education for families in regional Australia.
That is just one quote from the quotes of many people who support the passage of this legislation. The Labor Party have waged an outrageous campaign of misinformation, trying to divide the community with class warfare. The Labor Party do not seem to want to give parents the choice of how they might give their children what they perceive as the best education, whether that be in a government school or a non-government school. The ultimate hypocrisy of the Labor Party argument on this issue is that at the end of the day I understand they are going to support this legislation. So they run this argument of misinformation throughout the community, they try to stir up concern and distrust in the government system throughout the community, all for what they believe is short-term political gain, yet they are going to support this legislation. We have sat here day in and day out over the last couple of weeks and listened to them. They get up here with their indignation about class warfare, about how they believe government schools are not being correctly funded, using facts and figures that really are not facts and figures—they are just figments of their imagination—twisting figures around so they can build up this so-called case. But they have no basis for the case they are mounting. At the end of the day, it just shows their hypocrisy.  
I believe that Australia is in one of the strongest positions it has been in for many generations, and it has only been as a result of the Howard coalition government. The reason we are in such a strong position is the reforms and policies we have put forward. The Labor opposition have never supported our reforms and our policies. But have they put up alternative policies? Have they put up a different direction? Have they looked at the facts? No, we have always had negative carping and harping about blocking what we are trying to do which is right for this country. In this debate about education they have lost the plot: they are not concerned about parents and children. They are not concerned about the quality of education in this country. The quality of education in this country is the future of this country. Instead of being divisive about it, instead of trying to wage a class warfare, they should be out there trying to support what is the best policy to provide a good system of education in this country, the best policy that can deliver the education that is the future of this country for our children, the best policy that will allow the parents of this country to make a choice about how they want their children to be educated to get the best possible education so that this country can go forward and continue to be the strong country that it is, and the best policy that will give the children of this country the best education that they can possibly have. The Labor Party will be shown up for the hypocrites that they are.

"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2000-10-10,"—The opposition supports the Commonwealth Electoral Legislation (Provision of Information) Bill 2000. We understand that the Australian Electoral Commission has been giving departments a range of electoral roll information in electronic form for some time. Following advice from the Solicitor-General in June of this year, it appears that the AEC has been doing so quite unlawfully. Not only did the Solicitor-General's advice force the Prime Minister to abort his GST direct mail letter which was to go to all households in Australia; it also made the AEC review its past and future handling of the Commonwealth electoral roll. This bill arises from that legal advice.
Unfortunately, the government has refused opposition requests to see the Solicitor-General's advice, so we are unable to see to what extent the bill does actually reflect the advice. Nevertheless, given that the Prime Minister's letter was embarrassingly withdrawn—perhaps humiliatingly withdrawn might be an even more appropriate description—and the Australian Taxation Office returned the electronic roll to the Electoral Commission, we can safely deduce that the Solicitor-General advised the AEC that it could not give the Taxation Office the roll in electronic form for the purposes of a mail-out, as it had done previously.
The opposition's understanding is that the AEC could only provide elector information in electronic format to departments, if permitted purposes for the use of that information had been prescribed. At the time of the Prime Minister's GST letter fiasco, no such permitted purposes had been prescribed. Therefore, in broad terms, the opposition supports this piece of legislation because, first, it should resolve any questions about previous use, by agencies, of electronically supplied elector information; second, it should preclude arguments about the admissibility of evidence in court which had been gathered relying on the use of such elector information; and, third, it should resolve any questions about the future use of that information. On that basis, the opposition supports the bill.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL LEGISLATION (PROVISION OF INFORMATION) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2000-10-10,"—The matters before us appear, on first glance, quite procedural and, as outlined by the member for Melbourne, are necessary to address some legality associated with what had been standard practice: the use of the electronic version of the electoral roll by various agencies such as the National Crime Authority, Federal Police and Customs. They are agencies which have made use of the electronic form of the information which underpins the electoral roll upon which we all rely as members of parliament. I must say also that members of parliament themselves have come to rely upon being able to use this database of electors in a way which assists them in communications with their constituents and helps them to keep a note of those communications in a readily accessible form. I am sure that all members in this place would welcome the passage of the Commonwealth Electoral Legislation (Provision of Information) Bill 2000, including its speedy passage through the Senate, so that we can get on with the business of accurately representing our constituents and recording our activities on their behalf on those databases which we do maintain in a very confidential way. 
But this matter also raises the concern held by so many people in Queensland about the integrity of the electoral processes taking place in that state. Given that the Queensland electoral roll and the Commonwealth electoral roll have been hand in glove for about 15 years now, it is important for us in this place to reflect upon just what is unfolding in Queensland at the moment in the form of the Shepherdson inquiry into allegations regarding the illegal obtaining of enrolments for the purposes of the Australian Labor Party and its preselection processes and other matters.
Apparently, the Labor Party in Queensland has the requirement of your having to be enrolled in an electorate in which you are participating in a preselection ballot. As a result of this, there have been some vigorous efforts by the Labor Party basically to rort the roll for its internal processes. It has also been a convenient factor when it comes to elections which have been taking place in various seats. As I said to the parliament last week, this is not a matter which is isolated only in the region of Townsville. Two of my constituents were named in connection with the Shepherdson inquiry as being key and keen participants in this particular activity.
I think it is very important to know the following details. The member for Woodridge in the Queensland parliament, Mike Kaiser, a former State Secretary of the Labor Party, has been mentioned in dispatches. The party returning officer, Joan Budd—who is the wife of former member for Redlands John Budd—told the Shepherdson inquiry yesterday, according to the Courier-Mail, that she had told State Secretary Kaiser two forged Electoral Commission white cards had been used in an attempt to enrol ALP members for a preselection vote in the East Brisbane council ward in 1993. The member for Griffith would share my concern about this matter, given that we have this ward covering both of our electorates. This means the Labor Party in 1993 was involved in rorting the electoral roll for the purposes of internal matters, which then became a convenient matter come election time. If Mr Kaiser knew about these matters when he was state secretary, it begs the question as to why two other former state secretaries of the Labor Party also did not know about these matters and why they did not do something about them.
—Who were they?
—Those particular people—in reply to the interjection of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration—were the current Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie, and the current member for Lilley, Mr Swan. Both were state secretaries of the Australian Labor Party at a point in time when this rorting occurred. (Quorum formed)
The dogs have been barking for the member for the Northern Territory ever since that famous dog show he hired a VIP to go to a few years ago. I am surprised how sensitive the Australian Labor Party are on this matter. I would have thought that members opposite would have been interested in democracy and ensuring that the integrity of our electoral roll was never under any doubt. If those opposite want to keep raising quorums and points of order all afternoon, don't you worry, because we have enough material here to fill a thousand adjournment speeches and we will keep it coming.
Let me tell you that the facts do not just rest with the relationships of John and Joan Budd, Mr Kaiser, Mr Beattie and Mr Swan. Lindesay Jones, the former assistant state secretary, was also one of the people who knew about the fraud claims that are becoming obvious because of the Shepherdson inquiry. His wife wanted to be a senator for Queensland. If the AWU had not got her, she might have got up as a Socialist Left candidate. Then there is Linda Lavarch, who is now an MLA for the seat of Kurwongbah. Lavarch might be a name familiar to those who have been in this chamber for a while. Yes, she is the wife of the former Attorney-General of Australia, and she was also named as the recipient of a letter in October 1993 from then Assistant State Secretary Jones concerned about unprecedented electoral stacking in the ward of East Brisbane. So Mrs Budd has dropped in a few more people.
The relationships become pretty interesting. The current councillor for East Brisbane ward is Catherine Bermingham. Her brother Lee was named in proceedings last week—he is my constituent; in fact Catherine is also a constituent of mine—as being one of the key and keen vote rorters in the Australian Labor Party in Queensland. Then we hear that Jim Elder might have in fact been told about this. Jim Elder is the Deputy Premier of Queensland. In fact, Mrs Budd said that she had told the Deputy Premier, Jim Elder, that former AWU faction member Lee Bermingham had allegedly asked Brisbane party member Ross Musgrove—the brother of Grant Musgrove, the member for Springwood in the Queensland parliament—to put his numbers into Mundingburra for the 1996 election. That was the supplementary election that was ordered following the doubts cast over 15 ballot papers at the real election that took place in 1995. As history reflects, as a result of those fraudulent ballots, a new election was called, the seat of Mundingburra was won by the Liberal Party and the state government of Queensland changed to a very effective coalition government, although short-lived. So it is interesting to know that Mrs Budd interpreted this request as being to transfer Labor members onto the roll. This morning's Courier-Mail states: 
Ms Budd said she believed Mr Bermingham was the person responsible “because of talk I heard around”.
But it seems to go even further than that. The article states:
She also said Mr Elder, ALP president Don Brown, and party organiser Linda Holliday—
a former councillor in the Brisbane City Council, the darling of the Socialist Left and the partner of Queensland government minister Mr Stephen Robertson—
did not believe it.
She said that they did not believe any of these allegations. So they all sat on it. The points are really quite interesting when you start to consider all the relationships between all the people. It is not just factional business we are talking about in the Shepherdson inquiry; it is a family concern. It is a family business. So what did all of these people do about this? Essentially, they sat on their hands and did nothing. If it had not been for the fact that Karen Ehrmann and a couple of others had got caught and Ehrmann had rolled over—and became a Labor rat, I guess—this part of the Labor culture may not have been revealed in the sort of detail that we have heard.
All of this raises questions about a number of interesting people in important positions in Queensland: the Parliamentary Secretary to the Premier, Mike Reynolds, and Paul Lucas, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Criminal Justice Committee. The parliamentary committee which oversights the CJC was also mentioned in dispatches yesterday with regard to Mr Lucas's preselection for the Lytton by-election. Mr Lucas said that he had not been interviewed by the CJC on the matter, which makes me wonder just how important the parliamentary inquiry at the federal level is now becoming. Then there is Gary Fenlon, the member for Greenslopes and Chairman of the Legal, Constitutional and Administrative Review Committee. One of their current inquiries is into the minimisation of electoral fraud. We now have Caesar judging Caesar in the Queensland parliament. I make the point again: the parliamentary inquiry being conducted by a subcommittee of this parliament has never been more important when we consider what is occurring in Queensland.
Madam Deputy Speaker, let me tell you about Stephen Robertson. Stephen Robertson is the member for Sunnybank, which includes part of my electorate. He is the Minister for Emergency Services, but his nickname in the 1980s was the `little bagman' in the United Firefighters Union. The 1991 Cooke inquiry into union corruption in Queensland said that the ballot he presided over as the state secretary of that union in 1985 was—and I quote from page 76, section 3.12.12 of the Cooke inquiry—`fraudulently rigged'. So here we have in Queensland key and important parts of the current government who have been involved in this Labor culture of rigging ballots. Councillor Catherine Bermingham and others in the Brisbane City Council certainly have more to answer for. I am also left wondering about the effects of—

—Another coward's quorum, is it?
—If you want to call me a coward, get outside and say it. I draw your attention to the state of the House, Madam Deputy Speaker.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask the member for Batman to withdraw that allegation. That is outrageous. It is unparliamentary, and he has to withdraw it.
 (Mrs De-Anne Kelly)—I did not hear the comment myself.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I have drawn your attention to the state of the House. I am asking you to act in accordance with the standing orders.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, there was an allegation made about the member for Moreton which I now ask you to direct the member for Batman to withdraw.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, if it would assist you, I am simply quoting from this morning's Courier-Mail. If the member for Batman is so sensitive, I think we should just get on with the business of the House.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, you are obligated to act in accordance with my request. I have drawn your attention to the state of the House.
—I will read the standing orders, thank you. There has been a question raised about unparliamentary language.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, if I understand what this is about, it is the fact that there was an allegation about this person—
—Have you a point of order?
—Yes, I have. It was not unparliamentary. It is a term which is often used in this parliament about the question of cowardice. He has yelled out `coward' across this chamber several times this afternoon, with no point of order taken by the opposition. This person has used the parliament this afternoon to make attacks on individuals in this place.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, standing and sessional order 76 says:
All imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on Members shall be considered highly disorderly.
The member for Batman made an outrageous allegation against the member for Moreton, which was heard on this side of the House. I do ask that you reflect on that and ask him to withdraw those words. If he does not, he should be suspended from the House.
—I did not hear the comment, but the member for the Northern Territory has told us now what it was. It does seem to be an unparliamentary comment and I would ask the member for Batman to withdraw it.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, the comment I made was identical to the comment made by the member for Moreton. He went first; I went second. If you act consistently, then I will act.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, the reflection on the chair by the member for Batman is outrageous and I ask him to withdraw that as well.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, it was not a reflection on the chair; it was a statement of fact. You did not hear me and I assume you did not hear the member for Moreton. I have drawn your attention to the facts. The member for Moreton made the comments about cowardice in the chamber first. I responded to him and asked him to make the comments outside this House. It is tit for tat. If you did not hear either, then the record is square.
—The member for Moreton, is that in fact so?
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I am not going to play childish games like the member for Batman. I can simply say to you that I did reflect upon his cowardice in continuing to call quorums and to make frivolous points of order, and this is exactly what he is trying to do. He is afraid of hearing the facts associated with the corruption of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland. What the member for Batman is doing this afternoon is a disgrace. 
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I take you back to my original point: I draw your attention to the state of the House. You did not hear the intervention by the member for Moreton, which preceded my intervention, nor did you hear my intervention. You should therefore act on the request that I made, and I draw your attention to the state of the House again. There was no reflection on you, and the exchange between the member for Moreton and me stands between us two.

—It is a disgrace to think that the union heavyweights opposite have decided to spend the whole afternoon denying the possibility of proper discussion about the fraud that has been committed by Labor Party personalities in Queensland. They will keep trying to silence us, but they will not silence the people.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2000-10-10,"—Initially, I would like to express the concern that I believe the people of Australia would have about the way in which the Labor Party sought to muzzle the member for Moreton as he outlined what does appear to be institutionalised electoral fraud in Queensland. 
This bill contains provisions which will resolve any questions about past use of electronically supplied elector information by prescribed Commonwealth government agencies and authorities, being prescribed authorities as listed in schedule 2 of the Electoral and Referendum Regulations and as defined in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The bill also contains provisions which will avoid any uncertainty surrounding the admissibility of evidence in court which has been gathered relying in some way on electronically supplied elector information. The bill will also resolve any questions about future use of elector information that was supplied electronically and which has been incorporated into prescribed authorities' information systems and from which it would be impracticable to identify and/or remove the information. The coalition does indeed welcome the support of the Australian Labor Party with respect to the Commonwealth Electoral Legislation (Provision of Information) Bill 2000.
The member for Moreton, however, in his contribution pointed out the very real concerns and question marks which now apply against the names of Premier Beattie, Joan Budd, Lindesay Jones, Linda Lavarch, Catherine Bermingham, Deputy Premier Elder, Linda Holliday, Ross Musgrove and the member for Lilley. He referred to factional business in the Australian Labor Party being `family business'. He referred to the culture of Labor, and we are of course seeing daily in the Shepherdson inquiry the unveiling of Labor practices and procedures which most Queensland residents would find utterly abhorrent. We have seen questions raised about the parliamentary secretary to the Premier, Mike Reynolds; Paul Lucas, Chairman of the CJC; and Gary Fenlon, Chairman of the Legal, Constitutional and Administrative Review Committee who, most amazingly, is handling the inquiry into the minimisation of electoral fraud.
The member for Moreton referred to the `little bagman' in the United Firefighters Union, Stephen Robertson, the Minister for Emergency Services. He also referred to the comments made by eminent QC Marshall Cooke in his inquiry into union corruption when he said that the ballot presided over by the then office bearer in the United Firefighters Union, Stephen Robertson—now Minister for Emergency Services—was fraudulently rigged. 
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I understood that the debate was about the Commonwealth Electoral Legislation (Provision of Information) Bill 2000. My point of order goes to the question of relevance. The issues being raised by the parliamentary secretary are not related to the bill.
—Resume your seat. The reality is that other occupants of the chair have allowed a wide ranging debate, and I will continue the precedent set by the previous deputy speaker.
—Part of my role in summing up this legislation on behalf of the government is to refer to the speeches—erudite or otherwise—made by honourable members. I was simply referring to matters in the Hansard which were raised by the member for Moreton in his contribution to the Commonwealth Electoral Legislation (Provision of Information) Bill 2000. The member for Moreton also referred to Catherine Bermingham. Indeed, questions must now be asked about the Brisbane City Council. Day by day, Queenslanders remain fascinated as they turn the pages of the Courier-Mail and are appalled by what they see as institutionalised electoral fraud in the Australian Labor Party. As the current secretary to the Australian Labor Party, Cameron Milner, suggested, the ALP could well take water at the time of the next election. I want to make a prediction that the Beattie Labor government will be swept from office whenever the next state election is held.
But, returning to the specific provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Legislation (Provision of Information) Bill 2000, I wanted to point out that the Australian Electoral Commission had been providing a number of other prescribed authorities with electoral roll data under the provisions of subsection 91(10) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. As the act does not provide for end use restrictions on the data supplied to prescribed authorities under this legislation, the AEC used the privacy principles under the Privacy Act 1988 for guidance, together with a safeguard agreement made between the AEC and the requesting agency.
After questioning at Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee estimates hearings on 24 May of this year the AEC sought additional legal advice in written form to confirm previous legal advice from the office of the Australian Government Solicitor so that it could provide elector information to prescribed authorities in electronic format. Despite several legal opinions since 1991 that continued to advise that the AEC could lawfully provide this information, the Solicitor-General advised on 8 June 2000 that the AEC could not provide prescribed authorities with the electoral roll in electronic format under subsection 91(10) but could do so under paragraph 91(4A)(e).
However, the supply of the electoral roll in electronic format under paragraph 91(4A)(e) would require a regulation under subsection 91A(1) in order for the prescribed authorities to be able to use the information. No regulations had been made to that effect at that time. However, whilst prescribing regulations would authorise future use by prescribed authorities of the elector information supplied in electronic format, regulations could not be used to authorise past use. This can only be done by enacting legislation. On 8 June 2000 the Attorney-General issued a media release indicating that the government would seek to rectify, through legislation, regulation or other appropriate action, the past use by prescribed authorities of elector information received in electronic format.
There was also concern that prescribed authorities may have difficulty in progressing cases which had in some way relied upon elector information supplied electronically by the Australian Electoral Commission. Without the proposed amendments, there is a possibility that previous actions taken by prescribed authorities as a result of the use of elector information could be called into question and that challenges to prosecutions may result in lengthier trials and an increase in the number of appeals. The government's legal advice is that such challenges and appeals are not likely to succeed. However, they could result in an unnecessary waste of court time and legal resources. It is therefore preferable that any doubt in relation to the past use of elector information by prescribed authorities be removed. These amendments will fulfil that purpose. The proposed amendments will also authorise the future use of elector information previously supplied on tape or disk that has been incorporated into a prescribed authority's information systems from which it would be impracticable to identify and/or remove the elector information supplied by the Australian Electoral Commission. This will ensure that future actions taken by prescribed authorities using such material cannot be called into question. 
On 26 June 2000, cabinet agreed that the AEC should prepare legislation which would resolve any questions about past use of the electronically supplied elector information and also resolve any questions about unavoidable future uses of the information. The uses to which the prescribed authorities can now put electronically supplied elector information are set out in the Electoral and Referendum Regulations made on 25 July 2000. Members on both sides of the House support this legislation. It is vital that it proceed to the other place tomorrow. I have a great deal of pleasure in commending the bill to the House.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2000-10-10,"—I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate this afternoon. I am indebted to the Parliamentary Library for their very informative Bills Digest, which is up to their normal very professional standard. The purpose of this bill, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Tallies and Picnic Days) Bill 2000, is to remove tallies from allowable award matters and, as a result, from federal awards. The effect of the bill will be to narrow the scope of matters which federal awards can address. Tallies—which are, as you would be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, from your background in the rural areas of North Queensland, a form of piece rate or a payment of results remuneration system—have been included in the meat industry awards. The bill also prevents a union Picnic Day clause being considered as an allowable award matter, although union picnic days are not currently prescribed as allowable award matters. The bill also creates a six-month interim period from the bill's date of commencement during which parties to an award can apply to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to vary the award so that it provides only for allowable matters. At the end of this period, non-allowable matters cease to have effect. At the end of the interim period, the commission must review each award to ensure that it contains only allowable award matters.
These issues—that is, the removal of tallies and union picnic days from this legislation—as I am sure you are aware, Madam Deputy Speaker—were canvassed in the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999. That bill was referred to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Committee for inquiry in August 1999. The committee reported on the bill on 29 November 1999. Schedule 6 of the More Jobs, Better Pay bill proposed removing some matters from allowable award matters while making the following non-allowable: minimum or maximum hours of work; transfers between work locations; transfers from one type of employment to another, for example part-time to full-time; training and education; recording of work times; accident make-up pay; union representation for dispute settling procedures; union picnic days; limitation of numbers of employees of certain types; and tallies.
As an aside on this question of training and education, I am advised that the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs visited Groote Eylandt recently, and was involved in discussing with people on Groote Eylandt, Aboriginal people in particular, employment and training issues. He visited, as I understand it, a group of Aboriginal trainees employed by the mining company on Groote Eylandt. He was informed that their training time was paid for by the company. He—in the presence of those being trained—said that they should be paying for their own training. I guess that sums up this minister in relation to the extent to which he is prepared to go to deny Australians protection not only through awards but also through the provision of entitlements, in this case by an employer, to appropriate training so that the workers are sufficiently skilled up to take jobs that are available within the workplace. 
To date, as you would be aware, the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999 has not passed the Senate. What we have seen here is what the minister said we could expect, and that is that he would reintroduce parts of the bill in bite-sized chunks. Removing Picnic Day as an allowable public holiday will reduce award public holiday entitlements. Its effect will be to reduce public holidays from 11 to 10. The effect of making union picnic days non-allowable will be to reduce the public holiday entitlements of workers covered by awards that include picnic days. Instead of receiving the 11 standard public holidays determined by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission those workers will receive 10.
I have seen a number of awards, and I am thinking this afternoon of the Storage Services General Award 1999 and its public holidays clause. If you read that award, it contains Picnic Day as a holiday. The award is consistent with the commission's public holidays test case standard. All workers covered by the award, whether union members or not, are entitled to the union picnic day public holiday. If this day is to be deleted no alternative day will apply, leading to a reduction in public holidays from 11 to 10. Workers covered by awards with a union picnic day public holiday will be penalised by the loss of one public holiday by this bill merely because one of the public holidays is called union picnic day. Other workers will suffer no reduction in comparison.
I might say that union picnic day is very important to many Australians. It is worth while pointing out that in the case of the Northern Territory, as you may be aware, Picnic Day has been legislated for by the Northern Territory Assembly. The Northern Territory has a Picnic Day provision in its public holidays act. Picnic Day is on the first Monday in August and is included as part of the 11 public holidays. You may not be aware that this Picnic Day in Darwin on the first Monday in August is in fact on Darwin Cup Day. Some time ago my colleague Senator Crossin said that the government was proposing to remove this holiday from the calendar. That was denied by the CLP in the Northern Territory and by the spokesperson for the government. It is now writ large in this legislation that the government's very intention is to delete this Picnic Day from awards thus ensuring that the number of public holidays in the Northern Territory is reduced from 11 to 10 and by the way ensuring that Darwin Cup Day will no longer be held on picnic day or a public holiday.
I am not sure whether the minister has been the bearer of these good tidings, as he would see it, to the Northern Territory government, the Northern Territory racing industry, the Northern Territory tourism industry and Northern Territory hospitality industry. But I would say that this is just an indication of the consequences of what I regard as a very ill thought out and inappropriate proposal in this legislation. It also needs to be understood that in most awards the standard public holiday award clause also provides for the facility for an employer and a majority of employees to take an alternative day in lieu of the specified standard public holidays. Substitution agreements can also be made involving individual employees.
Other standard public holidays and awards include the Queen's Birthday. You will recall that part of the argument for the reduction of union picnic days is the level of unionisation within the Australian work force. The view has been put that, because the level of unionisation has diminished over the years, there is no longer a call to have this public holiday. I am sure none of us would propose—certainly I would not—that it is appropriate to remove the Queen's Birthday from the list of official holidays. But how many Australians pay any regard to the Queen or the royal family on the Queen's Birthday public holiday? Indeed, if you were to ask Australian workers what they celebrate on the Queen's Birthday public holiday, I am damn sure they would say, `Not the Queen.' 
All workers are entitled to that holiday, even republicans. Most of the workers that I am aware of—certainly in my electorate—would fall into the category of republicans. We know that non-Christian people are entitled to Easter and Christmas holidays. Even the minister himself, as much as he opposes unions, would—if he were covered by an award—be entitled to Labour Day. I think the point needs to be made here that this is unnecessary and entirely inappropriate. You would have to accord some merit to the argument that this is all about the ideological prerogative that the minister believes he has in determining the nature of industrial relations in this country. You have to say that, if this is the way the government proposes to deal with these issues, the only people who are going to be disadvantaged by it are Australian workers.
Whilst the minister perennially parades into this place, going on about what he is doing to improve the lot of Australian workers, we know that, as I pointed out earlier in my contribution, his attitudes towards Australian workers do not reflect the gratitude he would want them to have because, clearly, what he is about is stripping away award conditions and entitlements and ensuring that Australian workers are, in fact, worse off. I have had cause to mention these issues in this place before. 
It is also worth pointing out some other things, and I thank the Parliamentary Library for this information. There are a number of commission decisions relevant to picnic days and public holidays. The commission in its public holidays test case in 1994 determined that federal award employees throughout Australia are entitled to a minimum safety net of 11 public holidays per year. Easter Saturday was found to be a public holiday. The applications were made in response to the intention of the Victorian government to reduce the number of public holidays in 1993. The commission named 10 public holidays and provided that one other day be specified according to state, territory or locality or on some other basis—such as an award picnic day.
In 1997, another full bench of the commission was required to consider the continuation of the union picnic days within the requirements of award simplification or, more accurately, under the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Act's transitional provisions. In what became known as the award simplification decision, the commission held that union picnic days had been considered as public holidays for decades. The decision says:
The employers and the Joint Governments submitted that union picnic days are not gazetted holidays or holidays which the public in general enjoys. Against these considerations is the fact that union picnic days have been included in the public holiday provisions of awards for decades in a large number of industries.
There are numerous decisions of the Commission and its predecessor, the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, in which a union picnic day has been treated as a public holiday. The Full Bench decision which established the test case standard for leave entitlements in Commission awards relating to public holidays included union picnic day as a day which may be included as one of the additional public holidays constituting the minimum entitlement of leave under the public holiday clauses. As we have already indicated, the use of terms in their industrial context is an important element in construing the matters listed in s.89A(2).
We have therefore concluded that union picnic day falls within the expression public holidays for the purposes of s.89(A)2(i).
The effect of this decision has been that, even though union picnic days are not expressly identified as allowable award matters under section 89(A) of the act, they have been regarded as public holidays which are allowable.
It is very clear that the approach being adopted by the government is both mean minded and mean spirited. The government needs to contemplate, firstly, why it is carrying out this activity given that holidays are of themselves, by and large, matters up to state and territory jurisdictions. To come into this place and seek to take out the ability of workers to enjoy a picnic day underlines, in my mind, very clearly the mean-spirited approach being adopted by the government. 
The other major provision of this legislation is the matter which deals with tallies. The act specifies `piece rates, tallies and bonuses' as allowable award matters. Tallies and bonuses are used to set pay rates in agricultural industries such as the meat industry, sheep shearing, fruit picking and the clothing industry. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Tallies and Picnic Days) Bill 2000 will not remove either piece rates or bonuses as allowable award matters—only tallies.
Again, I am indebted to the Parliamentary Library for the following information. The issue of tallies was considered by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee in its review, which I referred to earlier, of the More Jobs Better Pay bill. At that time, the ACTU submitted that the three terms, piece rates, tallies and bonuses, are used interchangeably in awards in industries such as clothing and meat. It also expressed concern that clothing workers could lose their entitlements to bonus payments, and thus workers under these systems could seek clarification or attention of their particular earnings by results systems.
Not surprisingly, the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business attempted to distinguish between the operation of these systems in its 1999 submission to the Senate committee. It argued that tallies are based on inputs, in contrast to piece rates systems, which are based on outputs.
In contrast, the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union, the AMIEU, suggested in its submission on the More Jobs Better Pay bill that with the removal of tallies from awards, meat industry employers would replace the tally system with another piece rate system. Their submission reads:
Removing tally provisions, given that most employers would maintain some form of incentive system, would destroy the effectiveness of the award safety net ... award tally provisions represent a key award entitlement, which must be maintained in order to avoid substantially reducing the award safety net.
... employees in the meat industry are not highly paid by committee standards.
The effect of making tallies a non-allowable award matter would be to make it legally possible to reduce a tally worker's gross pay by 25%. The safety net value of the award would become virtually irrelevant.
It is very clear to me that the position we ought to be adopting on this legislation is not the one which is being advocated by the government. Further in their submission, the AMIEU stated that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission was reviewing the tally system as part of the process of reviewing awards, as is appropriate. The union said that to remove tallies as an allowable award matter would inhibit the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from implementing the federal meat industry decision, print R9075, particularly those aspects of the decision dealing with the tally provisions of the award in question, and that the evidence presented during the AIRC hearings showed that meat processors, while not using the award prescribed tally system, were using their own arrangements whether contained in certified agreements or by way of private arrangements between the employer and employees and/or union. Much of the case before the full bench of the AIRC was in relation to the tally system in the federal meat industry processing award 1996. The tally system is very clear. 
It is both unfair and unreasonable for the government to adopt the approach it has in relation to this matter. I referred a moment ago to the full bench's decision in the 1996 case. The decision was in relation to tallies in that award, but will have application to other awards containing tallies. The full bench at that time was conscious of the need to retain award protection for employees working under piece rate systems. It said:
On the other hand, in our view, it is essential that the terms and conditions of any incentive payment system to operate in place of the standard time work payment system be documented, authenticated and readily ascertainable.
Further, it said: 
Those measures are also necessary to ensure that employees have an opportunity to understand, or can readily ascertain, the terms of the incentive payment system, and are able to monitor accrual of entitlements under it.
It is very clear that this bill's removal of tallies as an allowable award matter undermines the integrity of the decision reached by the AIRC and could prevent the AIRC from properly reviewing the effects of the FMID as it relates to fairness to employees. It is very clear that more work needs to be done on this issue. The government should be very conscious of our view; it is entirely inappropriate for this matter to be addressed in the way that is being proposed by this legislation. I have said before that it is very clear that this matter is being ideologically driven. In my view, this, and the question of picnic days, is something which the government should rethink. It is not appropriate to be doing it in this way. It will only penalise those people who should not be penalised—Australian workers. The issue of the holiday for picnic day will affect workers regardless of the industry they work in, and the issue of tallies will have most application for those industries that I have already mentioned, particularly the clothing industry and the meat industry. I do not believe that it is fair or reasonable to treat Australian workers with the disrespect that this bill seeks to do.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TALLIES AND PICNIC DAYS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,2000-10-10,"—I rise to talk on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Tallies and Picnic Days) Bill 2000 very proudly because, to my knowledge, I am the only member with a working-class background in this place who worked as a tally worker, both as a slaughterman and a boner in the meat processing industry, in my younger days, and I was also a member of the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union.
Before I talk about my personal experiences as a qualified tally worker, I will reflect on the attitude of the Australian Democrats and the ALP on the workplace relations bills. In their 1998 IR election policy, the Democrats supported a simplified and usable award system. Their record on voting on coalition bills shows that, despite several opportunities, and this bill is yet another one, they have failed to act in accordance with their own policies. Despite their self-adulation as those who `keep the bastards honest' and as those who `do not just say no to legislation', they have failed to assess this bill and others on their merits. Despite their rejection of the More Jobs Better Pay legislation, largely on the basis that it was an inappropriate omnibus bill, they have failed to assess on the merits the bills, including this one, that the coalition has served up in bite-sized chunks just so the Democrats could manage them.
Let me now talk about the Democrats workplace relations voting record. Between 1988 and 1996, Labor moved 17 pieces of industrial relations legislation through the Senate. Between 1996 and 2000, the coalition moved 16 pieces of workplace relations legislation through the Senate, with four bills currently in the House of Representatives. Only three items of Labor IR legislation were referred to committees, whereas 15 items of coalition legislation have been referred to committees. The Democrats even voted against a committee when Labor moved their 1988 omnibus bill—the Industrial Relations Bill 1988. The Democrats spent 833 days considering Labor's 17 pieces of legislation in the Senate—an average of 49 days per bill. By contrast, as at 6 September, they have spent 2,528 days considering the coalition's 16 pieces of legislation—an average of 158 days each. All pieces of Labor industrial relations legislation put before the Senate have passed into law, some with amendment, and every time there has been a vote on Labor's legislation the Democrats voted in favour.
The Democrats have only ever voted in favour of two coalition workplace relations bills since the 1996 election. One further bill passed in the last parliament without a vote. Only one coalition workplace relations bill has passed during the present parliament, and that was with Labor support—and I refer to the youth wages bill 1999—with the Democrats voting against. In every other case the Democrats have voted down, disallowed or delayed coalition workplace relations legislation. The Democrats have voted down four coalition workplace relations bills, disallowed three regulations and delayed another bill until it died at the last election. There are currently four pieces of workplace relations legislation still blocked in the Senate, with a further four bills on their way from the House of Representatives. The Democrats have been prepared to deal with Labor IR legislation in omnibus form but have refused to do so to coalition omnibus legislation in the coalition's second term. By the time the parliament resumed sitting in August 2000, coalition workplace relations bills had been delayed for approximately three times longer than Labor's legislation was delayed, and this tally was racked up over half as many years. 
Let me now talk about the ALP's contribution. Award simplification should be a matter of bipartisan policy in this parliament. It was a policy advocated by the former Keating Labor government between 1993 and 1996. The Labor Party in opposition has, however, regressed in its own support for award simplification. It has caved in to its union mates, with an approach of mindless opposition, like that of the ACTU, to all award simplification. Rather than support simplified awards, Labor's policy promises the complete abolition of award simplification—awards which are comprehensive, not simplified.
The removal of tallies from awards is long overdue and has been widely advocated within industry and by policy makers across the political divide. As related by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services to parliament on 26 June 2000:
... for a short period only, (the Australian Labor Party) got realistic about this industry, and their spokesman, the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peter Cook, in 1992 said `We ought to get rid of the tally system.' Peter Cook was not able to ... deliver. Do you know why not? The ACTU said no. Peter Cook said, `This will produce more jobs. This will save jobs and produce more jobs. It is an important reform. But the ACTU said no.'
Why did the ACTU say `no'? The answer lies in the quote from an article in the Journal of Industrial Relations (MA Jerrard, March 2000), which described the tally system as:
... the method by which the union controls the pace of throughput of the plant in a shift.
The Democrats in particular will say that the bill is unnecessary and that the Industrial Relations Commission should put the remaining meat industry awards which contain tally provisions through the same process used for the major federal meat industry award. Neither the Labor Party nor the Democrats have called into question the AIRC decision to remove tallies from the major federal meat industry award. Apart from this award, unit tally systems also exist in a number of other federal meat awards. The removal of tallies as an allowable award matter will expedite the modernisation of these awards and remove the necessity for the commission and the parties to go through the same lengthy process they went through in respect of the major federal meat industry award.
Let me now touch on my experiences. As a 14-year-old I went into the meat processing industry at a small country abattoir at Echuca in Victoria as a labourer. After labouring for two years, as a 16-year-old I wanted to become a slaughterman to earn more money and to get a profession. Unfortunately, the award of the day and the way the tally work was structured prevented me doing so, but there was a section in the award that I took advantage of and this was called the improver section. As a 16-year-old, I was able to learn from one of the tradesmen the art of solo slaughtering on lambs and sheep. I was able to do that on a weekly wage and, when I got up to the tally—at that time a low tally was 65 carcasses per day—I could then go on to the full-time award. I became a proficient solo slaughterman at 18 years of age, when the tallies in those days were 65 minimum and 80 maximum per day.
At that time I was producing in my prime about 100 sucker lambs a day. I was starting at 7.30 in the morning and finishing at three in the afternoon. Because of the heavy lifting that was involved in that process while I was a young man, which also included some heavy lifting of pigs and beef which I learnt as a tally slaughterman, I have long-term physical problems. Apart from the normal dangers of knife stick injuries and cuts, which I have had a considerable number of, I suffer with what is called dry sockets, or the `screws', which means I have no liquid left in the ball-and-socket joints of my two arms because of the heavy lifting I did as a young man. Following on from becoming a proficient solo slaughterman, I took up tally work as a boner and I worked in the boning rooms for two or three years. 
I then went off to the big city where I became a proficient chain slaughterman on a mechanised system producing 85 carcasses per day as part of a team of 32 slaughtermen on each chain. We processed sheep, calves and beef—when I was on beef—on the chain system. Part of the problem we had with the tally system in those days was that I, like many others, wanted to get out of the place as early as I could, so we turned the speed of the chains up to the point where we started at 7.30 in the morning and we finished our tallies by midday. We completed our tallies extremely quickly. But the effect that had on the workmanship of those particular carcasses in those environments was catastrophic in terms of the economic loss to the abattoir owners themselves, because when you turn chains up to get out quickly not only do you put an enormous amount of pressure on your body physically but you tend to take shortcuts and, when you take shortcuts with knives, you damage hides, skins and carcasses. When the meat processing industry decided that it needed to put more mechanism into the manual labour of slaughtering, it introduced mechanised slaughtering aids such as hide and skin pullers, air operated knives, splitting saws and so on. It did that in an endeavour to make the chain process and the tally system of slaughtering a lot easier for people, and it did to some extent, but it also created a compounding problem.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2000-10-10,"—Tonight I would like to acknowledge the tremendous work of the Centre for Australian Indigenous Studies at Monash University. The centre is not only a centre for learning and research but also a meeting place. Located at the Clayton Campus of Monash University in my electorate, it is a social centre where the indigenous students can relax, feel at home and get support and counselling from the friendly and accessible, if overworked, staff. Watching the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games reminded me of my visit to the centre during NAIDOC week this year. The strong message of reconciliation from the games is demonstrated daily by the fantastic work of the Centre for Australian Indigenous Studies. The centre educates both indigenous and non- indigenous students about Australian indigenous culture and provides encouragement for indigenous students into higher education via the Monash indigenous access scheme. 
The Centre for Australian Indigenous Studies had a lot to celebrate in NAIDOC week 2000: a newly founded centre; the introduction of a first-year indigenous studies unit in the Bachelor of Arts course; a recently announced ARC grant of $101,000; in collaboration with other colleagues in the university, the introduction of an indigenous access scheme; three Rio Tinto scholarships for indigenous students in the engineering faculty; and ongoing collaboration work with the medical and law faculties. The centre can also boast a Fulbright postgraduate student Kyllie Cripps. Kyllie is a Monash PhD student, and she was one of two candidates selected to receive a 2000 Fulbright Postgraduate Student Award for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, sponsored by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. As part of her PhD and in affiliation with the University of Arizona, Kyllie will undertake comparative research work among native American communities in Arizona. Her research, through extensive fieldwork in both Australia and the US, will seek to identify, examine and provide a comprehensive analysis of programs that are successfully addressing family violence in indigenous communities. Kyllie was one of 19 Australians to receive an award in 2000 under the auspices of the Australian-American Fulbright Commission. Kyllie was also recognised this year as being one of 30 high achievers in Victoria. Interestingly enough, during the process of that work, she had to explain that she was actually Aboriginal. Being of white skin, she has taken to carrying a photograph of her black mum and dad by way of explanation. The Centre for Australian Indigenous Studies at Monash University is another great example of how the community is leading the Prime Minister on reconciliation. I ask on behalf of the Australian community: why can't he just say sorry?  
On a note of indulgence, today is the birthday of the beautiful Madeleine Louise: she is one today. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who have made this interesting combination of motherhood and parliament that much easier. Without a doubt, I would like to thank the parliamentary staff in this House—the attendants, the cleaners, all those in the Serjeant-at-Arms's Office, and particularly the Comcar drivers, who all know how to install a baby capsule. I would also like to thank, without a doubt, my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the House who have been absolutely delightful in their support of me. I would also like to thank on this occasion the Speaker for his indulgence on occasions too; my staff in Chisholm, who have been very understanding at times; the folk of Chisholm, my many constituents, who have embraced my daughter marvellously; my mum; my in-laws; my best mate, Steve, without whose support and his taking the year off work none of this would have been at all possible; and, most importantly, my beautiful Madeleine, who is just a delight. Thank you, Mr Speaker.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2000-10-10,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
	(1) I am advised that my portfolio is compliant.
	(2) GST compliance within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA), the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) has been achieved through a comprehensive implementation program that commenced in August 1999.  The implementation was monitored and guided by a high level taskforce that included representatives from across key areas of DIMA, the MRT and the RRT.  The Taskforce met on a regular basis and periodically briefed the Departmental executive and myself.
	In addition to the internal management and monitoring of the implementation, the Department of Finance and Administration (DOFA) monitored the progress of all agencies in implementation of the GST.  DOFA's monitoring was undertaken over the period from November 1999 to May 2000 via a series of comprehensive questionnaires and interviews.  DOFA assessed progress on implementation from these questionnaires and interviews and reported the findings to me and each of the agency's chief executive officers.
	During May 2000, DIMA engaged a consultant to assess the preparedness of its business and IT systems to cope with the GST, and to make recommendations of enhancements required to achieve GST compliance where any deficiencies were identified.  The consultant reported in mid June that if DIMA's implementation program continued as planned, DIMA would achieve compliance by 1 July 2000.
	(3) The implementation and ongoing management of tax reforms by DIMA, the RRT and the MRT is the responsibility of their respective chief executive officers.  While the Government will continue to monitor the impact of the implementation of The New Tax System, the reforms are not expected to reduce the level of funding of these agencies in real terms.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Portfolio Compliance</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,16,1,answer
