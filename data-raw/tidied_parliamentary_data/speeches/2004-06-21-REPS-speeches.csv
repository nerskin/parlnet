"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Science and Innovation, I present the committee's report entitled Science overcoming salinity: coordinating and extending the science to address the nation's salinity problem, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—This is a unanimous report. It deals with the coordination necessary to ensure that the best scientific knowledge to combat the salinity problem is applied on the ground. We must ensure that farmers and catchment management organisations dealing with the salinity threat are equipped with the knowledge and resources to fight salinity. We must also ensure that our science agencies and programs continue to develop economically viable salinity management options that can be readily adopted by land managers. To address these issues, our report makes 24 recommendations across six themes. 
The first theme is that the report recommends that regional planning and on-ground works to address salinity use the best available science as their basis, and that catchment management organisations and land managers be adequately supported to use science in their planning and salinity investment activities.
The second theme relates to research coordination. It is crucial that the nation's considerable investment in salinity research and development not be wasted or misdirected. A strong case was made for an ongoing role in salinity R&D coordination at the national level. Our report recommends that the National Dryland Salinity Program be retained and its functions expanded to include irrigation and urban salinity. Its research, coordination and communication strategies should evolve to meet the requirements of the new natural resource management environment. Our report also recommends that a comprehensive audit of the Australian government investment in salinity research be undertaken. An audit would bring greater coherence to the range of science investments and assist in improving coordination with state and regional salinity research efforts.
The third theme relates to the adequacy of the existing science base and funding for future research. The Australian government is supporting a tremendous salinity research effort through a range of national research agencies, programs and partnerships. However, it is crucial that gaps in our knowledge be identified and addressed. For instance, many submitters called for more salinity management options that are profitable and can be adopted on a large scale, thus giving landowners a greater incentive to directly address salinity. Our report recommends that greater emphasis be given to the development of new, economically viable land and water use systems to combat salinity. The committee notes the emphasis in natural resource management policies on regional level planning and delivery of programs, which we support. However, it is important that the regional focus not detract from ongoing research into solutions that are of state-wide or national relevance. Accordingly, the committee recommends that provision be made within the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality for the establishment of a salinity R&D fund to finance research of this nature.
Our fourth theme concerns the importance of salinity mapping technologies and data management. The report recommends that governments expedite the development of data management systems that are standardised, integrated and accessible. The report also recommends that managers of regional projects be equipped with the requisite skills to properly manage salinity data. 
Our fifth theme—and, in my view, the most important—is the need to ensure that salinity research findings and tools are extended to users on the ground. In this respect, the report makes a number of recommendations, including that governments consider establishing groups of mobile knowledge brokers to provide scientific and technical support to land managers. The committee also recommends that governments build on current efforts to establish a multitiered database of information and salinity research findings. Traditional face-to-face advisory and support services for land managers—commonly referred to as extension services—remain an important means of transferring information. The committee urges governments, and in particular state governments, to not only maintain but also improve their support for these services.
The sixth and final theme of our recommendations is that the private sector be encouraged to undertake salinity research, development and extension activities. Our report finds that the private sector are great innovators in the areas of salinity technologies, such as mapping techniques, and are increasingly involved in providing support services for land managers.
I wish to thank my committee colleagues for their bipartisan and thoughtful input to the inquiry at all times, particularly those who made time to undertake inspections across several states. Also, I say well done to our excellent secretariat team: Catherine Cornish, inquiry secretary Jerome Brown, researcher Zoe Smith and administrative officer Suzy Domitrovic.
In closing, I emphasise that salinity is a tremendous threat to our nation. It destroys productive land and imperils farmers' livelihoods, it reduces river quality and damages urban and public infrastructure, and it threatens conservation reserves and biodiversity. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Science and Innovation Committee</title>,Committees,0,1,speech
"Corcoran, Ann, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—The Standing Committee on Science and Innovation was sent out to inquire into the coordination of the science to combat the nation's salinity problem. This inquiry was set up to try to discover whether the best science is readily available to and/or being used by those on the ground addressing the problem of salinity. We wanted to know if the science and research being done in the universities, by CSIRO or by the cooperative research centres set up for the purpose is actually getting to those on the ground.
This inquiry was not about the salinity problem itself. Formally, we were not interested in why we have this problem, nor were we formally interested in the many solutions that are being put forward. Our task was clearly to focus on whether and/or how the science being done is available to other scientists and those responsible for land management and the implementation of salinity programs. The decision not to be interested in what is causing salinity nor in the many solutions proposed was deliberate and very sensible. It was sensible because we needed to stay focused on the question and also because a lot of work has already been done on the causes of and solutions to salinity.
However, this is a very interesting area and it was quite often hard to ignore it as we listened to the evidence being given to us. It was hard to ignore partly because, as I have just said, this is an interesting area but also because of the enthusiasm of those giving evidence on the subject. Both on the field trips and in the more formal sessions we met many people who were absolutely determined to solve this problem. We met people who had installed programs or systems and who had achieved a measure of success. They were justifiably proud of their achievements and keen to share their experiences. 
As a result of this inquiry, what we did find in simple terms is that there is a lot of information out there but that no-one really has a good overview of what is around or where it is. Ironically, I wonder whether this situation has occurred because of the seriousness and immediacy of the problem. There has been a concerted effort by many people to address the situation. Scientists have done a lot of work and so too have many land managers. The trick now is to make sure that everyone is aware of what is around, or at least knows that research is available, and to ensure that it is accessible.
The situation is not confined to rural areas. We saw plenty of evidence of salinity being an issue in urban areas. We saw evidence of urban land managers taking steps to address the problem. Again, though, it was not clear that urban land managers are aware of work being done by others on this problem. We got the feeling that a lot is happening in isolation and that that may not necessarily always be a bad thing. There is some credibility in the argument that every area is different and has its own problems and therefore its own solutions. Again, it was hard not to get drawn down the track of trying to assess this theory because it was interesting, but we were on a different mission.
The main thrust of this report is therefore about getting a handle on what is around. The member for Eden-Monaro has mentioned that we have made a number of recommendations. They essentially call for an audit of all the salinity research and development undertaken by agencies in Australia and for a register of all this research. This should be extended to the solutions and systems developed through trial and error by those on the land as well as to those developed through more formal research and development methods.
The point was also made that solutions need to be economically viable. It must not be forgotten that salinity occurs on public open space and also in urban areas, but obviously it occurs most often on land being used for grazing or cropping and so people's livelihoods are involved. It is clear that not every situation can be addressed by a solution that ensures the continuation of current land use. It is fairly obvious that if science is to propose alternative methods or alternative land uses then these must be economically viable if landowners are to be encouraged to stay on the land.
I would like to record formally my thanks to the committee staff—Catherine Cornish, Jerome Brown, Zoe Smith and Suzy Domitrovic—for their hard work on this very interesting inquiry. Finally, I want to record my appreciation of the work of all committee members on this inquiry, especially the chair, the member for Eden-Monaro, for his drive and unflagging commitment to the job.

"Jull, David, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 12th annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum held in Beijing, People's Republic of China, from 12 to 14 January 2004. The Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, the APPF, is an organisation which each January brings together members of parliaments from throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Delegates discuss matters of mutual interest, as set out in an agreed agenda. Formal resolutions are adopted on agenda items and this report provides the text to 25 such resolutions.
Australia has been an active participant in the forum since it was established in 1993 and many members and senators have now attended its annual meetings. We were fortunate this time that all four delegates—myself, the member for Oxley, the member for Stirling and Senator Ferris—were seasoned APPF delegates. This provided us with an understanding of the rules and practices of the forum which allowed us to make a sound contribution to a number of aspects of the meeting. 
The subject matter for the forum included political and security issues, economic issues, and agenda items `Cooperation for the Stability and Prosperity of the Region' and `Future work of the APPF'. Australia prepared four draft resolutions covering: the political and security situation in the region; combating international terrorism; protection of the Pacific Ocean's biomass, including relevant multinational agreements; and cooperation on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. Following negotiation and amendments suggested by other countries, all our drafts were eventually adopted with three being jointly sponsored with other delegations.  
The item entitled `Future work of the APFF' was of particular significance to this meeting. After 13 years service to the APPF, His Excellency Yasuhiro Nakasone resigned as president, following his retirement as a member of the Japanese House of Representatives. Mr Nakasone, a former Prime Minister of Japan and the founding President of the APPF, leaves a very great legacy. He was honoured by the unanimous decision to invite him to continue his association with the APPF by becoming honorary president. In this role he will advise the executive committee and provide continuity and leadership into the future. On behalf of this delegation and previous Australian delegations to the APPF, I place on record our gratitude to Mr Nakasone for the great contribution that he has made to the forum. We wish him well in the future.
The search for a replacement APPF president failed to identify a candidate who would agree to take on the role for the three years provided by the APPF rules. Accordingly, the rules were altered to provide for a rotating president. For the future, the host parliament of the next annual meeting will nominate both a president and a chairman of the annual meeting to serve for a year. The Parliament of Vietnam will provide the first annual president. 
The APPF provides an important opportunity for Australian parliamentarians to press Australia's interests. This is done formally through our draft resolutions, but we also promote Australia's national interests during speeches in the plenary and in bilateral meetings with other delegations. In addition, APPF delegations have the opportunity to encourage other parliamentarians in our region to understand Australians policies and priorities through the numerous informal occasions which arise throughout the meetings. 
In relation to activities other than those that took place in the plenary session, I pay tribute to the role played by the member for Stirling in her leadership of the Technological Working Group. This is the second year in a row that Jann McFarlane has chaired the group, taking over the role from the member for Oxley, Bernie Ripoll. The Beijing meeting of the Technological Working Group was significant for preparing and having adopted by the plenary a statement of its aims and objectives. The work done by the group in keeping a watching brief on the APPF web site will be most valuable in the future because, in the absence of a permanent secretariat, the web site is the contact point for information of the APPF. 
Delegation leaders met privately with President Hu. The President told me that he was overwhelmed by the hospitality he received during his visit to Australia last October, particularly from senators and members following his address to them. He was very optimistic about future relations between China and Australia and stated that he felt very privileged to be able to address us from the floor of this parliament. 
The Australian delegation also enjoyed a successful bilateral meeting with the Indonesian delegation; and we had an informal meeting in the form of a dinner party with the Thai group as well. I thank all members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Parliamentary Library, particularly Larissa Ashwin from the post in Beijing, Ms Brenda Herd from the Parliamentary Relations Office and in particular Judy Middlebrook, the secretary to our delegation, who as usual did a magnificent job. Finally I would like to thank my fellow delegates: they worked together as an effective team and represented Australia's interests very well.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I am pleased to also speak on this delegation to the 12th annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum, the APPF. This was the second time that I have been a delegate to this forum to help Australia contribute to these very important Asia-Pacific regional talks. I would like to begin by thanking the chairman of our delegation, the member for Fadden, who spoke some very kind words in his contribution earlier. I thank him for the role he played in assuring that Australia contributed fully. I also thank the other members of the delegation—the member for Stirling and Senator Ferris. I make particular mention also of our secretary, Judy Middlebrook, whose assistance and work for the delegation is invaluable and unbelievable. It certainly makes our work a lot easier.
This particular parliamentary forum was held in Beijing and was excellently hosted by the Chinese authorities. Their hospitality was first rate, and the way in which they organised the forum made the plenary sessions, discussions and meetings much easier to deal with.
The forum has been going since 1993—just over 10 years. In that time there have been many meetings where Asia-Pacific countries come together to discuss issues of mutual importance: economic, environmental and security cooperation; regional issues; and stability and prosperity in our region. Having been to two of these forums, I now have a fuller understanding of the importance of these types of meetings where regional partners and neighbours can come together and talk about issues that are significant to them—outside of more formal settings in government-to-government talks. These are parliamentary-to-parliamentary talks and are extremely valuable.
We discuss a range of issues, set an agenda and pass resolutions agreed to by each annual meeting so that each country can take them back to their own parliaments and use them as a basis for action in their own countries and their parts of the region. I find that extremely important, particularly in the climate that we live in with regional cooperation being a key to regional stability and cooperation between countries, in terms of better understanding what we each do, what we think about each other, how we better coordinate our own programs, and how we get on as nations and as neighbours.
The future of the APPF is significant. It is a meeting of nations that should continue into the future, and for that to happen we do need to look at a number of issues. For a few years there has been a move towards establishing a permanent secretariat. While Australia has not agreed with this position, and that continues to be the case, I do believe that we need to look at a better mechanism to continue the work of the APPF between sessions, from year to year. In our view, that has come in the form of the web site and some web based information. I think that is the best way for us to continue sharing ideas and forming resolutions. The idea of a permanent secretariat is, I think, still early. We do not have one group that is prepared to come forward and take on that huge responsibility. 
We had a number of bilateral meetings; in particular, we had a very successful one with the delegation from Indonesia, our closest neighbour in the region, and we also had a meeting with our friends from Thailand. I would also like to place on the record my thanks to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Parliamentary Library and also to Larissa Ashwin from the Beijing post, who was very helpful in getting some material together and helping us in terms of diplomacy for our delegation. All in all, it was a very worthwhile experience and I recommend it to anyone who would like to take part in a delegation in the future.

"Elson, Kay, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Getting water right(s): The future of rural Australia, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—Water is truly the lifeblood of our nation. It is particularly important to our rural industries and communities. The minister's reference to the committee in mid-2002 was very timely, with a large part of Australia in the grip of a harsh drought, which continues in some areas today.
If development was the catchcry for much of the 20th century, then sustainability is the catchcry of the 21st century. All the evidence the committee received from virtually all stakeholders, be they environmentalists or irrigators, agreed that Australia's water resources must be managed on a sustainable basis. There was overwhelming support in the evidence taken by the committee during this inquiry for four broad principles: that the management of Australia's natural resources, particularly water, be placed on a sustainable basis; that the Commonwealth continue to work with state and territory governments to implement the COAG water reforms to ensure long-term, sustainable water resources; that the Commonwealth maintain funding to programs such as the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan to assist regional communities which have water quality and sustainability problems; and that the Commonwealth continue to fund research into areas such as the impact of rural water usage on biodiversity, farming practices, irrigation techniques, and weather forecasting and climate predictions.
The work of this inquiry was to some extent overtaken by events, with the announcement by COAG in August 2003 of the new national water initiative. While the committee welcomed the announcement of the national water initiative, most of the members were concerned that decisions were being made before all relevant data could be compiled and analysed. In April 2004 the committee presented an interim report to the parliament focusing on the Living Murray initiative. The interim report recommended the postponement of plans to increase river flows to the River Murray until the complete data was collated and properly analysed. The committee believes that it would be better to take more time now to get things right for the future. Rural water and the communities which rely on it are far too important to be subjected to hurried, piecemeal decisions made on the basis of incomplete data.
The report I am tabling today contains 30 recommendations. The committee strongly believes that the adoption of all of these recommendations would greatly facilitate and sustain the development of rural water to the benefit of the industries and communities which heavily upon it. However, there are two recommendations which I would like to particularly commend to the government, recommendations 2 and 30. Recommendation 2 is:
The Committee recommends that a top priority of the National Water Initiative should be to fund the scientific research ... necessary to determine what level of water use is sustainable in each of Australia's major working rivers and aquifers.
Recommendation 30 is that, as part of the national water initiative, a national research strategy be developed that prioritises and coordinates all research activities on water. 
I will discuss recommendation 30 first. The committee believes that Australia needs a national research strategy for water. Everyone from the Prime Minister down agrees that water is a key national priority and must be supported by a properly resourced and coordinated research effort. The national water initiative presents the ideal opportunity for a proper national research strategy to be developed. Recommendation 2 really gets to the heart of the issue of future supplies of rural water. We must determine, and quickly, the sustainable use of Australia's working rivers and aquifers. We all want our water resources to be there for future generations, and we are all agreed that these must be utilised in a sustainable manner. We need to get the balance right between water for the environment and water for agriculture. Let us make that the top priority for the national water initiative.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the committee for their active involvement in this important inquiry. A big thank-you must be extended to our secretariat members, Ian, Bill, Marlene, Jeannie and especially Alex Olah, who is a credit to his profession. The secretariat's dedication and support over this period was outstanding. To the many people and groups who took the time to send in submissions and appear at hearings all over Australia, this report's results are due to the efforts that you made—a big thank-you. We became known as the drought breakers because during 2003, wherever the committee held a public hearing, it would inevitably rain in that particular area. If only it were that that easy to make rain. I really feel for those areas of Australia where this awful drought has persisted so long. I commend the report to the House.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—Today we are presenting to the parliament the final report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's inquiry into the provision of future water supplies for Australia's rural industries and communities. The committee has been meeting for 18 months or more. It became very unwieldy and went rather too long so that, although there are some good recommendations to finally come out of it, most of them have been superseded because of a further study being undertaken by the Senate, the fact that the states are considering the whole issue through COAG this week, and other decisions made by government as this inquiry was being held.
It should have been a fundamental report, one that considered the whole role that water plays in our lives, as one of the four elements of life that also include earth, air and fire. But it has been left in the hands of sectorial interests and therefore the report has become marginalised in its final discussion. It also concentrated heavily on the Murray-Darling system at the expense of a broader, more inclusive discussion on water use and cost in Australia.
When I presented a dissenting report as part of the interim report, it was because I believed the direction of the study had been hijacked and it was being used as a political football. We had heard from some 60 scientists, well known in their field for understanding the issues involved, and there was an enormous amount of work undertaken to develop the ideas. Yet some committee members seemed to be only interested in hearing from two who had different views. So I would dispute the fact that the findings were hurried or piecemeal in their presentation, or that the data was incomplete. I doubt whether one could present a `complete' report on such a fundamental issue, as the parameters would change over time anyway. 
It was and is important to start the process of introducing the additional water to the Murray-Darling system to allow increased environmental flows; quite frankly, we should get on with it. All this pussyfooting around to appease a handful of people is not getting us anywhere. I expect this report will be another to gather dust in the archives of parliament as this government shelves another important issue in the too-hard basket and will not face the decisions that need to be made.
That said, the report itself has some very good information. It has considerable amounts of data from all over Australia, not just from the states that are interested in the management of the Murray-Darling. It is a shame that it probably will not have a more careful consideration by the federal government to actually do something about the recommendations. I thought that the information that was presented to the committee was very thorough, and much of it could certainly form the basis of an overall water strategy in the future. From my point of view, I would really like to see the take-up of some of the recommendations that are more general, like the water tank policy, the cost recovery of water in urban environments and helping small communities upgrade their water supplies. This makes more sense, really, in many of the other electorates, like Tasmania, than worrying about the Murray-Darling.
But for now I would like to thank the committee secretariat, particularly Ian Dundas, Alex Olah and Bill Pender, as well as Marlene Dundas and Jeannie Brooks. They have put in enormous amounts of work and time putting together the hearings and then putting the findings into a report. Thanks to my colleagues for participating in the committee. Let us hope that in the next one we take on we can be a little bit more cohesive and dispassionate in the roles and work of the committee. It is, after all, our opportunity to do bipartisan work in the interests of parliament as a whole. I support the report.

"Elson, Kay, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Getting water right(s): The future of rural Australia, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—Water is truly the lifeblood of our nation. It is particularly important to our rural industries and communities. The minister's reference to the committee in mid-2002 was very timely, with a large part of Australia in the grip of a harsh drought, which continues in some areas today.
If development was the catchcry for much of the 20th century, then sustainability is the catchcry of the 21st century. All the evidence the committee received from virtually all stakeholders, be they environmentalists or irrigators, agreed that Australia's water resources must be managed on a sustainable basis. There was overwhelming support in the evidence taken by the committee during this inquiry for four broad principles: that the management of Australia's natural resources, particularly water, be placed on a sustainable basis; that the Commonwealth continue to work with state and territory governments to implement the COAG water reforms to ensure long-term, sustainable water resources; that the Commonwealth maintain funding to programs such as the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan to assist regional communities which have water quality and sustainability problems; and that the Commonwealth continue to fund research into areas such as the impact of rural water usage on biodiversity, farming practices, irrigation techniques, and weather forecasting and climate predictions.
The work of this inquiry was to some extent overtaken by events, with the announcement by COAG in August 2003 of the new national water initiative. While the committee welcomed the announcement of the national water initiative, most of the members were concerned that decisions were being made before all relevant data could be compiled and analysed. In April 2004 the committee presented an interim report to the parliament focusing on the Living Murray initiative. The interim report recommended the postponement of plans to increase river flows to the River Murray until the complete data was collated and properly analysed. The committee believes that it would be better to take more time now to get things right for the future. Rural water and the communities which rely on it are far too important to be subjected to hurried, piecemeal decisions made on the basis of incomplete data.
The report I am tabling today contains 30 recommendations. The committee strongly believes that the adoption of all of these recommendations would greatly facilitate and sustain the development of rural water to the benefit of the industries and communities which heavily upon it. However, there are two recommendations which I would like to particularly commend to the government, recommendations 2 and 30. Recommendation 2 is:
The Committee recommends that a top priority of the National Water Initiative should be to fund the scientific research ... necessary to determine what level of water use is sustainable in each of Australia's major working rivers and aquifers.
Recommendation 30 is that, as part of the national water initiative, a national research strategy be developed that prioritises and coordinates all research activities on water. 
I will discuss recommendation 30 first. The committee believes that Australia needs a national research strategy for water. Everyone from the Prime Minister down agrees that water is a key national priority and must be supported by a properly resourced and coordinated research effort. The national water initiative presents the ideal opportunity for a proper national research strategy to be developed. Recommendation 2 really gets to the heart of the issue of future supplies of rural water. We must determine, and quickly, the sustainable use of Australia's working rivers and aquifers. We all want our water resources to be there for future generations, and we are all agreed that these must be utilised in a sustainable manner. We need to get the balance right between water for the environment and water for agriculture. Let us make that the top priority for the national water initiative.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the committee for their active involvement in this important inquiry. A big thank-you must be extended to our secretariat members, Ian, Bill, Marlene, Jeannie and especially Alex Olah, who is a credit to his profession. The secretariat's dedication and support over this period was outstanding. To the many people and groups who took the time to send in submissions and appear at hearings all over Australia, this report's results are due to the efforts that you made—a big thank-you. We became known as the drought breakers because during 2003, wherever the committee held a public hearing, it would inevitably rain in that particular area. If only it were that that easy to make rain. I really feel for those areas of Australia where this awful drought has persisted so long. I commend the report to the House.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—Today we are presenting to the parliament the final report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's inquiry into the provision of future water supplies for Australia's rural industries and communities. The committee has been meeting for 18 months or more. It became very unwieldy and went rather too long so that, although there are some good recommendations to finally come out of it, most of them have been superseded because of a further study being undertaken by the Senate, the fact that the states are considering the whole issue through COAG this week, and other decisions made by government as this inquiry was being held.
It should have been a fundamental report, one that considered the whole role that water plays in our lives, as one of the four elements of life that also include earth, air and fire. But it has been left in the hands of sectorial interests and therefore the report has become marginalised in its final discussion. It also concentrated heavily on the Murray-Darling system at the expense of a broader, more inclusive discussion on water use and cost in Australia.
When I presented a dissenting report as part of the interim report, it was because I believed the direction of the study had been hijacked and it was being used as a political football. We had heard from some 60 scientists, well known in their field for understanding the issues involved, and there was an enormous amount of work undertaken to develop the ideas. Yet some committee members seemed to be only interested in hearing from two who had different views. So I would dispute the fact that the findings were hurried or piecemeal in their presentation, or that the data was incomplete. I doubt whether one could present a `complete' report on such a fundamental issue, as the parameters would change over time anyway. 
It was and is important to start the process of introducing the additional water to the Murray-Darling system to allow increased environmental flows; quite frankly, we should get on with it. All this pussyfooting around to appease a handful of people is not getting us anywhere. I expect this report will be another to gather dust in the archives of parliament as this government shelves another important issue in the too-hard basket and will not face the decisions that need to be made.
That said, the report itself has some very good information. It has considerable amounts of data from all over Australia, not just from the states that are interested in the management of the Murray-Darling. It is a shame that it probably will not have a more careful consideration by the federal government to actually do something about the recommendations. I thought that the information that was presented to the committee was very thorough, and much of it could certainly form the basis of an overall water strategy in the future. From my point of view, I would really like to see the take-up of some of the recommendations that are more general, like the water tank policy, the cost recovery of water in urban environments and helping small communities upgrade their water supplies. This makes more sense, really, in many of the other electorates, like Tasmania, than worrying about the Murray-Darling.
But for now I would like to thank the committee secretariat, particularly Ian Dundas, Alex Olah and Bill Pender, as well as Marlene Dundas and Jeannie Brooks. They have put in enormous amounts of work and time putting together the hearings and then putting the findings into a report. Thanks to my colleagues for participating in the committee.

"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I present the report of the Australian Delegation to the 110th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly held in Mexico City and the ANZAC Day ceremony, Mexico City, 15 to 25 April 2004. The report I have tabled presents in detail the work of the Australian parliamentary delegation at the 110th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly held in Mexico City in April 2004. At page 3 of the report we present the highlights of the delegation's work at this IPU Assembly. As usual, the Australian delegation worked hard and effectively, and this in many ways has been one of the most successful IPU assemblies that we have attended as the official delegates of this parliament over the last three years.
I think it is appropriate to record some of these highlights. My colleague and leader of the delegation, Senator Chapman, was elected as a Vice-President of the Second Standing Committee on Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade. Senator Jeannie Ferris, who has been a very active Australian delegate at the IPU over the last three years, was elected to the Coordinating Committee of the Meeting of Women Parliamentarians. My good friend and colleague Ms Maria Vamvakinou, the member for Calwell, made a significant contribution to the drafting of a final resolution on the emergency agenda item on: 
The role of parliaments in stopping acts of violence, and the building of the separation wall, in order to create conditions conducive to peace and a lasting solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
As the title of the resolution suggests, this was a highly charged issue for the IPU, and Ms Vamvakinou's work on the drafting committee that met for many hours to formulate a final resolution was recognised by several delegations at the IPU Assembly, including the delegations from both Israel and Palestine. Although the emergency agenda item attracts the interest and attention of all delegates during the assembly, other committees debate and finalise resolutions on important international issues. Senator Ferris contributed to the Second Standing Committee on Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade's consideration of:
Working towards an equitable environment for international commerce: the issues of trade in agricultural products and the access to basic medicines.
Senator Ferris also made an intervention in the plenary session's consideration of the final resolution on this matter in order to explain Australia's position on free, just and multilateral trade. I contributed to the Third Committee on Democracy and Human Rights when it considered:
Furthering parliamentary democracy in order to protect human rights and encourage reconciliation among peoples and partnership among nations.
Senator Chapman also spoke at the general debate on the political, economic and social situation in the world with particular reference to reconciliation and partnership. All delegates attended the meetings of the Twelve Plus Group and the Asia-Pacific Group—the two geopolitical groupings to which Australia belongs. I would also like to take this opportunity to record how honoured the delegation was to be asked to participate in the Anzac Day ceremony held in Mexico City and how privileged I was to deliver the address at that ceremony as a former Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I think the delegation's report eloquently expresses sentiments that I expressed that day and the feelings of the other delegations attending the ceremony:
The delegation was very moved by the ceremony and honoured to participate in it. Although thousands of kilometres from similar ceremonies being conducted in Australia, the proceedings in Mexico City had the same poignancy and significance. Indeed, in some ways the fact that the ceremony was being held so far away from Australia gave testimony to the timeless significance of ANZAC to Australians and New Zealanders.
The delegation records its very sincere appreciation of the Australian Ambassador to Mexico, Mr Graeme Wilson, and his staff, including Peter Rennert and Chris Munn, for their assistance while we were in Mexico City. The ambassador is doing great things for Australia in the region and he is assisted in this by his very professional and committed staff. We thank them for the assistance they provided to us during our stay in Mexico City.
I wish to record my thanks to our leader, Senator Chapman, and the other delegates, who have worked cooperatively and effectively at the IPU. Our record over the last three years shows a delegation that has influenced the internal workings of the IPU, and, in this regard, I emphasise the position we took on financial reform and increased accountability within the organisation. The record also shows a delegation that contributed to all IPU committee debates and resolutions.
I must say that over the last three years we have been very well looked after by our advisers. In this regard, I thank Mr Phillip Allars and Mr Doug Foskett from DFAT. In particular, I want to thank Mr Neil Bessell, the secretary to the delegation—a very good personal friend of mine and someone who has served us extremely well. Mr Speaker, I thank you for your cooperation as well. I was not able to be with you when you led one of these delegations, but you have been an inspiration to us. I want to thank everybody involved.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—For more than two years I have been campaigning for the Howard government to grant a Medicare-eligible MRI licence to Concord hospital in my electorate of Lowe. Today, I again speak on behalf of Concord's radiology department, the RSL and the veterans' community, Sydney university and the 8,759 constituents who have signed my MRI petitions, and demand that the federal government grant Concord hospital a Medicare-eligible MRI service.
On 9 June, the federal Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon. Tony Abbott, announced that the government will fund 23 more Medicare-eligible MRI machines. One of the three locations announced by the minister includes the federal seat of Adelaide, the government's most marginal South Australian seat. However, the remaining 20 locations, according to the minister, are to be announced within a few weeks after consultation with the radiology profession and the clinicians. It is appalling hypocrisy for Minister Abbott to guarantee a Medicare-eligible MRI machine for the government's most marginal seat in South Australia and reserve 20 other machines for a cynical pork-barrelling exercise for the upcoming election. Even worse, it appears there will be a bias towards giving them to private providers while ignoring public hospitals like Concord. This is an opportunity for the federal government to stop playing politics with the health care of my constituents. It must listen to the people of the inner west and match the commitment of the New South Wales government, which has agreed to provide a MRI machine— (Time expired)",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Health: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Machines</title>,Statements by Members,4,1,speech
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—On indulgence, I would like to briefly mention the very sad and untimely death early yesterday morning of the former Premier of Tasmania James Alexander, popularly known as Jim, Bacon. There will be many members in this House who knew Jim Bacon better than I did and will be able to speak of him in a more personal fashion but, as Prime Minister, and having in mind the fact that his 5½ years as Premier of Tasmania coincided with my time as Prime Minister, I would like to say a few words about him.
As you all know, Jim Bacon had a very active career in the trade union movement. He was a very active member of the Builders Labourers Federation and he was involved in the titanic struggles between Norm Gallagher and Jack Mundy in the 1970s. He had been a student activist when he was at university. He was a strident opponent of Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, and in 1970 he led a three-day occupation at the Monash University careers and appointments office to protest at the on-campus presence of the Honeywell company, which produced antipersonnel mines for the war.
He went to Western Australia in 1977 to become the first organiser of the BLF at Karratha. He moved to Tasmania to become state secretary of the Builders Labourers Federation. In 1989 he was appointed to the position of secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council, a position that had been held on earlier occasions by some other very distinguished Tasmanians who, in one case, shared his political views and, in another case, shared his political views for a period and then went on to repudiate many of those views. He held that position until 1995. He was elected to the House of Assembly for the division of Denison in 1996 and he became Leader of the Opposition, taking over from Michael Field, a year later. He won the 1998 election and was overwhelmingly re-elected as leader of the Labor Party in August 2002. 
In the 5½ years that we worked together, I found Jim Bacon a very constructive person to work with. He was interested in the future of Tasmania. Despite our evident and manifest political differences, that never prevented us discussing matters in a sensible fashion. I want to place on record the fact that we were able to work together and that there was a very effective cooperation between the two governments over that period of time.
I think all Australians were moved by the manner in which Jim Bacon announced to the world that he had inoperable lung cancer. I remember the day that he made that announcement and conducted his press conference. I had the opportunity to speak to him just after he returned to his home after that very traumatic period of time. He spoke to me of the immense privilege that he felt in being elected to such a high office in his state. He expressed a hope and optimism that he might be given an opportunity to have more time with his wife and family. Sadly that was not to turn out to be the case. He obviously had an extremely aggressive form of lung cancer and, despite intensive chemotherapy, he did not live for more than three or four months.
It is important that we place on record his contribution to public life. Public life is frequently too heavily maligned. Whatever people's political views may be, when you are committed to a cause, as he was, and you have the opportunity to rise to the highest position—in his case in his state, within his own party, playing a role in the affairs of his state at the highest level for a period of 5½ years—it is important for all of us who strive in different ways to improve the welfare of the people who elect us that we pause for a moment and mark the contribution that people have made.
He was a person of great personal optimism and he carried that optimism forward into the final struggle of his life. I certainly think that Tasmanians, whatever their political views may be, will remember him as somebody who fought hard for the interests of his state and carried into practice in public life those things that he believed in. He did not have an easy childhood. His father died when he was 12 and his mother was left on a war widows pension, supplemented by work as a night nurse, to raise five children. He completed his secondary education at Scotch College on a bursary and he later attended Monash University in Melbourne on a scholarship.
I think all of us would echo again the very heartfelt and eloquent plea that he made for the young of this country not to commence the terrible habit of smoking. It is one of the things that he will be well remembered for. He took the opportunity, inevitably made possible by the sad circumstances of his resignation, to make a heartfelt plea for that. It is something that all of us can echo. We can only join others in expressing our sympathy to his wife, Honey, and to his two sons, Scott and Mark, and convey to them our very fond thoughts in their time of very great sadness and bereavement.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Bacon, Hon.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—On indulgence, I join with the Prime Minister in honouring the life of Jim Bacon. Today we mourn the passing of a man much loved by both the people who knew him and the people he led. Jim Bacon was a good man, a committed trade unionist and a successful reforming Premier of Tasmania. I will always remember him as a tremendous person, a man with a great sense of humour who was always positive and optimistic, especially during his courageous battle with cancer. He was an incredibly strong and impressive person. I saw him at his home in Hobart in March, and he was talking about his illness as if it was just some passing problem, something that he could handle with a good laugh or the flick of his hand, something that his spirit would front up to. He was not intimidated; he was strong. He was an impressive person under all conditions. I have never seen such optimism and strength under pressure from anyone. He was a very special person indeed. 
He was also a great character, an Australian original, down to earth and with a great sense of fun. The night before our ALP national conference in Sydney in January there was a presentation where the different state and territory leaders could say a few light-hearted things about their jurisdictions. I remember saying to Jim after it that he was so fair dinkum funny that he could have been a stand-up comedian. He had a wonderful sense of humour, a wonderful sense of timing. He really was an Australian original, and we enjoyed his company so much over the years.
His life was taken early but he achieved a great deal. He was the privately educated son of a professional family in Melbourne. Jim's passions were captured by the revolutionary spirit of our university campuses in the late sixties and early seventies. He was a Maoist in his philosophy at that time and, as he proudly told me in March, he got to China before Gough. These political interests and his social commitment led him to become an official of one of the nation's most active trade unions, the BLF, and that was during its most active period. Jim Bacon was tough and he was loyal—as he needed to be to represent and fight for the interests and rights of working Australians.
In 1980, he moved to Tasmania, ultimately becoming Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council and then entering the state parliament in 1996. He then found his vocation in life as Premier of Tasmania—the job of his life, as he so often said. He loved every minute of it. And it was through his ideas, his reforms and very often his own personal willpower that he transformed that state. He turned the Tasmanian economy around, boosted its population, created jobs, reversed the brain drain and brought back the ferries. He replaced the defeatism of Tasmania's decline in the 1980s with a new spirit of hope and optimism. It was very much his own personal spirit of hope and optimism.
He also believed very strongly in the unity of the Tasmanian people. I know that Jim often thought long and hard—indeed, agonised—about some of the political divisions in the state between environmentalists and advocates of the forestry industry. He wanted to bring Tasmanians together. In the program called Tasmania Together, a communitarian project, he tried to work through the democratic processes, the issues and the differences and to use the power of reason to bring progress to his people and his state. It was an attempt to turn an island state into a community governed by the principles of public service, social justice and tolerance—and it worked. In very large part, it worked.
Jim Bacon was a great Tasmanian and a great leader of his state. He was loved and respected and now, of course, he is missed by so many. On behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I pay tribute to Jim Bacon and convey my sympathy and condolences to his wife Honey, his sons Mark and Scott, his stepson Shane, his mother Joan and his sisters Jenny, Mary and Wendy.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. I draw his attention to the closure of 1,600 bank branches in Australia since 1996, including 450 closures in rural and regional Australia. Prime Minister, will the government now require APRA and the Department of Transport and Regional Services to conduct an independent audit of banking services and request the banks to act on the findings of the audit? If the banks refuse, will the government establish a bank community obligation fund by which the major banks would help to restore banking services around the country, especially in regional areas?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Banking: Branch Closures</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—I might start my response to this question by pointing out to the Leader of the Opposition that the most proactive thing that any government has done about rural services in this country in the last 20 years has been the inauguration of the rural transaction centres program. These are centres which provide basic services in rural areas where the critical mass has made it difficult, on commercial grounds, for banks and other financial institutions to maintain services. There are currently 114 rural transaction centres operating in Australia and a further 126 have been approved.
I might point out to the Leader of the Opposition that this is doing something positive with well-directed government resources to maintain basic services in country areas. It is a proposal that was first conceived back in 1997—seven years ago. In fact, I think I opened the first one. I remember that not long after the last election I paid a very memorable visit to Ganmain in the electorate of the member for Riverina, in which we opened a rural transaction centre. The giroPost initiative is offered at almost 3,000 Australia Post outlets across Australia. I will respond to the Leader of the Opposition in relation to the requirement on the banks, but perhaps I should ask the Leader of the Opposition, rhetorically, of course: will he join me in applauding the rural transaction centres initiative as a great coalition initiative to do something about this problem?
The Labor Party have released a policy on banking. In my view, that policy will impose additional costs on banks, and those costs will be passed on to customers through higher fees and charges or increased interest rates. The $30 million community fund is nothing more than another tax on the banks. The Labor Party's proposal will impose an additional layer of red tape. I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that it is not necessary to legislate for mandatory safety net accounts, as banks already provide no frills accounts to low-income earners, including pensioners. I say to the Leader of the Opposition again: banks already provide no frills accounts to low-income earners, including pensioners. 
While we are talking about bank fees, I also remind the Leader of the Opposition of a bank fee which he opposed the abolition of—that is, the financial institutions duty. The financial institutions duty, which used to collect $1.4 billion from banking customers, was part of taxation reform. Guess who opposed that? Guess who airbrushed that out? That did not get a reference in front of Country Labor yesterday. No, there was no talk of financial institutions duty when the Leader of the Opposition addressed Country Labor yesterday. If the Leader of the Opposition had had his way, bank customers would be paying an additional $1.4 billion. I remind him of the way interest rates have fallen under this government. I remind him of the financial literacy initiatives of the Consumer and Financial Literacy Taskforce, chaired by Mr Paul Clitheroe in February this year. In other words, I do not think the Leader of the Opposition's initiatives will benefit consumers. They tread a path that has been well trodden before by others. They will add complexity and red tape, and of course they fail to acknowledge that, if the Labor Party had had their way, we would still have the financial institutions duty that would be ripping $1.4 billion out of bank customers.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Banking: Branch Closures</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer

"Scott, Bruce, MP",NATS,2004-06-21,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I present the committee's report entitled Australia's maritime strategy.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The inquiry into Australia's maritime strategy has provided an opportunity to examine the relevance and effectiveness of our defence objectives and strategies. Maritime strategies are significant in military planning because they provide the means to apply power flexibly over a range of contingencies and areas. Modern maritime strategy involves air, sea and land forces operating jointly to influence events in the littoral together with traditional blue-water maritime concepts of sea denial and sea control. The role and influence of maritime strategies are therefore a significant feature of credible military strategies.
The inquiry found that there was a need for a comprehensive national security strategy which would articulate all the elements that the Australian government has at its disposal to address issues of national security. This builds on a similar recommendation made by the committee in 2000 as part of its report From phantom to force. A national security strategy would address more than just issues of defence. It would address Australia's key interests, such as economic, business, diplomatic, trade and environmental interests. The national security strategy would indicate where our maritime strategy fits within this grand strategy.
Australia's interests are not just limited to our territory but stretch throughout the region and globally. Our defence objectives and strategy must therefore reflect the need to defend Australia and its direct approaches, together with a greater focus on, and acquisitions of, capabilities to operate in the region and globally in defence of our non-territorial interests. 
The committee has recommended that the government develop a new defence white paper for issue during 2005-06. The new white paper should take into account the findings of the committee and, in particular, the need for more flexible joint forces capable of littoral manoeuvre. In addition, a new defence white paper should be developed every four years through a rolling four-year program. This will ensure that Australia's defence strategy will remain current and can meet developments in the global strategic environment. The proposed new white paper should ensure that the Australian Defence Force can implement the key features of a modern maritime strategy, including sea denial, sea control and power projection ashore for the purpose of peace keeping and regional assistance missions.
In addition to the key recommendations detailed above, the committee recommended that the Department of Defence should review the number of air-to-air refuelling—AAR—aircraft that it will need to mount effective operations. The committee is of the view that Defence may require more AARs than has currently been planned. The Department of Defence should continue to examine air combat capabilities in the region and the cost of ongoing upgrades to the FA18A versus its fatigue and ageing. If the F35 will not be available by 2012, the government should give cost details of prolonging the lifespan of the FA18A and provide details on the range of options to maintain air superiority in the region. The government's decision to purchase three air warfare destroyers for delivery by about 2013 is supported. The Department of Defence, however, should explain how adequate air protection will be provided to land and naval forces before the air warfare destroyers are delivered. If in 2006 the government confirms that it will purchase the joint strike fighter, the F35, it should consider purchasing some short take-off and vertical landing versions of the F35 for the provision of organic air cover as part of regional operations.
As my time is short, I want to thank members of the committee for their support and work through this process. We have come to a unanimous decision, and I would like to acknowledge the contributions of our chairman, Senator Alan Ferguson, and of the member for Chifley and the member for Brisbane.

Recommendation 3 seeks a statement on an Army sustainability model. One of the most important announcements in the Defence White Paper 2000 was that Australia should be able to maintain a brigade level and a concurrent battalion operation and sustain it in the long term. Clearly that cannot be done. The sustainment model, I accept, is not complete, but this is an area that the subcommittee has pursued relentlessly. I still believe there are many questions to be answered.
Recommendation 4 seeks to have a ministerial statement outlining Army Reserve policy, focusing on the reserves, training, effectiveness, equipment, capability, readiness, transition to new functions, blending with regular units and detailed costs. An area of ongoing concern for the subcommittee is the purchase of the F35—not the purchase itself but rather any capability gap and the use of the FA18. In particular, we are calling for ongoing assessment and costs of the FA18 versus fatigue and ageing. Indeed, in relation to the annual report, we are proposing to have a further public meeting on this very issue, because the defence subcommittee are not satisfied to date with the answers that have been provided. The recommendation looks at the decision to retire the F111. Again, the subcommittee believe that that is an important option, should there be a gap in the provision of the F35. The Air Force has already indicated it expects to have that capability in service by 2014, so there is a two-year gap. We should maintain the option of looking at the F111 just in case.
I urge honourable members to read this report. Its genesis comes from our experience in East Timor, where our serving men and women performed admirably, but clearly there were shortcomings. If we are to give meaning and reality to being able to deploy a brigade level and a concurrent battalion and sustain them in the longer term, maritime strategy will be very important. In the end, maritime strategy is not just about Navy, it is not just about Air Force and it is not just about Army; it is the way the three services interact with what Professor Dibb has described as `the arc of instability'.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I am pleased to present the Superannuation (Entitlements of Same Sex Couples) Bill 2004 but I am disappointed that I have to do this once again. The Superannuation (Entitlements of Same Sex Couples) Bill 2004 was once titled 1998, because it has been before this chamber for six years. There is allegedly now a consensus in the parliament that same-sex couples are entitled to equal treatment with regard to their superannuation. I certainly believe that equality in this area should be a first step to achieving equality across the board and I support the removal of discrimination against same-sex couples.
But I am not alone. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia supports my bill, as do various private sector organisations and the ACTU. Indeed, the Senate had an inquiry into my bill for which it received hundreds of submissions in support of the bill and only three in opposition. It is quite clear that, at a time when someone's partner dies, the last thing they should be subjected to as a grieving partner is a wrangle over superannuation rights. The case for this reform is therefore very clear. The government will say that it has fixed the reform through an amendment to its choice bill, which is a retrograde bill with regard to superannuation, that came about through a deal with the Australian Democrats.
There are a number of problems in that, because the government has failed to take the step of redefining the term `spouse', as my bill does, to acknowledge the fact that these days spouses are diverse and should include same-sex partners. As a result, even though the reform is a step forward, same-sex couples will still be required to prove both financial and emotional interdependence, and they will be excluded from other benefits of the superannuation and taxation system such as the spouse contribution rebate. 
There are other concerns about whether the bill will cover same-sex couples in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. There is also a concern about whether they will be able to benefit from the superannuation legislation, because the Income Tax Assessment Act is not being amended to allow same-sex couples to receive the same taxation concessions that are currently available to heterosexual couples. You might think that is because the government will not acknowledge that same-sex relationships can be as legitimate and important as heterosexual relationships, but a contradiction in the government's policy on this has been drawn to my attention. It is in the government's Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004. Schedule 3 of that bill, `Associating with terrorist organisations', seeks to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995, subsection 102.1(1) of the Criminal Code and to insert the following definition:
... close family member of a person means:
the person's spouse, de facto spouse or same-sex partner;
The government can make the leap towards an acknowledgement of same-sex couples when it comes to the antiterrorism bill, but they cannot make that leap when it comes to superannuation. Whilst an interdependent relationship between, say, two sisters can be very important and valid—and there is argument for the need for reform there—that is not the same as a sexual, loving relationship between either two men or two women. That is not the same, and the government refuses to take that step with regard to superannuation legislation. Frankly, I am disappointed that the Democrats have caved in on this issue and have not supported full reform. The Labor Party in government will remove discrimination in this area and also in taxation, immigration and a range of areas, after a full audit of all Commonwealth legislation. This would be an important step. I commend the bill to the House.

"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I present the Australian Design Rules Amendment Bill 2004. This bill amends the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 to ensure that passenger motor vehicles are fitted with a spare wheel and tyre of similar design specifications to the standard wheels and tyres fitted to the vehicle. Failure to comply, unless with the minister's exception, will see the vehicle fail to meet Australian standards. This bill will ensure that the safety of the Australian motoring public will not be compromised by the increasing use by motor vehicle manufacturers of temporary use spare or space-saver tyres. Temporary use spare tyres, or TUSTs, come in a variety of forms. The most commonly used TUST is the traditional space-saver tyre. They have a reduced width, reduced radius and a brightly painted, usually yellow, rim. Sports cars or luxury cars are usually fitted with these space-saver tyres, and some popular small cars are also fitted with them. Another type of TUST is a small wheel spare tyre. It is a smaller and usually cheaper wheel from the same but less luxurious model of vehicle. This tyre may look like a full-size tyre, but its dimensions differ from those actually fitted to the vehicle. Some manufacturers are also fitting a full-size spare tyre on a steel rim, although the vehicle is fitted with alloy rims as a standard feature. Worst of all, some manufacturers do not equip their vehicles with spare tyres at all. They go for two options, either supplying run-flat tyres, which are designed so the vehicle is driven a limited distance when the tyre is punctured, or repair kits—in other words, they supply no spare tyre, just a kit to temporarily seal a puncture, expecting you to then somehow reinflate the tyre, which will need to be repaired properly at a later time. Although some vehicle designs such as luxury sports cars can only accommodate space-saver tyres, other manufacturers are compromising safety deliberately, to save money. Standards need to be assessed so that the Australian motoring public are not put in unnecessarily dangerous situations due to this practice. 
Research shows that the practice of putting in a different spare tyre to the standard full-size tyre equipped on the vehicle is now so prevalent that there is a one-in-four chance that a given model in motor vehicle showrooms across Australia has a smaller, inferior spare. These space-saving and cost-effective tyres compromise motor vehicle safety, and this bill seeks to ensure that manufacturers equip new vehicles with full-size standard tyres instead of temporary use spares. Most drivers are not even aware that they have a space saver as a spare—a narrow tyre with a yellow rim—until they have a flat. They open their boot to find a small, short-term tyre that is only designed for emergency use.
Studies have shown that these temporary tyres compromise a vehicle's handling ability and increase braking distances. The space saver is the worst. Its smaller radius and width compared to the car's standard tyre affect the motorist's emergency handling of the vehicle. There is a reduced ability for the tyre to handle extreme loads during emergency braking, swerving and cornering. In one automobile club test, a space-saver tyre fitted to the front axle of a small vehicle without an anti-lock braking system increased braking distances by 15.4 metres or 3½ car lengths. Cornering traction is also affected, in particular on heavy vehicles such as four-wheel drives where grip levels deteriorated as much as 13 per cent. In the international standards test for emergency lane changing—the moose test—space-saver tyres significantly increase the difficulty of emergency swerving without the vehicle becoming unstable. Under emergency braking and swerving in vehicles without an anti-lock braking system, the motorist experiences difficulties in keeping control of the vehicle. When trying to stop quickly the wheel locks and emergency braking causes the vehicle to pull to one side of the road and causes flat spots in the tyre.
People may say that the occurrence of flat tyres and the consequent need to use your spare is pretty rare. However, in the period from June last year to the end of May this year, the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia received 18,738 roadside assistance calls from members with flat tyres. This figure excludes motorists with the means and ability to change a tyre themselves. That is a fair few dozen flat tyres and probably an increase in the number of shocked motorists who realise when they change their flat tyre for the first time that their car is equipped with a substandard version of their normal tyres. The Motor Vehicle Standards Act in its current form does not ensure that motor vehicles are fitted with spare wheels at all, let alone standard-sized wheels. A national standard must be set so that Australian motorists are not compromised in their safety on the roads. 
Of course, the type of road surface and weather conditions are probably the most influential factors in creating the safety concerns about TUSTs, but there is a more important issue here. Manufacturers are knowingly putting unsafe equipment in vehicles, and unsuspecting motorists' safety is at risk. Consider the outback roads and highways in Australia. The distances between some towns and cities are immense. A flat tyre between populous places would require the use of a temporary spare tyre to limp on to the next service centre. It would involve a few days wait in some of the remotest locations just for metropolitan dealers to freight the replacement tyre to such places. If vehicles were fitted with a full-sized spare, at least a motorist would be able to travel quickly and safely to the nearest service centre, avoiding unsafe travel conditions not only for themselves but for other road users as well.
This bill is all about road safety, preventing unnecessary risks to motorists and ensuring motor vehicle manufacturers take responsibility for the vehicles they are producing so that the Australian motoring public's safety is not compromised. I commend the bill to the House.

"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—My grievance this afternoon is about the recent round of Community Settlement Services Scheme funding for 2004-05 and, in particular, the shock defunding of two organisations, the Victorian Immigrant and Refugee Women's Coalition and the Victorian Arabic Social Services. This year's round of CSSS funding has seen at least 10 current programs lose funding nationally. Six of those programs are in my home state of Victoria. The reasons that have been given by DIMIA for the defunding of the two organisations I wish to speak about this afternoon are, as far I am concerned, far from satisfactory. I would like to take this opportunity to call on the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Minister Hardgrave, to immediately review DIMIA's decision to defund both the Victorian Arabic Social Services and the Victorian Immigrant and Refugee Women's Coalition.
The Victorian Arabic Social Services—affectionately known as VASS—is based in my electorate of Calwell and services hundreds of Arabic-speaking residents, from newly arrived families to young people—especially young boys—and women in the Broadmeadows area. VASS was founded 25 years ago and evolved from a lobby group into a comprehensive and highly professional service provider. VASS is a non-political, non-religious and non-sectarian agency which was founded on the basis that it would represent the welfare needs of and provide advocacy for all Arabic-speaking communities on an inclusive basis. The operative word to describe the strength of VASS is `inclusive.' It is a very inclusive organisation.
Another strength of the organisation, as well as its inclusiveness, is its proficient understanding of the language and culture of the people it services. This is an organisation that is providing an important service. VASS has hundreds of families on its books. My office works closely with VASS, and I often seek its advice and guidance on issues—so do other service providers in my electorate, such as the Dianella Community Health Centre and the Hume City Council. 
VASS works closely with other community networks and has become a leader in helping to break down the barriers of racism by developing innovative and creative programs to help the broader Australian community understand Muslim Australians. It works with local schools to develop programs to strengthen links between parents and schools and provides a means by which people of Arabic-speaking backgrounds can participate in the Australian community. It actively promotes citizenship and has recently commenced working very closely with our local job providers to help deal with the very high unemployment amongst the Arabic-speaking community in Broadmeadows and especially the difficulty of young Australians of Arabic background in finding work.
In light of these services, it is fair to suggest that VASS is doing a great job and is a valuable service. Therefore, I cannot for the life of me understand why it was defunded in the current round of CSSS funding. In fact, I am astounded, because there is a huge need for VASS's services in my electorate. We have many emerging migrant and refugee communities and, in particular, a very large Iraqi community. These are new migrants who desperately need settlement services. Because of this senseless decision by DIMIA, a vital service has been arbitrarily terminated and is in fact in danger of being lost altogether. But such is the dedication of the people at VASS that they have said to me they will not turn people away and will in fact continue to provide their services on a voluntary basis, if needs be.
DIMIA's claim—the reason that they put forward for terminating funding to VASS—was that there are other organisations in the surrounding area that offer settlement services to the Arabic community. In their view, that creates an overlap. My grievance this afternoon is not about why one organisation was funded and not the other. I am definitely not here to pit one organisation up against the other, because I am familiar with the other service providers and organisations and I know that they also do a tremendous job and have rightfully received funding. I am here to ask why VASS in particular was defunded, because it certainly should have been funded again. The strange thing about VASS is that it is physically located in the catchment area it services, making it convenient and accessible to its clients. It complements the work of existing services rather than, as DIMIA says, duplicating them.
The second organisation I wish to talk about is the Victorian Immigrant and Refugee Women's Coalition. This is a state-wide advocacy body that addresses the various concerns of refugee women. It works with relevant regional, state and national agencies and monitors the impact of government policies on immigrant and refugee women in Victoria. It has a membership of 58 organisations, with a total individual membership of some 2,000 people. It was launched in 1998. It received a two-year grant out of the 2002 CSSS funding, which enabled it to hire a full-time worker. Its current activities include: mentoring programs; a multicultural women's cooperative; training women for work in the hospitality area; and referral and training support for 30 grassroots women's groups. It functions as a policy forum. It has an employment partnership program, an English conversation program, a multicultural women's choir, volunteer training courses and leadership programs. As you can see, it too is conducting much needed work—work which is innovative and far reaching. Again, I am unable to understand why it was defunded in the current CSSS round. The defunding will result in the organisation losing 90 per cent of its funding, which will mean that it will no longer be able to employ staff. Certainly the wonderful programs that it runs will cease, and the organisation will simply fold. I wonder what sense there is in making that decision. 
Again, the organisation was told by DIMIA that it had been defunded because it had failed to meet its outcomes. Given the nature of its work—and, as you can see, it is very extensive and highly professional work—how could anyone believe the excuse that it had failed to meet its outcomes? The excuse seems even more curious when we are told that DIMIA never ever mentioned to the organisation that it was not meeting its outcomes. In fact, in the last 18 months there has been no indication—not a word—from DIMIA that it was not happy with the organisation's performance. It is nothing less than an outrage that it should be slapped with this highly unflattering report card and lose its funding.
Rather than the excuses that have been put forward in relation to these organisations—that is, the claims of duplication of services or, indeed, alleged failure to meet outcomes—the defunding of these organisations is, in my view, a case of selective penny-pinching by the government, which has overseen massive cutbacks in service programs across the board, particularly in the area of multicultural services. These are cutbacks to the service sector and, as I have said, they are not the result of a lack of money, because this government has truckloads of money, as we have seen in recent times. Rather, these cutbacks are the consequence of the government's misguided and inhumane priorities when it comes to the delivery of services.
There is obviously no extra money to expand rather than reduce settlement programs, but the government has no problem in lashing out $6 million to buy the Maygar Barracks in Broadmeadows for a new 200-bed detention centre. It also has no qualms about spending $7 million upgrading the Maribyrnong detention centre, even though it is going to sell it in a few years. Obviously there is money to burn—it is just that it is being spent in the wrong areas. Imagine how many settlement programs that money would fund. There is money for detention centres but there is no money for services. Those are twisted priorities from an opportunistic government. My electorate is worse off because of those twisted priorities.
If the government is serious about enhancing our multicultural society and about easing the transition of migrants and refugees in the Australian community it should take immediate action to redress this stupidity and restore funding to these organisations. The minister must review the decision, otherwise we will have no reason to believe anything other than that this government is not really committed to servicing the needs of migrant communities and is simply playing politics with multiculturalism—playing favourites with multiculturalism. I ask the minister, finally: if these groups were able to pose a serious threat to the government in this election year, would he immediately move to restore their funding, as has been the case with other groups?

That amendments be agreed to.
On Friday, 18 June 2004, the Senate agreed to two amendments to the Tourism Australia Bill 2004 and the Tourism Australia (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004. The purpose of these bills is to establish Tourism Australia, which is a key element in the delivery of the coalition government's $235 million tourism white paper, and to repeal the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987.
The effect of the Senate amendments will be to increase the proposed size of the board of Tourism Australia from eight to 10 and to add the skill in Indigenous tourism or culture to the pool of skills required for suitable appointees to the board of Tourism Australia. This unique tourism product must be carefully nurtured and managed to ensure that both domestic and international visitors alike have an opportunity to learn about Indigenous culture in Australia. Accordingly, the government supports the Senate amendment dealing with the skills in Indigenous tourism or culture—that is, we support the amendment to clause 14(1) of the Tourism Australia Bill 2004. The government also supports the Senate amendment to clause 12(e) of the Tourism Australia Bill 2004, aimed at increasing the overall size of the Tourism Australia board by two, to a total of 10 members. These amendments will allow the board to have a broader expertise base in the areas outlined in clause 14 of the Tourism Australia Bill 2004.
I would like to acknowledge the constructive contribution of the ALP and the Australian Democrats to the Tourism Australia legislation. I would also particularly like to thank Senators Kerry O'Brien and Aden Ridgeway for facilitating the passage of the bill through the Senate. I would also like to thank the Prime Minister and his staff, and in particular Hellen Georgopoulos, my ministerial colleagues and the coalition's Friends of Tourism members for their ongoing support of the tourism industry and the white paper process, especially during the development of the legislation to establish Tourism Australia. I also commend the Australian tourism industry for its contribution to the implementation of the tourism white paper and its role in the development of a long-term, sustained and profitable growth industry.
The Tourism Australia Bill 2004 and the Tourism Australia (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004 signify the beginning of a new era in government-industry collaboration in tourism. The passage of these bills through the parliament will enable Tourism Australia to be established and will facilitate the implementation of the tourism white paper, which is the most far-reaching reform and resourcing package of the tourism industry ever undertaken by an Australian government.

"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I rise to speak briefly on the Tourism Australia Bill 2004 and the Tourism Australia (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004. As I remarked when the Tourism Australia Bill 2004 was originally tabled, it is largely the result of the new-found professionalism of the tourism industry's advocacy bodies. They are to be congratulated on their input into the tourism white paper and these bills. I say that these bills and the white paper are largely the result of the industry's input for we know well that elements of the package have been designed by the government for the benefit of the government rather than the industry.
As part of our diligent consideration of legislation, Labor initiated an inquiry by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee into the provisions of the Tourism Australia Bill. The outcome of the inquiry was that Labor undertook to move a number of amendments if needed and determined to move another. At the time of the hearing, there was great concern amongst the staff of the Bureau of Tourism Research and the Tourism Forecasting Council that they would be severely disadvantaged by the move from the public sector to the new statutory authority, Tourism Australia. Labor undertook that, if required, we would move an amendment to protect those staff. I am, however, happy to report that, under pressure from Labor and the CPSU, the government has now provided transfer and working conditions suitable to affected staff and, as such, that amendment is no longer required. I congratulate the CPSU and Labor shadow minister for tourism, Senator O'Brien, for the fine job they have done in looking after the interests of these staff.
Also as part of Labor's diligent consideration of these bills, we took on board concerns from the South Australian government regarding the reappointment of board members together with ensuring the regard Tourism Australia must have for state and territory marketing plans and activities. After discussions between Labor's Senator O'Brien, Minister Lomax-Smith and the office of the federal minister, Labor has been satisfied that these amendments are no longer required.
The Tourism Australia Bill as originally drafted made no provision for Indigenous tourism to be represented on the board of Tourism Australia. The development of the Indigenous tourism industry will encourage greater awareness and understanding of Australia's unique and enduring Indigenous culture and permit Indigenous communities to enjoy greater economic independence. Therefore, Labor formed the view that such an omission from the bills and the board was untenable.
After extensive negotiation with Indigenous tourism leaders, Minister Hockey's office and the Australian Democrats, I am pleased to say that Labor's amendment to rectify this situation has been accepted by the government in the Senate. Labor's amendment provides the Minister for Small Business and Tourism with the capacity to appoint members to the Tourism Australia board based on their Indigenous tourism or cultural knowledge experience. Labor's amendment will help to ensure that the entire tourism industry benefits from the activities of an organisation whose leaders possess the right mix of skills and experience, including knowledge of Indigenous tourism or culture. These are better bills on account of Labor's amendment and I think that, as such, Tourism Australia will be an organisation better able to serve the entire Australian tourism industry. I commend Labor's amendment to the House.
 (Hon. D.G.H. Adams)—The question is that the amendments be agreed to.

"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NATS,2004-06-21,"—I move:
That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 17 June 2004, namely: Program of security enhancement projects around Parliament House.
This motion proposes to improve the security of Parliament House through a program of three security enhancement projects. These projects will provide additional security measures that will reduce the risk of attack on Parliament House using vehicle-borne explosive devices. The program of projects includes Parliament Drive security barriers, car park changes at the ministerial wing end of the building and work on the ministerial wing windows.
The Parliament Drive works involve construction of a low wall around the inside of Parliament Drive to prevent unauthorised vehicle access to the building, substantial redevelopment to the parade ground to prevent unauthorised vehicle access to the forecourt and the installation of retractable bollards to all slip roads to allow only authorised vehicle access to parliament's entrances.
The ministerial wing car park works involve the closure of the ministerial wing ground level car park, which currently allows unchecked parking within seven metres of ministerial wing windows, and consequential works to the Melbourne Avenue car parks to restrict access to pass holders and Commonwealth vehicles and to compensate for the loss of parking spaces outside the ministerial wing.
The ministerial wing windows works involve the installation of silicon sealant to prevent sheets of window glass from projecting into the office areas on the ground floor and first floor windows and a shatter-resistant film to the second floor windows of the south-facing ministerial wing windows. The estimated cost of the works is $11.7 million. These funds have been provided in the Department of Parliamentary Services budget for 2004-05.
Projects are scheduled to be completed by 31 March 2005. This will enable the existing white plastic vehicle barriers to be removed. Unscreened pedestrian access to the roof of the building will continue to be prevented through the installation of a temporary fence and the continued deployment of significant numbers of APS officers.
Works approval from the National Capital Authority has been granted. Under section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974 the presiding officers are responsible for works within the parliamentary precincts and the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads is responsible for other works in the parliamentary zone. Accordingly, this motion is moved on behalf of the Speaker and President. I commend the motion to the House.

That the amendments be disagreed to.
The Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004 is part of a national framework to support the state and territory reforms to the law of negligence. The approach being taken was developed as a result of extensive consultation and hard work by the Australian, state and territory governments. The reforms are supported by all jurisdictions and have been applauded by industry and stakeholders both here and overseas. In fact, reforms undertaken to implement this framework have already begun to make liability insurance more affordable and available to community groups and businesses throughout Australia. 
The government has worked with state and territory ministers, industry representatives and other key stakeholders to develop a national resolution. The bill before the parliament today is a key component in implementing this resolution. The bill draws on the findings of an expert panel established at the May 2002 ministerial meeting on public liability insurance and chaired by the Hon. Justice David Ipp. The panel was established to assist governments to formulate a consistent and principled approach to reforming liability laws. The Senate moved a number of amendments to the legislation which are inconsistent with the panel's findings and which the government does not accept.
Amendment (1) incorporates the misleading and deceptive conduct provisions into the 2004 bill. This amendment proposes to extend the application of measures contained in this bill to conduct in contravention of part V, division 1, of the Trade Practices Act 1974. This would have the effect of allowing actions for personal injuries and death in contravention of part V, division 1, of the act, subject to the proposed thresholds, caps and limitations regime contained in this bill. This amendment is contrary to the recommendations of the review of the law of negligence, which reflected concerns for the no-fault dimension of part V, division 1, that this part of the act was not originally intended to apply to claims for personal injuries and death. The scope for framing claims for personal injuries or death would remain in the misleading and deceptive conduct provisions if this amendment were accepted, allowing the potential for actions under this part of the act to undermine state and territory civil liability reforms.
Amendments (2) to (6) relate to special arrangements for claims for personal injuries caused by tobacco use made under the Trade Practices Act 1974. These amendments are not supported for a number reasons. The Australian government is already pursuing a broad range of policies in relation to tobacco control appropriate to its jurisdiction. The approach suggested by the Senate lacks any basis in principle which would justify exempting tobacco related injuries from national benchmarks on damages and limitation of actions but not other injuries. There is no principal reason why special arrangements should apply for injuries caused by the use of tobacco products. Additionally, while recent civil liability law reforms in a number of states and territories have been framed so as to not apply to tobacco claims, there has been no clear consensus between states and territories as to this approach. Accordingly, the House of the Representatives should not accept these amendments.",REPS,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—While I do not have responsibilities for this particular package, the opposition certainly found some inconsistencies in the way the government addressed these public liability issues under various parts of the Corporations Law. We are matching the states' capping regime in some areas but not in others. I think that is the basis of the Senate amendments—I am not sure. Given that the shadow minister responsible is not able to be here for reasons of illness, I make the point that Labor stands by its amendments as sought in the Senate.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—The Excise and Other Legislation Amendment (Compliance Measures) Bill 2004 will assist the ATO in its efforts to ensure compliance with Australia's excise regime. I suspect that we do not always give sufficient weight to these issues in this place, but the fact is that large benefits can be made from selling excisable goods on the black market. It is a lucrative activity for criminal elements in our society. Excisable goods are currently subject to a stringent regime to prevent revenue leakage. For example, a licence is required to produce and store excisable goods. However, people are always looking for ways to avoid their taxation obligations. It is perhaps as big a problem as income tax avoidance, but with a more violent tinge: for example, chop-chop—or illegal tobacco—represents a sizeable component of the tobacco market in Australia and a huge area of revenue leakage for the government. It also represents a major security issue for our tobacco farmers.
The bill includes a number of measures to enhance the compliance provisions of the excise regime and simplify the administrative arrangements. This will help the ATO administer the excise regime. Schedule 1 of the bill enables the Commissioner of Taxation to control the delivery of excisable goods for export through issuing permits and, if the commissioner is not satisfied that the goods have been exported or otherwise accounted for, require payment of the excise duty equivalent. At present, excisable goods may be moved from excise-licensed premises for export if they have authority from Customs. This creates a dual system for excisable goods in which the Commissioner of Taxation is responsible for excise collection but Customs has jurisdiction when goods are for export. Providing the Commissioner of Taxation with complete control over excisable goods will improve his ability to enforce the law and protect revenue.
Schedule 2 of the bill amends the Excise Act 1901 to include tobacco seed and plants in provisions requiring the Commissioner of Taxation's permission to move tobacco leaf. In addition, it introduces penalty provisions where tobacco seed, plant and leaf for export are not moved within a time period specified in the permission for such movement. The illegal tobacco trade represents a major revenue risk in Australia. While tobacco seed, plant and unprocessed leaf are not excisable, the Excise Act 1901 does provide significant controls over their production, dealing and storage. The amendments in this schedule will further enhance the ability of the commissioner to stamp out the illegal tobacco trade and protect revenue.
Schedule 3 of the bill will expand the class of seized goods that can be immediately disposed of following seizure, and provides for the retention of samples. However, the bill also enables owners to recover the market value of the goods disposed of if it is shown that the grounds for seizure and disposal did not exist. These amendments are largely aimed at destroying seized tobacco and illegal alcohol, which currently do not automatically fall within the category of goods that can be destroyed following seizure. 
Schedule 4 of the bill will allow the disclosure of licence, permission and remission arrangements to a second person where disclosure is considered necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Excise Act. The Act has a comprehensive licensing system for the production and dealing of tobacco and the manufacture and storing of excisable goods generally and provides for licences to be suspended or cancelled under certain circumstances. Currently, the confidentiality provisions of the act prevent the ATO from disclosing information about excise licences and permissions to a second person also dealing with the goods under the excise legislation.
Information on whether a person is licensed or has permission to deal with particular goods or quantities of goods is at times a prerequisite for a second person to comply with the provisions of the legislation. For example, if a tobacco grower has lost their licence to legally grow tobacco then a potential buyer of that tobacco needs to be informed so that they do not inadvertently buy illegally grown tobacco. The amendments would ensure that in these circumstances the ATO could pass on relevant information to a second person. Labor is happy to lend its support to the bill.",REPS,<title>EXCISE AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPLIANCE MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Prosser, Geoff, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—I rise to speak today in support of the Excise and Other Legislation Amendment (Compliance Measures) Bill 2004. This bill proposes to amend the Excise Act 1901 to provide the Australian Taxation Office with greater compliance provisions for revenue protection and improve administrative arrangements in respect of the payment of excise.
The bill contains four groups of amendments, each contained in separate schedules to the bill. The first such schedule deals with the delivery of excisable goods for export. The fundamental control of the Commissioner of Taxation over all excisable goods is provided for in section 61 of the Excise Act 1901. Other controls include permission requirements and offences for contravening those requirements over the movement of excisable goods on which duty has not been paid. However, movement of excisable goods for exportation may occur without the permission given under excise legislation. 
At present, excisable goods on which duty has not been paid may be moved away from excise licensed premises for exportation on the basis of an authority to deal with the goods provided by Customs. This authority is taken as permission to move the goods from an excise licensed place to a place prescribed under the Customs Act 1901. This means that excisable goods pass out of the Commissioner of Taxation's controls upon delivery of the goods to a Customs licensed premises. Accordingly, the Australian Taxation Office is unable to apply the usual compliance and revenue protection measures to the movement of these goods that it may provide to all other movements of excisable goods.
The current arrangement dates back to the time when Customs administered both customs and excise legislation. With the separation of these functions it is necessary to update the provisions to ensure adequate compliance arrangements. The diversion of excisable goods from export, particularly tobacco products, is considered to be high risk. There have been instances where excisable goods for export have not reached the place of export or have been diverted from within the place of export. In other cases, the goods have not reached their overseas destinations and it is unclear to where they have been diverted. Containers have been found empty or not containing the goods as described. 
The proposed changes will therefore specify that the commissioner may instead give permission for the delivery for exportation and will enable excisable goods for which an export authority has been withdrawn to be returned to a specific place and provide that this movement must be in accordance with the commissioner's declaration. The amendments will also extend the provisions that allow the commissioner to demand payment of excise where a person has not kept the goods safe or cannot otherwise account for the goods—that is, the commissioner will have the power to recover excise in relation to goods that go missing without evidence of where they were exported to.
These amendments are aimed at persons who attempt to avoid payment of excise by exploiting weaknesses in the ATO's ability to control the movement of such goods that are or were ostensibly intended for export. The weakness relates to movements of goods that are legislatively under ATO control but are actually authorised by the Australian Customs Service. Such authorisations originate from the fact that Customs used to administer both customs and excise legislation, whereas excise, as I mentioned, is now administered by the ATO.
The second group of amendments applies specifically to the movement of tobacco seed, plant and leaf and aims to provide consistency in provisions and offences relating to movement of the range of tobacco products. Tobacco manufactured as specified in the Excise Tariff Act 1921 is an excisable good and is dealt with in the excise legislation under the arrangements applying to excisable goods. However, the illicit trade in tobacco is considered a major revenue risk and, while unprocessed tobacco seed, plant and leaf are not excisable, the Excise Act 1901 provides considerable controls on their production, dealing and storage, which must be carried out under an excise licence.
The Excise Act 1901 requires permissions for movement of tobacco leaf and applies substantial penalties, including imprisonment, for offences of unauthorised movement of tobacco leaf and unlawful buying, selling and possession of tobacco seed, plant and leaf. The Excise Act currently provides that permission is required from the commissioner for movement of tobacco leaf only. The proposed changes will include tobacco seed and tobacco plant in these provisions. The changes also provide for an offence where tobacco seed, plant and leaf delivered for export are not exported within a specified time. I note that new section 44(8) adds a provision making it an offence where a person has permission to deliver tobacco seed, plant or leaf for export and the tobacco seed, plant or leaf is not exported within 30 days—or other period specified in the permission—after the day of delivery, and the person fails to return the seed, plant or leaf to a place specified in the permission for its return within five days after the end of the 30 days or other specified period. 
The third group of amendments proposes to extend the criteria for the immediate disposal of seized goods and to enable evidentiary certificates to be used in proceedings in relation to those goods. These changes will streamline administration of excise prosecutions by removing the costly need to store large quantities of illegal products, while providing appropriate safeguards for the rights of the owners.
The Excise Act enables the commissioner to destroy seized goods if they are perishable and constitute a danger to public health. However, in most cases seized excisable goods or tobacco seed, plant or leaf do not satisfy both the perishable and danger to public health criteria. Seized forfeited goods may constitute a public health risk only if returned to the owner or the market. They may only be perishable without special storage arrangements. For example, tobacco is highly perishable but can be preserved with special storage arrangements. Goods may be neither a public health risk nor perishable but cannot be returned to the market as they do not meet applicable quality standards. For example, alcohol extended with other products or illegally blended petroleum that would not meet the relevant food or fuel standards respectively do not meet the current criteria for immediate destruction. Such goods are generally not perishable and whether or not they are a danger to public health depends on the contents. However, they cannot be appropriately returned to the market. The proposed amendments therefore alter the provisions to provide for immediate destruction where the goods are perishable or do not meet any applicable quality standard or the goods, if made available to the public, would constitute a risk to public health or public safety. 
However, where the goods are destroyed, provisions will be made for sampling and recording of goods, appointment of an analyst and use of evidentiary and analyst certificates in proceedings. Also, to protect the rights of the owner of goods, the proposed amendments will include a provision that ensures the owner has a right to recovery of the market value of the destroyed goods where a court is satisfied that the grounds on which the goods were destroyed did not exist, and in such cases compensation will be payable.
The fourth group of amendments relates to confidentiality and aims to improve compliance arrangements by enabling licensing information about a person to be disclosed to another person where it is necessary in order for that other person to comply with the law. The Excise Act 1901 has a comprehensive licensing system for the production of, and dealing in, tobacco and the manufacture and storing of excisable goods generally and provides for licences to be suspended or cancelled in certain circumstances. In addition, through permission requirements and offences for contravening these requirements, there are controls over the movement and possession of tobacco seed, plant and leaf and other excisable goods. Licences or permissions may be subject to certain conditions such as restriction to specified quantities of goods. 
The excise legislation confidentiality provisions prevent the Australian Taxation Office from disclosing information about excise licences and permissions to a second person also dealing with the goods under the excise legislation. Information on whether a person is licensed or has permission to deal with particular goods or quantities of goods is at times a prerequisite for a second person to comply with the provisions of the legislation. The problem is illustrated in the illicit trade in tobacco, which poses a significant risk to the revenue base. It is an offence for a person to buy tobacco seed, leaf or plant from an unlicensed producer, manufacturer or dealer. However, the ATO is unable to provide information about licence status and conditions. 
Therefore, a tobacco cooperative with a dealer's licence cannot be advised whether a member is licensed as a producer or when a member's licence is cancelled or suspended. A tobacco grower cannot be informed if the company to which tobacco is to be sold is licensed. Where a licence is cancelled, it may be necessary to amend or cancel permissions held by suppliers for the movement of goods to the person whose licence has been cancelled. Currently, the ATO cannot give the permission holder information relating to the cancelled licence, despite the fact that it will need to amend or cancel the permission. 
There are also disclosure issues around remission certificates, which are administrative documents stating that the holder may obtain quantities of excisable goods from a supplier according to the conditions set out in the regulation. These conditions normally allow the holder to obtain goods at concessional or duty-free rates—for example, alcohol for industrial purposes. A supplier to a remission certificate holder may need to be informed that a remission certificate has been amended or cancelled. Therefore, the proposed changes will allow disclosure of information about the licence of a person to another person who is dealing with the goods. The disclosure will be permitted when the information is necessary to ensure that the second person's dealings will not contravene provisions of the Excise Act. The various measures contained in this bill assist the effectiveness of the ongoing campaign by the ATO against the illegal tobacco sector and require a greater accountability of persons involved in the tobacco and export sectors. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>EXCISE AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPLIANCE MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2004-06-21,"—Neither of the previous speakers, even though they were very erudite about the Excise and Other Legislation Amendment (Compliance Measures) Bill 2004, referred to the very serious nature of what is going on in the tobacco industry in Australia as far as revenue goes. Tobacco manufacturers in Australia claim that $600 million a year is being lost in revenue to the tax department. I confronted the two senior officers of the tax department with that figure and they said, `It is less than that now,' which was of course an admission that it was that figure at the time. I said, `Would you like to speculate as to what the figure is now?' They would not, but they said, `It is less than that now.'
I must say that I inferred from the tone of their statements that many hundreds of millions of dollars are still being lost to Australian revenue. I notice one of the public servants shaking their head. You can shake your head all you like, but the industry and the manufacturers have produced unassailable figures which show that either suddenly there has been a huge drop in the consumption of tobacco in Australia—which has not occurred; no-one claims that—or someone else is supplying the tobacco; it is not being supplied legally. Only those two alternatives are available, and no-one is denying the huge drop in sales of tobacco as far as the revenue for the federal government is concerned. In other words, the legal trade of cigarettes has dropped suddenly and abysmally from the point of view of tax revenue for the Australian government.
When you are losing hundreds of millions of dollars one would think that you would get off your backside and act fairly expeditiously to try to plug up the hole that exists. If they had asked the people who know about the industry and the forces that are at work inside the industry or if they had listened to us instead of blindly following their mad, free market ideology then they would have known that they could have gone down the pathway of forcing the tobacco companies to take Australian content. The situation previously was that there were mixing regulations enforced by an extremely high tariff regime. The government said they were removing the tariffs and, not surprisingly, the tobacco companies removed the mixing regulations, since they could buy the tobacco more cheaply overseas.
If we were talking about this grand ideology providing benefits for the Australian smoking public—and there would be very few here who would regard that as a laudable target—then it would have been fairly predictable to try to work out a situation in which these farmers could have survived. If you force these farmers into a situation where they have no market for their product—they are on farms far too small to make a living from any alternative crop—then, not unnaturally, given the choice of bankruptcy and the loss of everything they have worked for all of their lives, they might choose another alternative. If some of them have acted outside the law and risked going to jail, they have done that because they love their children and their families very deeply and they are not prepared to face the humiliation of bankruptcy and the trauma and loss that is associated with it. They are not prepared to have their lives blasted after such extremely hard work in Australia. 
The situation in the Mareeba area was that a $70 million industry existed and it brought $23 million of taxation revenue to the Australian government. That industry no longer exists. People in this place seem to think that, somehow or other when you wipe out an industry, another industry comes to take its place. I do not want to quote myself here; I will quote General John Grey, who was appointed by this government as the head of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. He delivered a speech to sugar farmers at Gordonvale, and a very excellent address it was. He said that the strongest argument for protection against the extreme green movement would be to look at what has taken place in Mareeba. You can drive for mile upon mile in Mareeba and see what was a productive part of Australia now simply going back to a wilderness. It is not a wilderness covered in natural flora but mile upon mile of weeds—introduced species which are destructive to the fauna and flora of the Australian environment.
That is not me speaking; that is the man appointed as the head of the Wet Tropics Management Authority—a man who is probably respected by both sides of the green environmental argument. He is dead accurate in saying that. That is what these silly people have achieved. And, according to every commentator, they have cheated themselves out of $600 million a year—which may be down to just hundreds of millions a year now. That is what they have achieved. Ask yourself, Madam Deputy Speaker: is that a good outcome? We put to these people the question: do you think that it is going to be a good outcome to force law-abiding, hard-working farmers into actions which are illegal? Do you think it is good to wipe out a whole industry that is creating meaningful employment for the people of Queensland and Australia? Do you think that is a good outcome? Do you think that destroying another industry and losing the revenue coming into the Australian taxation system is a good idea? Is having to import this product into Australia from offshore a good idea?
For those representing manufacturing areas who are sitting around smugly, there is no way that those factories will not close down and go overseas. It is really quite stupid to import tobacco from a state like Texas in the United States, from Zimbabwe or from China—where, I am told, most of it is coming in from and they can produce it infinitely more cheaply than we can. The 2,000 Australian people that were involved in this industry will vanish without trace and get put onto the scrap heap. We are averaging one suicide a month in these areas, thanks to what the government has done to this and other industries. Has this been a good outcome for this country?
This is taking place on the Atherton Tablelands and in the surrounding coastal areas. Action by the previous Hawke and Keating governments and by the current government has virtually closed the entire fishing and timber industries of North Queensland. It has closed the rice industry of North Queensland. It has pushed the dairy, grape and peanut industries into a situation where one wonders whether they can survive. When the maize industry in Atherton was deregulated, the maize board collapsed, losing tens of millions of dollars for the farmers in that area and driving many of them into bankruptcy. It was only because of the most extreme action taken by people in this House that we were able to get reversed the decision taken by the current Leader of the National Party in relation to the chicken meat industry of Australia. It is a miracle that we had that decision reversed and it is standing upright at the moment. 
We deregulated the wool industry and, to quote Alan Jones, we now have only half a wool industry—an industry that just some 15 years ago, in 1989, provided this country with one-tenth of its entire export earnings. I thought that Mr Jones was exaggerating but I went to the library and found that he was dead accurate. We had 200 million sheep in Australia and now we have 100 million. My area had a lot of sheep. There are hardly any sheep at all left in North Queensland now and they will never come back again. No-one is ever going to put out the huge capital expenditure to get sheep back again.
Madame Deputy Speaker, at the time of speaking to you, it is no news to anyone in this House that the great and mighty sugar industry of Australia—one of our 10 major export-earning industries for almost all of this country's history—is simply collapsing. The government's solution to that problem is to deregulate the industry. Do they seriously think farmers are going to stay in an industry where they are now at the tender mercy of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. or Bundaberg Sugar, which is foreign owned? Of course they are not.
The Mareeba area farmers switched from tobacco to sugar farming. They walked straight into a haymaker which has taken their heads off. It is one of the worst hit industries in Australia. The bigger farmers who had enough land to be able to switch industries borrowed a hell of a lot of money to move from tobacco into sugar, thinking that it was a great industry—it had existed for some 130 years in this country—and that nothing could happen to it. But, in this case, thanks to government inaction on ethanol and thanks to actions by this government in removing the tariff, some $100 million a year has been taken away from us. I think the banana industry battle will be fought in the High Court and I think the government will be humiliated in the High Court—I most certainly hope they will be.
What did the United States do to their tobacco industry? Did they take this sort of action? Whilst we remove the tariffs in this country, the United States put up the tariffs in theirs. They passed legislation increasing their support levels for tobacco farmers to protect them against Zimbabwe and China where poor people work for nothing. They were not going to open their doors and force their people to work for nothing, so they increased their protection levels.
The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, is on record as having said it was disgraceful the way the United States government looked after their farmers—and I said, `That's one thing you'll never be accused of, that's for certain.' That's a problem we won't have with Mr Truss—the problem that created this revenue loss of, even on the department's admission, many hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Every single year we are losing hundreds of millions of dollars, and decent hardworking people have put themselves in jeopardy of going to jail, and a lot of them, when this sort of thing comes upon them, take the very sad way out. We now have one suicide a month taking place. Let that be on the conscience of those people who make the decisions in this place. 
This illegal tobacco is called chop chop. We approached the department about going to the tobacco companies. If you do not want to breach your ideology—and it does not matter that people are shooting themselves, so long as you can keep pure with your ideology; that does not worry you at all—at least let's be sensible about this. If you want to stop the bleeding and the loss of these hundreds of millions of dollars a year, then give these people a way to earn a living legally. There was no chop chop around before the government went down this pathway—or at least not that I have heard about, and no-one has ever claimed there was. Of course, the figures being released by the manufacturers clearly indicate this as well.
We said, `Use a health levy. Put a health levy on cigarettes and put the tariff back on.' But Mr Keating—one of the most monumental disasters that ever befell this nation, with his introduction of national competition policy and everything, all of which has been carried on by this government, so they cannot abuse him or criticise him—bound us to introducing zero tariffs in all agriculture, so that legally we cannot put a tariff back onto any agricultural sector. No other country in the world did this. It was a crazy decision. But there are a few isolated examples, and this is one of them, where a 16 per cent tariff is still available.
So the government has two levers they can use to lean upon the tobacco manufacturers to reinstate this industry. They can reinstate a voluntary code of mixing regulations, where they take 40 per cent to 50 per cent of Australian product into the cigarettes that they are manufacturing in this country. The health levy and the 16 per cent tariff are the levers that they could use to get these people to come to the table. If, for reasons best known to themselves, they are determined to close down farmers in Australia, they could use the health levy to buy these people out—to give them a decent amount of money so that they could retire out of the industry and not be forced down this illegal pathway. Either of those alternatives—providing them with an adequate buyout scheme or forcing the tobacco companies to go to mixing regulations—would have allowed those people to have avoided the horrific circumstance of having to go to illegal activities—having to produce chop chop. That is why this legislation is being passed this evening.
The government is naive beyond belief in the actions that they propose to carry out. There was another country in another part of the world that decided to ban alcohol. I remember the famous words of the great American movie actor, Will Rogers, when he was interviewed as he went to vote in the American congress on prohibition—he was a congressman. They said, `Congressman, how do you think the vote will go today?' He said, `I think they'll vote dry all right, but I'm pretty sure they'll still drink wet.' Of course, he was dead right. If there was one really terrible disaster in the United States which created organised crime and many other horrific outcomes—the corruption of their political system—it was prohibition. It was naive in the extreme to think that you were going to stop people from drinking, and it is naive in the extreme to believe that you can stop people from smoking. Of course, the cost of smoking has gotten so horrifically high that the temptation is always there to have a chop chop industry. But the government precipitated it; the government pressed the trigger. The government pulled the lever that created the chop chop industry. It was not there until the government took away these people's right to make a decent living for themselves. 
We are here today to try and do the impossible: to stop the chop chop industry. The people that know how to grow tobacco in Australia are tobacco farmers—now ex tobacco farmers. You might want to know what those farmers are doing. A large number of them are well on in years. They have simply gone into the town of Mareeba or other places. They have left their farms, waiting for the payment of $7,000 or $8,000 an acre. That is what they have put them on the markets for, but of course they will never get that amount of money for them. I would like to say they are lying fallow, but they are not lying fallow at all. They are growing weeds. We can see the complete deterioration of some 4,000 hectares of what was once a beautiful, productive part of Australia. You used to drive through green fields for 20 or 30 miles, to use the old measurements, and now you drive through what is a national disgrace.
So here is a government that, like the previous government, has put forward an ideology and a system of policies—globalisation, privatisation and competition policies, or the three `-tions' as they refer to them up north. There is no judging these policies on their outcomes. If you want to judge them on outcomes, you should have a look at the destruction of the rice, dairy, grapes, peanuts, maize, wool, sugar and banana industries—and you will get around to knocking off the poultry industry in the long term. Every policy should be judged on its outcomes, and that is what is not happening in this place.

"McGauran, Peter, MP",NATS,2004-06-21,"—I wish to thank the members who have contributed to this debate on the Excise and Other Legislation Amendment (Compliance Measures) Bill 2004. The member for Kennedy has broadened the dimensions of the particularities of the bill before the House to take into account the decline of the tobacco industry of North Queensland. Debate on a bill that deals more specifically with protecting the revenue and giving powers to the Australian Taxation Office of control over tobacco and to regulate any unauthorised movement of these goods has been expanded by the honourable member into a wider debate and discussion about issues of free trade, protection and the like. Time will not allow me to engage with him in as fulsome a manner as that with which he has projected his views this evening.
There are a few facts, though, that do need to lie on the table, I feel. The tobacco industry in Queensland has been in decline for several decades. In 1970 there were 822 tobacco quota holders; 10 years later, in 1980, the number had fallen to 690; by 1993, some 13 years later, it was down to 371; and it was down to 150 tobacco quota holders by the year 2000. The tobacco growing industry in Australia is a comparatively small industry, concentrated in the Myrtleford area in Victoria and the Atherton Tableland in North Queensland. I am told—at the risk of angering the honourable member for Kennedy—that the Victorian producers produce higher quality tobacco for a much lower price than the Queensland producers.
—You are right about my getting angry.
—By way of interjection he does agree that I have angered him. British American Tobacco Australia ceased purchasing tobacco from North Queensland growers at the end of the 2002 growing season; Philip Morris Ltd ceased purchasing at the end of the 2003 season. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry advises that there are currently 124 tobacco growers in Queensland. The 118 growers in North Queensland, who are the responsibility of their local member, the honourable member for Kennedy, sadly no longer have a legal market. The six growers in south Queensland still have a market for their tobacco. In the absence of a market for your tobacco and, given that if a crop were allowed to be grown there would be a risk of diversion to an illegal market, licences have not been granted to the 118 growers in North Queensland, so the honourable member accurately and fairly states the decline of the tobacco industry of North Queensland. The reasons for it, I have to impress on the honourable member, are a great deal more complex and longstanding than an issue of liberalised trade alone. The two companies that purchased tobacco leaf in North Queensland say they have withdrawn for commercial reasons. 
—It's cheaper overseas.
—To a large extent that is true, but I would not want anyone to be left with the impression that the government have abandoned the North Queensland tobacco growers. We have given significant assistance to encourage them to adjust in what has been the inevitable downsizing of their industry. Under the government's Farm Help program, financial assistance is available to tobacco growers choosing to leave farming. Farm Help provides income support and professional advice. Since 1994, Queensland tobacco growers have also had access to two state-funded adjustment packages, totalling over $42 million; and the $18 million Atherton Tableland Sustainable Regions Program from the federal government has been in place since August 2001. That program recognises the historical importance of tobacco to the area and the structural adjustment issues facing the region.
None of this is of comfort to the honourable member—he will see it as bandaid solutions to overall economic policies that have stripped the tobacco industry of North Queensland of its viability. I do believe that the government's measures are responsible and necessary to help the tobacco growers adjust. Clearly, if there is no legal market then licences cannot be granted to the growers for fear of illegal usage of that product. But I cannot accept that this situation is due only to policies of liberalised free trade and so on. There are a great many of Australia's commodity groups, organisations and grassroots farmers who want as free trade as possible—sheep, wool, grains, dairy, beef and many others. So there are differences of opinion about free and liberalised trade even within the agricultural sector as a whole. The speech that the honourable member for Kennedy has just given should be tried out at some of the forums involving those very large, very significant export earners for Australia and for Australian farmers.
It is a complicated and difficult issue at the best of times. Without direct subsidies—and cash payments even—to the North Queensland tobacco growers, it is hard, if not impossible, to see how they could remain viable against even the Victorian tobacco growers, let alone tobacco growers in other countries. Australia enjoys low-cost production relative to many other countries in many commodity areas—coal and liquid natural gas come readily to mind. If we cannot be the world's lowest-cost producer in each and every commodity, nor can any other country. A government, where an industry or a sector of an industry is in decline, has a moral as well as an economic responsibility to assist the transition, and I believe this government has discharged that responsibility.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",REPS,<title>EXCISE AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPLIANCE MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—The Australian Labor Party supports the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Direct Deductions and Other Measures) bill 2004. Indeed, we cannot understand why it sat on the Notice Paper for a couple of months. Some time ago we indicated to the minister's office that we supported it and we expected it to have been dealt with before this. The bill is an omnibus bill extending a range of minor benefits. It also makes a number of technical changes. Part 1 of the bill makes provision for direct deductions. This extends the facility of direct deductions from the current limited range of pensions to include disability pensions and war widows pensions. This will mainly benefit those paying rent to state housing authorities and the ATO. This facility has taken far too long to implement, simply because it should have been provided at the same time as pensions were paid directly into bank accounts. As we know, pensions have not been paid by cheque for a long time. This amendment is very convenient to the Commonwealth and it has cut overheads enormously. The electronic loop for veterans, however, has been incomplete for some time. It is only now as a result of this bill that routine deductions can be made.
It also needs to be realised that computer technology take-up has not been extensive among the older generation. BPay for example, which we all now take for granted, is not an option for many veterans and war widows. Increasingly, too, mobility is a major issue. Many veterans are now in their 80s, and getting to the bank, keeping a cheque account and paying bills is becoming difficult. At least now some will be able to make key payments automatically. Families will not need to worry either. We simply mention, however, that the department needs to make sure that veterans are fully aware of the deductions being made. Similarly we need to be sure that deductions cease properly when required and that full acquittal is made. These are very complex matters for older people, and for most the nature of the pension is such that at the end of a fortnight there is little left over.
Part 2 of the bill provides for an increase in and indexation of the VC allowance. It also amends some redundant provisions with respect to gratuities and makes some minor technical changes. This amendment increases the rate of payment of the Victoria Cross allowance from $2,808 to $3,230 per annum and indexes it by CPI. Again, this is a long overdue change. There are only two Victoria Cross recipients alive at present: Mr Ted Kenna and Mr Keith Payne. We can be sure that they also believe that this added recognition is long overdue. A number of decorations are added to the list set out in section 102 as being eligible for the payment of the decoration allowance. These include the Star of Gallantry and the Medal for Gallantry.
Part 3 of the bill provides for the automatic grant of income support supplement. This amendment extends automatic provision of the income support supplement payable by DVA to all war widows, rather than the current limited range, thus removing an unnecessary anomaly. This amendment will remove a provision whereby widows whose age pensions were paid by DVA on behalf of Centrelink will no longer have to make separate application for ISS. Instead, ISS will be paid automatically, as is currently the case for widows who are paid direct by DVA. This is an important provision in that it streamlines the provisions. It also helps rationalise the methods of payment and processes for war widows as they switch from Centrelink to DVA. This underpins the importance of having all widows cared for by one agency. 
Part 4 of the bill provides for the calculation of disability pension arrears. This amendment corrects an inconsistency in the calculation of arrears of disability pension where a partner's Centrelink payments need adjusting. Currently the actual date of payment and the decision date on a claim do not coincide—and they should, for accurate assessment. Once again, this is a sensible amendment to remove a problem which is typical of legislation which is complex and which often does not mesh properly with the Social Security Act.
Part 5 of the bill deals with another inconsistency, this time with respect to Norfolk Island. Currently veterans pensions are payable to qualified people who live on Norfolk Island. However, social security benefits are not payable unless there is 10 years residency of Australia. The criteria for the payment of a veteran's partner pension and a widows pension is satisfaction of the Social Security Act, but this excludes those who live on Norfolk Island. This amendment simply removes that anomaly by providing eligibility for veterans' partners and widows who are currently excluded.
Part 6 of the bill provides for changes to the calculation of rent assistance. The payment of rent assistance to veterans is subject to a means test in which disability pension is included as income, but the act is not clear how this calculation applies to those on the partnered rate of pension where only one partner receives disability pension. This amendment remedies a drafting shortcoming and will provide a common means of assessment. Part 7 of the bill provides for changes to the calculation of arrears. Because the veterans disability pension is always paid in arrears from the date of claim, the recovery of overpaid rent assistance is necessary. The act, however, does not allow that recovery to be made from partners where the disability pension is treated as income for the married rate of pension. This amendment corrects that shortcoming.
Part 8 of the bill seeks to close a loophole which has been identified with respect to the treatment of assets in the deeming provisions. As the result of an AAT decision the loophole has been created whereby encumbrances from capital assets can be deducted before the calculation of deemed income. This approach is intended to apply only to the assessment of assets. Its extension by the AAT to deeming provisions needs to be countered. The same amendment is also to be made to the Social Security Act. Part 9 of the bill clarifies the definition of income for returns accrued but not paid from financial investments. Currently it is possible that accrued payments may also be treated as actual deemed income, thus double-counting the return. This amendment removes that possibility.
Part 10 deals with the exemption of superannuation assets from the means test. At present there is an inconsistency between the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This concerns the ministerial discretion to exempt superannuation assets from the assets test for the service pension in some circumstances, where the person would be otherwise disadvantaged. This amendment will bring the VEA into line with the SSA. Part 11 also refers to means test exemption but with respect to other superannuation accounts and rental income. Again the Veterans' Entitlements Act needs to be brought into line with the Social Security Act with respect to the treatment of small superannuation accounts and private rental income in the means test for the service pension. This is the result of an oversight in 1995, whereby only the SSA was amended. 
Part 12 provides for changes to war widows' pensions to remove an important anomaly. Currently there is an anomaly between the way a war widow's pension and income support supplement are calculated in combination, and the way a war widow's pension and service pension are calculated where there is a third party compensation payment. That is, there is a difference where the widow is also a service pensioner in her own right rather than the partner of a deceased veteran. In the former, the ceiling rate of income support supplement is adjusted upwards to compensate for the offsetting of the third party payment. In the latter, the frozen rate of service pension is not so adjusted. This is an anomaly caused by a legislative omission in the past. This amendment removes the anomaly.
Part 13 relates to offences. This is a minor technical change to provide that an offence can also be committed where a part pension is payable rather than just a whole pension, as is currently the case. Part 14 repeals a provision which was made incorrectly in 2002 for the treatment of deprived assets in the means test for the service pension. If left in the VEA it could result in deprived assets being counted twice where they were disposed of prior to 2002.
Part 15 deals with compensation recovery. This is a minor technical change to bring the Veterans' Entitlements Act into line with the Social Security Act with respect to the definition of periodic compensation payments. This is the result of an AAT decision which, if allowed to stand, would have an implication in a small number of cases. The Social Security Act has already been amended. Part 16 provides for a range of minor technical amendments. These are all minor drafting changes to clarify definitions, remove redundant wording, correct references and standardise some expression. They are of no consequence in their effect. 
These amendments are all justified and raise no major policy issues. It is noted, however, that those amendments which affect the treatment of the disability pension in the means test under the Social Security Act would not be necessary if that pension were ignored as income under that act. Instead of taking that path, the government has decided to pay an allowance in lieu of the value of the current pension reduction. This is extraordinarily messy and complex and could have been avoided by a simpler amendment to the SSA. The reason, as we know, is that there has been a standoff in the government which has not been resolved.
In short, the Minister for Family and Community Services has refused to exempt the veterans disability pension from the means test in the Social Security Act. Instead, the Department of Veterans' Affairs will pay an allowance to all those with the disability pension, equivalent in value to the deduction currently made. This will also have to be paid to partners where joint income is assessed, even though they may not be clients of DVA. This is an absurd arrangement and really demonstrates a dysfunctional government. At least veterans will not be disadvantaged, although, no doubt, many will be dreadfully confused.
I just want to touch on one other issue as this is, as I described, an omnibus bill which touches on a whole range of veterans' issues. I want to deal with an issue which the minister raised. Following the fact that no-one from the opposition chose to question the minister during appropriations, she got in a bit of a pique about things and put out a press release claiming that the opposition had snubbed the veteran community. I want the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to clearly know that it was not the veteran community that was being snubbed but the minister. Quite frankly, we are sick of asking questions and getting no answers, and we are sick of seeing the veteran community being constantly ignored by this minister when they write letters to her, not of a political nature but simply seeking information, advice or the current status of certain things that they might be involved in, only to have those matters ignored for months and months. 
I want to draw to the attention of the House a particular case which explains exactly what I am talking about and why there is so much frustration with this minister. I have a copy of an email sent by Mr Andrew Wilby, who is the Treasurer of the Injured Service Persons Association in Queensland. He wrote the email to Mr Latham and it has been passed on to me. It says:
Dear Mr Latham
I writing to tell you about the ongoing battle for military compensation that myself and everyone else who require carers to look after us face. I was left a quadriplegic 15 years ago in the military and I am still fighting for compensation. One of my main concerns is that anyone who require carers to look after them faces the added financial burden because everywhere we go or everything we do costs us double, we have to pay for our carers as well as ourselves.
I had a meeting with Danna Vale at the Caboolture RSL Club on the 23rd of February 2004, we discussed several things, one of which was how severely injured personnel who require carers to look after them face extra financial burden because they not only have to pay their way but they have to pay for their carers as well.
For instance if I fly anywhere I require a carer to fly with me, therefore I am up for the price of their flight as well. She said she was going to personally look into the situation and get back to me. As yet I have had no response to that meeting or the four letters that I have sent every month since.
It is signed—
Still waiting
Andrew Wilby
Treasurer
Injured Service Persons Association Queensland Inc.
I am not going to keep the House on this issue. We have already explained that we support this bill. But, as it is an omnibus bill, I wanted to bring up this situation because it is a fair example of why the veteran community, as I have said, is so frustrated with this minister. Indeed, I believe that many people on both sides of the House are frustrated with this minister. I say that because I know that the office of Mal Brough, the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, has also intervened in this matter on behalf of Andrew Wilby and has sought those responses that were personally promised by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs but which are yet to see the light of day. Mr Wilby is just another ex-serviceman frustrated by incredible delays and, indeed, an ignorant silence.
I think, when a minister gives a personal commitment to look into something on behalf of an injured soldier, that is a pretty strong commitment to give. On behalf of Mr Wilby, I want to ask the minister to get him a reply. I ask her at least to let him know that the issues she thought were so important to give him a commitment about, face to face, are still issues which—in the confines of her office, with all of her staff and with all of those resources at her fingertips—she thinks are important enough to at least live up to the personal commitment that she gave. I think there is always going to be room for politics in our game, but you do not play politics with the needs, concerns and vulnerabilities of injured service personnel. The minister should get back to this man within a very short period of time. As I said, the ALP supports this legislation. ",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (DIRECT DEDUCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—I am pleased to rise this evening to speak on this omnibus bill, the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Direct Deductions and Other Measures) Bill 2004. The member for Cowan has provided a very detailed overview of the various elements and provisions contained within this bill. It is not my intention in the debate this evening to deal with each of the issues, other than to say that this bill sees an amalgam of some 16 different and separate proposals incorporated into the one bill.
The proposed amendments give effect to several minor policy initiatives and improvements that apply with respect to the application and administration of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Probably the principal parts within the bill are designed to ensure that there is an update to the provisions of the VEA so that they mirror or are similar to provisions in the Social Security Act. Many provisions for income support payments in both acts mirror each other, and parity is certainly desirable to ensure consistency, at the very least, and—more importantly—equity. All of the income support pensions and allowances provided under the SSA, with the exception of the blind pension, are income and asset tested. The like income support payments provided under the VEA that are also income and asset tested are the service pension, the income support supplement and the invalidity service pension.
The reason I speak on this bill is that in my electorate of Moncrieff I have some 4½ thousand veterans. It was an absolute pleasure for me to attend, only last Friday, the opening of a new relocated Veterans' Affairs Network office in the very street, in fact, where I have my electorate office—Short Street in Southport. The staff in this office are among the most committed and hardworking Veterans' Affairs staff that I know. It was indeed a pleasure for me to be there on behalf of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Danna Vale, to officially open their new premises and to speak with many of the veterans who live on the Gold Coast. That particular VAN office services over 10½ thousand veterans who reside in the immediate Gold Coast City. When you consider the size of that veteran population—it is in fact the fourth largest veteran population in the country—you start to appreciate the importance of this particular legislation and the impact that it has on their day-to-day lives. That is the reason I am very pleased to associate myself with this bill which, although an omnibus bill, is an important piece of legislation.
As I mentioned, I intend not to touch on every aspect of this bill but merely to address several of the key components and key provisions that are contained within it. One in particular is part 2 of schedule 1, which deals with the Victoria Cross allowance. The current Victoria Cross allowance is some $2,800 that is paid annually in advance to veterans who have been awarded the decoration of the Victoria Cross. They are of course among our bravest veterans, and they obviously deserve the recognition that goes with having been a recipient of that award. In this regard, it has been past practice for the VCA to be increased on an ad hoc basis as various governments have deemed necessary. This bill seeks to increase the annual rate of the Victoria Cross allowance to $3,230, effective from 1 July 2004, and to ensure that the VCA is indexed to the CPI on an annual basis from 1 July 2004, thereby providing greater certainty for those Australian veterans—and there are very few veterans who have a Victoria Cross. This is a small but nonetheless significant change, and one that I know people are certainly supportive of. 
Part 3 of schedule 1 deals with the automatic grant of income support supplement to age pensioners and to wife pensioners. The question is: what is the income support supplement? It refers to income tested support supplement that is paid to some recipients of the veterans disability pension or to recipients of the war widows pension. Neither the veterans disability pension nor indeed the war widows pension is means tested on income or assets, and that is largely as a consequence of the fact that it is paid as compensation for war related illness, injury or indeed death.
Some recipients of these veterans' compensation payments may also be eligible to qualify for other income support payments provided under the Social Security Act. These may include, for example, the age pension or the wife pension. If they are entitled to that, the amount of the age or wife income support supplement is paid at a reduced rate, recognising that they are also in receipt of a means test free veterans' war compensation payment. In this regard, some disability pension or war widows pension recipients do not qualify for the income support supplement as a consequence of their income and/or assets precluding payment of an age or wife pension because of the threshold tests that apply under the application of the means test.
Prior to March 1985, any additional age or wife pension was provided by the then Department of Social Security as a frozen rate age or wife pension under the Social Security Act. With the passage of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act 1994, the income support supplement was introduced and was effectively a replacement payment that was to be provided by DVA. It is paid at a rate that is similar and under the same conditions as any age pension or wife pension that is otherwise payable under the Social Security Act. In fact, in March 1985, there was opportunity for people to be streamlined. As such, the DVA automatically transferred all recipients of this income support supplement under the SSA across to the DVA. This was a choice that people had, but it is important to recognise that virtually all recipients were transferred across to DVA as a consequence of the fact that they needed to object if they did not seek to be transferred across to the Department of Veterans' Affairs.
With respect to this particular bill, it is proposed that an automatic grant of income support supplement to the surviving partner of a deceased veteran be applied. Normally, to be granted a pension under either the Veterans' Entitlements Act or the Social Security Act, a person is required to formally lodge a claim. However, part three of schedule 1 provides for the automatic grant of income support supplements to eligible wife and age pensioners where their veteran partner has died. This will eliminate the necessity for the surviving partner to lodge a formal claim on the death of their veteran partner, when DVA already knows the person is entitled to the income support supplement. This is in line with other automatic grant arrangements for the income support supplement that already exist under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I know that my veterans would consider this to be a beneficial proposal.
Part 4 of schedule 1 deals with the calculation of disability pension arrears. It is a technical aspect that deals with the period between when a claim is lodged and when a claim may subsequently be granted. It recognises the fact that there may be arrears that arise as a consequence of the time lag that is involved between the application being lodged and the subsequent granting of a particular claim. Part 6 of schedule 1 details amendments to the VEA to clarify the impact of the disability pension on the rate of rent assistance where the person or their partner is receiving a disability pension. Part 7 details a reduction in pensioner arrears that results from a partner's receipt of a service pension. This refers to the same issue in the Veterans' Entitlements Act, as part 6 does—that is, the impact of a disability pensioner's income for the purposes of the calculation of the rate of any rent assistance paid, in addition to the veterans service pension. 
Part 9 deals with deemed income and actual income from accrued returns. Under the income test that is applied under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and under the Social Security Act, any income realised from financial investments is assessed under one simple set of rules. These are the deeming principles. The deeming rules were introduced to both the SSA and the VEA, with the social security and veterans' affairs amendment act that was passed in 1995. Deeming assumes the financial investment is earning a prescribed rate of income, no matter what income is in fact being earned. Financial investments include, for example, bank and building society accounts, cash, term deposits, cheque accounts, friendly society bonds and the like. Financial investments, however, do not include a residential home or its contents, cars, boats or caravans. Nor do they include antique or stamp collections; assets held in superannuation and rollover funds, if the person is under age pension age; home insurance policies; holiday homes; farms; and those types of things. The reason this is important is that, under the deeming rules, many veterans may in fact be better off.
It is worth highlighting, as well, that whilst some people do have concerns that they express from time to time about the application of deeming rules, most major banks do provide a deeming account which is linked to providing a return that is equal to the deeming rate. It is an important consideration because people ought not fear, if they do not feel that they are particularly financially savvy, that they need to ensure that they are earning an income that equates to the deeming rate, because that is relatively straightforward to achieve through most major banks, credit unions and the like. For those who perhaps do have a greater degree of financial savvy, they have the opportunity to earn above the deeming rate and therefore, over a period of time, be in a more beneficial position.
This omnibus bill does make a number of minor amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act and other associated legislation, but it sees a continuation of benefits that apply to veterans under the Howard government. I am very pleased that I am able to associate myself with not only this bill but a number of very positive measures that this government has taken to ensure that the veterans' lot in life is appropriately recognised and that all Australians appreciate the fact that many of our freedoms were hard fought and won and hard fought and defended by veterans who now look towards not only this government but previous governments and subsequent governments to provide them with some reassurance and an appropriate level of respect, recognising the contribution that these veterans have made to the Australia that we know and enjoy today.
This particular bill does contain many amendments, but it continues to build on the strong platform we as a government have made to recognise and care for our veterans. I am very pleased to enjoy a very good relationship with all of the ex-service organisations in my electorate. I am very pleased that I have a significant number of ex-service organisations that, in fact, send along representatives to veterans kitchen cabinet meetings, as I call them, that meet from time to time in my office. It is an opportunity for all those members of those ESOs who attend my veterans kitchen cabinet to sit down and discuss with me issues that they believe are important. Some of those issues are incorporated into this bill and some of them have been incorporated into other bills. But, in all, I certainly believe it fundamentally to be my role to ensure that I continue to listen to my veteran community and that my veteran community knows that I will be a strong advocate for them in recognition of the significant sacrifice and contribution that they have made as veterans in Australia's past. I am pleased that the Labor Party is supporting this bill and I commend it to the House. ",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (DIRECT DEDUCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2004-06-21,"—The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Direct Deductions and Other Measures) Bill 2004 proposed here is good legislation and we praise the government for proceeding with it. These are small things but they are things that needed to be done and I am well aware, as are many other members of parliament, of the necessity of carrying out a number of these actions. Having said that, when we introduce legislation in this House, whilst the legislation says that we will do these things, by implication there are also things that have not been done.
I attended a major address by the outgoing Dean of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Queensland. He said that there were three great shames of this country: the first was the way we treated the first Australians—and some might disagree with that, but that is what he said—the second was the way that we have treated the dairy farmers of this country and the third was the way that we treated the men who returned from Vietnam. The Boyer lectures by Tom Fitzgerald some years ago were, I thought, the best things I had ever heard on radio. He was a fighter pilot in Britain. He remembered with great bitterness that they were brought home in the dead of night and the next day their vehicles had graffiti painted all over them. The people of Australia were very hostile towards these men. They were ordered—they had no option—to go and fight in Great Britain. Australians believed that they should have been here fighting for Australia, but, of course, in wartime, if you do not do as you are told, you get shot—it is called treason. There is very swift action taken. So those men suffered, but there was a very small number of them.
In the case of the Vietnam vets, they came home to a most unfortunate situation, to say the least. I agree with everything that the previous speaker, the member for Moncrieff, said, but words are cheap. If you want to express your appreciation to somebody then, ever since the Phoenicians invented money, money has been one way of doing it. The other way of doing it is with medals. I have been asked to put questions to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and she will be receiving them by way of questions on notice. I think it is right and proper that they should be aired in this place at this time. They are as follows. Is the minister aware that there are thousands of Defence Force personnel—and this is not in this bill—who have served since 1946 without any recognition of their service by way of the award of a medal? Is the minister aware that these personnel include regular officers and soldiers who, between 1946 and 1972—a 26-year period—had no medal recognition at all? These include many female personnel who were compelled to leave the service in earlier days upon marriage and therefore did not complete the 15-year service period required for any such awards as then existed, personnel retrenched through no fault of their own after periods of service often exceeding 10 years but not 15 years and personnel who were injured in non-operational military service and thus did not qualify for any medal recognition.
Is the minister aware that representations have been made, supported by approximately 60 service and ex-service organisations, that a medal should be issued to personnel such as the above to cover those persons falling through the cracks in the present award system, so that such persons are recognised and can participate with dignity and recognition in such patriotic events as Anzac Day? Finally, does the minister agree that persons such as the above merit medal recognition and this recognition should be both prospective and retrospective? 
As to the civil service medals—and my maternal grandfather was one of these cases; he wanted to join up, but he was told that, because he was a builder and carpenter, he had to go into the civil service corps—all of us that have given out those medals have seen the extremely great pride with which they are accepted. In many cases now, sadly, they are accepted by the descendants of those people. In my grandfather's case, it was my auntie as he had already died. It seems to me that there is little purpose in giving out medals after a person has gone. So we plead with the minister to look at and seriously consider this.
The opposition spokesman said that there is a non-reactiveness from this department. Whilst he may have addressed the remarks to the minister, I have to say in all seriousness and sincerity that it is a charge, allegation and criticism which I have heard constantly and it would be improper of me not to pass it on in this place. These requests are not listened to. Even the decision to give the service medal and certain other actions that government has taken were only after years and years of anger because of representations that were ignored in this place.
Finally—this is not in this bill—in the First World War the soldiers came home and were provided with free education and soldier settler blocks. In the Second World War they came home and were provided with free education and soldier settler blocks. The men that came home from Vietnam were provided with nothing. A very large segment of this community treated them with great disrespect and in an extremely shabby way.
When the Dean of the Faculty of Economics talked about those three great shames, I added the part we played in the Boer War, where 28,000 women and children perished in the British concentration camps, and the fact that we did not take any of the Jewish refugees trying to flee from Mr Hitler in the Second World War. That makes up five great shames of this country—particularly the Jewish one, where some six million of these people perished because they could not get out of the country as no other country would take them. If they had gone to Israel, who could blame them?
The reason I make that point is that there is something bad and morally wrong that we need to fix up. We cannot have a country with a great spiritual patriotism if we do not address these problems. If we go out and march on Anzac Day and then treat these men in the most shabby of manners and provide them with absolutely nothing for what they were forced to do in the Vietnam War, whether they liked it or not, then we are deserving of the greatest criticism. I do not think that this situation should continue.
Let me now be very specific about what needs to be done and what is not being addressed in this bill. In North Queensland there is vacant land at Kalpowar Station and a number of servicemen have simply moved into occupation. I give fair warning in this place: Les Hiddins and the boys have brought back soil that is stained with the blood of our soldiers and taken it up and placed it at Kalpowar Station. People have lost family—and I most certainly am one of them. I have lost family from amongst my forebears at Suvla Bay. Some of their blood was spilled there when they went there and is still there today. This will be a sacred place for Australia. If anyone dares touch it, then they will understand the wrath of patriotism that will flush out in this country. So we give fair warning on this issue. If these people were not given free education when they came home, if they were not given soldier settler blocks, if they were treated as substandard soldiers when they returned home then who could blame them for taking the actions that they have taken at Kalpowar Station? 
The onus lies upon the government, the minister and the department to act in requested areas with respect to these medals and the station property in North Queensland. Many other people in this country—national parks and our first Australians, who we are very proud of, of course—have received huge amounts of land, but these people have received no land at all. They have claimed little bit of Australia for themselves—good on them. We plead with the government to answer the questions we have asked and to act on these other matters discussed here this evening.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (DIRECT DEDUCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—I am delighted to rise this evening to support the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Direct Deductions and Other Measures) Bill 2004. This bill carries out a series of steps and brings them into being, which will assist veterans. I want to begin with two preliminary points that flow from the role, care and action of veterans within my electorate of Flinders. As with every electorate, there are people who served Australia in times of war and times of peace within the military who now live in that area. In particular, we have a group of veterans, whether from Rye, Rosebud, Dromana or Mount Martha, who have retired to the area and made a commitment in the course of their lives and served this country.
I bring a little personal history to this debate having lost a great-uncle in the First World War. As a custodian of his legacy, almost 90 years on now, it is something that sits with my own family as I know it sits with every family. Having paid tribute to the veterans in my electorate, I want to raise a specific issue which one of them has asked me to bring before the House. Dennis Gist, who was a naval seaman aboard HMAS Sydney in Vietnam in 1965, has been the custodian of a legacy: he has been working with many of his fellow seamen and others who were aboard HMAS Sydney, a troop carrier, to achieve for themselves positive consideration for the South Vietnam campaign medal. I know that this has been considered by the government, and I gently but genuinely urge them to consider this situation in the light of all the newest evidence which is available.
In essence, looking back over the history, we know that, in May 1965 in Vung Tau harbour, HMAS Sydney was a troop carrier for the Australian Navy, along with other ships, RAAF No. 10 maritime squadron and certain military units. Although they were not seen as directly being engaged in action, the history is nevertheless very clear: they were in an area of enemy activity, which involved hostile fire from the island of Long Son. There was Vietnamese mortar, mines in the water—both fixed and floating—and also divers with hostile intent. Against that background, previous governments have not agreed to the award of the South Vietnamese campaign medal for the crew of HMAS Sydney, the accompanying ships and RAAF No. 10 maritime squadron. I realise that these are difficult issues; all of balance and all of judgment. On behalf of Dennis Gist, former naval seaman, I urge the government, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to give consideration to the circumstances surrounding the crew of the HMAS Sydney and to do all they can to assist in the award of the South Vietnamese campaign medal. I realise that these are difficult issues; nevertheless, I place these matters clearly before the House. 
The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Direct Deductions and Other Measures) Bill 2004 seeks to do three things. Firstly, it expands options and support for disabled veterans, war widows and veterans' partners; secondly, it aligns the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 with the social security law in relation to the deeming of certain income and assets, including the treatment of superannuation benefits and compensation recovery provisions; and, thirdly, with changes to the direct deduction arrangements contained within this bill, it gives assistance to persons receiving service pension or income support supplements, to persons receiving the disability pension, to those receiving the war widow or widowers pension and to those who receive other pecuniary benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act.
Those are important steps. They come against a particular background. I pay special tribute to the work of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who has had a Herculean task in the last year to respond to the Clarke review. Against that background, the government's response to the Clarke review, and in particular the Minister for Veterans' Affairs' response, basically deals with the core areas of service eligibility, access to the gold card, benefits for totally and permanently incapacitated and disability benefit recipients, and rehabilitation measures. Looking at all of those things, the total package which has come out of the response to the Clarke review is an additional $267 million to assist our veterans over the next five years. That is a significant figure.
Of course, any government always wants to do more. But, given the available resources, this is a very significant step forward. What we see is an increase in funding, which is already evident with the rise in pension rates from 20 March this year, by $11.40 to $464.20 a fortnight, with the maximum rate for couples to increase by $9.60. The TPI pension rose by $8.40 to $771 a fortnight. Of course we want to do more, but within the available resources this is a significant step forward. In addition to that, what we find is that more than 19,000 disability pensioners who receive their income support from Centrelink will benefit from the change. On average, they will receive an additional $40 a fortnight. That is a significant and important step forward. Furthermore, there is an increase in the extreme disablement adjustment, which will be increased by $4.80 to $438.45 a fortnight. Last, but by no means least, the government also accepted the Clarke committee's recommendation to extend an ex gratia payment of $25,000 to all surviving prisoners of war held captive during the Korean War and to their widows or widowers. This is in recognition of the extraordinarily inhumane and difficult conditions they endured as a consequence of their service to Australia in the most hostile environment.
The Clarke review and the changes made build on the back of a series of other packages over the course of the life of the government. Perhaps most significantly, since coming into office in 1996 this government, through its successive ministers, has increased spending on veterans affairs from $6.4 billion to $10 billion in the federal budget for 2003-04. Why is that important? It represents an increase of over 50 per cent in the period of a few short years. That is an increase which is far and away above rises in the consumer price index. It is a significant and real increase in the value of that which is paid to those who have served Australia. It is a very important step forward. 
So when you look at the full range of initiatives, what you see is that we are making real progress on the conditions which are offered to our veterans—people who have either placed themselves in harm's way or offered to place themselves in harm's way. In the world in which we live today, we perhaps recognise better than at any other time over the last 30 years the magnitude of the debt we owe our veterans, wherever they may be around Australia—or, in my case, from the Mornington Peninsula.
As I said at the outset, I come to this speech and this topic with not a direct connection but a familial connection. My own great-uncle was lost in the First World War. That had an impact throughout the ages throughout the family. There is recognition, understanding and remembrance. I think most Australians can say that they have a direct connection in some way or a connection to people who have served Australia, because it has been a national responsibility over the course of the last century. In that context, I am delighted to commend the measures set out in this bill. I thank people such as Dennis Gist who have kept alight the flame for any particular part of the service community. Whilst we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we work towards recognising their legacy, treating it appropriately and thanking them for their work. In that context, I commend the bill to the House and I urge its speedy passage.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (DIRECT DEDUCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—My colleague the member for Flinders indicated that he thought veterans' benefits had always been at the forefront. But after the First World War there were not too many benefits and there were a lot of people who worked very hard in Australia to get benefits for veterans. I remember Alec Campbell, the last Gallipoli veteran and a Tasmanian, spent some of his life after he came back from the first war working very hard to improve veterans' entitlements.
The bill currently before the House—the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Direct Deductions and Other Measures) Bill 2004—comes from the Clarke review of 2004. It falls well short of recognising, let alone compensating for, the full cost of our veterans' services to Australia. For veterans who participated in the Korean War, the amendments in place are small compensation for the trauma experienced in that particular theatre of war. Korean veterans and those veterans fighting in previous and subsequent wars are continually being palmed off with small, one-off payments, all too often too late for any real benefit to be achieved by the recipient. These payments and benefits do not allow for the constant suffering previously experienced by veterans or their families.
The provisions in favour of the veterans are limited, as are the numbers of those who will receive any real benefit when in fact in many cases it has been a larger group who has suffered and relived the madness of war many times with veterans, repeatedly and for long periods of time. How much better it would be for the veterans to have the knowledge that, while they are still young enough to gain some real benefit from any monetary payment to assist them with their health issues or specific needs, these payments were available at the time, not when it is really too late.
When I talk to my constituents who are members of the veterans community I am struck by the fact that it is not only the veterans themselves who are still paying the price for their service but their families as well. Most alarmingly, the cost of conflict is also being borne by their children. On several occasions recently I have read information detailing the large increase in the number of suicides among children of veterans. Still we hear very little from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on what steps are being taken to counteract this terrible occurrence. While there has been some attempt to put in place more counselling services for children of veterans, the suicide rates increase continually and the obvious need is not being addressed satisfactorily. 
Although it is over 30 years since Australia's service personnel served in the Vietnam conflict, the effects of their service are still very much with us today. The effects of the chemical defoliant Agent Orange—which was used extensively in Vietnam—in both the short term and the long term have been the subject of hot debate for a number of decades now. The United States finally in 2002 formally acknowledged the potential for Agent Orange to be considered the prime causal factor in a number of conditions that were still being suffered by Vietnam veterans and their children. The conditions were not only in their children but often in their grandchildren as well. It is clear that time and generational change has not put paid to these issues.
Here we are in 2004 and our defence personnel are once again serving in many theatres of conflict, facing not only the physical threat of harm and death but the same uncertainty regarding their future health condition when they return to Australia and their civilian life. Their own personal health is still at risk, as is that of their children and their children's children. While the veterans' affairs minister states that the alternatives being offered to veterans will offer a more satisfactory mode of compensation, it will only be satisfactory for the department—certainly not for the veterans or their families. Little or no consideration is given to the list of exposures potentially faced by members of the forces: the chemicals, radiation, and biological and biochemical agents that may lead to chromosomal or DNA damage that can be passed on from one generation to another.
The bill before us should surely represent an opportunity to learn from the experience of past conflicts and the ramifications of those conflicts for many Australians—even today. As we formulate this legislation we should realise that our troops that are serving now will have needs far into the future, as will their families and their children yet to be born. We cannot know what these needs might be. As recently as 8 June this year the New Zealand Daily News was extolling the achievement of Judith Collins, a New Zealand member of parliament, for her part in establishing a select committee to investigate the ongoing effects of Agent Orange on the New Zealand Vietnam forces and their offspring. I too believe that this is a highly commendable response to a clear need and as such would serve us well as a model for how we are to treat our returning service men and women now and in the years to come.
Any Vietnam veteran's child who has a birth defect should be presumed to have a service-connected health effect if that person suffers from the type of health effect consistent with exposure to any of the materials detailed above. This bill does not recognise that the effects of armed conflict can and do cause problems into the future and for future generations. Instead it wants to pay our veterans off with a cynical golden handshake. A lump sum payment right now might look like a golden egg to someone returning from the conflict in the Middle East, but I believe that time will quickly show the lack of foresight and compassion of the government that laid it. Young people returning home from a particularly intense and traumatic passage of their lives are clearly not in the best position to prudently husband a one-off payment to hedge against the problems that might arise from their military service. They are quite possibly problems that they cannot know about; they might be problems that will be experienced by children who are not yet conceived. 
To a large extent, we do have the benefit of hindsight regarding these issues. In enjoying this benefit we need to ensure that resources are available to our returning service personnel by way of regular income support payments for veterans and their families as well as assured support for the health and community services that veterans and their families will need in the near future and for a long time to come. This bill in its current form does not even begin to provide these resources. As with some of the other one-off payments that we have seen introduced in this place in recent times, far from being a carefully considered budgetary solution to a clear need it is a ham-fisted attempt by this government to sidestep its responsibilities to those men and women who have served our country so well. If this bill passes into legislation, our current service men and women and their families will soon find themselves out on their own and may well remain there for many years to come.
I now move on to another aspect of the bill—one that is connected very closely to the areas already detailed above: eligibility for payment of benefits. From World War I to relatively recent times, veterans and their immediate family members who suffered from disability or illness resulting from the veterans' exposure to contaminants or disease were covered by the Repatriation Act 1920. However, over recent years this has changed and now applies only to the veteran and wife or widow.
On many occasions during recent times there has been the necessity for servicemen and servicewomen to remain in areas of conflict beyond the cessation of conflict. This in turn has brought with it the requirement for a further period of service that has placed or still places the serviceperson at risk of contamination from dangerous materials, unexploded bombs and disease, bringing with it the greater risk of long-term illness in the years to come. For many of the members of the forces there is no choice in this; it is part of a tour of duty.
There is a long list of countries where Australian forces have participated in operational conflict and where the lives of young men and women have constantly been at risk—countries such as those involved in the First World War and Second World War, as well as Korea, Japan, Malaya, Vietnam and Thailand; more recently, Namibia, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, East Timor and Afghanistan; and now Iraq and the Solomon Islands. As I have stated, the effects of materials used in past wars are only now becoming obvious. For those who have participated in the most recent conflicts, the results are yet to be seen, although already we see a number of cases of suicide and post-traumatic stress disorder.
The effects on the children of participants in the latest conflicts are yet to be seen. Will those cancers and other diseases that have plagued the veterans of the Korean War return in oncoming generations? The question must be asked: were those cancers suffered by Korean veterans caused purely by smoking or were there other considerations that have as yet not been investigated? Unless appropriate provision is made for veterans on their return to Australia and future provision is made for their offspring in the event of illness or birth defects from war-associated materials or disease, we have failed not only our servicemen and servicewomen but the Australian community at large. Our servicemen and servicewomen deserve better than this and so do their children. However, in the interests of getting some benefits under way and to provide these benefits to the war widows and veterans concerned, I will not oppose this bill. I just believe it is too little, too late and should be revised and improved as soon as possible.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—As always, it is a privilege to speak in the chamber when you are in the chair, Deputy Speaker Price. The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Direct Deductions and Other Measures) Bill 2004 before us today is an omnibus piece of legislation and brings into force a number of changes which I think overall benefit veterans. My only question is: why has it taken so long for it to be introduced? I will go through a summary of the proposals. Part 1 of the bill proposes a facility for direct deductions from pensions. That will extend the currently limited range of pensions with that facility to include disability pensions and war pensions. That is something that should be in place, and it is very unfortunate that it has taken so long to be put in place. There is a proposed increase in the VC allowance and indexation of that VC allowance in line with the CPI. That will be $3,230. Also proposed is an automatic grant of income support supplement. The bill looks at the calculation of disability pension arrears. There is also a provision that proposes the inclusion of Norfolk Island and amends the legislation to provide eligibility for veterans' partners and widows living there who are currently excluded.
The calculation of the payment of rent assistance to veterans is subject to a means test in which the disability pension is included as income. It is not clear how this is calculated, and this amending legislation will look at some of the drafting shortcomings there. A section of the legislation looks at the calculation of arrears, assets and deeming. It deals with a loophole that was identified as a result of an AAT decision. It looks at deemed income, accrued returns and clarification of the definition of income for returns accrued but not paid from financial investments. There are proposed means testing exemptions on superannuation, rent and superannuation assets. There is a ceiling rate for service pensions and a couple of other minor amendments that all go towards improving the legislation and making it a little better for veterans—something that we are not used to seeing happen.
I support the comments made by my colleague the member for Cowan about the snide, cheap shot by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs at the ALP. One would have thought that anyone with any nous at all would have known that the ALP have a policy platform for veterans. All you have to do is visit the web site. It has been available since late January. Not one veteran has any doubt about what the ALP stand for. We stand for the opposite of what this government stands for. We stand for a fair go for veterans—something that they do not expect from this government. One thing we do not stand for at all, though, are the cheap shots from this minister, who is now acknowledged as the worst Minister for Veterans' Affairs ever. That is something I hear on a daily basis; I am sorry, Minister.
The minister might do well to read the policy. She might learn something about real policy from the ALP policy. It is not about cutting ribbons around the world. It is not about pushing to the front when the cameras are around. It is not about hollow self-promotion or basking in the past glories of veterans. It is about real people with real needs. Minister, read our policy—take it and copy it for your own, if you like. That would be standard for the Howard government. We have seen that practised time and time again in this House.
With respect to the criticism that the ALP did not ask questions at the consideration in detail stage of the appropriation bills, let me ask: what would be the point? I was in the Main Committee. I saw the minister arrive and I had a list of questions I was going to ask her but then I thought: `Why worry?' She never answers any questions. Every time she is asked a question in this House it is never answered. It is quite clear that the minister is not capable of answering any questions on veteran matters. There is a strong chance that she would get it wrong—or simply flick the switch to cutting ribbons or to the colour of her hat. Minister, if you are willing to answer some question then take this on notice: why do you continue to cut services to ageing veterans and war widows under the Veterans Home Care program? I am being contacted on a daily basis by veterans who are most upset about the fact that their home care is being cut. The maintenance part of that Veterans Home Care program is almost non-existent, yet the purpose of that program was to assist veterans. What the minister has done is raise expectations and put in place some home care only to take it away from veterans at a later date. 
Another point I make about that program is that the method of telephone assessment is not the right way to do things. It is inadequate and it is not delivering the right outcomes for veterans. That is one of the questions I would have liked to have asked you, Minister. Why was the budget for home care cut by $4 million? The minister might like to answer that question also. How do you define the special rate as to whether it is income or not? Once again, I hope that the minister might like to take this up when she is summing up on this legislation. Why are you denying veterans access to aids and appliances? That is also a common complaint that I receive in my office.
—Why don't you write to me then?
—As the minister should be aware, I have written to her about this on a number of occasions and I get an answer back from the minister but, unfortunately, nothing ever changes. The needs of our veterans are not considered in their context. Minister, how much harm has been done by your refusal—and this refusal goes through to next January—to do anything about specialists refusing to treat, under the gold card, veterans with serious medical conditions? I appreciate that you have announced in the budget additional funding to come into play, but that is not until January next year. To the veterans in my electorate who cannot see a urologist or an orthopaedic specialist and have that specialist accept the gold card in full payment for their service, that is not good enough. Veterans who have defended our country in times of need and who always believed that their government would look after them are very disappointed. They believe that that gold card should deliver them the care and treatment that they need and deserve but, time and time again, veterans are attending specialists only to find that that specialist will not accept their gold card. I will be watching very carefully to see whether or not there are any changes in January next year.
The minister may like to look exasperated about this but these are real people who are struggling and hurting. There is one gentleman living on the Central Coast of New South Wales who has been so severely disadvantaged by the fact that he cannot get a urologist that he has had to change urologists and travel further. In that area, that is an extreme disadvantage. He is a real person who has been really hurt by her inaction, and there is the same sort of problem within the Lake Macquarie part of my electorate.
Minister, why can't war widows be paid their rent assistance until late September? Why does it have to be held off for that long? They have waited and waited and they still have to wait longer. My final question—the big question—is: why has this bill been in the House since 25 March and not been dealt with? The questions could go on and on, but I feel that they would never receive the proper answers and would not be taken seriously. Like the many veterans and widows who write to the minister and write to me with questions and asking for assistance, I know that we will never get the answers to these questions. 
Why don't we bother asking you, Minister? I think the proof is in the pudding. Like veterans, we are sick of the syrup and the empty homilies. We have watched with disdain the process of the Clarke report to which 3,000 veterans and widows made submissions and were dismissed with total contempt. Believe me: people really committed to that process. They went to great lengths to prepare submissions and they felt extremely upset by the response and tardiness of the government and the whole process. Veterans know, as we do, that it was a stalling device to get the minister from one election to another. Fortunately, veterans can see that. Veterans know that they have been duped. They know too that the government was mean and tricky in its first response to the Clarke report and that the Prime Minister was rolled by his backbench. I am sure that the minister was pleased that that happened because surely she must have some compassion and concern for the veterans that she represents here in this parliament. Veterans know that the full intention of the Clarke report was to do nothing—that is what they felt at the end of the process.
This now brings me to the bill once again. Minister, there is a bit of policy in this bill, as I mentioned earlier, which, as I say, has been sitting around waiting for your attention since 25 March. The bill makes a number of technical changes, some of which I highlighted in the beginning of my contribution to this debate. Why has it taken so long to bring them forward? The minister is willing to rush around the world cutting ribbons, but here in the parliament all we get is neglect—and all the veterans around Australia get is neglect.
Direct deductions and electronic payments are things that most people around Australia have had available for a long time. Why has it taken so long for these things to be made available to veterans? The resulting situation is as silly as this example: in South Australia, war widows can only have their rent deducted if their whole pension is paid into the housing trust. The trust takes the rent out and then returns the balance to the war widows, for whom the need outweighs the inconvenience. This bill has been sitting about in this place since 25 March, and those widows have been inconvenienced in the way I have just described. We can presume that the systems are ready and that this can start tomorrow. I am sure that the minister would want that to happen—this to start tomorrow and those electronic deductions to come into play straightaway, so that the widows in South Australia might not have to continue to suffer that inconvenience. The minister might like to tell us when it will start and what veterans and widows have to do to take advantage of this service.
The rest of this bill is largely a clean-up of some odds and ends which affect very few veterans. Given the complexity of this act, this is not surprising. What is surprising, however, is that it takes so long to mirror changes made in the Social Security Act. Why is it that changes made to one act are not also made at the same time to the other act? I do not understand that. I cannot understand why it takes so long and, Minister, I do not think veterans can either. Is there a moat full of crocodiles between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Family and Community Services? Why do we have to suffer these inconsistencies when we have one group of pensioners affected? More to the point, when are we going to get some consistency between two stovepipes?  
Let me now turn to an issue I touched on earlier—that is, Veterans' Home Care. No doubt the minister will not be able answer my earlier questions on Veterans' Home Care. If she had been able to, I am sure she would have acted to look after those veterans severely disadvantaged by the cutbacks that they are suffering. They are people like the elderly gentleman living in the Lake Macquarie part of the Shortland electorate who has very limited mobility and is confined to his house. He is just managing to stay there—he is hanging in there by his toenails. He has had his home care slashed. A phone call from assessors in Brisbane told him that he did not need the level of care he was receiving. I honestly do not understand how someone on the other end of the telephone can all of a sudden determine that a man with very limited mobility who is unable to take care of his home without assistance all of a sudden has a lesser need. It just does not make sense.
Minister, if you cannot answer those questions, maybe you can look at reviewing the fact that the home care budget is fixed to the number of card holders there are. The number of card holders is shrinking, and so too is the home care budget. What sort of logic is this? The problem is that those who remain on home care are, like the gentleman I described to you, becoming frailer and beginning to need more services to keep them out of institutionalised care. After all, the purpose of the Veterans' Home Care program is to keep people living in their homes—to keep them out of an institutional environment.
The government has told us that Access Economics concluded that Veterans' Home Care pays for itself. I would agree with that, because I think the longer you can keep a person in their home the more it will save the community and the better it is for a person's wellbeing. That is to the advantage of everyone concerned, and you do not end up with veterans in residential care facilities. That is the last option. If that is the case, then what is the logic in cutting the budget for the Veterans' Home Care program? I really do not understand. I think that it would be good policy to invest more in the Veterans' Home Care program, in order to keep people like the gentleman I described a moment ago from living in a residential facility. I think the cutback is simply perverse.
On a second issue, Mr Deputy Speaker, may I refer to the reductions and cutbacks which are clearly under way in the Department of Veterans' Affairs with respect to veterans' aids and appliances. Apparently, it is a bold bid to save some departmental running costs. Tenders have been called for the supply of aids and appliances, to reduce the number of suppliers to a very small number. That has happened within my own area. It might sound efficient, but it is not necessarily the best idea. It is not about delivering good service and it is not about delivering the right appliance or the right aid for a veteran. A veteran's aids and appliances are determined by that veteran's individual needs. What will happen to the odd-job man who has been installing those handrails for the veterans? Minister, I actually do not believe that is the right way to go, so, whilst I support this legislation, I do have some serious concerns about it—and I do have concerns about your ability to answer those questions that I have posed to you. I believe that the veterans' community would like some straight answers. They would like some action from the minister, and they would like a demonstration of the fact that she has real care for their needs.

"Vale, Danna, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—in reply—I thank members for their contribution on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Direct Deductions and Other Measures) Bill 2004, particularly the member for Moncrieff and the member for Flinders, and I warmly acknowledge the opposition's support for this bill. The bill gives effect to a number of minor policy measures that will enhance services to veterans and their dependants, continuing this government's strong commitment to improving the repatriation system to ensure it operates as effectively as possible in meeting the needs of the Australian veteran community.
Firstly, the bill will extend the direct deduction arrangements to recipients of disability pension and war widows or widowers pensions. The direct deduction arrangements will enable regular deductions to be made from these pensions for payments such as rent to state housing authorities. These arrangements are already available to service pension and income support supplement recipients. The bill will increase the Victoria Cross amount by 15 per cent, taking it to $3,230 per year. The bill will also provide for the annual indexation of the allowance in line with movements in the consumer price index. These amendments reflect changes to the allowance provided to British VC recipients by the British government and recognise the special place held by Australia's Victoria Cross winners.
Other amendments to the bill will enhance support for veterans' partners who receive the social security age pension or wife pension through my department, by providing automatic eligibility for income support supplement following the death of the veteran partner. In a further measure of support for veterans' partners, the bill will ensure eligibility for the partner service pension. It includes certain partners who are resident in Norfolk Island. These amendments correct an anomaly in the provisions that meant certain partners resident in Norfolk Island were not eligible for the partner service pension.
Other amendments will correct minor policy flaws and align the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 with social security law in relation to the deeming of certain income and assets, the income and assets treatment of superannuation benefits and compensation recovery provisions. Many of these amendments represent relatively small changes to our repatriation legislation. However, this finetuning of the Veterans' Entitlement Act is important to those members of the veteran community who will benefit from these changes, and the government sees this legislation as continuing to deliver on its commitment to those who serve in the defence of our nation.
Some of the speakers raised some issues, and I would like to address them. The member for Cowan mentioned that I raised the point that no member of the opposition turned up to ask questions in the debate of the appropriations bill last week. He mentioned that it was intended as a snub to me—not to the veteran community. It seems that the best method of defence is always attack, and that is a pretty good spin to put on a failed appearance. But the fact remains that the opposition leader also failed to mention veterans' issues in his speech in reply to the budget. On another occasion that would not have escaped the notice of the veteran community, out of the 200 promises pledged by the opposition leader in the past 200 days only one had anything to do with veterans' issues. I also point out, and it has been raised by the member for Shortland, amongst other things, that in the Labor Party's platform—a policy document of about 300 pages—any mention of veterans' issues occurs in the last pages, as if in an afterthought, and even then in ambiguous language and so very guarded as to give concern to any person who would look to see the directions that the Labor Party might take in regard to veterans' issues. 
The member for Cowan also raised an issue regarding a Mr Wilby and some letters that had not been answered from my office. I am surprised if he has not yet received a response, and I do apologise to the gentleman if that is the case. I will make inquiries of the department tomorrow. I point out that my department does receive a large volume of correspondence—around 8,000 letters a year—and replies may inevitably be overdue, especially if they do require some investigation, but I will make inquiries tomorrow on behalf of the member for Cowan for this gentleman.
The member for Kennedy raised the issue of the need to do more for our Vietnam veterans. I—and, I think, all in this place—agree that not enough was done at the time our Vietnam veterans returned home from the war. I would like to point out that this government has introduced a range of initiatives especially to assist Vietnam veterans and their families, and they have been very successful—especially our successful heart health program. The government also committed $32 million of funding in the 2000-01 budget in response to the findings of the Vietnam veterans health study that was undertaken by this government. This funding benefits both the veterans and their families. This government funds and supports the health of those children of Vietnam veterans who may suffer from specific health problems like spina bifida, cleft palate, or certain leukaemias or cancers. This has been very well received by the veteran community. Of course, we can always have a look at issues and discuss them with the veteran community, which we do in our consultation process, to make sure that their needs are being met. I note the member for Kennedy also raised the issue of medals. I have had a word to him and referred him to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, who has the responsibility for medals.
I think perhaps the member for Lyons was very confused by this bill. I think he actually confused this particular bill with the Clarke bill. He raised issues about what was being done for the children of veterans. Again I am happy to be able to inform him that we have introduced some very practical measures to assist the Vietnam veterans' children, including the Vietnam Veterans' Children Support Program, which is a very popular sons and daughters program. Also, we have doubled the number of Long Tan bursaries—there are now 30 presented every year for tertiary education to assist specifically the children of Vietnam veterans. Also, as I said, the specialist health care needs of the children are looked at and the Vietnam veterans' children do have access, as do the Vietnam veterans' partners, to our Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, which I understand is very well received.
The member for Shortland raised several issues. She keeps saying that she does not understand. There seems to be quite a lot that the member for Shortland does not understand. She again made the point that the ALP platform has been available since January. As I pointed out earlier in my comments, it is hidden at the back of a 300-page document. I remind the member of the failure of the opposition leader to mention one word about veterans in his reply to the budget. The member for Shortland also asked about the reason for the delay in bringing this bill to the chamber. We tried to seek agreement from the Labor Party to have this bill discussed in the main chamber, but it refused, hence the bill had to take its place in the queue to come to this House.
The member for Shortland raised some very serious allegations about cuts to our Veterans' Home Care program. Nothing could be further from the truth. This program, which is very popular with veterans, has not been cut. We allocated an extra $8.6 million to this program in the budget of 2003-04. The level of service from this particular program for our veterans has been maintained. As a matter of fact, the demand the veterans have for this program shows how popular it is. 
The member for Shortland talked about the purpose of the program. As our veterans and war widows become more frail and aged it may be that this program no longer suits their needs. The purpose of the program was to provide low-level domestic assistance, respite care and support with hazard reduction in the home and in the yard. There may be some veterans whose needs are greater than that, and perhaps they should be assessed for a community aged care package or a program that caters to a higher level of need. I am aware that some veterans in frail and declining health may need to go to a nursing home, but the purpose of Veterans' Home Care is to provide low-level care to suit the needs of the veterans and to help them to stay in their own homes for as long as they can.
Over 100,000 veterans and war widows have been assessed for this service using the telephone assessment instrument, which we believe is highly effective. I understand that the member for Shortland has some complaints about it but, on my advice, this assessment instrument is similar to the HACC assessment instrument. The member for Shortland said that this program has been cut by $4 million. The amount of money that has been allocated to this program in this budget reflects the number of white or gold card holders that will make up our treatment population for the future. Sadly, it does reflect the fact that the number of aged and frail veterans in our community is declining.
Again, the member for Shortland raised the issue of specialists and said that her veterans have to wait until January for a response from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This government has always guaranteed that our veterans will receive specialist care if and when they need it. If the member for Shortland has in her electorate a veteran who is going without specialist care, I need to know about it immediately. We will find a specialist for any of her veterans who are in such a position. To my knowledge, no veteran has gone without specialist care. I urge the member for Shortland to speak to me personally about veterans in that position. I would like to know who they are. Indeed, I ask her to contact my office tomorrow and let me know who they are, so that I can make sure that they receive the specialist care they deserve.
The member for Shortland asked when the government's arrangements for the income support supplement or the rental assistance for war widows will be carried through. I can assure the member for Shortland that that will be done as soon as our department can accumulate the database that is required. There is a need for information that we have never had in our department before—the number of war widows who happen to be in private rental. That information has to be garnered from the war widow community. However, I do think it is very rich of the member for Shortland to ask about what the government is doing about war widows. It was the Labor Party—I am sure I do not need to remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins—that froze out the income support supplement and the indexation arrangements thereto, in the mid-1980s, against war widows. As a matter of fact, the issue is something that is often brought up by the war widows community when I see them. The member for Shortland also raised the issue of veterans' home appliances. We certainly are not cutting that budget; we are streamlining the mechanism for delivery. I am sure that the member for Shortland will find that, when we have a closer look at how we can deliver better, her veterans will certainly be very satisfied. 
That is about all the answers I have to the questions that were raised by members. Again, I thank them for their contributions to the debate. I invite the member for Shortland to speak to me personally about any issues of concern she has with her veterans. I am here to deliver and to answer—and, indeed, we will. In that regard I commend this legislation to the House.

"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I am mindful of the hour and the minister's desire to expedite through the House the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Bill 2004, which we have before us now, so I do not want to delay the House for too long. This is one of those funny bills, where it is almost like a Shakespearean double negative. The intention, the way in which it is expressed, is to say that something that was previously prohibited is no longer prohibited. The fundamentals of interception, as they are found in the telecommunications bill, relate to the existing, plain old telephone system lines—the fact that it was possible to intercept a telecommunication wire essentially by physical means, by tapping into it, and to do that in a live way, because all telephone conversations were live. Generally under that regime it was necessary for the Australian Federal Police or the state police to get a warrant to be able to undertake interception.
We are faced with a bill where there have been a number of different attempts by the government to construct a way of approaching stored communications and bringing them under the aegis of the bill. There have been about three attempts so far and we have finally got something. In his second reading speech the minister quite sensibly pointed out two fundamental things. The first was that there is a 12-month provision in relation to the operation of this bill. As I understand it, this is the first go at trying to get access, without the need for a search warrant, to stored communications—in particular, short message service text and multimedia messaging service text—once they are stored in the memory of a mobile phone, on a card, or, alternatively, to get access to stored emails.
The minister has quite rightly pointed out that, whereas it has been difficult, definitionally, to get an agreement in relation to this in the past, we are now faced with a situation where all sides seem to have a rough agreement. Indeed, our shadow minister indicated that at present, in terms of the House of Representatives, we are willing for this second reading to go through. We think the bill should be looked at in the Senate. 
The core problems, of course, relate to the interface between normal practice and the change into a much more complex world. In addition to the single telephone line there is a vast range of different ways for people to communicate. The greatest problem, of course, for the Australian Federal Police and other agencies seeking to protect the nation is to trawl through immense amounts of data. Even when they have identified persons of interest and seek to then take action, so far they have been prohibited from accessing areas of information which may be vital to the investigations that they have undertaken.
In an age which has changed over the past 10 years because of the war on terror and the actions of al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiah and others, this bill I think is necessary. It is an attempt to grapple with changes in technology and to change the law appropriately—even if here it needs a double negative to do it. So the opposition at this point in time has indicated its support here in the House. It has recommended that the bill go through a more thorough process in the Senate. Being mindful of the hour and the desire to get this through—and also being mindful of the fact that the member for Greenway is shortly to speak—I will leave my observations at that.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT (STORED COMMUNICATIONS) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—in reply—I thank the honourable member for Blaxland for his short but succinct remarks and his excellent understanding of the nature of the problem we face—and there is a problem; let me just make that very clear. We have been treating this over some time, particularly with the Senate as they have trawled over the matters and have made a number of suggestions. I make no bones about it: this is a short-term measure to ensure that the Australian Federal Police are able to access telephone intercepts for what we regard as the normal procedures, where you are tapping a voice, in effect. For anything else—such as texting, email and so on that you have to read—you go and get another sort of warrant.
We are going to have a longer term inquiry. That is why we have a sunset clause: so that it fixes an end to it. That is really why I am disappointed that, while the amendments have been applauded because they meet urgent operational needs, the potential for delay in the Senate is nevertheless foreshadowed. If the Senate could deal with it on Friday—get the Australian Federal Police in—and pass it on Monday, perhaps it would not be a problem. But the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has twice considered proposed amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act in relation to stored communications. On the last occasion, the committee recommended that further consideration of the amendments be deferred until the questions surrounding the interpretation and the proposed amendments had been resolved. Those issues have been resolved.
The amendments have been developed by my department in close consultation with the Australian Federal Police and they should be passed without delay. Not only do the AFP support the amendments; they have called for the amendments to be passed as quickly as possible to meet their operational needs. The amendments are subject to a sunset clause, as I have mentioned, because they are interim in nature and they address immediate operational issues. The need for similar provisions in the long term will be considered as part of a comprehensive review of the communications interception policy that I have asked my department to carry out.
I emphasise again that the amendment is urgently required to ensure the effectiveness of the AFP investigations into serious Commonwealth offences. The amendments address those operational concerns surrounding the lawfulness of means of accessing stored communications. This is an opportunity for the opposition to retain—I hope—some credibility when it comes to matters of national security. It is not enough to suggest that you are supporting stronger intelligence and security law enforcement agencies if you put roadblocks in the way. So I would like you to have another look at it, if you can, and to see whether or not this bill can be approved in the Senate during the course of this week. I commend the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Bill 2004 to the House.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I will tend to some unfinished business first. I was telling the House earlier today about the Australian blind cricket team touring England for the first time ever in August this year to play for the Ashes. They need help financially for the trip. Trivia nights, raffles and footy-tipping competitions will only get them so far. The Prime Minister calls himself a cricket tragic. Well, Mr Prime Minister, this Australian cricket team needs your help. They need the support of the federal government to travel to England to beat the Poms and then to South Africa to beat the Springboks. I call on the federal government to help fund this historic trip for these elite sportsmen who have been chosen to represent our nation in cricket.
On another issue: as I will be retiring at the end of this term of parliament, I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the electors of Greenway, who gave me the honour of representing them in the federal parliament over the past eight years. Chief amongst these electors is my wife, who has been my companion for over 44 years and has been a great source of support, particularly during my professional career as a trade union official for some 27 years and now during my parliamentary career. Jan's support and assistance has been invaluable. I would also like to mention a number of other people who have assisted me. The first would be Jack Miller, the current president of the Blacktown branch of the ALP, who worked hard to ensure I won my preselection and has since been a constant supporter. I would also mention Michael Sommerton, Paul Gannon and Rebel Hanlon, who were my campaign directors at various elections.
ALP candidates rely very heavily on volunteers at election time to staff polling booths, letterbox pamphlets and hold shopping centre stalls. It is not possible to mention all the people who have helped out at election time, but I would like to mention Margaret Koczberski, a member of the Lalor Park branch, who sadly passed away a month ago. Margaret was a good example of the unselfish branch members who work for the party without seeking any personal gain. Margaret was always very proud of the displays of posters at her polling booth. Margaret always had a sharp question or comment at branch meetings for us politicians. She also referred to her branch as the `premier branch'. She was a true character and will be missed by all who knew her. 
Members of parliament rely on the dedication and skills of their personal staff in representing their constituents. Here I have been very fortunate in having Christine Mesa, who has been with me for the full eight years I have been in parliament; Nicole Duffy; Michelle Facchin; Athol Cairn, whom many I am sure would recall; and Steve Duffy, who is in the House tonight. They have all been extremely loyal and hardworking in looking after the interests of the constituents of Greenway.
One of the interesting appointments that I experienced during my parliamentary career was being appointed to the Speaker's panel in my first term. To say that I was inexperienced in the customs and forms of the parliament would be an understatement. In fact, I did not know what door to enter the chamber when it was my turn to occupy the chair. I remember very clearly sitting in my seat in the parliament, up in this direction somewhere, as the minutes for me to occupy the chair for the first time ticked by and seeing Speaker Halverson and the clerks at the table looking anxiously in my direction, no doubt wondering when I was going to make a move. I may still have been sitting there if the Deputy Speaker at the time, Mr Garry Nehl, had not literally marched up and escorted me to the Speaker's chair.
Opposition members interjecting—
—He did. From that point on, over the next eight years, things proceeded fairly smoothly, thanks to the assistance of various clerks and others in this chamber.
I would also like to express my appreciation to a range of people in this parliament—and I certainly will not have time to mention them all—who help make members' lives a little bit easier. To the attendants, the cleaners, the library staff, the Comcar drivers and many others, I simply say, `Thank you'. Finally, through the various House committees and the occasional overseas delegation, I have got to know members on both sides of the parliament extremely well, and this has been a very pleasant part of my period in the parliament. I simply say to all members, particularly members on the other side, good health if not good luck.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I understand that there are informal agreements regarding the length of time for consideration in detail of each appropriation. In the interests of time, I will limit my remarks to four distinct issues and seek to cover two of those in my first observations.
My first area of concern relates to the Great Barrier Reef. Last week the government's energy white paper identified four sensitive offshore basins which are immediately adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park as high priority for oil exploration. I was very surprised to discover this. I have expressed the view previously that oil exploration could seriously threaten the Great Barrier Reef, which is of course a World Heritage listed icon. It is well known that an oil slick can travel for many kilometres and an accident involving oil drilling outside the reef, given prevailing currents and winds, could have catastrophic consequences for the reef and the tourism industries which are dependent upon it. Each year 1.6 million people visit the reef and it is at the heart of Queensland's tourism industry, to which over 200,000 people owe their livelihoods.
I have felt sufficiently strongly about this issue to introduce last year a private member's bill which would extend the Great Barrier Reef region to the exclusive economic zone, which would have the effect of prohibiting mining and exploration both on and near the reef. The government have not supported my private member's bill. I am very concerned they have not supported it, particularly as I now see in the energy white paper reference to these offshore basins and the oil-drilling proposal. If I read it correctly, the paper goes on to suggest that exploration in these areas is in Australia's interest and should be a high priority for government. I am very concerned about that, and I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, first, about the status of the previous application, which we were dealing with when I introduced the private member's bill, from the Belgian company TGS-NOPEC to drill in the Townsville Trough. Is it correct that the government has never ruled this out? Secondly, what is the government's position, and in particular the Minister for the Environment and Heritage's position, regarding these offshore basins? Is their position that it is okay for us to have oil exploration in these areas, having regard to the damage which would occur if there were a spill or an accident of some kind? I indicate that I regard this as a matter of extreme concern.
The second issue I want to raise at this point concerns Australian government greenhouse spending. In January last year there was a very good analysis of Australian government greenhouse spending called `Missing the Target', which talked about the amount of time it would take to spend the alleged $1 billion dedicated to greenhouse issues. It is now my understanding that what is called GGAP Round 3 is to be the final round, to the value of just $30 million, and that we will end up with the situation where $400 million was initially allocated to GGAP but, after all three rounds, $178 million is now the maximum allocated, and indeed this figure itself may be revised downwards as further projects withdraw from the program and/or fail to reach milestones. 
I also expressed concern about what the real GGAP abatement figure is, because we have seen from the minister's press release of May 2003 and answers given in May 2004 different abatement projection figures. I express concern that the GGAP abatement figure is a very difficult number to have confidence in and express the view that the true figure may be much less than what is being claimed, which is a serious matter given that recently we learnt that Australians emit the highest per capita emissions in the industrialised world. Indeed, we emit more than either France or Italy in total, never mind per capita, and only 20 per cent less than the United Kingdom. So I raise that question of greenhouse spending with the parliamentary secretary and also the question of oil exploration in the Great Barrier Reef region.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—The first issue that the member for Wills, the opposition spokesman on the environment, raised is oil drilling or exploration on the Great Barrier Reef and beyond. The member for Wills thought it would be a good idea if we took out of consideration any oil exploration in the area right to the edge of the economic exclusion zone. Let me assure you that the Commonwealth, under our coalition, is very concerned to do two things. Firstly, we want to make sure that the Great Barrier Reef, which is World Heritage listed, remains at the centre of government attention, as it has under the Howard government. As you know, we have extended the area of the marine park to make it one of the world's largest parks. Secondly, we certainly have no intention of endangering any part of that extraordinary piece of coral reef through inappropriate activity, whether that is commercial fishing, coral gathering or indeed oil exploration. Where we are allowing oil exploration it is fully considered in relation to not damaging the area adjacent to the reef. Certainly beyond the reef, as you know, each exploration application gets very careful consideration. The member for Wills asked about the status of the application in the Townsville Trough. I will take that on notice and get back to the member for Wills on that issue.
The member for Wills was keen to know the status of spending on the Australian Greenhouse Office, and on the GGAP in particular. The Australian government is very proud that this was the first dedicated office in any nation that was looking at how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from a country—in this case, Australia—which has a very large greenhouse gas emissions footprint. We found that in some ways the Australian Greenhouse Office when it began was ahead of the pack and a lot of the early initiatives like GGAP required quite a few months, if not years, for different companies to get up to speed to make best use of that grant system. In fact, it is an ongoing process of discussion and there is no limit right now and no intention to contract or claw back what has been promised or put on the table. It is a case of how the applications flow and whether they are applications that meet the criteria of this program and that will deliver the emission reduction targets that Australia has put upon itself and in response to our Kyoto considerations.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I continue to be concerned that these areas have been identified as areas of high priority for oil exploration. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage talks about what the government has been doing in relation to the marine park, but things like the Representative Areas Program can be very much jeopardised and undermined by oil exploration if any accidents or spills occur in such a sensitive area. 
In relation to greenhouse spending, the advice I have is that very extensive underspending has occurred in the Greenhouse Office budget—$136 million in 2001-02; $21 million in 2002-03; and $27 million in 2003-04. Further, the total Greenhouse Office funding for 2004-05 is $71 million, compared with the original commitment of $1 billion over four years. That would be a rate of $250 million a year. So we are at much less than that. We could all run around saying, `We're going to spend a hundred trillion dollars on social services in the next 100 years,' but the point is that spending delayed is spending denied. We have a situation now where the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program is being brought to a conclusion without evidence that it is genuinely improving Australia's track record in relation to greenhouse gas emissions.
I want to move on—become of the shortness of time—to ask the parliamentary secretary for a response regarding two other matters. The first of those concerns the issue of dolphins in the Solomons. The advice given to the opposition has been that something like 74 dolphins have been captured since the time this issue was first raised back in September last year and that 64 have gone missing and are believed to have been exported from Honiara. My questions to the parliamentary secretary are: could she provide an update of actions taken by the federal government and outcomes from those actions in relation to the issue of dolphin capture and export back in September last year; can she confirm reports that 74 dolphins have been captured and have been held in pens in the Solomon Islands; and can she confirm reports that the majority of these dolphins have now gone missing and are expected to have either died or been exported? If these reports are correct, the question for the government is: what action is it taking to try to have these dolphins released?
It has been further said to the opposition that an Australian citizen and ex-Australian Navy chief petty officer, Steve Goodhews, has been involved in the capture, transport and detention of the dolphins and that his vessel, the Lalae, has been used to transport the dolphins. I am interested in the parliamentary secretary's response to this. If these reports are true, what means are available under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and other relevant legislation to take action in this case? What are the government's intentions in relation to taking action in this case?
It is important that we take action to prevent the export of dolphins from the Solomon Islands and to ensure that they are being treated humanely. Australia, as the parliamentary secretary would be aware, condemns the international trade in dolphins—which is not legal under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—The first matter that the member for Wills mentioned was greenhouse spending. He has revisited that particular issue. Having listed a number of years of underspends, it was rather ironic that the member for Wills then wondered why we had reduced program funding in that specific area. As I mentioned in my first response, sometimes a program is ahead of the capacity or ability of an industry or private companies to take up the funding; in particular, when you are talking about new and emerging industries. 
I want to assure the member for Wills of our commitment towards addressing climate change and greenhouse emissions. The new funding provided through the budget and the energy white paper brings the Australian government's commitment to more than $1.7 billion in the greenhouse emissions reduction area. Our original commitment was $1 billion to the Australian Greenhouse Office as our spearhead for reducing emissions, and we are more than on target with $1.7 billion committed. Rest assured that this government will never put funds into projects that are not fully developed—and, obviously, that do not have a great likelihood of success—simply because there are so many dollars on the table. We evaluate each application as it comes in and if no applications are able to meet the criteria then in that particular year there will be an underspend, which will be made up for in other ways—perhaps when a different program is introduced—to help the industry with whatever stage it is at, perhaps in capacity building.
The member for Wills raises a very significant issue in relation to how dolphins and other cetaceans are going to be properly protected and conserved, specifically around Australia and in the Pacific. If an Australian national is involved in any exercise, obviously the Australian government is most concerned that any allegations are fully explored and tested. I do not have the details with me in relation to the dolphins in the Solomons situation, but I can again assure the member for Wills that I will supply him with that information, provided that it is not sub judice.
Let me assure him that—as he has probably become aware in recent times—where there is any suggestion that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act has not been fully adhered to by an Australian national, whether that be making films in the Antarctic or working with endangered or vulnerable species, the Australian government is most anxious to investigate each case that comes up. We have specially trained investigators to do the task. The EPBC Act offers a range of penalties—as the member for Wills is probably aware—ranging from simply a sharply worded letter describing the minor transgression, if that is what has occurred, through to criminal sanctions if there has been a very serious breach of the act. I will get back to the member for Wills with the details about the situation that he referred to.
Let me assure him that this government is leading the world, particularly in the case of the Antarctic, in ensuring that our own nationals do the right thing. We have been leading the world in trying to establish whale sanctuaries in the South Pacific as well as the Southern Ocean in the past, and all the cetaceous species are beginning to have a comeback under this government. We want to say that watching whales and dolphins in their natural marine environment is far better for Pacific economies and the Australian economy than having these species caught for scientific or other reasons or having them displayed in closely confined places.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I thank the parliamentary secretary for her assurances in relation to that issue and look forward to being provided with appropriate information in due course. I have one final matter I wish to raise. That concerns the Daintree and the wet tropics World Heritage area and in particular the recent decision by the Douglas Shire Council to enact a temporary local planning instrument designed to stop the development of freehold blocks which have not yet had development applications.
As the parliamentary secretary and others here will know, the Daintree lowlands is within the wet tropics World Heritage area. It is an area with a fantastic wealth of biodiversity; it has, I understand, the highest number of endemic primitive plants in the world; and it is very significant in nature based tourism. Unfortunately, areas of the Daintree lowlands have been sold off which, if developed, would prejudice the value of that World Heritage area and add to threats to endangered species, including the cassowary. 
I believe that the Douglas Shire Council temporary local planning instrument is a very far-sighted thing and I welcome the step which the shire council has taken. In enacting the temporary instrument they have talked about a need for financial contributions not only from the council themselves—and they are prepared to do that—but also from the state and federal governments to bring about a more permanent and sustainable solution which protects the Daintree World Heritage area.
I understand the state government has been prepared to contribute its proposed $5 million share of the money required. I urge the federal government to contribute the $5 million which they have been asked to contribute to bring about a more permanent solution. My questions to the parliamentary secretary are: I assume the government are aware of the action taken by the Douglas Shire Council, so do they support the temporary local planning instrument, and are they prepared to contribute the $5 million which is needed in order to bring about a more permanent outcome to resolve some of the more unfortunate development and planning decisions which have been made in the past?",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—The Daintree is an extraordinary piece of Australia. The biodiversity there is probably amongst the most diverse in Australia—and, of course, Douglas Shire has long been concerned about how to protect that biodiversity. The cassowary protection has been something the schools have taken up, in particular with Natural Heritage Trust 1 funding. There has been a lot of Green Corps work down there—a lot of Work for the Dole participants have helped to protect parts of the Daintree, particularly cassowary habitat protection.
In terms of the shire council looking at temporary local planning instruments, they do indeed need to be more conscious of the encroachment of urbanisation and smaller block development. Under NHT2, the Commonwealth government has put in place a strategic planning process. The Douglas Shire should be, and I am sure is, an integral part of that planning regime which, in addition to vegetation planning, is looking at endangered species protection. This is a new opportunity for regions to work together so they have consistency in planning and some strategic outlook. At this point we have not been engaged closely with the Douglas Shire on this particular issue, but I will certainly look out for it when it comes through, and we applaud the Douglas Shire for continuing the good work that it does.
Given that the member for Wills indicated that was his final statement—
Opposition members interjecting—

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I realise the time constraints. I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage a few questions in relation to the PM's energy statement made last week and an environmental question in relation to Sydney airport. 
Firstly, as for the geosequestration of carbon dioxide from power stations, I would like to know how practical that is because I make the point that for every tonne of coal burned you have to bury three tonnes of carbon dioxide. As an example, Liddell Power Station in the Hunter Valley consumes about 24,000 tonnes of coal a day so would have to dispose of 72,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per day, and that is a very large amount of gas to pump underground. As you would be aware, carbon dioxide is a gas at normal temperature and would have to be compressed and piped to some remote location to pump into the ground. I have been advised that it is not even a remote possibility, so I ask you if this is correct and, if not, why not? To do all this, it will cost lots of energy—an estimated 16 per cent to 20 per cent of a power station's output. If this is correct, what impact will that have on power bills? Is it not true that solar power stations are advancing rapidly and will produce electricity as cheaply as coal without the added cost of burying the carbon dioxide?
I have one question in relation to Sydney airport, and I would be happy for you to take this on notice. I understand that the phrasing of chapter 13.1 of the final master plan for Sydney airport implicitly denies environmental impacts of lands immediately adjoining land affected by the Airports Act 1996, and other environmental impacts surrounding the immediate land use and planning factors associated with works and activities on airports act land. If that is so, what action will the minister take to ensure that these impacts are capable of assessment and, if none, why not?",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—If I can take the honourable member's first issue first, he referred to the geosequestration technology that was referred to among a number of elements in the new $500 million low-emission technology fund that was announced as part of our energy white paper just last week. This particular fund will stimulate greater investment in low-emission technologies across a whole spectrum of energy sources.
This is just one of those opportunities. It is still in its infancy and certainly not enough is yet on the table for us to have a full-blown program but there is a view that perhaps carbon geosequestration is one of the ways we can deal with carbon emissions. We could put carbon dioxide back into very stable strata where it takes generations—in fact, thousands of years—before there is any likelihood of this carbon dioxide being anything other than locked down there. The idea is that if we could use this funding to successfully develop this process and trial or pilot it, it will be one way that we can have very low emissions from one of our extraordinary sources of energy: our coal.
We are in this country blessed with extraordinary fossil fuel deposits, including some of the best brown and black coal deposits in the world. We do not for a minute suggest that this country can suddenly abolish the use of our fossil fuels—our coals and our gases—and overnight turn into a nation dependent on some of the other energy sources, like wind, solar, hydro and so on. What we wish to do is to also have very low-emission technologies which make greater use of our coals and would allow us to become world leaders, even in exporting such technologies.
One of the technologies that could help our coal fired station energy sector reduce its emissions is this geosequestration concept. It is being investigated in other countries and Australia intends to be there among those who find whether or not it is the answer for a significant portion of our emissions. Let me assure the member that it is not something that we see as the total answer. It is one of many elements. We should look at every possible way that we can develop emission reduction technologies. 
We are also funding things like large scale solar concentrators. We are looking at effective traffic management systems and more energy efficient manufacturing technologies—a whole range of different ways to reduce our emissions. We intend to do it while keeping the economy strong and by keeping the people who currently work in the Hunter Valley and the Latrobe Valley in work in a clean, green industry which will, if necessary, pioneer technologies that can do the job for us.
The member was also concerned about what the environmental impacts might be, if there was a new Sydney Airport development, and how we might deal with those environmental impacts. Let me tell the member that whatever is on the horizons of any local or state governments—or even any private developers—which would in any way threaten habitats or species or heritage values, under our EPBC act it will be looked at. He would be aware that the minister looks at every new project and development that is brought before him and assesses whether or not there is an impact under the EPBC act which would require that project to be modified, changed or even halted altogether. It does not matter what the new project is in Australia. Our EPBC act has a large reach and it is specifically designed to make sure that all of our future development in Australia is sustainable and we do not lose our biodiversity, we do not endanger our species and we certainly do not spoil our great cultural or built heritage.
If I could sum up, the year 2004-05 budget is a very significant budget. Our environment budget was called A sustainable strategy for the Australian continent—which is interesting because it extends our budget commitments to the continental shelf area and indeed to the Antarctic. The Howard government have put some $2.4 billion—a record level of support—into environmental action. That is the largest environmental commitment that we have ever seen from any government since Federation. I am very proud to be a part of the government that have managed to do that. It is an illustration of how significant and important we believe the environment and environmental sustainability are for this great country.
As well, the federal government has put our environment right in the front row through the Sustainable Environment Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, with a whole-of-government approach. Australian government portfolios and agencies are partners in our environmental sustainability strategy, and you see this in all levels of government, whether it is defence, education, health or portfolios like our great industry portfolio. In particular, we look at the lives of people living in remote communities and the resources they need. This is an environmental strategy which is for small country towns and for our large cities, as well as for those who live on the land.
It is a strategic approach to natural resource management and has been complemented just recently by our national approach to energy and greenhouse gas emissions, announced in the new white paper just last Tuesday. Another key feature of the strategic framework is the identification of heritage protection and management as an essential tool for sustainability. The government continues to support major legislation, such as the EPBC act, which has recently been amended to incorporate heritage matters from 1 January 2004.
To summarise, the budget delivered a further $300 million for the Natural Heritage Trust to extend it through to June 2008; $30.3 million over three years to help implement the rezoning plan for the Great Barrier Reef, including a $10.2 million structural adjustment package for displaced fishers and communities; a four-year $463.6 million package to address climate change and greenhouse programs; grants for cathedrals—again, more of our heritage protection; and further funds provided in the contingency reserve for the protection of biodiversity hotspots in Australia. 
Taking into account the environmentally related aspects of relevant government investments through other portfolios—that whole-of-government approach I referred to—I just want re-emphasise that we have yet again provided a record level of support for environmental action, to $2.4 billion. I know all of my fellow coalition members are very proud of our environmental achievements and record in government, particularly what we have achieved with reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. They are some of the best results of any developed nation in the world. At the same time as we have grown the economy, we have managed to rein back our greenhouse emissions in a way that we can all be very proud of.
I thank the members of the opposition who have put questions to us, and I again undertake to bring back some of those answers to questions that needed to be taken on notice.

Proposed expenditure, $3,517,507,000",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—The key question of concern to those engaged in the foreign policy debate of this country is our recent adherence to international obligations for the protection of prisoners, our recent performance in terms of compliance with the Geneva Conventions, and specifically the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the above.
I draw the parliament's attention to a question I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 26 June 2003. This was about three months after the commencement of the Iraq war and only a month or six weeks following the conclusion of the Iraq war. I asked the minister:
Can he explain the system that the Government—
That is the Australian government—
has put in place to ensure that Australia's international obligations under the Geneva Convention are being met, including (a) who oversees that system, (b) who is physically making that assessment across Iraq, (c) where is that person or persons located and how often are they reporting and (d) how many staff are working on that program.
I emphasise that that question was asked almost one year ago today. The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied on 8 September 2003. In response to that part of my question, he said:
The Government established a legal watch group comprising the General Counsel (International Law), Office of International Law in the Attorney-General's Department, the Senior Legal Adviser of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Director-General of the Defence Legal Service, as well as experts in international law drawn from each of those Departments. The legal watch group advises on legal matters of relevance to Australia's participation in the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). The group consults with its counterparts in the governments of the Occupying Powers in Iraq, namely the United States of America and the United Kingdom, to ensure that Australia's international legal obligations are taken into account. 
In addition, Australia has assigned an experienced military lawyer to the Office of General Counsel in the CPA in Baghdad. The Australian Representative Office in Baghdad also conveys Australian views on legal and other matters directly to the CPA, and maintains regular contact with Australia's representative in the CPA Office of General Counsel. 
The answer which the minister provided also deals with other aspects of the question which I asked, but the reason that I have placed this on the parliamentary record afresh this evening is to put in stark context the fact that one year ago I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs precisely what arrangements he was putting in place to ensure that obligations under the Geneva Conventions would be met in Iraq. Of course, obligations under the Geneva Conventions cover, under the third Geneva Convention and in part the fourth, the protection offered for prisoners of war. 
The Minister for Foreign Affairs' reply is quite explicit. It says that he had taken measures to establish an Iraq legal watch group within his department, that it was staffed by three agencies—A-G's and Foreign Affairs, as well as Defence legal—and that its mission was to deal with other powers involved in the occupation in Iraq, namely the US and the UK, to ensure that international legal obligations are taken into account. 
The reason I emphasise this so much at the outset of what I want to say this evening is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Commonwealth of Australia was placed on notice a year ago that the Geneva Conventions were relevant to our period in Iraq as an occupying power and, secondly, was placed on notice as to the importance of his ensuring that he had systems in place within his portfolio to make sure that our obligations under the conventions were being met. He answered to me in parliament in the affirmative, stating quite plainly that a mechanism had been established that comprised three government agencies, the legal experts within them, and furthermore that it intended to liaise directly with other occupying powers in Iraq to ensure that obligations under the Geneva Conventions were met. So the minister was warned. That is all I can say again clearly and unequivocally on the record here.
The question we want to confront this evening in this debate is what then happened on the ground in Iraq as far as the activities of the Australian Representative Office was concerned, which represents the Department of Foreign Affairs' interests in Baghdad? Secondly, what communications occurred between the representative office in Baghdad and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade here in Canberra? Thirdly, what communications, if any, then occurred between the department and the Minister for Foreign Affairs himself? (Extension of time granted)
On the first of those questions, when did the Australian Representative Office in Baghdad first know that there were allegations of prisoner abuse in American detention centres in Iraq? Here, tracing our way through the Defence estimates and the Foreign Affairs estimates and other material which has come to public light, it is a very murky question indeed. I suppose the key question is this: how many situation reports from the Department of Defence legal representatives in US headquarters in Baghdad were communicated to the Australian Representative Office? From the record so far, we can deduce that the Department of Foreign Affairs' view is that there were none so communicated, because we have got no record that I can find, unless the minister or the minister assisting, who is at the table at the moment, can enlighten me. What we do have is a record of what happened in terms of situation reports which had been put together by legal officers embedded within the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad.  
What we have heard from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in estimates is that there were two such situation reports that made reference to prison conditions in Iraq. The first was situation report No. 7, dated 11 June 2003, which I understand dealt with prison overcrowding. According to the department, in its testimony in Senate estimates, the second was situation report No. 16, which covered the period 1-7 September 2003, which did something different—it actually foreshadowed an International Council of the Red Cross prison visit. That, as I understand it, is the record that has been advanced by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in terms of those reports from embedded Defence legal officers with the CPA, which were copied to the Australian representative office in Baghdad.
The thing I do not quite understand is this: the document that has most recently been tabled by the Minister for Defence in the Senate lists a far longer list of situation reports that have been prepared by Defence officers in Baghdad, which were copied to the Australian representative office in Baghdad. If we go through that document, we find that it makes quite interesting reading indeed. We find that situation report No. 8, dated 20-29 June 2003, according to this list provided by the Minister for Defence lists the ARO—that is, the Australian representative office—as one of the original addressees. What does it deal with? It deals with `a range of problems dogging detainee management regime'. It also refers to `meetings with Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross'.
Then we have situation report No. 9, dated 30 June to 6 July 2003. Again, the Australian representative office is listed as an original addressee. It says that this situation dealt with `follow-up meeting with the International Council of the Red Cross and the press conference re: Amnesty International concerns'. We then go to situation report No. 11, covering the period 10-14 July 2003. Again, according to this list provided by Senator Hill, the Australian representative office, controlled by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is listed as one of the original addressees. What does it deal with? It deals with a memo from the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative, Sergio Vieira de Mello—who of course was subsequently tragically murdered by terrorists—to Ambassador Bremer on allegations of human rights abuses and issues of transitional justice. I repeat: it dealt with the senior United Nations representative in Baghdad at the time, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and his addressing of a memo to Ambassador Bremer on allegations of human rights abuses. That is situation report No. 11.
Then there is situation report No. 12 of 21-27 July. Again, according to this list provided by Senator Hill, one of the original addressees is the Australian representative office. What does it deal with? It deals with `the Amnesty International report on the activities of the Coalition Provisional Authority and meetings with Amnesty personnel'. We then come to situation report No. 19, covering the period 20-28 September 2003. Again, it is addressed to the ARO, representing the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Baghdad. It deals with `Human Rights Watch meeting with the CPA, regarding the handling of operations by the Coalition Provisional Authority and CJTF7'—that is, US military headquarters; and `ICRC resumed detention visits at Camp Buka this week'. (Extension of time granted)
We then turn to the situation report covering the period—
—Mr Deputy Speaker I rise on a point of order. I do not wish to interfere with the honourable member's presentation but my understanding was that after a five-minute response the parliamentary secretary would be given a chance to respond and vice versa. 
 (Mr Lindsay)—The member for Hinkler will resume his seat. The parliamentary secretary can rise and seek the call and she will be given the call if she rises. She did not rise.
—We then turn to the situation report covering the period 24-30 November 2003. Again, the Australian representative office, the agency representing the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Baghdad, is listed as an addressee. The report refers to `the then Iraqi minister for human rights raised concerns regarding detention practices' and `the officer coordinated ICRC meetings with the CPA and with CJTF7 staff'—that is, again, US military headquarters.
We then turn to a situation report of 29 December to 4 January 2004. Again, the Australian representative office is listed as an original addressee, and what does it deal with? It is that an International Committee of the Red Cross meeting at CPA palace on 30 December 2003 noted preparation for a large-scale visit to Abu Ghraib. Then we have a situation report covering the period 5-11 January 2004. Again, the ARO is listed as an original addressee, and what does it deal with? It refers to an ICRC visit to Abu Ghraib. The situation report of 12-18 January 2004 again lists the ARO as an original addressee, and again it refers to the ICRC having commenced a visit to the high-value detention facility, which I understand is the general term used for Abu Ghraib.
The situation report of 19-25 January 2004 again lists the ARO as an original addressee. What does it deal with? It refers to an ICRC visit to the high-value detention facility. A situation report for 26 January to 1 February 2004, again addressed to the ARO, refers to a proposed visit by the ICRC. The situation report of 2-8 February 2004, again addressed to the ARO, refers to an officer having chaired a meeting between the ICRC rep and coalition officers. I repeat, the officer—that is, an Australian officer—chaired a meeting between a representative of the Red Cross and coalition officers. We have the situation report of 9-15 February 2004, where the Australian representative office is again listed as an original addressee, and it refers to an ICRC report delivered to Ambassador Bremer during the week which was detailed, comprehensive and highly critical. We have the situation report of 16-22 February 2004. The Australian representative office is again listed as an original addressee, and what does it deal with? The officer will coordinate strategic issues between the Red Cross and the coalition provisional authority. The situation report of 23-29 February 2004 again lists the ARO as an addressee, and here we have an officer chairing a CPA/CJTF7—that is, American field headquarters—meeting with the Red Cross. The report for 1-7 March 2004 again lists the ARO as an addressee. Here we have a reference to the officer participating in a CJTF7 working level meeting with the Red Cross delegation—that is the American military again.
We are nearly finished, but we have a further situation report of 15-21 March 2004. Again, the ARO—that is, the representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Baghdad—is listed as an original addressee, and what does it deal with? It refers to advice received that ICRC has made a number of negative comments about the high-value detention facility known as Camp Cropper. Then we have the report for 29 March to 4 April 2004, where we do not have a reference to the ARO as being an addressee. In fact, that column is left blank here. But that sit rep refers to the officer having chaired a coordination meeting at the CPA involving the Red Cross once again. The sit rep for 12-18 April 2004 again lists the ARO as an original addressee, and it deals with the officer having chaired an ICRC, CJTF7—that is, US field headquarters—and CPA detention coordination meeting. Finally, the report for 19-25 April yet again lists the ARO as an addressee, and it refers to the officer coordinating the handover of the remains of detainees killed in a mortar attack at Abu Ghraib. 
All of those situation reports actually occur prior to the release on 28 April this year of the appalling photographs which have been the subject of such enormous debate in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. But the reason I have read through, at some length, what is in these individual situation reports is to simply highlight one point. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in its estimates—unless I have missed something, and I may have—there were two situation reports sent to the ARO which referred to prison conditions. (Extension of time granted) But the Department of Defence, as I have exhaustively read in that list of situation reports covering that entire period, did not have two situation reports being sent to the Australian representative office in Baghdad; it had 20 situation reports copied to the Australian representative office in Baghdad—not two but 20. It appears to me that here we have a basic conflict in the record between the two agencies.
What I am seeking from the parliamentary secretary at the table is some reconciliation of these two conflicting accounts. It may well be that I have not seen all the evidence that has been placed on the public record; but, if I contrast what is here in this list tabled recently by Senator Hill with that which has been put in the public domain through the most recent department of foreign affairs estimates, there appears to me to be this basic conflict.
When you drill down further into these 20 situation reports and look at what they contain, these are not marginal matters. Firstly, there are 18 references to Australian liaison with the Red Cross. The Red Cross is not an accidental organisation; the Red Cross is the agency charged under the Geneva conventions with the particular mandate and responsibility to ensure compliance with the conventions where you have prisoners of war, in whichever theatre of war. There are 18 references to an Australian officer liaising with the Red Cross. Secondly, we also have three references to Amnesty International—either meetings with Amnesty International or an AI press conference or the Amnesty International report, I believe, of July last year. On top of that, these situation reports also refer to the representations made by Sergio de Mello to Ambassador Bremer on allegations of human rights abuses in Iraq.
These are most significant matters—these are not peripheral matters. They go to the central question of whether or not conventions concerning prisoners were being adhered to in Iraq. And again we have this basic question, which must be reconciled, of the conflict between the two accounts which have been presented so far. The key question lies not so much in the conflicting accounts about what the ARO heard in Iraq, though that is important; the key question, as I see it, is: what information came back from the ARO and/or other sources to Canberra?
Remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that at the outset I read from the Hansard and said that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had established a legal watch group specifically targeted on Iraq, comprising the three agencies of state—Defence, Foreign Affairs and AG's—and legal officers to ensure compliance with the Geneva conventions. That is being set up in Canberra. The minister confirmed that to me in the parliament last September. In the period both before and after that we have evidence, based on the advice contained in this list presented by Senator Hill to the Senate, that 20 situation reports were passed to the Australian representative office and there were multiple dealings with the Red Cross, Amnesty International and other organisations, including the UN special representative, Sergio de Mello. So the key question is: what happened? 
This group was set up, according to Mr Downer, to deal with these problems. What we have from Senator Hill is the fact that there is actually a huge pipeline of information rocketing its way back to Canberra—about the Red Cross, about Amnesty International, about Sergio de Mello. So, what actually happened? I think, when it comes to this question, we need to again be clear about the chronology. As I understand it from the record—from what the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in the estimates—this legal watch group in Canberra started receiving these situation reports from 24 November 2003. The ARO seems to have been receiving these reports from sometime earlier than that, but DFAT told us that in Canberra they were passed on from 24 November.
 So the key practical question is this: how many situation reports actually found their way to this legal watch group set up to govern convention obligations for Iraq? The answer, based on the chronology that I have just read out, is 14. There are 14 individual situation reports out of Defence which deal with these convention compliance matters as they relate to the conditions of prisoners in Iraq.
To look specifically at what DFAT did with this information when they received it, let us take one as an example—the situation report of 24 November. That is an important one because it deals, as I understand it, with the meeting which occurred with the Iraqi minister for human rights, who raised concerns about coalition detention practices, and also with an Australian officer coordinating ICRC meetings. (Extension of time granted) The question that then arises is: what happened about that particular situation report, which conveyed back to the legal watch group in Canberra these concerns raised by the Iraqi minister for human rights, specifically about coalition detention practices?
What we have from Senate estimates, as I understand it, is DFAT saying that they briefed the minister that there were a series of reports from ADF legal officers basically focusing on process issues. Elsewhere I understand DFAT said that they `took no action' in response to that report. I have to say that I find that quite remarkable. If you established in September—according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs—an Iraq legal task force which was designed to ensure convention compliance, and then come November you have a situation report which is confirmed to have been received by DFAT in Canberra and that report contains an allegation by the Iraqi minister for human rights that there are concerns about coalition detention practices, would you not think that someone would do something about it, or is this simply misplaced optimism on my part?
If you go to the other situation reports that have been received over this period of time, a parallel set of questions arises. What was the 11 January sit rep reference to an ICRC report to General Sanchez about? What did it contain? What action was taken by the Iraq legal watch group as far as that situation report is concerned? Here I am referring to the information which has been provided so far through DFAT estimates. Secondly, we have the 18 January sit rep. There was a public controversy on prisoner abuse which had focused attention on the issue. Again, what action was taken by the Iraq legal watch group in response to that situation report given the summary that has been provided of it? 
We have, furthermore, a 29 February sit rep which referred to `very serious allegations' discussed during an ICRC, CPA, CJTF-7 meeting. Again, what was done in response to that? Furthermore we have a 15 February report, which is often referred to as the Muggleton report, which offers broader comments on US approaches to detention issues and `makes some observations about US and Australian approaches in a broadbrush way on detention issues'. We were advised, again through estimates, as I understand it, that these matters were raised in broad terms at the 26 February meeting of the Iraq legal watch group in Canberra, but we are not advised as to what action was taken by the Iraq legal watch group once that information was provided.
The final one I would like some response to is the situation report of 2 May. It refers to the possibilities of the sorts of incidents depicted in the photos having been foreshadowed in earlier sit reps, including the sit reps of 29 February and 9-15 February.
The reason that I have referred to this in some detail is that it points to a large number of situation reports which it seems to be confirmed were received by the Iraq legal watch group established by the minister to ensure compliance with the Geneva conventions, but we have no evidence here as to what action was taken by the Iraq legal watch group in response to each of the situation reports. They are not dealing with abstract matters; they are actually dealing with quite specific matters which relate to the treatment of prisoners, the role of the Red Cross and the role of the coalition authorities in maintaining the detention system. These are most serious matters. The key questions that we seek answers to are: what action was taken and, if no action was taken, why was it not taken? The minister was quite explicit in saying back in September that he had established this Iraq legal watch group to ensure that these sorts of convention obligations were adhered to.
The other thing I would like to touch on is the question of the minister's own knowledge. What I have dealt with so far is, firstly, what information came to the Australian representative office in Baghdad; secondly, what information came from the Australian representative office and other sources to the Iraq legal task force and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra; and, thirdly, what actually went on to the minister—he who boasted in parliament last September that he had established this thing called the Iraq legal task force to ensure that all obligations under the Geneva convention in relation to detained prisoners were being met. What about the Minister for Foreign Affairs himself? On the public record he has said in relation to his knowledge of the sorts of abuses which became apparent through the photographs released on 28 April that his first knowledge of allegations of prisoner abuse came from January, referring to a press release at the time. (Extension of time granted)
There is a little problem which has now emerged for the foreign minister on this question. Last week in question time in the House of Representatives I asked the foreign minister when he came into possession of this little document I am holding, which is the Amnesty International report of July 2003 entitled Memorandum on concerns relating to law and order. You will recall that I made some reference to that, Mr Deputy Speaker, because it features in some part of the discussion between officials in Baghdad in their dealings with the Red Cross, with other officials and directly with Amnesty International officials in Baghdad.
My question to the minister in parliament last week was: when did you receive this? After refusing to answer the question, he came back at the end of question time and said, `Well, of course this document entered the public domain on the Amnesty International web site as of about July last year.' That was a very interesting revelation, because what we have then is the minister's confirmation that this document was available to him, to his office and to the Department of Foreign Affairs as of July last year. But the minister's contention was that he was not aware until this year of the sorts of abuses at Abu Ghraib which became evident through the publication of photographs. 
What are the sorts of abuses which became apparent at the Abu Ghraib prison through the photographs released this year? In part 5 of its report of July last year, Amnesty International welcomed certain things that the authorities had done, but went on to say:
... the organization has received a number of reports of torture or ill-treatment by Coalition Forces not confined to criminal suspects. Reported methods include prolonged sleep deprivation; prolonged restraint in painful positions, sometimes combined with exposure to loud music; prolonged hooding; and exposure to bright lights. Such treatment would amount to “torture or inhuman treatment” prohibited by the Fourth Geneva Convention and by international human rights law.
This is a statement from Amnesty International from July last year. Elsewhere in this report it indicated that the information upon which it based its reports is from Amnesty delegates that it has had present in Iraq since 24 April last year—in other words, covering the period April, May and June, with the report coming in July. Therefore, what we have from this report is a clear demonstration that the report contained a specific alert to those sorts of abuses, which are totally in contravention of the fourth Geneva convention. This is the report which the minister said in parliament last week was available publicly as of July last year.
So the question for the foreign minister to answer is this: what were your officials, what was your office and what were you doing when this thing was released in the middle of last year? It goes to the core of a large number of the abuses which became documented this year. This was produced in the public domain six months beforehand. The minister himself confirmed that it was available on the web from that time. What did he do about it? We do not have an answer, though we were told earlier on that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had established the Iraq legal task force in order to ensure full compliance with the Geneva conventions.
Of course the foreign minister's response to all of this was as follows: what did the opposition do about it? Why didn't we jump up and down about it at the time? I will tell you why: we had a view, based on this formal undertaking to the parliament by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that these matters were in hand—properly in hand. I asked him in June last year, `What systems have you put in place to ensure convention compliance in Iraq; what reporting mechanisms have you established; and what group of officials have you got working on this?' He answered me in September and said, `I have established the Iraq legal task force.' But when it comes to simply accessing this document, which contains this information in the public domain, apparently no action was taken by the Iraq legal task force on this matter. So we as an opposition foolishly placed our confidence in the minister's assurance to the parliament in September last year that he had the mechanisms in place to ensure that any question of noncompliance with the conventions was going to be dealt with.
Why is all this important? It is important because in this period Australia was an occupying power. There is a dispute between us and the government as to the term of the occupation, but this Amnesty International report for the period April, May and June last year covers a large slice of the period of time when the government itself does not contest that it was not an occupying power. (Extension of time granted) So this is a most significant matter, because this report from Amnesty International deals with a period where even Mr Downer, Senator Hill and the Prime Minister accept that Australia was an occupying power and therefore part of the conjoint government of Iraq, and therefore legally responsible under the conventions for ensuring that all prisoners, be they civilian or military, were properly treated in accordance with the conventions. This is a most serious matter. 
We will leave to one side the debate between us and the government about when the period of our occupation or role as an occupying power ceases. We have argued that that ceases as of 30 June this year, because that is when the interim Iraqi government takes over. The government has chosen to part company with us on this, but that is a debate for another day. But I do note in passing—and I would appreciate the parliamentary secretary's response to this as well—that in legal opinions which have been tendered by Professor Gillian Triggs of the Faculty of Law of the University of Melbourne, Andrew Byrnes, Professor of the Centre of International and Public Law, Faculty of Law, ANU, Hilary Charlesworth, from the same university, and Gerry Simpson, Reader, Law Department, London School of Economics, all of them contend quite clearly in these two separate legal opinions that Australia's responsibilities as an occupying power are clear cut, and that furthermore we have particular additional responsibilities as a detaining power.
This leads us, in conclusion, to this arcane debate which the government has engaged in about what our responsibilities as a detaining power are. We have an exercise in medieval metaphysics engaged in by the government—through some of its advisers as well, I fear—trying to remove Australia from any responsibility for those prisoners it has taken into its custody. Article 12 of the fourth Geneva convention is very clear on this. It says quite plainly that if you detain a prisoner, which means you take that person into your custody, and then hand them over to someone else for the purposes of incarceration, you, the detaining power, maintain responsibility for that prisoner once you have handed them over.
Of course, what the Australian government sought to do was to legislate their way out, by legal agreement—or sublegal agreement—with the Americans and the British, from any responsibility for having detained those people it captured in the first place. The legal fiction the Australian government seeks to construct is: if I go out there and actually arrest somebody in the context of a military operation, I have not detained them—of course not—because I have an American chap with me in the field. Having arrested this guy in the middle of a battle and handed him over to the American up the back here, he becomes the detaining power as of that millisecond, therefore getting us off the hook for any legal responsibility for this guy's wellbeing subsequently. So we have troops in the field. They, we now discover, have actually physically detained 120 Iraqis in the period of this war, and we have this cute arrangement—which would fail against any test of law if it was to be heard internationally—whereby the Australian government is saying, `Oh, we didn't detain this person. They have simply been handed over to the Americans, who become the detaining power at that point.' This simply does not stack up, and I draw honourable members' attention again to the legal opinions I have referred to before, which make it plain that we have responsibilities as a detaining power for those individuals as well. 
What specifically are those responsibilities? They are as follows. Firstly, when we are part of the conjoint occupation of Iraq we are required to have set in place a proper system for the detention of all prisoners consistent with obligations under the Geneva conventions. Furthermore, on top of that, we have a particular responsibility for the physical protection of those prisoners taken in that March to May period when the government itself concedes that we were an undiluted occupying power. Thirdly, for the 120 individuals who have been incarcerated by Australians, we have a responsibility to ensure that their cases have been taken into account.
To conclude, we have a Minister for Foreign Affairs who acts as Pontius Pilate on these matters, not just pushing to one side the Australian government's responsibility for ensuring that its obligations under the Geneva conventions are met in relation to these individuals, but Pontius Pilate also in relation to the poor old Minister for Defence. He has been sold the total hospital pass on this. It is all a Senator Hill problem; it is not an Alexander Downer problem. We know what an absolutely fine relationship those two individuals have with one another. They loathe each other; they hate each other's guts. But what we have got right now is the foreign minister ducking for cover allowing the defence minister to take the entire responsibility on his shoulders, whereas fundamental questions need to be answered given the documentary record I put before the parliament this evening. The Minister for Foreign Affairs must make a full statement to the parliament outlining what action was taken in response to the information he was given about convention compliance.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—The member for Griffith in full flight is something indeed to behold. My apologies to those following, as we seem to have in one speech gone well over our full time. During his speech the member referred to, and these are his exact words, `a question I do not quite understand'. May I refer his very own words back to the member and remind him that we are actually looking at the appropriations in detail.
I am glad that the member does not seem to have any problem with the actual appropriations. We have the biggest ever aid budget, which is now at over $2.133 billion. I presume that, having made no comment on it, the member has no problems with it and nor with the way the aid money is distributed. I take his silence as congratulations to this government that we are now in fact providing 0.26 per cent in overseas development assistance. Neither in the DFAT issues have I heard any reference to the money that we will be spending on the biometric passports, so I conclude from this that the member is indeed very happy for us to be spending that money and indeed has no concerns about any of the appropriations at all.
I turn to something of the substance that the honourable member was talking about. He referred quite frequently to estimates and what in his view was a conflict between what was found out in Defence estimates and what was found out in DFAT estimates. I suggest to the member for Griffith that this is not the place to discuss anything that happened in estimates. Perhaps he should have asked his own senators to explore that, because indeed this is an examination of the appropriations in detail. As the member for Griffith and nobody else has raised any other questions and as we are now well over time for our segment, I shall leave it at that and be very glad that everybody is so very happy with our aid budget and indeed our DFAT budget.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I rise on the question of detail in respect to health and ageing to raise with the minister a number of cases that have been brought to my attention. Some of them she may have some difficulty in answering on the spot and I am happy if she comes back to us at a later date, if that could be done. But what I will do now, in order to help move proceedings along, is read out the examples. If she would be kind enough to comment at the end of that I would appreciate it. That might help me move along at a faster rate than if we were jumping up and down on half-a-dozen occasions.
I am reading explicitly from communications that have been received, so I will go to that now and apologise in advance for some of the grammar. In some cases anyway it may well be me. This is the first case:
My partner has been diagnosed with a brain tumour. I was sitting in a waiting room of a private suite. Before us, a couple came out of the consulting room looking obviously very alarmed by the news just received. The doctor came out and asked his secretary to organise an intervention for the next morning at 6.30 a.m. As discussion progressed, the patient is asked directly to pay $10,000 in cash or bank cheque. There was no access to credit, EFTPOS or personal cheque accepted for payment by the hospital, who would not accept the patient before cash payment was made. The doctor forwarded a personal cheque for the hospital and the couple gave a personal cheque to the doctor in return. 
(Extension of time granted) 
That is one case, which I would like the minister's comment on if she is able to.
The second case reads:
Following up for a constituent has revealed that, if families are electing to receive their FTB part A as a lump sum, they will not be entitled to receive the increased benefits of the new safety net until next year. Is this something that you were aware of? This is info provided by the Brisbane office and they were struggling with it all, but thought I would pass it on anyway. Further inquiries on behalf of the constituent also revealed that, even though she had changed her FTB part A over to fortnightly payments, thereby risking a debt, and produced a letter from Centrelink confirming the changeover, Medicare could not act to allow the increased benefits until their system was updated, which could take a couple of weeks.
The third case reads:
She has a 16-year-old son who no longer goes to school and is not studying, therefore ineligible for youth allowance. He has no income whatsoever. When his mother went into Medicare to register the family for the safety net, she was informed that because her son is 16 he does not qualify as part of the family for this new system. He is on her Medicare card and she pays all of his expenses, medical and otherwise. My husband is pretty sure that he heard her say something about a person needing to be 18 before qualifying as a single person for the safety net, which of course means that those people aged between 16 and 18 fall into a black hole.
The fourth case reads:
I am a 76-year-old widow pensioner, and I have just received the booklet from the Prime Minister with regard to the Medicare safety net for pensioners and I would like to query this with my recent experience with Medicare. On 2 March I had two basal cell cancers removed from my face by a plastic surgeon. I was charged $300 over and above the scheduled fee. I contacted Medicare with regard to this being now my safety net, but as there was no item number quoted on the receipt I was informed that I would need to get the plastic surgeon to give it a number. On inquiring from the plastic surgeon, I was informed this charge was for the use of his operating room and therefore not applicable. 
The fifth case reads:
I went to Medicare on Thursday to collect payment from a doctors visit. Whilst there, they registered me for the safety net and then told me that we as a family had passed the $300 out-of-pocket expenses. They informed me that they would not be able to start paying me the 80 per cent gap payments until I supplied them with either receipts or statements from the doctors/specialists of the payments we have made. I found this interesting, because they already have all the details, we have been reimbursed and they keep all the receipts. So we have to approach all doctors, specialists, radiographers et cetera et cetera we have seen. They stated that they would send us a letter outlining all that we needed to do to get the 80 per cent gap payments. This would be difficult for those that are very sick and frail, and I believe that this process is set up to deter people from claiming the 80 per cent gap payment that they are supposed to be entitled to.
I have another two questions, and again I apologise for the sketchy nature of the information. One is a suggestion that a constituent rang the hotline and was told that there is no need to register to be eligible for benefits. I would like to get a comment on that. The last point I would like to raise is: can the Minister for Ageing inform us as to what, if any, advice has gone out from the minister or the department to help individual MPs with questions about the safety net?",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—The member for Bruce reeled off a series of scenarios, and I have to confess that my shorthand is not as good as it used to be. In fact, my shorthand has never been good. So I did not quite keep up with all of them. He did offer me the opportunity to take these questions on notice, as it were, and I am sure there is somebody on the government side who would be only too happy to sit down with the member for Bruce for as long as it takes to answer his questions.
In relation to a couple of the issues, particularly the first question in relation to the communication that the member for Bruce received, where the people were overhearing a conversation between a doctor and a patient—something about a $10,000 cash payment—this is an in-hospital issue. The Strengthening Medicare safety net is not directed to in-hospital issues, so it is not a safety net issue. That is obviously why the government supports private health insurance and the rebate for private health insurance. Also, I do point out that, although the government is responsible for setting fees for Medicare benefit purposes and for the payment of Medicare benefits, we do not have any direct power or authority to determine the fees charged by doctors or their billing practices. Nor can we compel them to observe the MBS fee for a particular service. As the member for Bruce well knows, medical practitioners are free to set their own value on their services, and the actual fee charged is a matter between the doctor and the patient, although, of course, the government would implore doctors to show compassion when dealing with scenarios such as that referred to by the member for Bruce. Again, this is a very strong argument for supporting rebates for private health insurance.
The second issue I believe related to family tax benefit A. If I understand the member for Bruce correctly, if a person chooses to receive access through the tax system then, yes, the threshold will be the following year. In relation to the third scenario about the 16-year-old, I can confirm that, to be considered part of a family for the purposes of the safety net, a child must be either dependent and under 16 years or a full-time dependent student under 25. If a child turns 16, they would still be considered part of the family for safety net purposes provided they were a full-time dependent student. However, if the child is no longer a full-time student or is living independently, they would no longer be considered part of the family for the purposes of the safety net. I must say that I cannot recall the particular circumstances that the member for Bruce referred to, but, as any family approaches the safety net threshold, Medicare will contact them to confirm the registered family has not changed and to substantiate any further gap payments that might have been made. If the family has reached the safety net threshold prior to the child becoming independent, the family, including the independent child, will continue to receive higher benefits for the remainder of that calendar year. In the following calendar year the independent child would be considered as an individual for the purposes of the safety net. 
For scenario 4, all I got was that it was about a plastic surgeon, so that is one I will have to come back to you about. On scenario 5, in relation to the keeping of receipts, I confirm that receipts should be kept. Was there another? I recall the five and, on that basis, I will hand back to the opposition.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I thank the minister for her response. There are a couple of other issues in there which she will need to have a look at, but the other two points that I made towards the end were not actually a scenario. A question had been raised along the lines of a constituent having rung the hotline and being told that there is no need to register to be eligible for benefits. Is that the case? The second thing was: has any advice gone out from the minister or the department to members of parliament about dealing with questions regarding the implementation of the system and the safety net?",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I would like to raise with the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing why money was not appropriated in the budget for a Medicare-eligible MRI licence for Concord Hospital. Minister, the health minister is well aware of a longstanding campaign that I have been running in the parliament, over more than two years—with his predecessor, and him more recently—to get the government to grant a Medicare-eligible MRI licence for Concord Hospital. I would explain that Concord Hospital is a teaching hospital of Sydney University and it is also the veterans' hospital.
The tragedy of this issue is that the minister has met with medical staff associated with the hospital and he gave them a clear expectation that he would be granting the licence for the MRI machine in the foreseeable future. So the administrative staff and the staff of the radiology department of Concord hospital, the academic staff of Sydney University who work at the hospital and indeed the veteran community—the RSL and the War Widows Guild, for example—have an expectation that the minister will be granting an MRI licence.
I draw to the attention of the minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing that on 9 June Minister Abbott announced that the government would be funding 23 more Medicare eligible MRI machines. One of the three locations that the minister announced included the federal seat of Adelaide, the government's most marginal seat in South Australia. You can imagine how that has gone down with the people I have been representing for a long period of time. The minister has stated that the remaining 20 locations will be announced within a few weeks, after consultation with the radiology profession and clinicians. 
During members' statements just before question time today, I raised this issue again. I was hoping that the minister would be here tonight so that I could ask him face to face. I do not think it is doing the minister any good that he has not granted the licence. I would like the Minister for Ageing—if she cannot give an answer now—to go back to the Minister for Health and Ageing and ask him when he will grant the MRI licence for Concord hospital or whether he has now changed his mind.
As my colleague the member for Fraser, the shadow minister for finance, well knows, we are going to provide an MRI licence to Concord when we get into government. The state Carr government has purchased, at a cost of $2.8 million, the MRI machine—a state-of-the-art machine—and it is going to be installed very shortly. I suspect that, within these 20 locations, the minister might cynically be about to announce that Concord is going to get one but we will have to wait until the election is called. I suspect that that announcement will be done by the minister side by side with my opponent outside Concord hospital. I think that is pretty cynical and I do not think it will go down very well with the administrative staff at the hospital, the academic staff of Sydney University, the veteran community, the staff of the radiology department or the other specialists who are dependent on this vital piece of equipment.
I would ask the Minister for Ageing to take that question back to the minister if she cannot answer it now. I would ask her to clarify the situation, because it is becoming quite embarrassing for the minister. He cannot give medical staff associated with the hospital—people who have a passionate interest in this matter—nods and winks that it is going to be granted and then just wait cynically until very shortly before the election to announce that it is going to be granted—against the background that one was announced last week in the seat of Adelaide, the most marginal seat in South Australia.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—The member for Lowe raised the issue of additional Medicare funded MRI units. Without a doubt, expanding access to MRI units is a key government priority. It is reflected in the radiology quality and outlays memorandum of understanding with the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists and the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association. There has been a great deal of collaborative work done to expand Medicare access to MRIs. The department has consulted with the profession and with other key stakeholders on the initiatives, and discussions around this issue are of course complex.
The member for Lowe refers to an announcement of 23 more Medicare eligible MRI machines, and, of course, that is the case. I reject absolutely his charge of a cynical allocation of MRI machines. We are talking about the health, safety and welfare of all Australians. The federal seat of Adelaide covers the city of Adelaide and surrounding areas. I have no doubt that the good people of Adelaide and of South Australia are also worthy recipients of an MRI machine. There are always competing demands for limited resources. In relation to the specific allegations that the member for Lowe has made against the Minister for Health and Ageing, suggesting that he is giving a nod and a wink, that is not the minister's style, it is not the way the minister would operate. I will take the matters on board and raise them directly with the Minister for Health and Ageing. Without doubt, the overall package announced in the 2004-05 budget is a substantial investment in the health and ageing needs of the Australian community, including communities that need and deserve a Medicare accessible MRI machine.

"Jackson, Sharryn, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I hope the minister might be able to provide some clarification on the issue of districts of work force shortage, particularly in the Perth outer-metropolitan area, in respect of eligibility for the outer metropolitan work force programs and areas which are considered to be areas of unmet need. On first becoming elected, I was very concerned at the shortage of GPs in my electorate and I was extremely confused that a number of suburbs in my electorate were not part of the eligible districts for assistance. I raised this at the Senate Medicare inquiry in July last year. As you can imagine, I was reasonably pleased when an announcement was made by the member for Pearce in Western Australia indicating that a whole range of suburbs would now be eligible for inclusion in the outer-metropolitan areas. 
When I visited the department's web site, I found that there is a new category called `an area of consideration'. These are not the green striped areas of unmet need or recognised district of work force shortage but areas of consideration. I have had a couple of examples of where we have been unsuccessful with local practices in trying to access the programs for areas that are in areas of consideration. I would like to ask the minister: what is an area of consideration and how is it treated differently to areas that have already been defined as districts of work force shortage? How does it change the current policy? What are those practical changes and how have they assisted practices and other people operating in those areas of consideration?",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—I appreciate the question from the member for Hasluck but, given the time, I first want to answer the member for Lowe. I am sorry that he has left, but more information has come to hand. So, if the member for Hasluck would not mind, I would like to state, further to my answer in relation to the MRI machines, that in fact no decision has been taken in relation to Concord hospital. The government has agreed to fund up to 20 MRI machines on the basis of expert advice, which of course will be based on a consideration of geographic need and the level of private patient activity. In fact, three new machines have been announced for specialist children's hospitals. They include the Adelaide children's hospital and—
—Princess Margaret.
—Princess Margaret Hospital in my own electorate of Curtin—indeed; thank you. I knew that: Princess Margaret Hospital in my electorate of Curtin. I was just reading it, `PMH', thinking, `I hope there is not another one, because that is mine'! So the hospitals also include Princess Margaret Hospital and the Royal Children's Hospital in Brisbane. No decision has been taken regarding any other sites, so I will put that on the record.
In relation to work force shortages, of course the Australian government remains concerned about this issue. A major reason for the development of these shortages has been changes in supply characteristic of the medical work force; in particular, a move towards shorter average working hours for medical practitioners and the like. In order to address this issue the government made the work force a major focus of its $2.85 billion package for `Strengthening Medicare' that was announced back in November 2003—of course, that is now a $4 billion package over five years. 
Under that package, the number of appropriately qualified overseas trained doctors operating in Australia is to be significantly increased through a number of measures: more than 1,600 full-time equivalent nurses are to be supported through the practice grants; the introduction of the Medicare benefits schedule item will free up the equivalent of around 160 general practitioners; 280 funded short-term placements are being made available each year for junior doctors to work under supervision in general practices, specifically in outer metropolitan and rural and regional areas; refresher training courses and other supports are being provided to general practitioners and specialists who are no longer practising medicine to help them return to the medical work force; and higher Medicare rebates are being paid to non-vocationally-registered general practitioners practising before 1996 if they operate in an area of work force shortage.
Further, we have increased the support to general practitioners in rural and remote areas who provide procedural services like obstetrics and minor operations. Access to GP work force programs is being extended to areas of consideration which are rural in character but are in the same statistical local area as a large town. There is additional funding, which I am very concerned with and very interested in, to GPs who provide care to patients in aged care facilities. There are 246 new medical school places being made available to students who agree to work in areas of work force shortage. There are 150 new GP training places being offered each year—an increase of about a third. These are wide-ranging initiatives which we believe will increase the number of full-time doctors by more than 1,500 by 2007. There is a whole range of other medical work force initiatives which I do not think time will permit me to go into. But these measures have assisted greatly in increasing the supply of general practitioners in outer metropolitan as well as rural and remote areas.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Jackson, Sharryn, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I thank the minister for her answer, but I would ask again, first, if she could clarify for me what are `areas of consideration'; second, how are they identified; and, third, how they affect the actual application of the programs in this area vis-a-vis the current policy of a district of work force shortage. Is it just colouring-in a map, or is there some benefit or purpose to being designated an area of consideration? I really am curious, given practical experiences in this regard.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—The member for Hasluck raised the issue of reclassification of rural, remote and metropolitan areas. The RRMA is a measure that has been used for many years to differentiate between geographic areas based on their relative rural status—for example, while rural remote metropolitan area 1 areas are capital cities, RRMA 5 areas are more remote. It has been used for many years to determine eligibility for, for example, rural health programs.
I understand that the RRMA classification works most of the time but at times it throws up anomalies. For example, it does not take into consideration local issues that impede access to health services, nor does it take into account health status. It is purely a geographical classification. In light of those issues, the Minister for Health and Ageing asked the department to take a more systematic approach to determining which areas qualify for particular programs. The introduction of `areas of consideration' in the near future is a measure that will determine eligibility for the Rural Other Medical Practitioners Program and the Rural Locum Relief Program. So that is under consideration. 
It is intended to offer a more structured way to address the obvious anomalies in the rural, remote and metropolitan areas classification system. In the longer term, in recognition of the limitations of the RRMA classifications as a means to determine access to a range of health programs, the minister is commencing a comprehensive review of the RRMA classification system. The review will look at far more than just geography and will look to incorporate health status measures and health services access measures, such as the availability of GPs, in developing a new classification system.

"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I want to speak today on a couple of issues relating to the small business part of this industry portfolio, on two different issues of concern which I have relating to circumstances for small business in Australia and on Australian government policy as it relates to them. First, I want to talk about the Trade Practices Act and the crying need for the government to respond to the Senate Economics References Committee report released on 1 March. As you would expect, I agree with the majority recommendations that were supported by the Labor Party members of that committee—and I will come back to them if time permits—but we have the amazing circumstance where even the government members who brought down a minority report were recommending major changes; I would like to go further, but they were recommending major changes. I think they had initially indicated a sympathy for going even further than they did in their report, but the government probably managed to persuade them that that was not a very good idea. They certainly proposed to go far beyond the very timid suggestions that came from the Dawson committee of inquiry. Yet we have the government circulating for comment a draft trade practices amendment bill which, as I understand it, was circulated significantly after the Senate committee's report came down—a copy of which I have here—which does not go to any of the recommendations of even the minority report of the committee, let alone the more sweeping recommendations of the majority.
It is a source of great disappointment to me and will be a source of great disappointment to small business in Australia if we find that the government introduces this wholly inadequate response to the crying need of small business for amendments to the Trade Practices Act to enable them to more effectively compete with their larger competitors. It is most often seen in the retail sector, but it affects many people who are suppliers to major retailers, who are suppliers—even farm suppliers, particularly in the dairy industry—to powerful purchasers. They require changes to the Trade Practices Act—particularly to section 46. The Labor opposition has put out a comprehensive series of propositions about specific amendments that we would like to see to deal with the abuse of market power, to introduce cease and desist orders, to introduce a power of divestiture in cases of repeated abuse of market power by hard-core cartels and to combat creeping and cumulative acquisitions. Those are just four propositions that are an important part of the sevenpoint plan that the Leader of the Opposition outlined.
None of this is in the legislation, nor even, as I say, are the more modest propositions from the government members on that Senate references committee, who brought down a minority report. The minority report was disappointing but certainly far better than the proposition that the Treasurer has circulated for comment as a proposed set of amendments to the Trade Practices Act. It really does show that if the government are going to proceed down this very disappointing track then the whole question of the government's advocacy for small business is shown to be a hollow shell. I am sure that they must be able to do better. 
I understand the Prime Minister has said he is going to make a major statement on the Trade Practices Act in early July. I hope that is to say that this draft has been ditched and that the advocates of small business who reside in this portfolio—the Office of Small Business and the minister for small business—have been able to prevail on the Prime Minister to overrule the Treasurer and come up with a more comprehensive set of amendments. This proposition is totally unsatisfactory and disappointing. It ignores the real need of small business for the Trade Practices Act to have some teeth and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to have the capacity effectively to represent those small business interests when they come into conflict with the interests of big business.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2004-06-21,—I say to the member for Fraser that the amendments he is talking about in relation to the Trade Practices Act are more appropriately dealt with through the Treasury portfolio. I will have to take the issues he has raised on notice and we can respond accordingly.,REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—That is a disappointing but not surprising response. I understand that the legislation itself is the responsibility of the Treasurer. I am aware of that. But the only voice that will change the government's inadequate response is the voice of small business, whose advocates lie within this portfolio. That is why I have raised it here even though I accept that what the parliamentary secretary says is true. To some extent that also relates to the matter I want to raise now, because some of the issues that have arisen recently which are causing concern to small business do relate to other changes within the Treasury portfolio that totally ignore the interests of small business. We find the government advocating changes that fit ideological preconceptions of the Treasurer and/or the interests of larger businesses but it fails totally to listen to small businesses of Australia. The government takes for granted that small business will support it because overwhelmingly the owners of small business do support the coalition. So the government takes them for granted and simply delivers to their larger competitors.
I will not reiterate those things I have already said about trade practices, which is really an example of that. But we have another example today, where the government is trumpeting its success in getting a deal with the Democrats with regard to choice of superannuation. My colleague the shadow minister for superannuation has made a whole series of points about that which are not relevant to tonight's discussion and I will not raise them here. They are appropriate for discussion in other debates. But the council of small business have quite properly today in their newsletter the COSBOA Broadcast raised their concern about the possibility that the superannuation choice legislation raises that employers will have to submit to many different funds. It is fine for big businesses with human resources departments and computerised employment systems. There is hardly any extra cost if their employees contribute to different funds. I understand that. We have other arguments about the way in which the government has proposed this question of choice, and they are not relevant to today. But I do want to say that this change which has been announced today is going to cause a lot of small businesses a lot of heartache. The last thing they need is more red tape, but it is quite conceivable now that a business with 12 employees will wind up contributing to three, four, five or theoretically even 12 different superannuation funds. If you do not have your own human resources department—you are out the back doing the books yourself—and you do not have the high-powered computer power that flows from BHP, AMP and all the big employers then what you have got is just more administrative red tape burden for small business. 
What I want to say to the government is this: stop proposing all these changes that may suit your preconceptions. The government have always wanted to introduce this measure. They have their reasons. We do not agree with it but it is a democracy and they are entitled to pursue their argument. But if they are going to do it, they need to think about the fact that what they are doing is saying to every small business in Australia, `You are at serious risk of a greater burden of red tape and a greater burden of administration.' Small businesses are already overburdened.
We know what the biggest red tape burden is because the surveys, including ones by the New South Wales State Chamber of Commerce, tell us that it is still the problem of the BAS and the GST. The government has proposed changes to the BAS compliance system that will apply only to the very smallest businesses. The government knows that the measure that would best deal with BAS compliance difficulties is the measure that the Leader of the Opposition introduced as Taxation Laws Amendment (A Simpler Business Activity Statement) Bill 2003. It continues to be our policy. It continues to have the support of small business. The government will not go there for one simple reason: it is a proposition that the opposition put forward first.
I am concerned that what they have put forward this time is a very inadequate measure. It covers only the very smallest of businesses. It actually by moving to annual returns creates the risk of a very big cash flow hole for some small businesses to manage at what could be the worst possible time for them. In superannuation and in tax administration we continue to have a serious red tape problem for small business. I hope that the Office of Small Business can speak up and get the government to change its policy in these areas.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—I will respond to the member for Fraser, first of all, in relation to his comments on superannuation. There is no question that there needs to be some level of flexibility and choice for people working in small business. I do not believe that the complexity you are suggesting is actually going to cause the problems you are suggesting.
I would also say to you in relation to your suggestion of a layer of red tape that there has been a huge layer of red tape removed with the decision to change the GST reporting from quarterly to annually. This is going to have a very significant impact on a very large number of small businesses. I would suggest there are about 750,000 small businesses that are going to get some benefit from this. It will allow them to do all their paperwork in one hit when they lodge their tax return. That has certainly been applauded by the small business community.
The new innovation package also offers some real benefits for small business. You have the Commercial Ready program, which is $1.6 billion in support for R&D proof of concept, technology diffusion and early stage commercialisation activity. You have $100 million for the highly successful COMET program and another $390 million to continue the 125 per cent tax offset, which is certainly used by small business. These initiatives have certainly been very much welcomed by small business. With that, combined with more of the fundamentals, it is no wonder the small business community strongly supports the coalition government. I would suggest to you that low interest rates and strong economic growth play a very dominant role in ensuring that the small business community continues to prosper and in so doing will support a government that provides these economic fundamentals. 
I would like to summarise. The 2004-2005 budget provides significant funding for a range of industry initiatives, with a strong emphasis on encouraging commercialisation of business ideas, innovation and research and development, with funding provided through the budget for initiatives recently announced in the government's $5.3 billion science and innovation package, Backing Australia's Ability—Building Our Future Through Science and Innovation.
The industry portfolio will be responsible for delivering a number of the initiatives outlined in this package, valued at around $1.6 billion over the next seven years. One billion dollars of new funding will be provided for the new Commercial Ready program, $100 million will be provided to continue the highly successful COMET program, and there will be $390 million dollars in tax expenditure over five years from 2006-07 to continue the R&D tax offset, the 175 per cent premium R&D tax concession and the effective life treatment of the R&D plant.
In addition, $57.9 million will be provided to the National Stem Cell Centre and a further $20 million will be provided over four years to strengthen Australia's competitiveness in biotechnology through continued support for Biotechnology Australia and the national biotechnology strategy. On top of that, the budget provides funding for a range of other industry initiatives, including funding to promote Australia as a financial services centre, funding to leverage trade and investment from the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games, funding for the protection of Australia's critical energy infrastructure and taxation incentives to encourage oil exploration in remote offshore areas. (Extension of time granted)
The budget also contains initiatives to reduce the compliance burden on small businesses, as I mentioned earlier. Most notably, small businesses with turnovers of less than $50,000 will now be able to report and pay their GST annually when they lodge their tax returns. This initiative is expected to reduce paperwork and compliance and make a real and tangible difference for some 740,000 small businesses. Overall, this budget provides significant assistance for industry and continues the government's support for industry innovation, investment and international competitiveness.

"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—We seem to be remarkably short of a relevant parliamentary secretary or minister for this portfolio area. I hope someone is about to make sure that someone comes along as soon as possible. To facilitate business, let me proceed on the assumption that that person will be in a position to respond on the basis of staff advice when they arrive. I want first to raise some queries concerning the sale of Telstra, particularly in the light of today's announcement by Telstra, and the response to it by the Minister for Finance and Administration jointly with the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, concerning what is headlined on the web site as `Billions for Telstra shareholders'—that is, the decision announced today by the Telstra Corp. chairman, Mr John Ralph, to return $1.5 billion to shareholders annually for the next three years through special dividends and/or share buybacks. This adds to the very interesting circumstance we find ourselves in with regard to the budgetary implications of the sale of Telstra. 
The opposition have been arguing—and I have been arguing on our behalf for some time—that putting aside our broader and much more important arguments about the sale of Telstra, which are not relevant to this discussion and come up in a different portfolio, there are serious budget implications of the sale of Telstra that have been totally overlooked by the government and totally fraudulently rebutted. The most obvious point as a starting point is that the cost of the sale of Telstra in three tranches, as estimated by the government previously and reflected in the explanatory memorandum and in the budget, is $218 million per year for three years—that is, $654 million paid to merchant bankers and lawyers. So we have the first element of the budget equation, which is the $218 million for the sale.
What we have to do—and the Treasurer said this in the House recently—if you are going to claim that we, the opposition, do not have to spend that $218 million a year—that total of $650 million—is take into account the public debt interest saving and the dividends forgone. Now that is true. We now know from information publicly provided by the government what those two numbers are. The dividends forgone based on the government's assessment, which is the market consensus of a 28c dividend per share forecast, means the dividends forgone would be $601 million. We can assess the PDI savings, because in a second reading speech on 10 October 2003 Senator Minchin indicated the bond rate that should be applied and if that is applied to the sale price you get a PDI saving of $622 million. The arithmetic of that is quite simple. This results in a cost to the budget of $197 million in the first year of the sale alone—a negative figure of $197 million. But this does not take into account the significant extra return to the government from today's announcement. If Telstra is proposing to return $1.5 billion per year to shareholders and the government owns 50 per cent, then the straightforward calculation is that that is worth $750 million per year to the government to the budget in payments.
The situation is actually more complex than that because that would be the case if all the money were paid in special dividends. But Telstra is saying that will not be the case; some of it will be in a share buyback. So, to the extent that there are special dividends, it means that the government—if it were to sell Telstra—will be forgoing even more dividend revenue—hundreds of millions more, but we do not know how much. Additionally, if the share buyback proceeds we have the government in the ironic position that either it sells some of the shares into the buyback, which gives it a substantial short-term return, or it retains the shares—and, for a government committed to reducing its share equity, it actually increases its proportionate equity in Telstra, which has consequential implications for subsequent dividends.
So we have a situation now where Telstra announced today the way in which it will go about focusing on its core business and giving a better return to shareholders—I broadly welcome that—but it is creating a more complicated situation for the government in trying to pretend other than that this is a proposition that is bad for the budget. (Extension of time granted) So I am looking for the government to respond—it always refuses to respond to this because, frankly, it does not have an answer—to the arithmetic of the budgetary implications of the sale of Telstra, which is actually not complicated in its essence. The moving parts are the PDI, the public debt interest, saving which the government trumpets but ignores the fact that that is virtually cancelled out by the dividends forgone—and as a result of today's announcement may be more than cancelled out by the dividends forgone—then you have to add in the cost of the sale. Every way you calculate that you come out with a negative budget outcome. I challenge the government to say which of those various factors that we have outlined is not correctly summarised, because they all come from government figures. Also, what is the further implication to the budget of the sale of Telstra welcome announcement today of its proposition to return greater return to shareholders, which the government has properly welcomed? They are the unanswered questions, because the government does not have an answer and I continue to pursue it. 
There are bigger issues about the sale of Telstra than its budgetary implications, but those are for another debate in another circumstance. They are not matters that I am traversing here today. I have raised them on plenty of other occasions, as have the Leader of the Opposition and our shadow minister, and the government has other people who respond to that in other portfolios. It is not an issue I am seeking to raise. I am simply saying: if the government insists upon its view that, for broader national interest reasons which it holds—which we do not share—it wants to sell Telstra, it has to come clean on its budgetary implications and it has to deal with today's further announcement that retaining Telstra in public ownership will give an even bigger return to shareholders, because Telstra is going to give shareholders an extra $1.5 billion, which on the face of it is an extra $750 million return to the budget each year from Telstra if the government retains its 50 per cent interest.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—I thank the member for Fraser for his contribution. It really does not matter what occurs with Telstra, as I guess there is a fundamental opposition from the Labor Party in relation to the sale of Telstra—although, going on past history in these matters of privatisation, I question whether the opposition would not be going down the same track that we are going down at the moment if they were in government. But if there are any specific areas there that require a response I will have to take those on notice, and I will certainly ensure that they get back to you.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I raise a second matter in the hope that perhaps the parliamentary secretary in this portfolio, who has now come in, might want to respond either to the previous one or to this. This relates to a different aspect in the portfolio entirely, and it concerns matters raised by the AuditorGeneral, who lies within the responsibility of this portfolio, and what the recent budget estimates have revealed about the massive increase in spending on government advertising and the fact that this appears, by every reasonable assessment, to be in blatant breach of the guidelines set down by the AuditorGeneral.
The background to this, which members of the public would not be aware of but which is clearly relevant—and certainly members of parliament would or should be aware of it—is that when the now Prime Minister was Leader of the Opposition he said on 5 September 1995 that the shadow cabinet had met and decided that in government they—that is, the coalition—would ask the AuditorGeneral to draw up new guidelines on what is an appropriate use of taxpayers' money in this area. That was an explicit, trumpeted decision in September 1995. We are virtually nine years later on, and the government has done nothing about it. It has actually gone in exactly the opposite direction. I asked the Prime Minister today in question time whether the government's at least $110 million—and I think on the basis of recent estimates assessments even more—of government advertising complies with those guidelines, and the Prime Minister declined to respond. He said that it complies with earlier guidelines—guidelines which he repudiated, which he said were totally inadequate and which he said an incoming coalition government would supplant with guidelines from the AuditorGeneral. But the government never sought those guidelines. 
However, perhaps in an unwelcome—but, in my view, entirely appropriate—response to the massive spending on advertising around the introduction of the GST, the Auditor-General did initiate an outline of what he thought appropriate guidelines should be. I think he did a pretty good job. If I had been trying to write them, I might not have written exactly the same ones, but they are an independent assessment by the Auditor-General and I think we should take them into account. I am determined that an incoming Labor government will apply those guidelines.
What I am trying to find out is whether the government has in any way at all sought to apply these guidelines to the current massive advertising spree that it is on. It is unprecedented, making the Australian government the biggest advertiser in the country—bigger than Coca-Cola, McDonald's or Telstra. It is the biggest advertiser in Australia by a long way, and anybody who watches the television or reads the newspapers can clearly see that before their eyes. The biggest weight of this advertising is in the months of June, July and August of this year—what a surprise! There are 22 campaigns currently in the media or in the pipeline.
The placement cost of the government's Medicare campaign—just the placement cost, not the cost of production, which would be very high—is $15.7 million. So we are going to get a massive, sustained television advertising bombardment at least until the end of June. That of course might coincidentally just be the time when the Prime Minister wants to move to call an election. I do not know that, but you can see other peaks in that advertising running right through to August. So, whatever your preferred point of view is about when the election is going to be, you are going to see a massive government advertising spree in the lead-up to that election.
As far as any objective assessment goes, it is totally in breach of the Auditor-General's guidelines—and, I suspect, without the slightest reference to the Auditor-General. I suspect that the Auditor-General has never been asked. I suspect nothing has ever been submitted to him and no process has been undertaken to assess these campaigns against those guidelines. It is a clear breach of an election promise by the Prime Minister. It is a clear breach of any proper standard of public administration. (Extension of time granted)
I am particularly concerned that we are getting a recurrent problem here. In 1998 the government spent $32 million on advertising in the four months prior to the election. In 2001—that is, the next election year—the government spending on advertising was around $66 million. In this election year, we are over $100 million. The Auditor-General—following an audit of government advertising during the implementation of the GST—recommended that these new guidelines should require a higher standard.
If these guidelines were employed, there is little doubt that their scrutiny would reveal that the timing of this advertising—skewed as it is in this election year—fails the Auditor-General's requirement that it not be perceived as party political and that they are objective, factual and explanatory. We have the extraordinary situation where the government is spending $16 million on a Medicare campaign that does not tell Australians the most basic fact they need to know—that is, that they need to apply to access the government's safety net. It does not tell them that. You can watch every ad, read everything in the newspaper and miss the most relevant piece of information. 
The Auditor-General requires that no campaign should be undertaken without a justifiable cost-benefit analysis. It is quite clear that no such cost-benefit analysis could have been done, because $16 million is being spent on a campaign that fails to mention the most important piece of information about trying to access the program. And we have $20 million being spent on a family payments system that people do not have to apply for. The information is not just targeted to the people who are the beneficiaries; it is community-wide advertising. It is clearly not targeted at giving information to the recipients. The government has a list of all the recipients. It could write them a letter. It would cost a lot less than $20 million. But the government is trying to influence the attitudes of Australians who are not the beneficiaries of this measure.
The government is trying particularly with regard to Medicare to solve its political problem that it is seen as being fundamentally antagonistic to Medicare. Therefore, the government is spending massive, unprecedented amounts of taxpayers' money, which, on the face of it, is in blatant breach of the Auditor-General's guidelines. What I want to know is: has the Auditor-General been consulted, have his guidelines been applied, who has had responsibility for applying them and where is the documentation that says that these campaigns meet those guidelines? I believe the answer is that the Auditor-General was not consulted, the Auditor-General's guidelines have not been complied with and there is no documentation to validate the legitimacy of these campaigns against those proper, independent guidelines.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—I thank all of those honourable members have participated in the debate on the estimates in relation to the Department of Finance and Administration. In Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005, the Department of Finance and Administration appropriated $364.6 million—$165.8 million for departmental outputs and $198.7 million for administered expenses. Departmental outputs have increased by $17.1 million from 2003-04 due to new and prior year measures and an increase in the appropriation in lieu of interest on the Comcover special account.
These new measures are $1.3 million for South Pacific economic governance and stabilisation; $1.4 million for defence capability proposals and establishment of enhanced cost assessment capability; $6 million for government procurement arrangements relating to the Australia-United States free trade agreement; and $1 million for asset sales, staffing and administrative costs. Administered costs have increased by $8.7 million from 2003-04 due to additional funding for the administering of the electorate offices of all parliamentarians and ministers' offices and for the provision of electorate office relief staff. The funding for this increase was provided for in prior year measures. I commend the expenditure to the chamber.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-06-21,"—In summing up, I would briefly like to thank those members who have contributed to the consideration in detail on the budget appropriation bills and take the opportunity to highlight the importance of the budget in maintaining a strong Australian economy. This budget looks to the future in terms of boosting innovation, funding new infrastructure and addressing existing demographic challenges, including Australia's ageing population. Only through proposed reforms and initiatives in these areas can we ensure that the Australian economy will continue to grow to its maximum potential.
The preparation of the budget involved significant effort by agencies and the government. At this point, I would particularly like to acknowledge the support that the Department of Finance and Administration provides the government in preparing and managing the budget and advising on whole-of-government expenditure issues. Within the finance and administration portfolio itself, this budget provides support for a number of important measures, including $5.7 million for the establishment and operation of a Pacific support unit to enable the Department of Finance and Administration to provide effective support, including financial management assistance, to Papua New Guinea and other Pacific island countries; $8.1 million to enable Finance to take on a new role in the evaluation and quality assurance of the costs and financial risks associated with defence capability procurement proposals; $24.3 million to implement policy and administrative changes to the Australian government procurement arrangements required by the pending Australia-United States free trade agreement, which is expected to take effect from 1 January 2005; provision for the government to pay out its superannuation liabilities to the Telstra and Australia Post superannuation schemes by making lump sum payments; and capital funding of $83.8 million for the refurbishment of Anzac Park East and Anzac Park West, and $91.3 million to upgrade the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre.
The 2004-05 budget continues the government's record of strong economic management, with a cash surplus of $2.4 billion forecast for 2004-05. Net debt is expected to continue to fall in 2004-05 to around $24.7 billion or 2.9 per cent of GDP. The unemployment rate is expected to average around 5.75 per cent and inflation is forecast to fall to around 1.75 per cent through the year to the June quarter of 2005, with continued strong economic growth at 3.5 per cent and an economy that remains strong, flexible and resilient.  
In conclusion, the appropriation bills are part of a fiscally responsible budget that is designed to keep the Australian economy strong and to address longer term challenges. The budget builds on the significant government reforms over the last eight years and provides funding for important initiatives, including significant assistance for families. I am particularly proud to support the budget, and I commend the bill to the chamber.
