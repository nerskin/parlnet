Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:31):  In relation to the Senate order for the production of documents in general business notice of motion No. 1121, moved by Senator Rice and agreed by the Senate yesterday, I confirm for the Senate again, consistent with my letters to the President of the Senate of 19 September, 20 September and 16 October, that the government maintains its public interest immunity claim over the document referred to in the motion, on the grounds that this document informs and is the subject of cabinet deliberations which have not yet been finalised. The Ruddock report was commissioned by cabinet for the express purpose of informing cabinet deliberations in relation to a range of matters related to religious freedom. It was provided to the government in May. In due course, cabinet will finalise its response to the report's recommendations. As such, the deliberative processes of cabinet in relation to the report provided to the government by the expert panel have yet to be completed.


I hasten to add, again, that the deliberative process of cabinet does not just commence with the consideration by the full cabinet of a final submission with a final set of recommendations. The deliberative process of cabinet actually begins with the relevant minister or ministers putting together a draft submission, and the work leading up to the putting-together of a draft submission, which ultimately is destined to be considered by cabinet. Clearly the document referred to in the motion is the central input into a deliberative process of cabinet. While the report and the response have not yet been considered by the full cabinet, the report has already informed and continues to inform the deliberative process of cabinet. As is well recognised in the Westminster system, it is in the public interest to preserve the confidentiality of cabinet deliberations, to ensure the best possible decisions are made following thorough consideration and discussion of relevant proposals within cabinet. The release of this document at this time would harm the public interest, in that it would interfere with the deliberative processes of cabinet and good decision-making. 


The government will release the report in due course, following proper consideration of its recommendations by government through the deliberative processes of cabinet. Indeed, we will release the report together with the government's response to it. I would also, again—as I did earlier in the week—refer the Senate to section 125(a)(iii) of the Cabinet Handbook, which makes clear that cabinet documents are any material, relevantly, that is prepared for the purposes of informing the cabinet. For example, it says they include:


Any other papers prepared for the consideration by or for the information of ministers in a Cabinet or committee meeting, such as letters or reports, regardless of whether these documents are circulated in advance of the meeting or provided in the Cabinet Room …

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-10-17,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (09:34):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the minister's explanation.


What a farce. Here we have a review that, yes, was commissioned by government almost a year ago—11 months ago—and given to the Prime Minister on 18 May, which was a full five months ago. It's a report where the key recommendations are now in the public domain, and yet the minister is continuing this nonsense that, for some reason, it's not in the public interest to release the full report. There are no public interest immunity grounds as to why this report shouldn't be released. In fact, there are strong public interest grounds as to why the community deserves to see the background deliberations behind the recommendations which are now in the public domain.


Going to the minister's response and the issue of whether it should be held onto or whether they're actually hiding it—particularly whether they're hiding it before the Wentworth by-election on Saturday—it is ridiculous to say that, by releasing this Ruddock review into religious freedoms, it's going to interfere with cabinet deliberations. The statement is that it would harm the public interest in that it would interfere with the deliberative processes of cabinet. How ridiculous can you get, given that the key recommendations are already out there in the public domain? The Ruddock review is not cabinet deliberations; it is an input into those cabinet deliberations, and there is no need for it to continue to remain a secret document.


We know that having public debate on this review has the potential to influence cabinet deliberations. That is absolutely clear. But the farcical situation we're in, of course, is that that public debate is raging all around us, and, particularly because the recommendations are now in the public domain, we know that public debate is influencing cabinet deliberations on this very issue. We know that because we have got the government, the Prime Minister himself, saying that they're rejecting two of the key recommendations and that they now want to move to remove discrimination against LGBT children in schools—they want to remove that ability to discriminate against children in schools. We know that the recommendations of this review are, in fact, influencing cabinet deliberations, so it is ridiculous that we can't actually see the full report so that we can have more informed public consideration, which I'm sure would further influence cabinet deliberations.


The fact that we aren't able to see this report because it would interfere with the deliberative processes of cabinet does not stand up to scrutiny. It is influencing the public debate; it is influencing cabinet. We have got a situation where, just yesterday, we had a petition from GetUp! with 28,000 signatures calling upon the government to protect the rights of LGBT children, teachers and staff in schools. The Greens have got an online petition that's got almost 10,000 signatures. Advocacy group just.equal have a petition that's got almost 7,000 signatures. There is huge public interest in this issue, and rightly so.


The Ruddock review, and then the leak of these recommendations, has shown just how concerned people are about these issues—how concerned they are about discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender children; and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender teachers and other staff in schools. There is only one reason why this document is not being shared with the community now, and it's not because releasing it now would have the potential to influence cabinet deliberations. It's because they do not want the public to see the full body of this review before the Wentworth by-election; before the voters of Wentworth go to the polls. As part of their deliberations into how they are going to vote, the voters in Wentworth deserve to know where the government's thinking is on how much they want to continue discriminating against LGBTI Australians.


There are some worrying recommendations in the Ruddock review, which we have now seen courtesy of the leak to the Fairfax Media. There is the recommendation to continue discriminating against LGBTI students. But the review is not only recommending that not only should we be protecting people's ability to have a religious belief—and the Greens absolutely support having religious belief as a protected attribute in our anti-discrimination laws—but recommending that we should be protecting religious activity as well. Who knows where that religious activity would go? That's just what we're talking about: does religious activity enable the community, on the grounds of religion, to discriminate against people on the basis of their sexuality or their gender identity? This is very concerning.


The public needs to know what discussion there was in the review about this issue of how far religious activity should be protected. From the Greens perspective, we say, if you're going to be protecting religious activity, you've got to know when that religious activity becomes discrimination. Our view is that you need to have a charter of rights to be able to decide where one person's religious freedom becomes another person's discrimination.


These are important issues, and it is urgent that we act on them. Not acting on them now—not releasing this report—is playing with people's lives in a panicked attempt to hold on to the seat of Wentworth. This report should be released immediately, and we should be legislating immediately, as the community wants. We've got the ability to legislate immediately. Yesterday, the Greens introduced a bill that would remove discrimination in our schools completely. It would remove discrimination against LGBTI students and LGBTI teachers and other staff. We have the opportunity this week in the Senate to legislate. I call upon the government and Labor: if this is so critical and important, as we have now heard them say it is, let's take the opportunity of legislating to remove that discrimination this week. We could do that today. We could stop playing with people's lives. We could remove this discrimination. Now that the community has heard about it and is outraged about it, we could say, 'Yes, we hear your outrage.'


Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday said that we need to act 'today', that we need to deal with this issue once and for all, that we need to act right now. We've got the opportunity to do that. We're in control here in this Senate of what we can legislate on. We've got a Greens bill that was introduced yesterday. We could be debating that. We could be moving that and actually turning what are now words saying that we need to end discrimination into real action. We need action on all fronts. We need urgent action, because while these discriminations are still in place and while this debate is ongoing it's basically playing with people's lives. It's a bit of deja vu with the marriage equality postal survey debate that we were having a year ago. LGBTI Australians are still being treated like political footballs. It's just not good enough. We have got the opportunity to end this, to say that we value LGBTI Australians. We know that it's important that they're not discriminated against and that they are valued as much as every other Australian, rather than being played like political footballs. Let us act. Let us remove discrimination, and actually say to every LGBTI student and every LGBTI teacher and other staff member in schools: 'We value you. We know that you are as valued and you are as loved as every other member of your school community,' and say that we recognise that the discrimination that's currently there is unacceptable. We can act, and we could act today to remove that.


I call upon the government to release the full Ruddock review into religious freedoms and then to take the next step and move this week, before the Wentworth by-election, to join the Greens to debate and then legislate to remove discrimination against all lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gender diverse, intersex and queer Australians.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2018-10-17,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:45):  I also seek to speak on this motion to take note of the minister's explanation. I indicate that this is now the third time that the Senate has requested the government to release the Ruddock report into religious freedoms. Although Senator Cormann is claiming public interest immunity under the Westminster system to prevent the release of this document, there is an equally important Westminster tradition, and that's the right of the Senate to make these decisions to request this information. This is now the third time that the Senate has done it and it's the third time that the government has refused to release the document.


It beggars belief that the government could claim that there is public interest in keeping this issue under wraps when of course we have read in The Australian and The Sydney Morning Herald the recommendations of this report. Somebody in the government wants this document out there, because somebody in the government has released this document to journalists with those two newspapers. If it's good enough for whoever has had access to this document to release it to the newspapers, why is it not good enough for the government to release it to the Senate and then release it to the Australian people? Why is the government seeking to hide behind public interest immunity when the reality is the document has already partly been released? 


There is a debate raging in the parliament and in the community about the contents of this document, and yet we don't see it. One reason I guess we might not be given this document is the fact that in three days time there is going to be a by-election in the seat of Wentworth. Malcolm Turnbull was unceremoniously removed from the position of Prime Minister. He has been replaced by Scott Morrison. Scott Morrison is wanting to hold onto his slim majority in the lower house. The government are afraid that, if they release this document and the community gets to see the contents of this document and have a debate about the issue of religious freedoms, that will result in their candidate, Mr Sharma—in fact, he wasn't Mr Morrison's candidate; Mr Morrison wanted another candidate—losing the seat of Wentworth and, as a result of that, the government losing their majority in the lower house. That is not a basis for withholding this document. That can't be a public interest immunity case. That's the political interest of Mr Morrison. The government should not be hiding behind claims of public interest immunity when the reality is that the reason this document has not been released is the political interests of Mr Morrison.


When Mr Morrison became Prime Minister he promised all sorts of changes to the way in which the government is run, but he has fallen at the first test. He was one of those people who wanted this debate on religious freedom. He has got his report and he is now refusing to release it to the Australian people. There are some inconsistencies in just what's happening with this document in the government. We saw yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Frydenberg, say, 'The report hasn't even been considered by cabinet.' I'll refer to the last time the Senate requested this document to be released on 20 September. Senator Cormann told the Senate:


I hasten to add here, in relation to the report of the Religious Freedom Review Expert Panel, which has been received by the cabinet, that the government has not as yet made any decisions on the way forward. The cabinet continues with its deliberations.


Who's right? Is Mr Frydenberg right when he says, 'The report hasn't even been considered by cabinet,' or is Senator Cormann right when he says, 'The cabinet continues with its deliberations.' The reality is that this is a dysfunctional government. In a serious motion dealing with the issue of anti-racism, we saw yesterday that the Attorney-General wasn't able to make a decision on the response of the government to that motion. Minister Cormann wasn't able to make a response to that motion. We found that a junior staffer in a minister's office is now making decisions on behalf of the government. What sort of dysfunctional government are we dealing with here? I know you're shaking your head, Senator Birmingham; I'd shake my head too. Junior staffers are making decisions about government policy for this government. Is it because Prime Minister Morrison doesn't trust his own ministers? Doesn't he trust Minister Porter? Doesn't he trust Minister Cormann? He's now delegating the role to junior staffers to make the decisions.


We've got an important issue here of religious freedom. The community wants a debate. The parliament wants a debate. The Labor Party wants a serious debate on this issue. We've been waiting now for this report for 11 months. Eleven months ago was when the government announced they were going to start this review. They've had the review for five months and, even after that period of time, we still don't have access to this document. The government changed Prime Ministers to have a fresh start, but it simply hasn't happened. We haven't had a new beginning. This is the old government. This is not a new government with new policies. It's continuing to deny the Australian people the opportunity to have a say about this.




Senator McAllister:
  It's worse.




Senator FARRELL:
  You're right, Senator McAllister. I think we've actually gone backwards. I think we should have gone with Minister Cormann's preference for Prime Minister. Minister Dutton could not have done a worse job on this issue than the Prime Minister has done. There is still time. There are three days before the Wentworth by-election. There are three days to release this document. The government has to stop hiding behind public interest immunity claims. They have to stop trying to put their political interests ahead of the interests of the Australian people and their right to know and see this document and their right to debate this issue in a sensible, mature way. The reality is, if they don't release the document, there are obviously people in the government who are going to continue to leak this report; we're going to see it drip-fed through the newspapers. That's not the way for a government to run. It's a dysfunctional government. We've seen how this story ends before. The Labor Party have seen how this story ends, and it doesn't end well for the government.


I think the government has to stop hiding behind public interest immunity claims. There is a duty here to the Australian people but, more importantly, there's a duty to the Senate. The Senate has made its determination. The Senate has determined that this report should be released. It's now time for the government to respect the decision of the Senate and to release the report.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2018-10-17,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (09:54):  I rise to support Senator Rice and Senator Farrell in their comments today about the Ruddock report. The Senate required and requested that it be released, but it has not been. I find it to be an insult to the Senate and the Australian public that the Leader of the Government in the Senate can get up here today and say that it's being considered by cabinet, is protected by the public interest defence et cetera when, in fact, his own government—somebody in his own cabinet—released this last week to The Sydney Morning Herald, and then more of it later on to The Australian, because some people in the government want it out. They want it out there.


I know Senator Farrell says we need to have a debate about it. The debate is going on. The debate's been going on for months. The debate's been going on since the government, under Prime Minister Turnbull, actually announced this sop, and it was a sop, this religious freedom of speech issue. It was put out there so that the Abbotts, the Morrisons and the others who either abstained or voted against the same-sex marriage vote could have some say. Then it went to Ruddock. The government got it in May, and they've sat on it ever since. They've leaked little bits when they wanted to. It should be released in full. It should be out there. 


I don't totally let the opposition off the hook on this, because they're demanding the Ruddock statement be released and the report be released, yet, yesterday, they joined with the government to vote me down 47 to 12 on the issue, on my notice of motion, in which I said that any independent school—or its owners or its runners—that discriminates against a student or against a teacher on the grounds of their sexual orientation should not be entitled to government funds or to a charitable status. The ALP joined with the government and voted me down, because they didn't want to see the risk of money being taken away from Catholic schools.


I stand by what I've said about independent schools. If you want to defy the law of the land and want to put your religious credo ahead of the law of the land, you do not deserve one dollar from the Australian taxpayer and you do not deserve a charitable status. That will be challenged, and I shall challenge it as long as I am here.


On the issue of the Ruddock report, it should be released. It must be released. I don't know if it is true that it's being withheld because of the Wentworth by-election, because they were holding it for months and months before former Prime Minister Turnbull actually quit his seat in a tizzy. I don't know if it is tied to the Wentworth by-election, but it must be released. It should be released. We are entitled to it. It does not interfere with religious freedoms for us to have a copy of this report so we can discuss it at length.

",Senate,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Religious Freedom Review Expert Panel</title>,DOCUMENTS,2,1,speech
"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2018-10-17,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (09:58):  This is the third time that the government has refused to release the report of the religious freedom review. It's extraordinary. Why is the government afraid to release a report that was commissioned by a coalition government in response to pressure internally from members of the coalition party room and was written by a former minister of a coalition government. It is a coalition document. It is a coalition report. It heads, presumably, in a coalition political direction. Why is it that they are so scared to show the Australian public what it is that they are politically interested in and what it is that they politically believe in? There is just one word, and that word is Wentworth. The by-election in Wentworth has this crowd jumping around like a bunch of kangaroos on the road—they don't know which direction to go in. I'll tell you what, it's pretty dangerous for everybody else involved, because they are creating chaos in all aspects of government decision-making, and that has real consequences for our circumstances domestically and our circumstances internationally. They are presently driven by a primal electoral fear about what is going on in Wentworth. Wentworth, of course, registered one of the highest levels of support for marriage equality during the plebiscite. They are terrified, and they should be. They are terrified by what might happen to their electoral prospects if a proper public debate is able to take place about the contents of that review.


I'll tell you what scares them more. It's the reaction of their party room because, if parts of their party room were given the opportunity to discuss the content of this debate, we'd see even more of the ugliness that they are desperately trying to keep from public view in the lead-up to this by-election. It's been pretty ugly over the last couple of days because this is a government whose senators happily walked in here and sat over there on the affirmative side and voted en masse to say, 'It's okay to be white.' I'm pretty certain they've also got more than a few members who wouldn't be happy to say, 'It's okay to be gay.' That's the problem. That's the debate they are trying to avoid. But the problem is you can't avoid it forever, and this political tactic in the lead-up to the by-election isn't working.


The grounds on which they claim the document needs to be maintained as a confidential document are farcical. A detailed discussion about this document and about recommendations in this document appeared on the front page of the Fairfax papers weeks ago. The recommendations of the Ruddock report have been leaked in full and, if you google them, you can find them. The political consequences, the social consequences, the consequences for children and the consequences for the LGBTIQ community have been debated on the front page of the papers for days, and I can tell you that they're being debated on the ground in Wentworth as well. The Liberal candidate in Wentworth has been forced to comment on the recommendations which were leaked and published in the Fairfax papers. The Prime Minister gave his views on the recommendations last week, and then two days later he gave a different set of views on the recommendations. This is an absolute farce and it makes a mockery of all of the conventions about open government and proper community involvement in the decisions of the parliament and, indeed, the community's ability to contribute to the decisions of cabinet.


Why does the government insist on this debate proceeding publicly in the absence of the actual report from the religious freedom review? I tell you that it is in line with the secrecy that has permeated this review from its very beginnings. It's a review that the government wanted to conduct in the shadows, so initially they refused to release any of the submissions. There were no published transcripts, minutes or even a communique on the consultations that were undertaken by the committee. Earlier this year, I tried to FOI some of the documentation produced by the committee secretariat. That was knocked back. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that this is because the far Right in the coalition party room want to be able to deliver to some of their stakeholders in secret, far from the public eye, and that's just not sustainable. It's not sustainable at all.


Why is it that we're even having the review? You can't forget this. This was a concession that was demanded by the far Right of the Liberal Party as a consolation prize for having been so roundly defeated and so roundly rejected by the Australian public during the plebiscite. There has never been any clearly articulated threat to religious freedom identified by any of the proponents of this review. And, when pressed on it, the Prime Minister could only say, 'Just because things haven't been a problem in the past doesn't mean they won't be a problem in the future.' This is a solution looking for a problem to solve. But there are actually problems right here and right now, in the present, like the right of children to go to a school of their choice and to be supported at a school of their choice irrespective of their sexuality and the right of teachers to do the job that they love without being discriminated against on the basis of who they love.


The Morrison government seems determined to continue the tradition of the Abbott government and the Turnbull government by treating the LGBTI community with the most unbelievable cynicism. We believe that the LGBTIQ community deserves more than to be an object in the government's culture wars. We believe that they deserve support and philosophical consistency, not an opportunistic bounding around, kangaroo style, in the face of this election or that election, or this poll or that poll. There are everyday Australians who, thanks to this government, had to live through a nationwide survey on their right to marry who they love, and now those same Australians have to sit through another conversation about whether people like them ought to be kicked out of their schools. This is 2018. The very least that this government could do is release the report that it commissioned.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-17,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:06):  I rise to take note as well. I support the statements in relation to the religious freedom review and the implications of that as raised by Senator McAllister, Senator Rice and Senator Hinch. I want to talk about the actual claim made by the government in relation to this document, the claim of cabinet in confidence. I want to talk about the purpose of that doctrine. Going back to the very basics, the purpose of the cabinet-in-confidence doctrine is to protect the confidentiality of cabinet process to ensure that the principle of collective material responsibility is not undermined. That is the fundamental purpose, and I support that purpose and the doctrine, but the protections of that doctrine are limited; they are not unbounded.


Cabinet is not referred to in our Constitution, although I make no contest of the fact that it has legal status, and I once again recognise the role of cabinet and indeed cabinet confidentiality. Cabinet is a creature of convention, not statute; whereas the Senate's oversight powers are a creature of a statute and, in fact, that statute is the ultimate statute and that is the Constitution—section 49 of the Constitution. Of course, statute always overrides both common law and convention.


Both the courts—and I refer the Senate to the High Court case of Sankey v Whitlam back in 1978—and the parliament have powers to call for cabinet documents. The court made it very clear that in the interests of justice that may, in certain circumstances, override the doctrine of cabinet in confidence. I refer people to the Harry Evans lecture last year by Bret Walker SC where he clearly asserted that the parliament ultimately has the same power as the courts. I accept that that absolute power, that absolute right, is one that should be exercised in extremis, and I don't say that it's warranted in this particular case for us to use our absolute power in relation to this particular OPD.


What I will do is turn to Odgers and read very briefly from Odgers, because that's the norm:


It is accepted that deliberations of the Executive Council and of the cabinet should be able to be conducted in secrecy so as to preserve the freedom of deliberation of those bodies. This ground, however, relates only to disclosure of deliberations.


So not documents, and certainly not documents written by an independent person such as Mr Ruddock.


There has been a tendency for governments to claim that anything with a connection to cabinet is confidential.


It's the aroma of cabinet kind of argument. We wield it through the cabinet on a coffee tray, and therefore the Senate is not able to get access to it. 


A claim that a document is a cabinet document should not be accepted; as has been made clear in relation to such claims in court proceedings…


I will go on to provide you with what the courts have said in relation to this. The High Court, in the Commonwealth v Northern Land Council, a 1993 decision, said—and this should be listened to carefully:


It should be observed at the outset that the documents for which the Commonwealth claims immunity from disclosure are documents which record the actual deliberations of Cabinet or a committee of Cabinet.


So just the idea that deliberations are occurring is not sufficient to invoke the doctrine. I accept that cabinet submissions may contain, at the very least, the deliberations of the minister advancing the proposition to the cabinet, so I might accept a public interest immunity claim over a cabinet submission. Cabinet submissions have a particular form. They have particular security requirements, as laid out in the Cabinet Handbook. Typically they are no longer than 50 pages. I suspect that, when this document is finally released, we will find that the Ruddock review in no way, shape or form complies with the requirements of the Cabinet Handbook as a cabinet submission.


I point out that this document is an independent report written by Mr Ruddock. He does not express the views as a member of the cabinet, despite his history. So there can be no case to argue that the views of Mr Ruddock in this report, as well informed or as ill informed or as widely briefed as he was, are in any way a deliberation of the cabinet. This document should be produced, for all the reasons I have just talked about. The government is undermining the very doctrine it seeks to rely upon in this instance. It's inappropriate that it should make that claim. The document should be tabled.


Question agreed to.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:31):  In relation to the Senate order for the production of documents in general business notice of motion No. 1121, moved by Senator Rice and agreed by the Senate yesterday, I confirm for the Senate again, consistent with my letters to the President of the Senate of 19 September, 20 September and 16 October, that the government maintains its public interest immunity claim over the document referred to in the motion, on the grounds that this document informs and is the subject of cabinet deliberations which have not yet been finalised. The Ruddock report was commissioned by cabinet for the express purpose of informing cabinet deliberations in relation to a range of matters related to religious freedom. It was provided to the government in May. In due course, cabinet will finalise its response to the report's recommendations. As such, the deliberative processes of cabinet in relation to the report provided to the government by the expert panel have yet to be completed.


I hasten to add, again, that the deliberative process of cabinet does not just commence with the consideration by the full cabinet of a final submission with a final set of recommendations. The deliberative process of cabinet actually begins with the relevant minister or ministers putting together a draft submission, and the work leading up to the putting-together of a draft submission, which ultimately is destined to be considered by cabinet. Clearly the document referred to in the motion is the central input into a deliberative process of cabinet. While the report and the response have not yet been considered by the full cabinet, the report has already informed and continues to inform the deliberative process of cabinet. As is well recognised in the Westminster system, it is in the public interest to preserve the confidentiality of cabinet deliberations, to ensure the best possible decisions are made following thorough consideration and discussion of relevant proposals within cabinet. The release of this document at this time would harm the public interest, in that it would interfere with the deliberative processes of cabinet and good decision-making. 


The government will release the report in due course, following proper consideration of its recommendations by government through the deliberative processes of cabinet. Indeed, we will release the report together with the government's response to it. I would also, again—as I did earlier in the week—refer the Senate to section 125(a)(iii) of the Cabinet Handbook, which makes clear that cabinet documents are any material, relevantly, that is prepared for the purposes of informing the cabinet.

That the Senate take note of the minister's explanation.


What a farce. Here we have a review that, yes, was commissioned by government almost a year ago—11 months ago—and given to the Prime Minister on 18 May, which was a full five months ago. It's a report where the key recommendations are now in the public domain, and yet the minister is continuing this nonsense that, for some reason, it's not in the public interest to release the full report. There are no public interest immunity grounds as to why this report shouldn't be released. In fact, there are strong public interest grounds as to why the community deserves to see the background deliberations behind the recommendations which are now in the public domain.


Going to the minister's response and the issue of whether it should be held onto or whether they're actually hiding it—particularly whether they're hiding it before the Wentworth by-election on Saturday—it is ridiculous to say that, by releasing this Ruddock review into religious freedoms, it's going to interfere with cabinet deliberations. The statement is that it would harm the public interest in that it would interfere with the deliberative processes of cabinet. How ridiculous can you get, given that the key recommendations are already out there in the public domain? The Ruddock review is not cabinet deliberations; it is an input into those cabinet deliberations, and there is no need for it to continue to remain a secret document.


We know that having public debate on this review has the potential to influence cabinet deliberations. That is absolutely clear. But the farcical situation we're in, of course, is that that public debate is raging all around us, and, particularly because the recommendations are now in the public domain, we know that public debate is influencing cabinet deliberations on this very issue. We know that because we have got the government, the Prime Minister himself, saying that they're rejecting two of the key recommendations and that they now want to move to remove discrimination against LGBT children in schools—they want to remove that ability to discriminate against children in schools. We know that the recommendations of this review are, in fact, influencing cabinet deliberations, so it is ridiculous that we can't actually see the full report so that we can have more informed public consideration, which I'm sure would further influence cabinet deliberations.


The fact that we aren't able to see this report because it would interfere with the deliberative processes of cabinet does not stand up to scrutiny. It is influencing the public debate; it is influencing cabinet. We have got a situation where, just yesterday, we had a petition from GetUp! with 28,000 signatures calling upon the government to protect the rights of LGBT children, teachers and staff in schools. The Greens have got an online petition that's got almost 10,000 signatures. Advocacy group just.equal have a petition that's got almost 7,000 signatures. There is huge public interest in this issue, and rightly so.


The Ruddock review, and then the leak of these recommendations, has shown just how concerned people are about these issues—how concerned they are about discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender children; and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender teachers and other staff in schools. There is only one reason why this document is not being shared with the community now, and it's not because releasing it now would have the potential to influence cabinet deliberations. It's because they do not want the public to see the full body of this review before the Wentworth by-election; before the voters of Wentworth go to the polls. As part of their deliberations into how they are going to vote, the voters in Wentworth deserve to know where the government's thinking is on how much they want to continue discriminating against LGBTI Australians.


There are some worrying recommendations in the Ruddock review, which we have now seen courtesy of the leak to the Fairfax Media. There is the recommendation to continue discriminating against LGBTI students. But the review is not only recommending that not only should we be protecting people's ability to have a religious belief—and the Greens absolutely support having religious belief as a protected attribute in our anti-discrimination laws—but recommending that we should be protecting religious activity as well. Who knows where that religious activity would go? That's just what we're talking about: does religious activity enable the community, on the grounds of religion, to discriminate against people on the basis of their sexuality or their gender identity? This is very concerning.


The public needs to know what discussion there was in the review about this issue of how far religious activity should be protected. From the Greens perspective, we say, if you're going to be protecting religious activity, you've got to know when that religious activity becomes discrimination. Our view is that you need to have a charter of rights to be able to decide where one person's religious freedom becomes another person's discrimination.


These are important issues, and it is urgent that we act on them. Not acting on them now—not releasing this report—is playing with people's lives in a panicked attempt to hold on to the seat of Wentworth. This report should be released immediately, and we should be legislating immediately, as the community wants. We've got the ability to legislate immediately. Yesterday, the Greens introduced a bill that would remove discrimination in our schools completely. It would remove discrimination against LGBTI students and LGBTI teachers and other staff. We have the opportunity this week in the Senate to legislate. I call upon the government and Labor: if this is so critical and important, as we have now heard them say it is, let's take the opportunity of legislating to remove that discrimination this week. We could do that today. We could stop playing with people's lives. We could remove this discrimination. Now that the community has heard about it and is outraged about it, we could say, 'Yes, we hear your outrage.'


Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday said that we need to act 'today', that we need to deal with this issue once and for all, that we need to act right now. We've got the opportunity to do that. We're in control here in this Senate of what we can legislate on. We've got a Greens bill that was introduced yesterday. We could be debating that. We could be moving that and actually turning what are now words saying that we need to end discrimination into real action. We need action on all fronts. We need urgent action, because while these discriminations are still in place and while this debate is ongoing it's basically playing with people's lives. It's a bit of deja vu with the marriage equality postal survey debate that we were having a year ago. LGBTI Australians are still being treated like political footballs. It's just not good enough. We have got the opportunity to end this, to say that we value LGBTI Australians. We know that it's important that they're not discriminated against and that they are valued as much as every other Australian, rather than being played like political footballs. Let us act. Let us remove discrimination, and actually say to every LGBTI student and every LGBTI teacher and other staff member in schools: 'We value you. We know that you are as valued and you are as loved as every other member of your school community,' and say that we recognise that the discrimination that's currently there is unacceptable. We can act, and we could act today to remove that.


I call upon the government to release the full Ruddock review into religious freedoms and then to take the next step and move this week, before the Wentworth by-election, to join the Greens to debate and then legislate to remove discrimination against all lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gender diverse, intersex and queer Australians.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2018-10-17,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:45):  I also seek to speak on this motion to take note of the minister's explanation. I indicate that this is now the third time that the Senate has requested the government to release the Ruddock report into religious freedoms. Although Senator Cormann is claiming public interest immunity under the Westminster system to prevent the release of this document, there is an equally important Westminster tradition, and that's the right of the Senate to make these decisions to request this information. This is now the third time that the Senate has done it and it's the third time that the government has refused to release the document.


It beggars belief that the government could claim that there is public interest in keeping this issue under wraps when of course we have read in The Australian and The Sydney Morning Herald the recommendations of this report. Somebody in the government wants this document out there, because somebody in the government has released this document to journalists with those two newspapers. If it's good enough for whoever has had access to this document to release it to the newspapers, why is it not good enough for the government to release it to the Senate and then release it to the Australian people? Why is the government seeking to hide behind public interest immunity when the reality is the document has already partly been released? 


There is a debate raging in the parliament and in the community about the contents of this document, and yet we don't see it. One reason I guess we might not be given this document is the fact that in three days time there is going to be a by-election in the seat of Wentworth. Malcolm Turnbull was unceremoniously removed from the position of Prime Minister. He has been replaced by Scott Morrison. Scott Morrison is wanting to hold onto his slim majority in the lower house. The government are afraid that, if they release this document and the community gets to see the contents of this document and have a debate about the issue of religious freedoms, that will result in their candidate, Mr Sharma—in fact, he wasn't Mr Morrison's candidate; Mr Morrison wanted another candidate—losing the seat of Wentworth and, as a result of that, the government losing their majority in the lower house. That is not a basis for withholding this document. That can't be a public interest immunity case. That's the political interest of Mr Morrison. The government should not be hiding behind claims of public interest immunity when the reality is that the reason this document has not been released is the political interests of Mr Morrison.


When Mr Morrison became Prime Minister he promised all sorts of changes to the way in which the government is run, but he has fallen at the first test. He was one of those people who wanted this debate on religious freedom. He has got his report and he is now refusing to release it to the Australian people. There are some inconsistencies in just what's happening with this document in the government. We saw yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Frydenberg, say, 'The report hasn't even been considered by cabinet.' I'll refer to the last time the Senate requested this document to be released on 20 September. Senator Cormann told the Senate:


I hasten to add here, in relation to the report of the Religious Freedom Review Expert Panel, which has been received by the cabinet, that the government has not as yet made any decisions on the way forward. The cabinet continues with its deliberations.


Who's right? Is Mr Frydenberg right when he says, 'The report hasn't even been considered by cabinet,' or is Senator Cormann right when he says, 'The cabinet continues with its deliberations.' The reality is that this is a dysfunctional government. In a serious motion dealing with the issue of anti-racism, we saw yesterday that the Attorney-General wasn't able to make a decision on the response of the government to that motion. Minister Cormann wasn't able to make a response to that motion. We found that a junior staffer in a minister's office is now making decisions on behalf of the government. What sort of dysfunctional government are we dealing with here? I know you're shaking your head, Senator Birmingham; I'd shake my head too. Junior staffers are making decisions about government policy for this government. Is it because Prime Minister Morrison doesn't trust his own ministers? Doesn't he trust Minister Porter? Doesn't he trust Minister Cormann? He's now delegating the role to junior staffers to make the decisions.


We've got an important issue here of religious freedom. The community wants a debate. The parliament wants a debate. The Labor Party wants a serious debate on this issue. We've been waiting now for this report for 11 months. Eleven months ago was when the government announced they were going to start this review. They've had the review for five months and, even after that period of time, we still don't have access to this document. The government changed Prime Ministers to have a fresh start, but it simply hasn't happened. We haven't had a new beginning. This is the old government. This is not a new government with new policies. It's continuing to deny the Australian people the opportunity to have a say about this.




Senator McAllister:
  It's worse.




Senator FARRELL:
  You're right, Senator McAllister. I think we've actually gone backwards. I think we should have gone with Minister Cormann's preference for Prime Minister. Minister Dutton could not have done a worse job on this issue than the Prime Minister has done. There is still time. There are three days before the Wentworth by-election. There are three days to release this document. The government has to stop hiding behind public interest immunity claims. They have to stop trying to put their political interests ahead of the interests of the Australian people and their right to know and see this document and their right to debate this issue in a sensible, mature way. The reality is, if they don't release the document, there are obviously people in the government who are going to continue to leak this report; we're going to see it drip-fed through the newspapers. That's not the way for a government to run. It's a dysfunctional government. We've seen how this story ends before. The Labor Party have seen how this story ends, and it doesn't end well for the government.


I think the government has to stop hiding behind public interest immunity claims. There is a duty here to the Australian people but, more importantly, there's a duty to the Senate. The Senate has made its determination. The Senate has determined that this report should be released. It's now time for the government to respect the decision of the Senate and to release the report.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2018-10-17,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (09:54):  I rise to support Senator Rice and Senator Farrell in their comments today about the Ruddock report. The Senate required and requested that it be released, but it has not been. I find it to be an insult to the Senate and the Australian public that the Leader of the Government in the Senate can get up here today and say that it's being considered by cabinet, is protected by the public interest defence et cetera when, in fact, his own government—somebody in his own cabinet—released this last week to The Sydney Morning Herald, and then more of it later on to The Australian, because some people in the government want it out. They want it out there.


I know Senator Farrell says we need to have a debate about it. The debate is going on. The debate's been going on for months. The debate's been going on since the government, under Prime Minister Turnbull, actually announced this sop, and it was a sop, this religious freedom of speech issue. It was put out there so that the Abbotts, the Morrisons and the others who either abstained or voted against the same-sex marriage vote could have some say. Then it went to Ruddock. The government got it in May, and they've sat on it ever since. They've leaked little bits when they wanted to. It should be released in full. It should be out there. 


I don't totally let the opposition off the hook on this, because they're demanding the Ruddock statement be released and the report be released, yet, yesterday, they joined with the government to vote me down 47 to 12 on the issue, on my notice of motion, in which I said that any independent school—or its owners or its runners—that discriminates against a student or against a teacher on the grounds of their sexual orientation should not be entitled to government funds or to a charitable status. The ALP joined with the government and voted me down, because they didn't want to see the risk of money being taken away from Catholic schools.


I stand by what I've said about independent schools. If you want to defy the law of the land and want to put your religious credo ahead of the law of the land, you do not deserve one dollar from the Australian taxpayer and you do not deserve a charitable status. That will be challenged, and I shall challenge it as long as I am here.


On the issue of the Ruddock report, it should be released. It must be released. I don't know if it is true that it's being withheld because of the Wentworth by-election, because they were holding it for months and months before former Prime Minister Turnbull actually quit his seat in a tizzy. I don't know if it is tied to the Wentworth by-election, but it must be released. It should be released. We are entitled to it. It does not interfere with religious freedoms for us to have a copy of this report so we can discuss it at length.

",Senate,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Order for the Production of Documents</title>,DOCUMENTS,2,2,speech
"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2018-10-17,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (09:58):  This is the third time that the government has refused to release the report of the religious freedom review. It's extraordinary. Why is the government afraid to release a report that was commissioned by a coalition government in response to pressure internally from members of the coalition party room and was written by a former minister of a coalition government. It is a coalition document. It is a coalition report. It heads, presumably, in a coalition political direction. Why is it that they are so scared to show the Australian public what it is that they are politically interested in and what it is that they politically believe in? There is just one word, and that word is Wentworth. The by-election in Wentworth has this crowd jumping around like a bunch of kangaroos on the road—they don't know which direction to go in. I'll tell you what, it's pretty dangerous for everybody else involved, because they are creating chaos in all aspects of government decision-making, and that has real consequences for our circumstances domestically and our circumstances internationally. They are presently driven by a primal electoral fear about what is going on in Wentworth. Wentworth, of course, registered one of the highest levels of support for marriage equality during the plebiscite. They are terrified, and they should be. They are terrified by what might happen to their electoral prospects if a proper public debate is able to take place about the contents of that review.


I'll tell you what scares them more. It's the reaction of their party room because, if parts of their party room were given the opportunity to discuss the content of this debate, we'd see even more of the ugliness that they are desperately trying to keep from public view in the lead-up to this by-election. It's been pretty ugly over the last couple of days because this is a government whose senators happily walked in here and sat over there on the affirmative side and voted en masse to say, 'It's okay to be white.' I'm pretty certain they've also got more than a few members who wouldn't be happy to say, 'It's okay to be gay.' That's the problem. That's the debate they are trying to avoid. But the problem is you can't avoid it forever, and this political tactic in the lead-up to the by-election isn't working.


The grounds on which they claim the document needs to be maintained as a confidential document are farcical. A detailed discussion about this document and about recommendations in this document appeared on the front page of the Fairfax papers weeks ago. The recommendations of the Ruddock report have been leaked in full and, if you google them, you can find them. The political consequences, the social consequences, the consequences for children and the consequences for the LGBTIQ community have been debated on the front page of the papers for days, and I can tell you that they're being debated on the ground in Wentworth as well. The Liberal candidate in Wentworth has been forced to comment on the recommendations which were leaked and published in the Fairfax papers. The Prime Minister gave his views on the recommendations last week, and then two days later he gave a different set of views on the recommendations. This is an absolute farce and it makes a mockery of all of the conventions about open government and proper community involvement in the decisions of the parliament and, indeed, the community's ability to contribute to the decisions of cabinet.


Why does the government insist on this debate proceeding publicly in the absence of the actual report from the religious freedom review? I tell you that it is in line with the secrecy that has permeated this review from its very beginnings. It's a review that the government wanted to conduct in the shadows, so initially they refused to release any of the submissions. There were no published transcripts, minutes or even a communique on the consultations that were undertaken by the committee. Earlier this year, I tried to FOI some of the documentation produced by the committee secretariat. That was knocked back. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that this is because the far Right in the coalition party room want to be able to deliver to some of their stakeholders in secret, far from the public eye, and that's just not sustainable. It's not sustainable at all.


Why is it that we're even having the review? You can't forget this. This was a concession that was demanded by the far Right of the Liberal Party as a consolation prize for having been so roundly defeated and so roundly rejected by the Australian public during the plebiscite. There has never been any clearly articulated threat to religious freedom identified by any of the proponents of this review. And, when pressed on it, the Prime Minister could only say, 'Just because things haven't been a problem in the past doesn't mean they won't be a problem in the future.' This is a solution looking for a problem to solve. But there are actually problems right here and right now, in the present, like the right of children to go to a school of their choice and to be supported at a school of their choice irrespective of their sexuality and the right of teachers to do the job that they love without being discriminated against on the basis of who they love.


The Morrison government seems determined to continue the tradition of the Abbott government and the Turnbull government by treating the LGBTI community with the most unbelievable cynicism. We believe that the LGBTIQ community deserves more than to be an object in the government's culture wars. We believe that they deserve support and philosophical consistency, not an opportunistic bounding around, kangaroo style, in the face of this election or that election, or this poll or that poll. There are everyday Australians who, thanks to this government, had to live through a nationwide survey on their right to marry who they love, and now those same Australians have to sit through another conversation about whether people like them ought to be kicked out of their schools. This is 2018. The very least that this government could do is release the report that it commissioned.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-17,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:06):  I rise to take note as well. I support the statements in relation to the religious freedom review and the implications of that as raised by Senator McAllister, Senator Rice and Senator Hinch. I want to talk about the actual claim made by the government in relation to this document, the claim of cabinet in confidence. I want to talk about the purpose of that doctrine. Going back to the very basics, the purpose of the cabinet-in-confidence doctrine is to protect the confidentiality of cabinet process to ensure that the principle of collective material responsibility is not undermined. That is the fundamental purpose, and I support that purpose and the doctrine, but the protections of that doctrine are limited; they are not unbounded.


Cabinet is not referred to in our Constitution, although I make no contest of the fact that it has legal status, and I once again recognise the role of cabinet and indeed cabinet confidentiality. Cabinet is a creature of convention, not statute; whereas the Senate's oversight powers are a creature of a statute and, in fact, that statute is the ultimate statute and that is the Constitution—section 49 of the Constitution. Of course, statute always overrides both common law and convention.


Both the courts—and I refer the Senate to the High Court case of Sankey v Whitlam back in 1978—and the parliament have powers to call for cabinet documents. The court made it very clear that in the interests of justice that may, in certain circumstances, override the doctrine of cabinet in confidence. I refer people to the Harry Evans lecture last year by Bret Walker SC where he clearly asserted that the parliament ultimately has the same power as the courts. I accept that that absolute power, that absolute right, is one that should be exercised in extremis, and I don't say that it's warranted in this particular case for us to use our absolute power in relation to this particular OPD.


What I will do is turn to Odgers and read very briefly from Odgers, because that's the norm:


It is accepted that deliberations of the Executive Council and of the cabinet should be able to be conducted in secrecy so as to preserve the freedom of deliberation of those bodies. This ground, however, relates only to disclosure of deliberations.


So not documents, and certainly not documents written by an independent person such as Mr Ruddock.


There has been a tendency for governments to claim that anything with a connection to cabinet is confidential.


It's the aroma of cabinet kind of argument. We wield it through the cabinet on a coffee tray, and therefore the Senate is not able to get access to it. 


A claim that a document is a cabinet document should not be accepted; as has been made clear in relation to such claims in court proceedings…


I will go on to provide you with what the courts have said in relation to this. The High Court, in the Commonwealth v Northern Land Council, a 1993 decision, said—and this should be listened to carefully:


It should be observed at the outset that the documents for which the Commonwealth claims immunity from disclosure are documents which record the actual deliberations of Cabinet or a committee of Cabinet.


So just the idea that deliberations are occurring is not sufficient to invoke the doctrine. I accept that cabinet submissions may contain, at the very least, the deliberations of the minister advancing the proposition to the cabinet, so I might accept a public interest immunity claim over a cabinet submission. Cabinet submissions have a particular form. They have particular security requirements, as laid out in the Cabinet Handbook. Typically they are no longer than 50 pages. I suspect that, when this document is finally released, we will find that the Ruddock review in no way, shape or form complies with the requirements of the Cabinet Handbook as a cabinet submission.


I point out that this document is an independent report written by Mr Ruddock. He does not express the views as a member of the cabinet, despite his history. So there can be no case to argue that the views of Mr Ruddock in this report, as well informed or as ill informed or as widely briefed as he was, are in any way a deliberation of the cabinet. This document should be produced, for all the reasons I have just talked about. The government is undermining the very doctrine it seeks to rely upon in this instance. It's inappropriate that it should make that claim. The document should be tabled.


Question agreed to.

Could the minister confirm that there are 22 suspended provisions in the TPP that relate to previous US involvement and clarify the status of those provisions if the US rejoins the trade deal and what the process would be at that stage? Does it need to come back to parliament for ratification if a new member joins and new clauses are added to the TPP or are we de facto voting for the contingency that they may be reinstated if the US joins?

What is the process for a party like Australia to agree to (a) the inclusion of the US in the deal and (b) the activation of those 22 clauses?

I won't say the same about the FADT inquiry process, because the opposition tends to control that. So if the US rejoins, the minister signs the re-activation of those 22 clauses, and then it goes to JSCOT. JSCOT presumably produces a report. Does that come back to parliament for ratification?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:17):  Senator Whish-Wilson, we've been through this process several times. Again, I can keep giving you the same answer; however, I would point out, as Senator Carr has pointed out very clearly as well, that these are customs amendment bills. These are not a re-prosecution of something that has been addressed very extensively in the community. There have been 1,000 consultations. The parliament has had a look at it at least five times in committees. As you said yesterday, you have been through these issues many times over many years in many estimate processes. So if you would like to keep asking the same question over and over, you will keep getting the same response on these customs amendment bills. 


As I said, there are 22 clauses; they have been revoked; however, if the United States does come back in, those 22 have been examined and reported on by JSCOT. You and I both know well the process for treaties here in this parliament and also for consideration. But again, that is the process if the United States comes back in, but it would be an issue for Australian negotiators at the time. Of course, if there are any changes, it would come back to JSCOT.

  Answer the question. Yes or no?




Senator REYNOLDS:
   Senator Whish-Wilson, you've asked the question. I will answer it—again and again. It follows the exactly the same standard treaty processes. JSCOT has looked at the current 22 clauses that have now been revoked. If—and again this is a hypothetical—the United States joins and all parties agree to proceed, then it would come back to JSCOT, but again it is hypothetical because, at that re-negotiation at some time in the future, the clauses could be amended, they could be updated, they could be changed. They would go through exactly the same standard treaty process that this has gone through in the first place.


I'm not sure how much clearer I can be that this is a—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  You could answer my question: does it come to parliament?'




Senator REYNOLDS:
  That's exactly the answer to your question. It follows the exact same process, Senator.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Is that a yes?




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Yes, it follows the exact same process—again, in a hypothetical.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:20):  I just want to add to what Senator Whish-Wilson is saying. I just want to point out to the minister that the name of this bill is the Customs Amendment (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership Implementation) Bill. This is the only opportunity for the parliament in its formal sense in the chamber to deal with the enabling of the TPP, and so I would ask that you give substantial latitude and be very cooperative. We're not talking about a customs act; we're talking about the acts of parliament that are required to enable an agreement that has taken a long time to negotiate and has been controversial. To come in here and then try to narrow this down to,' This is just a customs act' is in some sense disingenuous. I just wanted to state that. 


Following up from Senator Whish-Wilson's question so as not to create a hypothetical, would the actual terms, as they currently stand—and I understand you've been very helpful by saying it comes back to JSCOT and goes through the process—require some enabling legislation for the treaty to enter into force notwithstanding it comes back to JSCOT? Is there some enabling legislation, not hypothetically, but with the current terms?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:21):  Senator Patrick, I'm very grateful for that somewhat patronising explanation of these bills. These are both very clearly customs tariff amendment bills and they are customs bill. I would note—as I've noted on multiple occasions now with Senator Whish-Wilson—that the arguments have mostly been in here, and we have spent several hours now on these same issues over and over again. These are issues that don't go to the substance of the bill. 


It is absolutely your right to keep trying to re-prosecute the TPP-11 itself. There are other opportunities in estimates next week to go through these issues in more detail, which is probably the more appropriate forum, so that the Senate can get on with other business. However, the substantive question that you've just asked is a complete hypothetical because, as I've explained several times, it depends on: if this did come forward again, the United States joined and all parties agreed, they would have a look and reconsider these 22 clauses. If there are changes, they would come back through the process and go to JSCOT. If there was eventually legislation that came back here as part of those negotiations to change the agreements, of course it would come back through here because it would require the customs bills to be amended. But, again, I have nothing more to add to that because it is hypothetical and the normal parliamentary processes would apply.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:23):  This just shows what an absolute disgrace this whole process is that we can't even debate the TPP in the chamber today. That's what the minister is telling us: 'No, nothing to see here. You can't have any influence over it, so I'm not going to answer questions or deal with it properly in this place. Go and deal with it later in Senate estimates after the bill has passed.' No, it's not good enough, Minister. 


The Australian people have a right to have these questions answered before the chamber passes this legislation. It may be that the government feels very comfortable because the Labor Party has rolled over and backed in the TPP, so they've got the numbers. That does not mean that the public and the taxpayers deserve to be treated like mugs, and yet that is precisely what the government has tried to do throughout the three days of debate on this bill so far. Senator Whish-Wilson, Senator Patrick and I have all asked specifically what happens to these 22 clauses if the US comes back to the table. If it's a hypothetical, Minister, why are they simply on ice and not deleted?




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Very good point! Who puts suspended clauses in trade deals?




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  There is no need and no reason for these clauses to be suspended if, indeed, they're only hypothetical. They're sitting there on ice, ready to be warmed up the moment the US enter the fray. We all know that. That's what the public commentary from nations has been about across these negotiations. It'd be timely now to have some honesty, truth and courage from the government, to tell people the facts. The Australian government are prepared to see these clauses back in the TPP negotiations because they're not prepared to tell the US to pull their head in.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-10-17,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:25):  I think a little bit of history and perspective on this is really important. I think it's commonly accepted that the US—at least stakeholders and interests in the US—initiated the TPP. In my speech on the second reading, I talked a little bit about the failure of the Doha rounds and of multilateral trade deals leading towards 2006. When the TPP fell apart, the idea of a separate multilateral deal being led by the US in the Pacific region was initiated. It was supposed to be finished by 2012, but that was really when it actually started getting interesting, and here we are in 2018 with a version of it. But this was a US led deal. Obama put his signature on this and, of course, led it in the US Congress. He was its biggest champion. And, of course, President Trump made an election commitment that if he got elected—and let's be honest, most of us thought he wouldn't, but he did—he would tear up the TPP, which he has done.


To ignore that this is not a US-driven and US led multilateral trade and investment deal and to say that it's hypothetical that the US might or might not rejoin this deal at some time in the future really is ignoring history. Add that to what Senator Hanson-Young just pointed out: there are suspended clauses in the trade deal—how often do you have suspended clauses in a trade deal, especially a trade deal this size, that are sitting there, waiting?


May I just talk on some of the most egregious aspects of the original Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, especially in relation to things like intellectual property and monopoly pricing for medicines. Even the previous trade minister, Andrew Robb, took the US to task on the kinds of provisions they wanted to put in on the monopoly pricing of medicine. So those clauses are sitting there suspended, waiting to be re-engaged. It is an absolutely critical question to be asking the government at a point, here and now, when we're about to vote on the enabling legislation. Are we basically voting on a contingency for these to be automatically reactivated if the US rejoins the trade deal or, as the minister has pointed out, does it have to go through a process that ultimately involves a sovereign parliament? Remember, we were elected by the people of this country to make the laws and to scrutinise what the government does. That's what the Senate does. That's what we're doing here this morning, and it's extremely important.


Minister, your own government has stood up in here ad nauseam during question time for years talking about how big this deal is—the biggest trade deal in history, the biggest multilateral trade deal, 40 per cent of our economy is covered by it et cetera. As I said, there are 29-plus-plus chapters in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that literally cover every aspect of our life in this country. Just about every industry and every community is impacted by the TPP, and yet, as I pointed out last night—and I did lose my temper in here—you act as though you're insulted that we're asking questions. Considering the gravity of how important this bill is, how big this deal is and how it's taken 13 years to get to this point—it's extremely controversial, extremely complex and there are thousands of pieces of paper covering an incredible amount of detail—I personally think we could be in here asking you questions for days on this, considering how much detail there is and how many unknowns there still are.


I think you've made it very clear, Minister, that this will come back to parliament if the US rejoins the TPP. I did hear you say in your last statement to Senator Patrick 'only if there's legislation'. I want to narrow that down. I'm being very specific with my questions here. Will it require legislation? I know they may change the clauses and there may be negotiations with our negotiators about the 22 suspended clauses but, if those clauses stand, will they require legislation to be put into any new form of the TPP with US involvement? Will that require coming back to parliament or are we voting on a contingency now for them to be automatically re-engaged, as they are if there are no changes?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:31):  Senator Whish-Wilson, you have asked this several times. I have already answered it several times. Again I will reconfirm—hopefully, for the last time because I've now gone through this several times and I don't think it could be any clearer—that this process follows exactly the same treaty processes that the government has done for decades.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  I asked you a specific question. I would like an answer.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  I'll explain it to you. If you don't understand why your question is a hypothetical, let me walk you through why it is a hypothetical built on a hypothetical built on a hypothetical. The first hypothetical is that the United States will re-engage. That is a hypothetical. Then it requires all 11 parties to agree that these provisions will be reactivated and then it requires another hypothetical—that we would agree to any changes negotiated in the process from there. Again, it is the standard processes we have gone through under the current TPP negotiations and the TPP-11. It's no different to now. If legislation is required to amend custom tariff rates, legislation will come through. I cannot say it any clearer. What you are asking over and over again are hypothetical questions that cannot possibly be answered if and until all in this series of events arise.

Minister, speaking about hypotheticals, I haven't asked you if the US is going to rejoin. I haven't asked you if they are going to change their 22 suspended clauses. They would be hypothetical questions. I have actually asked you what the process is if they do. That is not a hypothetical question. It is an absolutely critical question. I have asked you about the status of these clauses as they are now. Perhaps I will phrase it a different way, Minister. Why are there 22 suspended clauses in this legislation that relate to the US? Why do we have suspended clauses? Why haven't they been removed?

   (i) an amendment with the effect that Chapter 9 of the Agreement, which deals with investor-State disputes, does not apply in relation to investments within Australia;


   (ii) an amendment with the effect that labour market testing must occur in relation to contractual service suppliers entering, or proposing to enter, Australia from all parties to the Agreement; and


(b) another Act is in force that includes provisions with the effect that Australia must not, after the commencement of that Act, enter into a trade agreement with one or more other countries that:

   (ii) includes an investor‑state dispute settlement provision.


However, the provisions do not commence at all unless all of the events mentioned in this item occur.






 











I bring the chamber's attention to the Greens amendment on sheet 8529, and I'd like to ask some questions of the Minister in relation to that. But, Minister, first, I'd like an answer to the question put by Senator Whish-Wilson. I asked a very similar question yesterday and did not get a response. Why are those suspended clauses there at all? Why have they not been deleted? Did Australia argue for them to be deleted? If not, why not?

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:38):  I want to bring the committee's attention to the Greens amendment that I moved a few minutes ago. This amendment deals with these most important issues that are lacking in the TPP. As has been pointed out numerous times by me and my colleagues in second reading speeches and also through the committee stage today and yesterday, we are extremely concerned that ISDS provisions remain in the TPP. We also are worried, of course, about the failure to include proper protections for Australian workers through labour market testing. 


So this amendment says that, until these issues are dealt with, the TPP would not be able to come into effect. It is the bare minimum that should be required by this chamber—the absolute bare minimum. We've just heard question after question after question that was put to the minister not being answered because of an even more concerning sign that there are 22 other clauses that are incredibly controversial, such as making cancer medication too expensive for cancer patients to access. That is the type of clause which has been simply left there on the side, ready to be activated at any point, and the minister is refusing to answer questions about why Australia allowed those clauses to stay in place. If the minister is going to continue to not answer those questions, we could at least get to fixing what should be the bare minimum for the TPP, and that is removing those ISDS provisions and putting in place some proper protections for Australian workers, which is what this Greens amendment on sheet 8529 does. 


Interestingly, these two particular issues—ISDS provisions and the labour market testing—are two things which we know the opposition say they are worried about, yet they are prepared to simply tick this TPP legislation through the chamber today without fixing them. There is a hollow promise that somehow, if Mr Bill Shorten were able to become Prime Minister, this would be magically dealt with. We know that that's not true. We know that the government of the day is not able to simply amend the TPP. We've heard the minister say that already today, that changes would need to be renegotiated across all parties. Australia would have to withdraw from the TPP before anything could be fixed. That's the truth. We've had that confirmed previously by the minister for trade. Here we have the Labor Party trying to wind up debate in this place today, shut down debate, because they're embarrassed that their own position is an absolute furphy. Their own position on this legislation is an absolute furphy. Why? Because they've got some in their party who think this shouldn't be a problem, that ISDS provisions are not a problem and that labour market testing is obviously not a problem, and they've got plenty of people inside their own camp who know that it is. 


This amendment put forward by the Greens would fix these things. We don't have to wait for Bill Shorten to become Prime Minister. We could fix it today. Of course, we're going to have Senator Carr jump up in a minute and be very angry at me for pointing this out. You watch. There will be bluster and fury. He's very good at thumping the desk when he is a bit grumpy about how things are going in this place. So I suspect that will happen, because the Labor Party have sold out Australian workers, because the Labor Party have rolled over to back in the TPP, to keep these insidious antidemocratic ISDS clauses in the TPP. They're lying to the Australian people by pretending that somehow it can be fixed if and when Bill Shorten becomes Prime Minister. It's a lie. It's a furphy. Not just the Australian union movement know it; but workers across the country know it too. 


I look forward to hearing the justification from the Labor opposition as to why they won't vote for this Greens amendment when it is part of their own party's national platform. I would like to also ask the minister, in light of this amendment, how the government is going to manage the chilling effect on regulation, given the existence of ISDS clauses in the TPP.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (10:44):  I've been called upon to respond, and I'm only too happy to respond. After all, it is only every second day that the Labor Party gets accused of being made up of liars! And Bill Shorten is accused by the Greens of seeking to mislead the Australian people. Of course, this is the party that has voted with the Liberal Party to undermine the entire environmental structures of this country. We could have had some decent environmental politics in this country; we could have had that—nearly 10 years now—if we had a party here that actually had some real principles and some real understanding of the way power is exercised in this country. But no: we're talking about the Australian Greens. We know just how irresponsible they are when it comes to jobs. We know just how extremely opportunistic they are when it comes to the welfare of the Australian working people, because that's the history of the Australian Greens. As we well know, the Australian Greens are centred on the most wealthy people in this country now. They've got the best social conscience that money can buy. What would you expect from people who live the life? They're only too happy to tell everyone else, with great moral authority, that they know more about how to live the good life than anyone else does.


When it comes to the question of the ISDS provisions, Labor does not support the inclusions. We've made that very clear. We have made it absolutely clear that this government has made a fundamental mistake in including these provisions in this agreement. We've made it very clear that this is a customs bill, that the treaty has been signed. And under the current procedures of this parliament, which we want to change—which we actually want to do something about, by getting a Labor government elected—we want to be able to transform the way in which treaties are undertaken in this country. But we have to acknowledge this fact: that under the current legal framework the treaty has been signed by the government, and what we have before us is a tariff bill that talks about the provisions with which we can change the tariff arrangements themselves.


We've also said that in the future we will prohibit—make legislative changes to stop—the inclusion of ISDS clauses in trade agreements. We will follow the example of the New Zealand Labour government and negotiate side letters to have these clauses removed and reinstate labour market testing should we be fortunate enough to get elected. And we make no assumptions about that. I've heard the Greens talk here as if the election's been already held and already resolved. We don't make any assumptions about those questions. What we do say is that we will be highly competitive at the next election, whenever that is, and we say it should be held very, very soon, because this country simply can't afford to have this government continue in office. But what we will not do is act in an irresponsible manner that is contrary to the national interest.


When the Liberals have made this terrible mistake with regard to this treaty arrangement, our manufacturers, our universities, our winemakers and our farmers shouldn't be made to pay for that mistake. Senator Hanson-Young's proposition would punish them for that mistake if we were to accept these propositions. We have a simple matter here, and I've made this point, but I guess there are some folks for whom you need to repeat things, because it takes a little while for it to sink in. In South Australia there are iron and steel workers at Whyalla who understand the importance of not being undermined by their political representatives. Their position in relation to Canada would be undermined by the proposition that you have put forward. There are, of course, workers in the wool industry. There are meatworkers across South Australia. There are people who work in the pork industry who, of course, would be faced with the advantage that would be given to Mexico under your arrangements, which would give Mexico a 20 per cent advantage in pork. There are people in the cotton industry, not to mention the South Australian wine industry, who would be seriously disadvantaged. I could go on. There's the seafood industry, which is particularly important in South Australia; horticulture; and, of course, cereals and grains. In all of these, advantages would be provided to the Canadians if we were to accept these amendments.



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator KIM CARR:
  You don't want the Canadians to get an advantage? You'd prefer the New Zealanders? You think this is a responsible course of action to take. You would provide the New Zealand cheesemakers with an advantage over Australian cheesemakers in this transitionary period. Do you want to put the Canadian and New Zealand beef farmers ahead of Australian beef farmers or workers, the people in those industries who are seeking to get access to the Japanese markets? Abattoirs are seeking to get access to the Japanese markets under these arrangements.


What the Labor Party says is pretty simple. This is a very flawed agreement. We acknowledge that. We are in the business of getting that fixed, but we won't do it at the expense of farmers, winemakers, cheesemakers, blue-collar workers, manufacturers or our universities. We want to see those people enter international markets on the same basis as their competitors in New Zealand and Canada. I would have thought that would be a pretty straightforward proposition.


So, when it comes to the question of why the Labor Party won't accept these irresponsible stunts that you're putting forward, I think it's very clear. There is no way the Labor Party is going to join with you in these stunts to undermine the living conditions of Australian workers in the manner which we've become all too accustomed to from the Greens. You think this will go unnoticed? You're making a bit of a mistake.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:52):  I think Senator Carr has put the case very clearly. In relation to Senator Hanson-Young's question on the ISDS, those exact questions have been asked and answered several times.



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Yes, they have. Again I will refer you to Hansard. We've now had nearly eight hours of debate and questions on this issue, these customs amendments.



Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Senator Hanson-Young, I think that, if you go back through Hansard, you will find that the words 'chilling effect', along with all the other Greens buzzword bingo words, came out yesterday. Again I will just refer you to Hansard yesterday. There is no chilling effect, because Australian sovereignty still remains, and the Australian government's ability to legislate and to deal with these issues remains completely unaffected.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:53):  I want to get back to the question that I had for the minister that she still hasn't answered yet, but before I do I just want to say to Senator Carr: I know that you did stand up for workers in the automotive industry going back over a decade ago, when the tsunami of free trade was heading for this country, and I know that you personally have been involved with seeing thousands of workers and their families losing their jobs and their communities on the back of the free trade deals that this country has signed in the last 10 years. I know you're aware that there might be benefits to trade, but there are also costs. You're aware of that personally. What we're trying to do here today is minimise those costs.


The amendment that Senator Hanson-Young has put up does that up-front, but we know that if anything gets amended then the deal's off, which is really the irony of this whole situation. We're doing our job in here as senators, yet, because this deal is signed and sealed by the executive and by the government, often for political purposes, through a treaty process that's a couple of hundred years old and desperately needs to be upgraded, we can't actually amend this deal or make it better, because we would lose the whole thing.


Minister, it's extremely important that you answer my question from earlier, and I'll put it to you again. You haven't actually answered this bit. I'm asking about the process. It's not a hypothetical question. There are suspended clauses. I can't find any examples of where suspended clauses have appeared in any other trade deals, like they have in the TPP. If the US rejoins and the clauses are not changed, so they stay as they are, will there be a legislative process where it comes back to parliament for our ratification, or are we voting on the contingency of those clauses being immediately reactivated if the US rejoins? It's a critical question. Fine, legislation is required to change the customs duties and tariffs—we're all aware of that. But, as they are, these are in there as suspended clauses. If they're not changed and the US is happy with them, will there be any kind of legislative process where a sovereign parliament, in a country like Australia, will get to ratify those clauses becoming part of the TPP, or are they de facto already part of the TPP? It is the most important question I can ask you here today. Unfortunately, I don't have more time; I could do this for days, but I really want to know the answer to this question.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:56):  Thank you very much, Senator Whish-Wilson, for that same question. I've lost count now, but I think it's probably up to about eight times.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Try answering it!




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Just because you don't like the answer doesn't mean it won't be the same answer I've now given seven, eight, nine times. Again, I cannot make it any simpler than I already have, but, hopefully for the last time, this will be very clear. We have the 22 clauses that have been suspended. If—if!—the United States rejoins and if all 11 parties agree to what's already been agreed to in those clauses, it will come back to JSCOT, but then it would require, as I've had reconfirmed, custom amendment changes. And, as I've said previously, if that were the case, it would come back to parliament, as it has now. You can keep asking me the same question, Senator Whish-Wilson, but the answer will be the same. And, if you ask the same question again, I will refer you to Hansard, because this has now been asked and answered several times.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:57):  I predicted fire and fury from Senator Carr, and we got that, so obviously the Labor Party are still very tetchy about their position in relation to rolling over with the Morrison government on the TPP. I find it extraordinary that something that is Labor Party policy is now being decried in this place as irresponsible. This is the Labor Party's own policy, but they're selling out their members, they're selling out the unions and they're selling out Australian workers. We know that, because they think it's so bad that if they were to come into government they'd try to fix it. The problem is they can't. Once the TPP is in, it is in. We've already had confirmation from the minister that, in order to fix any of this down the track, Australia would have to withdraw and renegotiate. And that is simply the truth of the matter. It doesn't matter how many times or how angry or how embarrassed the Labor Party are, that's the fact. They can make as many promises as possible to fix things, but they are hollow and they are lies. With that, I ask that the question be put on my amendment so that we can get on to debating the next sections.

  Senator Hanson-Young, we do not have to withdraw. Neither I nor Simon Birmingham, as the minister, has said that is the case.

 (Tasmania) (10:59):  On that point, Minister, assuming the Labor government gets elected and they want to change aspects of the deal—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Remove the ISDS provisions.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Yes. Getting 10 other countries to agree to removing things, including labour testing for employment and ISDS, would be incredibly difficult when they actually want it in the deal now. Minister, can you confirm that if Australia insisted on the removal of ISDS from the TPP, and insisted on labour market testing for foreign workers, it would voluntarily have to withdraw from the TPP if it refused that or changed legislation in Australia that made that impossible?

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:02):  A report that has been put out by the Parliamentary Library says it has been raised that these provisions mean that, when Australian governments make new laws or policy in the interests of Australian people, foreign investors can sue our government in international tribunals if they consider that those laws harm their investments or disadvantage them in some way. So you are saying it goes to a tribunal, that it does not go to an Australian law court whatsoever. Can you tell me and the Australian people whether that tribunal will amount to only three people making the decisions?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (11:05):  Senator, I'm seeking further advice on that, but it depends on what's in the treaty itself. We'll get some more information on that. One thing I would like to point out and remind the chamber of in relation to the ISDS—something that we've discussed in great depth here over the last couple of days—is that this is reciprocal. Senator Hanson, this might allay some of your concerns. This is equally important for Australian businesses engaging overseas. For example, Australian mining companies want ISDS provisions in any future Indonesian free trade agreement because they provide certainty for those businesses themselves. Again, I think it's important to remember that this is not just an issue for others; it is an issue for us. In fact, in the negotiations on the Indonesia-Australia free trade agreement, the Indonesian government said that they want to have the ISDS to provide foreign investors, including Australian investors, with greater certainty in terms of doing business in Indonesia.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:08):  The final question I might have on ISDS is a question I raised with Senator Birmingham, and he was working towards an answer. In the event that a corporation here in Australia feels that they have been, in some way, disadvantaged because of a change of public policy or a change of law—I just want to make it very clear—I understand that they have the right to go to our courts to seek a remedy. This question does not relate to companies' rights to go to a court. It's clear under the ISDS provisions that a multinational corporation here in Australia can invoke ISDS provisions. My question is specifically related to an Australian company that feels that they need to be compensated in some way. Can an Australian company invoke an ISDS application in respect of a change of public policy, equal to what an international company can do?

Senator REYNOLDS

 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (11:10):  This treaty was signed in March. Currently before this chamber are two customs and customs tariff amendment bills. While I appreciate your desire to go off into some discursive discussion about the treaty itself, I would suggest that these questions might be more suited to estimates next week, where you will have the minister at the table and also the department to talk more about and unpack the process itself and any policy underpinnings of that. You can keep asking these questions in this place, as is your right, but they are not relevant to the legislation at this point. If you would like to have some discursive policy debate and discussion, we can continue to do so, but it is not relevant to the bill at hand, and many of those issues have been dealt with in now over eight hours of debate and discussion on these two customs bills.

If this government has not made a decision on who is going to be on that panel then it is pathetic and this whole treaty needs to be questioned fully. You are saying it's hypothetical. You have put it in there. That's what I heard yesterday: 'It's hypothetical. This may never happen. We've had these agreements for the last 20 or 30 years, we've been challenged only once and that was not successful.' If that is the case then why have we signed up to it, when the New Zealand Prime Minister has written a side letter to say that they are not going to be bound by the ISDS, yet Australia is adamant on having this in? If it's not that important then write a side letter and don't allow any multinational company to sue us in the case that they may be able to.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (11:13):  I would point you and perhaps your staff to chapter 9 of the TPP document, which we can provide or is available on the internet. It explains the processes in detail. I think one of the misunderstandings implicit in your question is that this is not a standing panel or body, so it does not exist. It is a process that can be invoked, should it be needed and Australia and whatever other party were in agreement that this panel would be set up. At that point then they would go through a process of agreeing to and appointing panel members, but the panel does not yet exist; it is just a theoretical process. Again, if you like, we can provide you with chapter 9, the investment chapter. The process for this is clearly laid out in that chapter. That goes to the heart of Senator Patrick's questions as well. Senator Patrick, you're clearly, by the tone of your questions, very well aware of that chapter and the provisions within it. So, again, we can provide it to both of you, but it is publicly available information on how that process would be invoked if it were ever necessary. That's why it is a hypothetical, Senator Hanson—because it is just something to be invoked should both parties agree in future.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (11:16):  Senator Hanson, again, when you were in the chamber yesterday these questions were asked and answered in great detail. That does come under the labour market testing provisions of the treaty, which again we can provide to you. Experience is very important. These labour market testing provisions are not new. They are already in a number of other treaties. I understand community concerns. This is certainly an issue that the unions are very vocal about. But, when you have a look at the facts, for the Japan, China and South Korea free trade agreements, which are subject to LMT provisions, the evidence is that 457 visa numbers for those three countries actually dropped by 10 per cent after the introduction of those LMT provisions. So these are not new. The processes are the same, and, despite fears that this will lead to Australian workforces and workers being overrun, the evidence is simply not there.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:17):  Minister, you may say that there is no fear, and of course your 457 visa numbers have actually dropped. Yes, I agree with you that they have. But the thing is, if you say it's not a problem, why put it into the treaty? If it goes on labour market testing and if we need the workers, then why was it necessary to put in the treaty, as with the Indonesian treaty and the China free trade agreement as well, that they could actually bring in 5,000 workers over a period of time? If it is based on labour market testing, why put any numbers in it at all?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (11:18):  Senator Hanson, as I answered in response to questions from Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Whish-Wilson—and I believe you were in the chamber for some of that yesterday—because this is a treaty, these are reciprocal arrangements, so they apply equally to Australians working in companies engaged in arrangements with some of our treaty partners. This is not just an issue about workers coming into Australia. It is also important because we cannot request that or expect that of our own workers, for our own companies, if we don't have some reciprocal arrangements.


I do have some further detail for you, Senator Hanson, in relation to your question about what the commitments are. Australia's temporary entry commitments are limited to businesspeople from parties to the TPP-11, and they provide similar access to Australian businesspersons in equivalent categories. So Australia has committed to providing access for TPP-11 businesspersons to stay and work in Australia, but, again, they are quite defined categories. For contractual service suppliers it's one year, with a possibility of extension. For investors and independent executives it's up to two years. For intracorporate transferees, which is a fancy way of saying executives and senior managers, it's an initial four years, with a possibility of extension. For specialists it's a two-year stay, with the possibility of extension; and for installers and servicers it's up to three months. Spouses and dependants are granted entry to accompany executives and contractual service suppliers. So it is very specific, it is very limited and it is focused on business and executives and their spouses. It's not a free-for-all. It is very specific. And, as you can see, there are different time frames for different categories of business visas and engagements.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:20):  Thank you very much for that answer. I have with me the customs tariff amendment comprehensive TPP bill 2018. I'm reading through this and I'm trying to find answers to this. The whole customs tariff book is based on the customs tariff, because it is customs tariffs. But all it says is—I'll pick one out, item No. 80: 2710.19.53, and it's got $0.412/L. It doesn't say anything about what it actually is. And then you've got here in tariffs, from 1 January—all free. It doesn't state what's free. It doesn't tell me anything, looking at this book—what is free. So, we've got pages and pages of items coming into Australia, no tariffs—it's free. Where do I get the answer to this? What impact are these imports going to have on Australian producers, farmers and manufacturing industries in this nation? How much more industry and manufacturing are we going to destroy in this country by getting rid of tariffs—the one thing that actually helped our businesses here to compete with countries that are paying only a few dollars a day to their workers?

I've got some specific information, because now I understand that you're talking about the amendments to the Customs Tariff Act. But what I would say is that there's a number of documents that can help you and your staff in relation to this. The first one is the explanatory memorandum, which does actually provide the detail, because the bill is—as you say, it is a very technical amendment to the act itself. The explanatory memorandum does have that information.


But I think I can short-circuit some of that more detailed information for you. The customs tariff amendment bill will make the following three major changes: first, it provides preferential rates of customs duty for all goods, excluding excise equivalent goods, that are determined to be originating within the new part of the act; second, it inserts new schedules to provide for excise equivalent rates of customs duty on certain alcohol, tobacco and fuel products and for phasing rates of customs duty in accordance with our treaty obligations; and, third, it amends certain concessional items in schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act to maintain customs duty rates in line with applicable concessional items. I would refer you to the explanatory memorandum, because that is the technical explanation of the technical bill that you're having a look at. What you're looking at is quite technical, because it is actually the wording to amend the act, whereas the explanatory memorandum explains it. I would also refer you to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report on these bills, which goes into some detail about what the customs amendment and customs tariff amendment bills are all about.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (11:32):  In respect of the Customs Amendment (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership Implementation) Bill 2018, I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 8530:


(1) Clause 2, page 2 (cell at table item 2, column 2), omit the cell, substitute:






 






If the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans‑Pacific Partnership, done at Santiago, Chile on 8 March 2018, enters into force for Australia—the first day that another Act is in force that includes provisions with the effect that Australia must not defend an action brought against Australia under an investor‑state dispute settlement provision of any treaty unless the Parliament has agreed to the defence.


However, the provisions do not commence at all unless all of the events mentioned in this item occur.






 













[commencement]



Given the failure, sadly, of the amendment just now because the Labor Party refused to be an opposition and voted with the government to tick through the TPP—despite the fact that that amendment was simply instating the Labor Party's own policies; take that as you will—this amendment ensures that any need for funds to fight an ISDS clause would have to come before the parliament. It also ensures that there is proper transparency around how taxpayer funds are being spent in defending our sovereignty and our laws and regulations against multinationals. Given we now have a TPP agreement with locked-in ISDS provisions, it is absolutely essential that the Australian people know what this is costing us and what the impact is, and that transparency prevails. This is about ensuring that the government can't paper over what they've just agreed to; that the Labor Party, either in opposition or in government, can't pretend that this isn't having a chilling effect; and that taxpayer money being spent on it is accounted for, and sunlight is shone in places where, we know, both sides of this place would prefer it not to be.


While I've been on my feet speaking, it has been just fascinating to see the minister in negotiations with the Labor Party. It just proves what a cuddly, convenient relationship we have now between the two parties in this place, with the Labor Party and the coalition selling out Australian democracy: selling out the rights of the Australian people to have laws and regulations that protect their health, protect the environment and look after their best interests. Meanwhile, Labor and the coalition are passing legislation that puts the interests of big multinational companies first. That's what they're more interested in doing. How can they shut down debate today? How can they make sure that power remains with the big corporates rather than with the Australian people? 


I urge all in this place to support this amendment now that the Labor Party have rolled over with the government to lock in these provisions which would allow multinational companies to sue the Australian people over regulations and laws that perhaps the public want because they know they are in their best interests. At the very least, the government of the day needs to be transparent about how much this is going to cost and what is on foot. It's a transparency measure. There should be nothing to be afraid of. But, of course, the proof will be in the pudding. We'll see the Labor Party and the coalition vote it down because they don't want the public to know just how bad this TPP deal really is.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (11:36):  I want to reflect on the comments that were made previously by Senator Hanson, who raised a very good point. In these trade debates, if you like to call them debates—in the spin around promoting free trade deals, which has happened since Mr Tony Abbot was elected in 2013 and we've seen an avalanche of bilateral trade deals; bilateral trade deals being trade deals between two countries—it is fascinating how the government will line up. They come in here at question time and quote their numbers—and Senator Carr has just done it in his statement to the chamber—about all the benefits that our exporters are going to receive when foreign countries allow increased access to their markets. But never in the debate do we talk about the costs of free trade deals. There are costs. Every economist acknowledges it. Those costs need to be weighed up in the debate, in the matter of public interest, against the benefits. That's how we assess whether a trade deal, or a trade investment deal like the TPP, is in our national interest. 


It's fundamentally dishonest that we never talk about the impacts of these deals on our local producers, on our local manufacturers and on our local farmers. I can tell you that campaigns such as 'buy Australian', 'buy Australian beef' and 'buy Australian seafood' have triggered state-to-state dispute settlements in previous trade deals like NAFTA, where US beef and Canadian beef—pardon the pun—had a major beef over a 'buy local' campaign. These trade deals make it extremely difficult for us to support local businesses or for governments to subsidise or provide assistance to local businesses and local industries. That's why we saw the loss of tens of thousands of Australian car workers. It has mainly been a slow decline, but it has been very rapid in the last five years as this Liberal government has signed an avalanche of free trade deals—mostly to get a headline and a press opportunity. I haven't seen any evidence that these deals have benefited our local exporters, but I can tell you that I hear all the time about how difficult it is for local farmers, producers and manufacturers to compete with cheap foreign products. That is what Senator Hanson asked. What access are we giving away and selling down the river? Who are we selling down the river? 


You may remember that the Korean free trade deal was called by the media, very cynically, 'the cars for cows deal'. In other words, we sold out our car industry to get increased access for our beef farmers. Let's just look at that example. If that's true, and I believe it was the case, who makes that decision? Who is the high, almighty arbiter of the fact that we are going to kill the car industry, its intellectual property and the decades of communities and workers who have grown up in those communities, as well as the ability to make our own cars and all the other ramifications that go with that? Who makes the decision that we sell out an entire industry and that we will trade that off against increased access for our beef farmers?


When you deal with bilateral deals, any economist will tell you that any simple input-output model, or any other economic model, can't accurately predict the benefits of those deals. That's because you end up stealing trade off other countries who you don't have bilateral deals with. I'm not going to give everyone in here a lecture on economics, but that's why, in theory, multilateral deals—like the deals we saw through the WTO, which fell apart after the Doha rounds—are the only kinds of deals that do bring net economic benefits. These bilateral deals and these multilateral deals don't. It is a really important point when we're about to vote very soon on this massive sellout of Australian interests—and for what? We need to consider the costs. They need to be properly quantified. No-one wants to talk about it in the public debate. It's absolutely our role here in the Senate to bring balance to this debate and to raise these issues with you, Assistant Minister.


I had a couple of quick questions for you in relation to the environmental chapter. It was welcome when the environment chapter in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement was negotiated. The environment chapter is chapter 20. There's a section in there that relates to the protection of cetaceans. I just wanted to ask you, given the importance of protecting cetaceans under Australian law, what ability we will have in the use of the TPP—presuming it's going to be ratified by this parliament very soon—and how that chapter will enable us to stop Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean, considering Japan has been the leader of this TPP-11 that we have before us here today. When the US pulled out, it was the Japanese Prime Minister, Prime Minister Abe, who reignited and reinvigorated the push for the TPP-11.


We saw, just a week or two ago, that the Japanese government was threatening to pull out of the International Whaling Commission, a rules based order around whaling that Australia showed leadership in over 35 years ago by banning commercial whaling. How will we be able to use this environment chapter in the TPP to hold the Japanese government to account if they go down to our Southern Ocean and start slaughtering whales on an industrial, commercial scale? That is what their stated intention is. I'd like to know how we can actually use this chapter to stop that from happening.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (11:43):  I think I've just discovered why some of these questions are coming from my Greens colleagues. You said that this will be ratified shortly. This is actually a treaty that was ratified back in March of this year, and these are two customs enabling bills. You just said it hasn't been ratified yet. Well, it has been ratified. That might perhaps explain the misdirected nature of some of these questions. Again, as you acknowledged, this is in chapter 20 of the treaty. You obviously have a copy of the treaty and of that chapter. These questions have absolutely no direct relevance to these two customs bills at all. So perhaps, Chair, I might ask, in that case, if I could just get your opinion of whether these questions are in order, because they relate to a treaty that was ratified in March of this year. We have now spent nearly 10 hours on debate in this chamber on the same questions over and over again—on questions which actually relate to a treaty that has been ratified and which are not relevant to the bills here today. Chair, if I could ask for your guidance.



The CHAIR:  It is a broad-ranging debate. The senator was asking for your view on the impact of that treaty on a free trade agreement, and I believe that you've answered that question.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (11:45):  I would say they're trying to distract away from that question. This is chapter 20. I won't say you deliberately misled the chamber then, Minister, but what we're doing today is ratifying this in parliament. You've signed this deal. Your executive has ratified it, but parliament hasn't ratified it yet. That's exactly why we're here today. That's what I would say a vote on the legislation is. But it's an attempt to actually distract away from the critical issue about which I asked you, which, by the way, is a question that hasn't been answered. And I'm sure you'd expect me, as a Greens senator, to be asking this question.


This environmental chapter was put in the TPP to try to bring civil society on board with the TPP. I've been following it long enough to know that's the case. It was designed to bring in environment groups, as were the other chapters in there around slave labour and wildlife trade. There's a whole array of stuff in here. As I mentioned earlier, it covers just about every aspect of life in every country that's signing up to this, and it is part of what we are ratifying as a parliament. You are giving effect to the customs and tariff side of this. That's what actually makes this treaty come into effect. But it is all the same. So this is absolutely critical, and I ask you again: is there a binding clause in here? Is it the purpose of this environmental chapter that Australia can take action against the Japanese government if they go down into the Southern Ocean this summer or next summer and resume commercial whaling, which has been banned for over 35 years? Will this actually allow us, as a country, within our relationship in the TPP-11, to take action against the Japanese government?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (11:47):  Senator Whish-Wilson, we are again well and truly foraying into the world of the hypothetical.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  What's it in there for then?




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Senator Whish-Wilson, if you're going to ask me a question, please allow me to answer the question. Again, I'll provide the same answers that I've provided over probably seven hours of questioning on the same issues. This is a treaty that has been signed. We are now dealing, before this chamber, with the customs bills to fully enable our agreements. In relation to the issues in chapter 20 that you're talking about—the environmental considerations—the parliament has had ample opportunity to debate this. Over the course of the last two years, the provisions of the TPP have been debated, and I've gone through the various inquiries in this chamber already. I think there have been at least five parliamentary inquiries. There have been over a thousand consultations with 485 separate organisations, which is incredibly comprehensive. It is the most comprehensive engagement and parliamentary debate on any treaty that Australia has ever been party to.


We've already dealt with a range of these issues over and over again in over seven hours of debate in this place. You and I both know that the questions you just asked are far more appropriate for next week's Senate estimates process. But, again, go back and have a look at your own remarks in Hansard, Senator Whish-Wilson. You have already acknowledged that you have raised these issues in multiple estimates committees over multiple years, so it's not like you and the Greens have not had ample opportunity to get engaged and involved and to debate these issues. You have. We can sit here for the next several hours—I think it's taken 10 hours of the Senate's time already—and it's your right to keep us talking about the same things over and over again, but, ultimately, you are reprosecuting a treaty that was signed in March. These are customs amendment and customs tariff amendment bills. There is nothing that I have not repeated over and over again. If you keep asking the same questions, I will keep giving you the same answers, because the answers do not change, even if you do not like them.

 (Tasmania) (11:50):  If you don't like what's in the 29-plus chapters of the TPP, your opportunity to stop it is to vote against it in this chamber. We can vote against this enabling legislation, which would mean the whole thing falls apart. Minister, why would I want to prosecute the case in estimates next week, when the deal would have already been voted on and passed into law? Now is the opportunity for these issues to be raised. By the way, I actually haven't read the final text, because it has changed so many times. I was involved in this for the previous TPP. Senator Hanson-Young has done a fantastic job as our trade spokesperson since then. I am asking you now. I have looked at this and I'm looking at the detail right in front of me. I would like you and your advisers to tell me how this chapter will help us hold the Japanese government to account if they begin illegal commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean. Considering there is a section on mammal and cetacean protection, do we have binding agreements in here? What action can we take? Is it a state-to-state process? What is the process that we can use? Or is this environmental chapter, essentially, just platitudes? Is there nothing in here that we can actually use to bind another country's actions around the protection of mammals like whales, which, as you know, are very important to the Australian people?

What in here will allow us to hold the Japanese government to account? If you don't believe that's the case, then just say so. Please answer the question.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (11:53):  Of course the International Whaling Commission is a separate process. The TPP has a chapter so that 11 countries can cooperate on protecting mammals and cetaceans. That's my question: what in this chapter will allow the Australian government—hopefully—to put pressure on the Japanese government to stop killing whales? Why even have a chapter that includes the protection of whales in a multilateral agreement if it's not going to actually work? A corporation or a government can sue another government for a breach of rules and regulations around economic factors when it affects their profits. Why even have a chapter in the TPP if we can't have binding agreements that have consequences on matters in relation to things like wildlife trade and the protection of cetaceans?

The United States and President Trump saw no reason to be involved in this and they've pulled out, so there are grave concerns. I will make comments on why I'm concerned about it. There was a free trade agreement with America signed by the Liberal Party in 2004 and ratified with support from the Labor Party. It came into effect in January 2005. Under that free trade agreement, from day one, Australia got rid of all its tariffs. America negotiated for its industries such as beef, horticulture and other areas to keep their tariffs on Australian exports into that country for between 11 and 18 years. That was for beef, horticulture, wine, steel, cotton and sheep. That was not a good deal for Australia. So it really concerns me when free trade agreements are signed off without being debated in this chamber and without the people of Australia being allowed to have a say in any of these treaties and agreements.


I can understand why you are saying it's a good thing—because we will be able to export our products to other countries around the world—and I'm sure a lot of people are very happy about that, especially in industry and the farming sector. My concern here is that in Australia we have a problem with multinationals paying their taxes. There are over 700 multinational companies in Australia that pay no tax at all. I hear the same old rhetoric from the government: 'We are addressing that and we are reining it in.' Under this free trade agreement, you are opening up the gates for multinational companies to come here, and they will be able to bring in their workers. My question to you is: if we are going to open it up to more multinational companies to come into Australia and work here, what is the government doing to ensure that they will pay their taxes here in Australia and not add to the over 700 companies already that pay no taxes in Australia, which costs the Australian taxpayer?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (11:58):  Thank you, Senator Hanson, for that question. I think most of that was a comment rather than a question, but, in relation to paying tax, I think that is a perfect question for Senator Cormann in question time, because any companies operating here would be subject to exactly the same laws and enforcement on taxation and all other regulations. The issue you raise is one of enforcement under Australian law and is not directly relevant to this bill here today, but it is a good question, and I would encourage you to take that up with Minister Cormann.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:59):  I want to talk a little bit about ratification, because I heard the exchange between Senator Whish-Wilson and the minister. I just want to repeat a point that Mr Mina of DFAT, who is an expert in this field, made in his public testimony:


The second point is simply to note that three countries—Japan, Singapore and Mexico—have all ratified. Three more need to ratify for the agreement to enter into force. Developments are gathering apace in five other countries—


and he mentions them. He continued:


It is very possible that, if Australia isn't an early mover on ratification, we will not make one of the first six … We do, therefore, commend early ratification to the committee, and we're looking forward to answering any further questions you may have today.


There seems to be some confusion. I put it to you that Mr Mina is an expert in this field. He is very well respected. But this treaty, I presume, hasn't been ratified on the basis of the testimony of Mr Mina.


Moving on next to the point about relevance to the bill, again, this bill is enabling legislation for a treaty and it's very normal in committee stage to deal with consequences of bills, including consequences that are not directly related to the bill. Pretty much everything is in order when we're talking about the TPP.


In the government's consideration of the agreement, once again, after many years I'm sure that the government has done its due diligence on this. It is clear, in respect of labour market testing, that there are about 450 professions that could be covered by the term 'contractual service supplier'. And I note that, for those contractual service suppliers, we don't have to have labour market testing. They can simply come to Australia under the agreement and take the role of an Australian worker without testing. What analysis did the government do in terms of the numbers of likely foreign workers that would come to this country without that testing?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (12:01):  Thank you very much, Senator Patrick, for your several questions wrapped up into the one. The first one I'd like to address is that article that you were talking about. Again, I think there is a bit of danger in reading bits and pieces, so what I'd like to do, perhaps, is go through with you the risks of not ratifying quickly and wrap up some of those issues. In that context, analysis reveals Australian industries would be at immediate disadvantage if we fail to ratify the TPP-11.


In terms of the process, it will enter into force 60 days after six countries have ratified the agreement. Japan, Singapore and Mexico, as I've said previously in this place, have all ratified. New Zealand and Canada are close to ratifying. They have almost finished their own domestic processes. After ratification, New Zealand and Canada would receive an 11 per cent tariff cut for their fresh beef exports to Japan next year, giving them a tariff rate of 2.2 per cent, which is lower than our current preferential treatment under our free trade agreement with Japan. This is significant given the value of all our beef exports to Japan is over $2 billion a year. That would be giving New Zealand and Canada a significant preferential advantage over our own beef producers right here in Australia.


Senator Carr has already identified this as well in the chamber, but I'm very happy to keep going through this with you. It is not only the beef industry. The New Zealand wine industry would gain an edge over our own domestic industry. The Canadian wine industry, which is growing, would also have significant advantages with the elimination of Canada's tariff, which on wine is currently 4.68c a litre, upon entering into force of the TPP. Again, that's a significant disadvantage to us potentially, because our wine exports to Canada were valued at nearly $200 million last financial year.


We've got beef, we've got wine and we've also got dairy. Under the Japanese free trade agreement the tariff rates on our cheddar cheese exports into Japan currently sit at nearly 30 per cent. On ratification of the TPP-11 New Zealand and Canada would have their tariff rates immediately cut to 27.9 per cent, obviously less than ours. Again, that gives them a competitive advantage over our dairy producers, because Australia's tariff rate would continue to remain at nearly 30 per cent.


We've got beef, we've got wine and we've got dairy. Also, Australian exports of iron and steel to Vietnam are currently worth $146 million a year. If Australia is not amongst the first six countries in the TPP-11 and Vietnam is, then Australian iron ore and steel exporters will be at a significant disadvantage to their Japanese steelmaking competitors—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  It sounds hypothetical to me.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  I'll take that interjection. This is not hypothetical, this is a reality. That is what will happen under these agreements. Again, if Senator Whish-Wilson had actually read this material, he would understand that that is the case and this is an issue that is directly relevant to these customs and customs tariff amendment bills here today. But that's not it; there is more, Senator Patrick, in terms of disadvantage for Australia. Australia would receive enhanced quota volumes for wheat and barley. Canada would receive an additional 40,000 tonnes of wheat exports into Japan—again, a significant disadvantage for Australian farmers. Australia's exports of wheat and barley to Japan were worth over half a billion dollars last financial year. So, again, there will be tangible and specific disadvantages for a number of Australian industries if we are not in that first six. The TPP-11 will eliminate all remaining tariffs on Australian raw wool exports to TPP-11 countries from entry into force. Australian wool exports to TPP-11 countries are valued at $35 million and growing.


Finally, the TPP-11 links Australia with some of the world's major automotive producers, including Japan, Mexico and Canada, and we would not have preferential access to these markets for our steel products. Senator Patrick, again, the facts are very clear, and I welcome these questions on this issue because they are directly relevant to these bills and the consequence of not passing these bills.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (12:07):  Minister, you are talking about the consequences of this treaty entering into force, and that's a very appropriate thing to do in this debate. But we shouldn't just talk about the positives; we also need to talk about the negatives—and I think that's what we have been doing and trying to do. Minister, you indicated to Senator Whish-Wilson that the treaty has been ratified when in actual fact it hasn't.



Senator Reynolds interjecting—




Senator PATRICK:
  No, I understand. It has been signed but it hasn't been ratified—and I note that, in your answer, you conceded that. I just wanted to make that relatively clear. We support free trade. We're just trying to deal with the unintended consequences—or maybe the intended negative consequences—and just trying to understand the magnitude of that consequence in order to make an informed decision about whether we allow legislation that would bring this agreement into force. I was asking questions about labour market testing. We know that, under this agreement, there are up to 450 categories of workers who may come in from overseas to fulfil a particular role for a multinational corporation. In the analysis and deliberations that took place, was there any measurement, modelling or calculation done as to how many workers per annum—assuming the treaty was being used effectively and benefits were flying on both sides—the government expects to come into the country as a result of this agreement?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (12:07):  I would again note a couple of things in relation to this. The labour market testing and the issues around that have been answered by you and others over many hours. So, in terms of the substance of that, I'll again point you to Hansard. Your specific question, which again is not relevant to these bills, relates to the debate before we signed the treaty back in March. Again, I'll point out that that is a discursive discussion better suited for estimates next week. However, as the senator well knows, that is almost a hypothetical, because it is market driven. So the government cannot tell you exactly how many, just as we couldn't with the Japanese, South Korean and Chinese free trade agreements because it is—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  But you can tell us how much diverted trade there's going to be.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  I know the Greens have no concept of what 'market driven' means, but Senator Patrick does. You know very well, Senator Patrick, that this is market driven. And you were in the chamber when I gave this answer to Senator Hanson. To get some indication, if you go back and look at the three free trade agreements—with Japan, South Korea and China—you will find that, since they were ratified, 457 visa numbers for those countries have fallen. While we cannot tell you a precise number, as you well know—because it is market driven—if you would like to go into the treaty policy analysis of cabinet, that is something you can ask the minister in estimates next week and have a much more discursive discussion, which is not relevant to these bills here today.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (12:10):  I do understand the concept of 'market driven'; I was referring to discussions that may have taken place during the deliberations in respect of the treaty. Surely the government, as they were going through the machinations of considering the terms of the bill, would have looked at this and said, 'What does that mean for Australia?' I don't necessarily expect them to be right, because, as you correctly say, they're market driven. But it is not so much a hypothetical as it is an issue of fact. During the deliberations, when the Australian government was working on this agreement, did it ever look at the numbers of workers that it thought might come in as a result of the treaty coming into force?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (12:11):  I'd refer you to my last answer and the many others before that. As you well know, those are questions about policy development and implementation that the parliament has had five opportunities that I'm aware of to ask and have answered, including in many Senate estimates, which I know you have been involved in. Again, you and I both know these are not questions for this session. If you want to keep asking about issues of policy that don't relate in any way to the substance of these customs bills, I can only keep providing the same answer: that is not relevant to this discussion, because, as you know, it is self-evident. No matter how calmly and nicely you ask these questions and pad them out, the answer is still the same, Senator Patrick: government considers these questions in the course of any treaty negotiation and process. The parliament has had ample opportunity over the last two years in this most debated, discussed and reviewed treaty process. If you want to ask questions about that process again in relation to these bills, I again suggest you raise them directly with the minister either in question time or, more appropriately, in estimates next week.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (12:13):  I'm trying to garner information for the vote that will be cast in relation to these bills. You must accept that they have quite significant consequences. It allows the treaty to come into force after six countries have ratified the treaty. Are you suggesting we shut down the committee stage just because we've had inquiries and Senate estimates? This is exactly what this stage of debate is about—making sure we have the details we require to make a good decision. If you're suggesting I hold off until next week, are you in a position to state that you would recommit the bills to a vote after these questions were answered at estimates?

Your idea is that somehow we are filibustering and trying to waste the committee's time by asking really important questions about supposedly the biggest multilateral trade and investment deal this country has ever signed. It has taken 13 years to get to this point. It has been highly controversial and extremely complex, and we still don't feel like we've got any answers out of this. I think you need to take on board that, if you're hearing similar questions repeated by various senators, it is probably because you didn't answer them in the first place.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (12:23):  by leave—I move Centre Alliance amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 8523 together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 3, page 8 (after line 6), at the end of Subdivision A, add:




153ZKUA


Cessation of effect of Division



 This Division ceases to have effect on 1 January 2020 unless all of the following come into force for Australia before that day:


(a) bilateral side letters exchanged between Australia and each other Party agreeing that Chapter 9 of the Agreement, which deals with investor-State disputes, does not apply in relation to an investment in Australia by an investor of the other Party;


(b) bilateral side letters exchanged between Australia and each other Party agreeing that labour market testing must occur in relation to contractual service suppliers entering, or proposing to enter, Australia from the other Party.




[sunsetting]



(2) Schedule 1, item 4, page 19 (after line 18), at the end of Division 4EB, add:




126AKM


Cessation of effect of Division



 This Division ceases to have effect on 1 January 2020 unless all of the following come into force for Australia before that day:


(a) bilateral side letters exchanged between Australia and each other Party agreeing that Chapter 9 of the Agreement, which deals with investor-State disputes, does not apply in relation to an investment in Australia by an investor of the other Party;


(b) bilateral side letters exchanged between Australia and each other Party agreeing that labour market testing must occur in relation to contractual service suppliers entering, or proposing to enter, Australia from the other Party.




[sunsetting]



I want to point out that the objective of this amendment is to include a sunset clause so that unless bilateral side letters are exchanged relating to ISDS provisions and labour market testing by 1 January 2020 this legislation is repealed. We believe that these amendments will allow the TPP-11 to enter into force but signal to other countries that Australia is planning to remove the ISDS clauses and reinstate labour market testing. If those arrangements haven't been made, the legislation will then be repealed.


These amendments give effect to the TPP. In that sense, they address the concerns raised by Senator Farrell in his statement yesterday, where he said that he was concerned that our exporters would miss out on a second tariff cut on 1 April 2019 for Japanese markets. That would give Canada and New Zealand an 11 per cent tariff cut on beef, making their rate lower than Australia's and hurting our beef producers. Our cheddar cheese producers would lose out to New Zealand, who would have a tariff rate four per cent lower than Australia's, et cetera.


Senator Carr, of course, raised some concerns about what would happen if we didn't enter into the TPP now. We respect those concerns. These amendments accommodate the Labor Party's announced intention to make sure that those provisions are removed, except that they provide a guarantee that is beyond Labor's control: if they are not elected next year, these sunset provisions will come into effect. That will, in effect, nullify our ratification and will keep their constituents—the unions and the hardworking Australians who vote for the Labor Party—happy. We would encourage Labor, in this instance, to support this.


I know a concern was raised by Senator Farrell that this may put in place an artificial deadline. Let's presume that the Labor Party were to form government next year and were to commence negotiations. If they felt that for some reason they weren't going to hit the deadline that was imposed by these amendments, I can then assure the Labor Party that we would be very open to a change. In good faith, they could come to us—or Senator Griff and myself, at the very least—and we would perhaps support a change to give more time for the Labor Party to have either these cancerous provisions removed or the labour market testing restored. In that context, I urge the Labor Party to support these amendments that not only are consistent with their national platform but are consistent with the plan that Mr Shorten has announced and made a commitment to in respect to their constituents.

 (Tasmania) (10:13):  I want to go back to a question that I would have liked to ask last night but ran out of time. Could the minister confirm that there are 22 suspended provisions in the TPP that relate to previous US involvement and clarify the status of those provisions if the US rejoins the trade deal and what the process would be at that stage? Does it need to come back to parliament for ratification if a new member joins and new clauses are added to the TPP or are we de facto voting for the contingency that they may be reinstated if the US joins? What actually are we voting on today?

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:14):  I understand that's what you said, Minister, but I'm seeking more information than that. What is the process for a party like Australia to agree to (a) the inclusion of the US in the deal and (b) the activation of those 22 clauses? Is it a process where the executive and the minister sign a document that says it is okay for the US to join and those clauses to be added, or does it come back to a sovereign parliament, like this chamber, for ratification?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:15):  Thank you very much for that question, Senator Whish-Wilson. My understanding is JSCOT has already considered those clauses; however, if the United States does rejoin the process, all the other parties would then also need to agree to those 22 being reinstated. My understanding is that while JSCOT has already considered those, it would come back to JSCOT.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-10-17,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:16):  So JSCOT has considered those clauses but they are not in this enabling legislation that we're passing today—at least they're not in there physically. But they are suspended clauses. JSCOT, as we discussed yesterday, Minister, is essentially a rubber stamp for the executive, which has already signed the deal. I won't say the same about the FADT inquiry process, because the opposition tends to control that. So if the US rejoins, the minister signs the re-activation of those 22 clauses, and then it goes to JSCOT. JSCOT presumably produces a report. Does that come back to parliament for ratification?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:17):  Senator Whish-Wilson, we've been through this process several times. Again, I can keep giving you the same answer; however, I would point out, as Senator Carr has pointed out very clearly as well, that these are customs amendment bills. These are not a re-prosecution of something that has been addressed very extensively in the community. There have been 1,000 consultations. The parliament has had a look at it at least five times in committees. As you said yesterday, you have been through these issues many times over many years in many estimate processes. So if you would like to keep asking the same question over and over, you will keep getting the same response on these customs amendment bills. 


As I said, there are 22 clauses; they have been revoked; however, if the United States does come back in, those 22 have been examined and reported on by JSCOT. You and I both know well the process for treaties here in this parliament and also for consideration. But again, that is the process if the United States comes back in, but it would be an issue for Australian negotiators at the time. Of course, if there are any changes, it would come back to JSCOT. In terms of that, there is no more information I can provide at this time after having gone through it several times now.

After going to JSCOT, will it come back to parliament for ratification? That's what we're doing now, right? We are ratifying enabling legislation. Will there be separate enabling legislation for those 22 clauses? Will it come to parliament for ratification?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:18):  Senator Whish-Wilson, there is really not much more that I can add to this, because, as I've said—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Answer the question. Yes or no?




Senator REYNOLDS:
   Senator Whish-Wilson, you've asked the question. I will answer it—again and again. It follows the exactly the same standard treaty processes. JSCOT has looked at the current 22 clauses that have now been revoked. If—and again this is a hypothetical—the United States joins and all parties agree to proceed, then it would come back to JSCOT, but again it is hypothetical because, at that re-negotiation at some time in the future, the clauses could be amended, they could be updated, they could be changed. They would go through exactly the same standard treaty process that this has gone through in the first place.


I'm not sure how much clearer I can be that this is a—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  You could answer my question: does it come to parliament?'




Senator REYNOLDS:
  That's exactly the answer to your question. It follows the exact same process, Senator.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Is that a yes?

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:20):  I just want to add to what Senator Whish-Wilson is saying. I just want to point out to the minister that the name of this bill is the Customs Amendment (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership Implementation) Bill. This is the only opportunity for the parliament in its formal sense in the chamber to deal with the enabling of the TPP, and so I would ask that you give substantial latitude and be very cooperative. We're not talking about a customs act; we're talking about the acts of parliament that are required to enable an agreement that has taken a long time to negotiate and has been controversial. To come in here and then try to narrow this down to,' This is just a customs act' is in some sense disingenuous. I just wanted to state that. 


Following up from Senator Whish-Wilson's question so as not to create a hypothetical, would the actual terms, as they currently stand—and I understand you've been very helpful by saying it comes back to JSCOT and goes through the process—require some enabling legislation for the treaty to enter into force notwithstanding it comes back to JSCOT? Is there some enabling legislation, not hypothetically, but with the current terms?

These are both very clearly customs tariff amendment bills and they are customs bill. I would note—as I've noted on multiple occasions now with Senator Whish-Wilson—that the arguments have mostly been in here, and we have spent several hours now on these same issues over and over again. These are issues that don't go to the substance of the bill. 


It is absolutely your right to keep trying to re-prosecute the TPP-11 itself. There are other opportunities in estimates next week to go through these issues in more detail, which is probably the more appropriate forum, so that the Senate can get on with other business. However, the substantive question that you've just asked is a complete hypothetical because, as I've explained several times, it depends on: if this did come forward again, the United States joined and all parties agreed, they would have a look and reconsider these 22 clauses. If there are changes, they would come back through the process and go to JSCOT. If there was eventually legislation that came back here as part of those negotiations to change the agreements, of course it would come back through here because it would require the customs bills to be amended. But, again, I have nothing more to add to that because it is hypothetical and the normal parliamentary processes would apply.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:23):  This just shows what an absolute disgrace this whole process is that we can't even debate the TPP in the chamber today. That's what the minister is telling us: 'No, nothing to see here. You can't have any influence over it, so I'm not going to answer questions or deal with it properly in this place. Go and deal with it later in Senate estimates after the bill has passed.' No, it's not good enough, Minister. 


The Australian people have a right to have these questions answered before the chamber passes this legislation. It may be that the government feels very comfortable because the Labor Party has rolled over and backed in the TPP, so they've got the numbers. That does not mean that the public and the taxpayers deserve to be treated like mugs, and yet that is precisely what the government has tried to do throughout the three days of debate on this bill so far. Senator Whish-Wilson, Senator Patrick and I have all asked specifically what happens to these 22 clauses if the US comes back to the table. If it's a hypothetical, Minister, why are they simply on ice and not deleted?




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Very good point! Who puts suspended clauses in trade deals?




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  There is no need and no reason for these clauses to be suspended if, indeed, they're only hypothetical. They're sitting there on ice, ready to be warmed up the moment the US enter the fray. We all know that. That's what the public commentary from nations has been about across these negotiations. It'd be timely now to have some honesty, truth and courage from the government, to tell people the facts. The Australian government are prepared to see these clauses back in the TPP negotiations because they're not prepared to tell the US to pull their head in.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-10-17,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:25):  I think a little bit of history and perspective on this is really important. I think it's commonly accepted that the US—at least stakeholders and interests in the US—initiated the TPP. In my speech on the second reading, I talked a little bit about the failure of the Doha rounds and of multilateral trade deals leading towards 2006. When the TPP fell apart, the idea of a separate multilateral deal being led by the US in the Pacific region was initiated. It was supposed to be finished by 2012, but that was really when it actually started getting interesting, and here we are in 2018 with a version of it. But this was a US led deal. Obama put his signature on this and, of course, led it in the US Congress. He was its biggest champion. And, of course, President Trump made an election commitment that if he got elected—and let's be honest, most of us thought he wouldn't, but he did—he would tear up the TPP, which he has done.


To ignore that this is not a US-driven and US led multilateral trade and investment deal and to say that it's hypothetical that the US might or might not rejoin this deal at some time in the future really is ignoring history. Add that to what Senator Hanson-Young just pointed out: there are suspended clauses in the trade deal—how often do you have suspended clauses in a trade deal, especially a trade deal this size, that are sitting there, waiting?


May I just talk on some of the most egregious aspects of the original Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, especially in relation to things like intellectual property and monopoly pricing for medicines. Even the previous trade minister, Andrew Robb, took the US to task on the kinds of provisions they wanted to put in on the monopoly pricing of medicine. So those clauses are sitting there suspended, waiting to be re-engaged. It is an absolutely critical question to be asking the government at a point, here and now, when we're about to vote on the enabling legislation. Are we basically voting on a contingency for these to be automatically reactivated if the US rejoins the trade deal or, as the minister has pointed out, does it have to go through a process that ultimately involves a sovereign parliament? Remember, we were elected by the people of this country to make the laws and to scrutinise what the government does. That's what the Senate does. That's what we're doing here this morning, and it's extremely important.


Minister, your own government has stood up in here ad nauseam during question time for years talking about how big this deal is—the biggest trade deal in history, the biggest multilateral trade deal, 40 per cent of our economy is covered by it et cetera. As I said, there are 29-plus-plus chapters in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that literally cover every aspect of our life in this country. Just about every industry and every community is impacted by the TPP, and yet, as I pointed out last night—and I did lose my temper in here—you act as though you're insulted that we're asking questions. Considering the gravity of how important this bill is, how big this deal is and how it's taken 13 years to get to this point—it's extremely controversial, extremely complex and there are thousands of pieces of paper covering an incredible amount of detail—I personally think we could be in here asking you questions for days on this, considering how much detail there is and how many unknowns there still are.


I think you've made it very clear, Minister, that this will come back to parliament if the US rejoins the TPP. I did hear you say in your last statement to Senator Patrick 'only if there's legislation'. I want to narrow that down. I'm being very specific with my questions here. Will it require legislation? I know they may change the clauses and there may be negotiations with our negotiators about the 22 suspended clauses but, if those clauses stand, will they require legislation to be put into any new form of the TPP with US involvement? Will that require coming back to parliament or are we voting on a contingency now for them to be automatically re-engaged, as they are if there are no changes?

 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:31):  Senator Whish-Wilson, you have asked this several times. I have already answered it several times. Again I will reconfirm—hopefully, for the last time because I've now gone through this several times and I don't think it could be any clearer—that this process follows exactly the same treaty processes that the government has done for decades.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  I asked you a specific question. I would like an answer.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  I'll explain it to you. If you don't understand why your question is a hypothetical, let me walk you through why it is a hypothetical built on a hypothetical built on a hypothetical. The first hypothetical is that the United States will re-engage. That is a hypothetical. Then it requires all 11 parties to agree that these provisions will be reactivated and then it requires another hypothetical—that we would agree to any changes negotiated in the process from there. Again, it is the standard processes we have gone through under the current TPP negotiations and the TPP-11. It's no different to now. If legislation is required to amend custom tariff rates, legislation will come through. I cannot say it any clearer. What you are asking over and over again are hypothetical questions that cannot possibly be answered if and until all in this series of events arise.

Minister, speaking about hypotheticals, I haven't asked you if the US is going to rejoin. I haven't asked you if they are going to change their 22 suspended clauses. They would be hypothetical questions. I have actually asked you what the process is if they do. That is not a hypothetical question. It is an absolutely critical question. I have asked you about the status of these clauses as they are now. Perhaps I will phrase it a different way, Minister. Why are there 22 suspended clauses in this legislation that relate to the US? Why do we have suspended clauses? Why haven't they been removed?

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:38):  I want to bring the committee's attention to the Greens amendment that I moved a few minutes ago. This amendment deals with these most important issues that are lacking in the TPP. As has been pointed out numerous times by me and my colleagues in second reading speeches and also through the committee stage today and yesterday, we are extremely concerned that ISDS provisions remain in the TPP. We also are worried, of course, about the failure to include proper protections for Australian workers through labour market testing. 


So this amendment says that, until these issues are dealt with, the TPP would not be able to come into effect. It is the bare minimum that should be required by this chamber—the absolute bare minimum. We've just heard question after question after question that was put to the minister not being answered because of an even more concerning sign that there are 22 other clauses that are incredibly controversial, such as making cancer medication too expensive for cancer patients to access. That is the type of clause which has been simply left there on the side, ready to be activated at any point, and the minister is refusing to answer questions about why Australia allowed those clauses to stay in place. If the minister is going to continue to not answer those questions, we could at least get to fixing what should be the bare minimum for the TPP, and that is removing those ISDS provisions and putting in place some proper protections for Australian workers, which is what this Greens amendment on sheet 8529 does. 


Interestingly, these two particular issues—ISDS provisions and the labour market testing—are two things which we know the opposition say they are worried about, yet they are prepared to simply tick this TPP legislation through the chamber today without fixing them. There is a hollow promise that somehow, if Mr Bill Shorten were able to become Prime Minister, this would be magically dealt with. We know that that's not true. We know that the government of the day is not able to simply amend the TPP. We've heard the minister say that already today, that changes would need to be renegotiated across all parties. Australia would have to withdraw from the TPP before anything could be fixed. That's the truth. We've had that confirmed previously by the minister for trade. Here we have the Labor Party trying to wind up debate in this place today, shut down debate, because they're embarrassed that their own position is an absolute furphy. Their own position on this legislation is an absolute furphy. Why? Because they've got some in their party who think this shouldn't be a problem, that ISDS provisions are not a problem and that labour market testing is obviously not a problem, and they've got plenty of people inside their own camp who know that it is. 


This amendment put forward by the Greens would fix these things. We don't have to wait for Bill Shorten to become Prime Minister. We could fix it today. Of course, we're going to have Senator Carr jump up in a minute and be very angry at me for pointing this out. You watch. There will be bluster and fury. He's very good at thumping the desk when he is a bit grumpy about how things are going in this place. So I suspect that will happen, because the Labor Party have sold out Australian workers, because the Labor Party have rolled over to back in the TPP, to keep these insidious antidemocratic ISDS clauses in the TPP. They're lying to the Australian people by pretending that somehow it can be fixed if and when Bill Shorten becomes Prime Minister. It's a lie. It's a furphy. Not just the Australian union movement know it; but workers across the country know it too. 


I look forward to hearing the justification from the Labor opposition as to why they won't vote for this Greens amendment when it is part of their own party's national platform. I would like to also ask the minister, in light of this amendment, how the government is going to manage the chilling effect on regulation, given the existence of ISDS clauses in the TPP.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2018-10-17,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (10:44):  I've been called upon to respond, and I'm only too happy to respond. After all, it is only every second day that the Labor Party gets accused of being made up of liars! And Bill Shorten is accused by the Greens of seeking to mislead the Australian people. Of course, this is the party that has voted with the Liberal Party to undermine the entire environmental structures of this country. We could have had some decent environmental politics in this country; we could have had that—nearly 10 years now—if we had a party here that actually had some real principles and some real understanding of the way power is exercised in this country. But no: we're talking about the Australian Greens. We know just how irresponsible they are when it comes to jobs. We know just how extremely opportunistic they are when it comes to the welfare of the Australian working people, because that's the history of the Australian Greens. As we well know, the Australian Greens are centred on the most wealthy people in this country now. They've got the best social conscience that money can buy. What would you expect from people who live the life? They're only too happy to tell everyone else, with great moral authority, that they know more about how to live the good life than anyone else does.


When it comes to the question of the ISDS provisions, Labor does not support the inclusions. We've made that very clear. We have made it absolutely clear that this government has made a fundamental mistake in including these provisions in this agreement. We've made it very clear that this is a customs bill, that the treaty has been signed. And under the current procedures of this parliament, which we want to change—which we actually want to do something about, by getting a Labor government elected—we want to be able to transform the way in which treaties are undertaken in this country. But we have to acknowledge this fact: that under the current legal framework the treaty has been signed by the government, and what we have before us is a tariff bill that talks about the provisions with which we can change the tariff arrangements themselves.


We've also said that in the future we will prohibit—make legislative changes to stop—the inclusion of ISDS clauses in trade agreements. We will follow the example of the New Zealand Labour government and negotiate side letters to have these clauses removed and reinstate labour market testing should we be fortunate enough to get elected. And we make no assumptions about that. I've heard the Greens talk here as if the election's been already held and already resolved. We don't make any assumptions about those questions. What we do say is that we will be highly competitive at the next election, whenever that is, and we say it should be held very, very soon, because this country simply can't afford to have this government continue in office. But what we will not do is act in an irresponsible manner that is contrary to the national interest.


When the Liberals have made this terrible mistake with regard to this treaty arrangement, our manufacturers, our universities, our winemakers and our farmers shouldn't be made to pay for that mistake. Senator Hanson-Young's proposition would punish them for that mistake if we were to accept these propositions. We have a simple matter here, and I've made this point, but I guess there are some folks for whom you need to repeat things, because it takes a little while for it to sink in. In South Australia there are iron and steel workers at Whyalla who understand the importance of not being undermined by their political representatives. Their position in relation to Canada would be undermined by the proposition that you have put forward. There are, of course, workers in the wool industry. There are meatworkers across South Australia. There are people who work in the pork industry who, of course, would be faced with the advantage that would be given to Mexico under your arrangements, which would give Mexico a 20 per cent advantage in pork. There are people in the cotton industry, not to mention the South Australian wine industry, who would be seriously disadvantaged. I could go on. There's the seafood industry, which is particularly important in South Australia; horticulture; and, of course, cereals and grains. In all of these, advantages would be provided to the Canadians if we were to accept these amendments.



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator KIM CARR:
  You don't want the Canadians to get an advantage? You'd prefer the New Zealanders? You think this is a responsible course of action to take. You would provide the New Zealand cheesemakers with an advantage over Australian cheesemakers in this transitionary period. Do you want to put the Canadian and New Zealand beef farmers ahead of Australian beef farmers or workers, the people in those industries who are seeking to get access to the Japanese markets? Abattoirs are seeking to get access to the Japanese markets under these arrangements.


What the Labor Party says is pretty simple. This is a very flawed agreement. We acknowledge that. We are in the business of getting that fixed, but we won't do it at the expense of farmers, winemakers, cheesemakers, blue-collar workers, manufacturers or our universities. We want to see those people enter international markets on the same basis as their competitors in New Zealand and Canada. I would have thought that would be a pretty straightforward proposition.


So, when it comes to the question of why the Labor Party won't accept these irresponsible stunts that you're putting forward, I think it's very clear. There is no way the Labor Party is going to join with you in these stunts to undermine the living conditions of Australian workers in the manner which we've become all too accustomed to from the Greens. You think this will go unnoticed? You're making a bit of a mistake.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:53):  I want to get back to the question that I had for the minister that she still hasn't answered yet, but before I do I just want to say to Senator Carr: I know that you did stand up for workers in the automotive industry going back over a decade ago, when the tsunami of free trade was heading for this country, and I know that you personally have been involved with seeing thousands of workers and their families losing their jobs and their communities on the back of the free trade deals that this country has signed in the last 10 years. I know you're aware that there might be benefits to trade, but there are also costs. You're aware of that personally. What we're trying to do here today is minimise those costs.


The amendment that Senator Hanson-Young has put up does that up-front, but we know that if anything gets amended then the deal's off, which is really the irony of this whole situation. We're doing our job in here as senators, yet, because this deal is signed and sealed by the executive and by the government, often for political purposes, through a treaty process that's a couple of hundred years old and desperately needs to be upgraded, we can't actually amend this deal or make it better, because we would lose the whole thing.


Minister, it's extremely important that you answer my question from earlier, and I'll put it to you again. You haven't actually answered this bit. I'm asking about the process. It's not a hypothetical question. There are suspended clauses. I can't find any examples of where suspended clauses have appeared in any other trade deals, like they have in the TPP. If the US rejoins and the clauses are not changed, so they stay as they are, will there be a legislative process where it comes back to parliament for our ratification, or are we voting on the contingency of those clauses being immediately reactivated if the US rejoins? It's a critical question. Fine, legislation is required to change the customs duties and tariffs—we're all aware of that. But, as they are, these are in there as suspended clauses. If they're not changed and the US is happy with them, will there be any kind of legislative process where a sovereign parliament, in a country like Australia, will get to ratify those clauses becoming part of the TPP, or are they de facto already part of the TPP? It is the most important question I can ask you here today. Unfortunately, I don't have more time; I could do this for days, but I really want to know the answer to this question.

If—if!—the United States rejoins and if all 11 parties agree to what's already been agreed to in those clauses, it will come back to JSCOT, but then it would require, as I've had reconfirmed, custom amendment changes. And, as I've said previously, if that were the case, it would come back to parliament, as it has now. You can keep asking me the same question, Senator Whish-Wilson, but the answer will be the same.

 (South Australia) (10:57):  I predicted fire and fury from Senator Carr, and we got that, so obviously the Labor Party are still very tetchy about their position in relation to rolling over with the Morrison government on the TPP. I find it extraordinary that something that is Labor Party policy is now being decried in this place as irresponsible. This is the Labor Party's own policy, but they're selling out their members, they're selling out the unions and they're selling out Australian workers. We know that, because they think it's so bad that if they were to come into government they'd try to fix it. The problem is they can't. Once the TPP is in, it is in. We've already had confirmation from the minister that, in order to fix any of this down the track, Australia would have to withdraw and renegotiate. And that is simply the truth of the matter. It doesn't matter how many times or how angry or how embarrassed the Labor Party are, that's the fact. They can make as many promises as possible to fix things, but they are hollow and they are lies. With that, I ask that the question be put on my amendment so that we can get on to debating the next sections.

Senator Hanson-Young:
  Remove the ISDS provisions.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Yes. Getting 10 other countries to agree to removing things, including labour testing for employment and ISDS, would be incredibly difficult when they actually want it in the deal now. Minister, can you confirm that if Australia insisted on the removal of ISDS from the TPP, and insisted on labour market testing for foreign workers, it would voluntarily have to withdraw from the TPP if it refused that or changed legislation in Australia that made that impossible?

 (Queensland) (11:02):  A report that has been put out by the Parliamentary Library says it has been raised that these provisions mean that, when Australian governments make new laws or policy in the interests of Australian people, foreign investors can sue our government in international tribunals if they consider that those laws harm their investments or disadvantage them in some way. So you are saying it goes to a tribunal, that it does not go to an Australian law court whatsoever.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (11:05):  Senator, I'm seeking further advice on that, but it depends on what's in the treaty itself. We'll get some more information on that. One thing I would like to point out and remind the chamber of in relation to the ISDS—something that we've discussed in great depth here over the last couple of days—is that this is reciprocal. Senator Hanson, this might allay some of your concerns. This is equally important for Australian businesses engaging overseas. For example, Australian mining companies want ISDS provisions in any future Indonesian free trade agreement because they provide certainty for those businesses themselves. Again, I think it's important to remember that this is not just an issue for others; it is an issue for us. In fact, in the negotiations on the Indonesia-Australia free trade agreement, the Indonesian government said that they want to have the ISDS to provide foreign investors, including Australian investors, with greater certainty in terms of doing business in Indonesia.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:08):  The final question I might have on ISDS is a question I raised with Senator Birmingham, and he was working towards an answer. In the event that a corporation here in Australia feels that they have been, in some way, disadvantaged because of a change of public policy or a change of law—I just want to make it very clear—I understand that they have the right to go to our courts to seek a remedy. This question does not relate to companies' rights to go to a court. It's clear under the ISDS provisions that a multinational corporation here in Australia can invoke ISDS provisions. My question is specifically related to an Australian company that feels that they need to be compensated in some way. Can an Australian company invoke an ISDS application in respect of a change of public policy, equal to what an international company can do?

You can keep asking these questions in this place, as is your right, but they are not relevant to the legislation at this point. If you would like to have some discursive policy debate and discussion, we can continue to do so, but it is not relevant to the bill at hand, and many of those issues have been dealt with in now over eight hours of debate and discussion on these two customs bills.

If this government has not made a decision on who is going to be on that panel then it is pathetic and this whole treaty needs to be questioned fully. You are saying it's hypothetical. You have put it in there. That's what I heard yesterday: 'It's hypothetical. This may never happen. We've had these agreements for the last 20 or 30 years, we've been challenged only once and that was not successful.' If that is the case then why have we signed up to it, when the New Zealand Prime Minister has written a side letter to say that they are not going to be bound by the ISDS, yet Australia is adamant on having this in? If it's not that important then write a side letter and don't allow any multinational company to sue us in the case that they may be able to.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (11:13):  I would point you and perhaps your staff to chapter 9 of the TPP document, which we can provide or is available on the internet. It explains the processes in detail. I think one of the misunderstandings implicit in your question is that this is not a standing panel or body, so it does not exist. It is a process that can be invoked, should it be needed and Australia and whatever other party were in agreement that this panel would be set up. At that point then they would go through a process of agreeing to and appointing panel members, but the panel does not yet exist; it is just a theoretical process. Again, if you like, we can provide you with chapter 9, the investment chapter. The process for this is clearly laid out in that chapter. That goes to the heart of Senator Patrick's questions as well. Senator Patrick, you're clearly, by the tone of your questions, very well aware of that chapter and the provisions within it. So, again, we can provide it to both of you, but it is publicly available information on how that process would be invoked if it were ever necessary. That's why it is a hypothetical, Senator Hanson—because it is just something to be invoked should both parties agree in future.

In some sense, we're interested in the rules.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (11:16):  Senator Hanson, again, when you were in the chamber yesterday these questions were asked and answered in great detail. That does come under the labour market testing provisions of the treaty, which again we can provide to you. Experience is very important. These labour market testing provisions are not new. They are already in a number of other treaties. I understand community concerns. This is certainly an issue that the unions are very vocal about. But, when you have a look at the facts, for the Japan, China and South Korea free trade agreements, which are subject to LMT provisions, the evidence is that 457 visa numbers for those three countries actually dropped by 10 per cent after the introduction of those LMT provisions. So these are not new. The processes are the same, and, despite fears that this will lead to Australian workforces and workers being overrun, the evidence is simply not there.

 (Queensland) (11:17):  Minister, you may say that there is no fear, and of course your 457 visa numbers have actually dropped. Yes, I agree with you that they have. But the thing is, if you say it's not a problem, why put it into the treaty? If it goes on labour market testing and if we need the workers, then why was it necessary to put in the treaty, as with the Indonesian treaty and the China free trade agreement as well, that they could actually bring in 5,000 workers over a period of time? If it is based on labour market testing, why put any numbers in it at all?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (11:18):  Senator Hanson, as I answered in response to questions from Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Whish-Wilson—and I believe you were in the chamber for some of that yesterday—because this is a treaty, these are reciprocal arrangements, so they apply equally to Australians working in companies engaged in arrangements with some of our treaty partners. This is not just an issue about workers coming into Australia. It is also important because we cannot request that or expect that of our own workers, for our own companies, if we don't have some reciprocal arrangements.


I do have some further detail for you, Senator Hanson, in relation to your question about what the commitments are. Australia's temporary entry commitments are limited to businesspeople from parties to the TPP-11, and they provide similar access to Australian businesspersons in equivalent categories. So Australia has committed to providing access for TPP-11 businesspersons to stay and work in Australia, but, again, they are quite defined categories. For contractual service suppliers it's one year, with a possibility of extension. For investors and independent executives it's up to two years. For intracorporate transferees, which is a fancy way of saying executives and senior managers, it's an initial four years, with a possibility of extension. For specialists it's a two-year stay, with the possibility of extension; and for installers and servicers it's up to three months. Spouses and dependants are granted entry to accompany executives and contractual service suppliers. So it is very specific, it is very limited and it is focused on business and executives and their spouses. It's not a free-for-all. It is very specific. And, as you can see, there are different time frames for different categories of business visas and engagements.

 (Queensland) (11:20):  Thank you very much for that answer. I have with me the customs tariff amendment comprehensive TPP bill 2018. I'm reading through this and I'm trying to find answers to this. The whole customs tariff book is based on the customs tariff, because it is customs tariffs. But all it says is—I'll pick one out, item No. 80: 2710.19.53, and it's got $0.412/L. It doesn't say anything about what it actually is. And then you've got here in tariffs, from 1 January—all free. It doesn't state what's free. It doesn't tell me anything, looking at this book—what is free. So, we've got pages and pages of items coming into Australia, no tariffs—it's free. Where do I get the answer to this? What impact are these imports going to have on Australian producers, farmers and manufacturing industries in this nation? How much more industry and manufacturing are we going to destroy in this country by getting rid of tariffs—the one thing that actually helped our businesses here to compete with countries that are paying only a few dollars a day to their workers?

I've got some specific information, because now I understand that you're talking about the amendments to the Customs Tariff Act. But what I would say is that there's a number of documents that can help you and your staff in relation to this. The first one is the explanatory memorandum, which does actually provide the detail, because the bill is—as you say, it is a very technical amendment to the act itself. The explanatory memorandum does have that information.


But I think I can short-circuit some of that more detailed information for you. The customs tariff amendment bill will make the following three major changes: first, it provides preferential rates of customs duty for all goods, excluding excise equivalent goods, that are determined to be originating within the new part of the act; second, it inserts new schedules to provide for excise equivalent rates of customs duty on certain alcohol, tobacco and fuel products and for phasing rates of customs duty in accordance with our treaty obligations; and, third, it amends certain concessional items in schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act to maintain customs duty rates in line with applicable concessional items. I would refer you to the explanatory memorandum, because that is the technical explanation of the technical bill that you're having a look at. What you're looking at is quite technical, because it is actually the wording to amend the act, whereas the explanatory memorandum explains it. I would also refer you to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report on these bills, which goes into some detail about what the customs amendment and customs tariff amendment bills are all about.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR

):  The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Hanson-Young on sheet 8529 be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (11:32):  In respect of the Customs Amendment (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership Implementation) Bill 2018, I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 8530:


(1) Clause 2, page 2 (cell at table item 2, column 2), omit the cell, substitute:






 






If the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans‑Pacific Partnership, done at Santiago, Chile on 8 March 2018, enters into force for Australia—the first day that another Act is in force that includes provisions with the effect that Australia must not defend an action brought against Australia under an investor‑state dispute settlement provision of any treaty unless the Parliament has agreed to the defence.


However, the provisions do not commence at all unless all of the events mentioned in this item occur.






 













[commencement]



Given the failure, sadly, of the amendment just now because the Labor Party refused to be an opposition and voted with the government to tick through the TPP—despite the fact that that amendment was simply instating the Labor Party's own policies; take that as you will—this amendment ensures that any need for funds to fight an ISDS clause would have to come before the parliament. It also ensures that there is proper transparency around how taxpayer funds are being spent in defending our sovereignty and our laws and regulations against multinationals. Given we now have a TPP agreement with locked-in ISDS provisions, it is absolutely essential that the Australian people know what this is costing us and what the impact is, and that transparency prevails. This is about ensuring that the government can't paper over what they've just agreed to; that the Labor Party, either in opposition or in government, can't pretend that this isn't having a chilling effect; and that taxpayer money being spent on it is accounted for, and sunlight is shone in places where, we know, both sides of this place would prefer it not to be.


While I've been on my feet speaking, it has been just fascinating to see the minister in negotiations with the Labor Party. It just proves what a cuddly, convenient relationship we have now between the two parties in this place, with the Labor Party and the coalition selling out Australian democracy: selling out the rights of the Australian people to have laws and regulations that protect their health, protect the environment and look after their best interests. Meanwhile, Labor and the coalition are passing legislation that puts the interests of big multinational companies first. That's what they're more interested in doing. How can they shut down debate today? How can they make sure that power remains with the big corporates rather than with the Australian people? 


I urge all in this place to support this amendment now that the Labor Party have rolled over with the government to lock in these provisions which would allow multinational companies to sue the Australian people over regulations and laws that perhaps the public want because they know they are in their best interests. At the very least, the government of the day needs to be transparent about how much this is going to cost and what is on foot. It's a transparency measure. There should be nothing to be afraid of. But, of course, the proof will be in the pudding. We'll see the Labor Party and the coalition vote it down because they don't want the public to know just how bad this TPP deal really is.

 (Tasmania) (11:36):  I want to reflect on the comments that were made previously by Senator Hanson, who raised a very good point. In these trade debates, if you like to call them debates—in the spin around promoting free trade deals, which has happened since Mr Tony Abbot was elected in 2013 and we've seen an avalanche of bilateral trade deals; bilateral trade deals being trade deals between two countries—it is fascinating how the government will line up. They come in here at question time and quote their numbers—and Senator Carr has just done it in his statement to the chamber—about all the benefits that our exporters are going to receive when foreign countries allow increased access to their markets. But never in the debate do we talk about the costs of free trade deals. There are costs. Every economist acknowledges it. Those costs need to be weighed up in the debate, in the matter of public interest, against the benefits. That's how we assess whether a trade deal, or a trade investment deal like the TPP, is in our national interest. 


It's fundamentally dishonest that we never talk about the impacts of these deals on our local producers, on our local manufacturers and on our local farmers. I can tell you that campaigns such as 'buy Australian', 'buy Australian beef' and 'buy Australian seafood' have triggered state-to-state dispute settlements in previous trade deals like NAFTA, where US beef and Canadian beef—pardon the pun—had a major beef over a 'buy local' campaign. These trade deals make it extremely difficult for us to support local businesses or for governments to subsidise or provide assistance to local businesses and local industries. That's why we saw the loss of tens of thousands of Australian car workers. It has mainly been a slow decline, but it has been very rapid in the last five years as this Liberal government has signed an avalanche of free trade deals—mostly to get a headline and a press opportunity. I haven't seen any evidence that these deals have benefited our local exporters, but I can tell you that I hear all the time about how difficult it is for local farmers, producers and manufacturers to compete with cheap foreign products. That is what Senator Hanson asked. What access are we giving away and selling down the river? Who are we selling down the river? 


You may remember that the Korean free trade deal was called by the media, very cynically, 'the cars for cows deal'. In other words, we sold out our car industry to get increased access for our beef farmers. Let's just look at that example. If that's true, and I believe it was the case, who makes that decision? Who is the high, almighty arbiter of the fact that we are going to kill the car industry, its intellectual property and the decades of communities and workers who have grown up in those communities, as well as the ability to make our own cars and all the other ramifications that go with that? Who makes the decision that we sell out an entire industry and that we will trade that off against increased access for our beef farmers?


When you deal with bilateral deals, any economist will tell you that any simple input-output model, or any other economic model, can't accurately predict the benefits of those deals. That's because you end up stealing trade off other countries who you don't have bilateral deals with. I'm not going to give everyone in here a lecture on economics, but that's why, in theory, multilateral deals—like the deals we saw through the WTO, which fell apart after the Doha rounds—are the only kinds of deals that do bring net economic benefits. These bilateral deals and these multilateral deals don't. It is a really important point when we're about to vote very soon on this massive sellout of Australian interests—and for what? We need to consider the costs. They need to be properly quantified. No-one wants to talk about it in the public debate. It's absolutely our role here in the Senate to bring balance to this debate and to raise these issues with you, Assistant Minister.


I had a couple of quick questions for you in relation to the environmental chapter. It was welcome when the environment chapter in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement was negotiated. The environment chapter is chapter 20. There's a section in there that relates to the protection of cetaceans. I just wanted to ask you, given the importance of protecting cetaceans under Australian law, what ability we will have in the use of the TPP—presuming it's going to be ratified by this parliament very soon—and how that chapter will enable us to stop Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean, considering Japan has been the leader of this TPP-11 that we have before us here today. When the US pulled out, it was the Japanese Prime Minister, Prime Minister Abe, who reignited and reinvigorated the push for the TPP-11.


We saw, just a week or two ago, that the Japanese government was threatening to pull out of the International Whaling Commission, a rules based order around whaling that Australia showed leadership in over 35 years ago by banning commercial whaling. How will we be able to use this environment chapter in the TPP to hold the Japanese government to account if they go down to our Southern Ocean and start slaughtering whales on an industrial, commercial scale? That is what their stated intention is. I'd like to know how we can actually use this chapter to stop that from happening.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (11:43):  I think I've just discovered why some of these questions are coming from my Greens colleagues. You said that this will be ratified shortly. This is actually a treaty that was ratified back in March of this year, and these are two customs enabling bills. You just said it hasn't been ratified yet. Well, it has been ratified. That might perhaps explain the misdirected nature of some of these questions. Again, as you acknowledged, this is in chapter 20 of the treaty. You obviously have a copy of the treaty and of that chapter. These questions have absolutely no direct relevance to these two customs bills at all. So perhaps, Chair, I might ask, in that case, if I could just get your opinion of whether these questions are in order, because they relate to a treaty that was ratified in March of this year. We have now spent nearly 10 hours on debate in this chamber on the same questions over and over again—on questions which actually relate to a treaty that has been ratified and which are not relevant to the bills here today. Chair, if I could ask for your guidance.



The CHAIR:  It is a broad-ranging debate. The senator was asking for your view on the impact of that treaty on a free trade agreement, and I believe that you've answered that question.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (11:45):  I would say they're trying to distract away from that question. This is chapter 20. I won't say you deliberately misled the chamber then, Minister, but what we're doing today is ratifying this in parliament. You've signed this deal. Your executive has ratified it, but parliament hasn't ratified it yet. That's exactly why we're here today. That's what I would say a vote on the legislation is. But it's an attempt to actually distract away from the critical issue about which I asked you, which, by the way, is a question that hasn't been answered. And I'm sure you'd expect me, as a Greens senator, to be asking this question.


This environmental chapter was put in the TPP to try to bring civil society on board with the TPP. I've been following it long enough to know that's the case. It was designed to bring in environment groups, as were the other chapters in there around slave labour and wildlife trade. There's a whole array of stuff in here. As I mentioned earlier, it covers just about every aspect of life in every country that's signing up to this, and it is part of what we are ratifying as a parliament. You are giving effect to the customs and tariff side of this. That's what actually makes this treaty come into effect. But it is all the same. So this is absolutely critical, and I ask you again: is there a binding clause in here? Is it the purpose of this environmental chapter that Australia can take action against the Japanese government if they go down into the Southern Ocean this summer or next summer and resume commercial whaling, which has been banned for over 35 years? Will this actually allow us, as a country, within our relationship in the TPP-11, to take action against the Japanese government?

 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (11:47):  Senator Whish-Wilson, we are again well and truly foraying into the world of the hypothetical.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  What's it in there for then?




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Senator Whish-Wilson, if you're going to ask me a question, please allow me to answer the question. Again, I'll provide the same answers that I've provided over probably seven hours of questioning on the same issues. This is a treaty that has been signed. We are now dealing, before this chamber, with the customs bills to fully enable our agreements. In relation to the issues in chapter 20 that you're talking about—the environmental considerations—the parliament has had ample opportunity to debate this. Over the course of the last two years, the provisions of the TPP have been debated, and I've gone through the various inquiries in this chamber already. I think there have been at least five parliamentary inquiries. There have been over a thousand consultations with 485 separate organisations, which is incredibly comprehensive. It is the most comprehensive engagement and parliamentary debate on any treaty that Australia has ever been party to.


We've already dealt with a range of these issues over and over again in over seven hours of debate in this place. You and I both know that the questions you just asked are far more appropriate for next week's Senate estimates process. But, again, go back and have a look at your own remarks in Hansard, Senator Whish-Wilson. You have already acknowledged that you have raised these issues in multiple estimates committees over multiple years, so it's not like you and the Greens have not had ample opportunity to get engaged and involved and to debate these issues. You have. We can sit here for the next several hours—I think it's taken 10 hours of the Senate's time already—and it's your right to keep us talking about the same things over and over again, but, ultimately, you are reprosecuting a treaty that was signed in March. These are customs amendment and customs tariff amendment bills. There is nothing that I have not repeated over and over again. If you keep asking the same questions, I will keep giving you the same answers, because the answers do not change, even if you do not like them.

We can vote against this enabling legislation, which would mean the whole thing falls apart. Minister, why would I want to prosecute the case in estimates next week, when the deal would have already been voted on and passed into law? Now is the opportunity for these issues to be raised. By the way, I actually haven't read the final text, because it has changed so many times. I was involved in this for the previous TPP. Senator Hanson-Young has done a fantastic job as our trade spokesperson since then. I am asking you now. I have looked at this and I'm looking at the detail right in front of me. I would like you and your advisers to tell me how this chapter will help us hold the Japanese government to account if they begin illegal commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean. Considering there is a section on mammal and cetacean protection, do we have binding agreements in here? What action can we take? Is it a state-to-state process? What is the process that we can use? Or is this environmental chapter, essentially, just platitudes? Is there nothing in here that we can actually use to bind another country's actions around the protection of mammals like whales, which, as you know, are very important to the Australian people?

That said, I find it inconceivable that you don't understand that these are two separate processes.

We're about to enter into an agreement with Japan, along with 10 other countries in our region, that covers a whole range of impacts. What in here will allow us to hold the Japanese government to account? If you don't believe that's the case, then just say so. Please answer the question.

Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Senator Whish-Wilson, please don't feign ignorance. You know the difference. You are probably more familiar with the international whaling activities we take and the processes than just about anybody else in this chamber. They are not linked. They are two separate processes.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (11:53):  Of course the International Whaling Commission is a separate process. The TPP has a chapter so that 11 countries can cooperate on protecting mammals and cetaceans. That's my question: what in this chapter will allow the Australian government—hopefully—to put pressure on the Japanese government to stop killing whales? Why even have a chapter that includes the protection of whales in a multilateral agreement if it's not going to actually work? A corporation or a government can sue another government for a breach of rules and regulations around economic factors when it affects their profits. Why even have a chapter in the TPP if we can't have binding agreements that have consequences on matters in relation to things like wildlife trade and the protection of cetaceans?

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-17,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:55):  I put on the record that I am very concerned about the signing and ratifying of the TPP-11. The United States and President Trump saw no reason to be involved in this and they've pulled out, so there are grave concerns. I will make comments on why I'm concerned about it. There was a free trade agreement with America signed by the Liberal Party in 2004 and ratified with support from the Labor Party. It came into effect in January 2005. Under that free trade agreement, from day one, Australia got rid of all its tariffs. America negotiated for its industries such as beef, horticulture and other areas to keep their tariffs on Australian exports into that country for between 11 and 18 years. That was for beef, horticulture, wine, steel, cotton and sheep. That was not a good deal for Australia. So it really concerns me when free trade agreements are signed off without being debated in this chamber and without the people of Australia being allowed to have a say in any of these treaties and agreements.


I can understand why you are saying it's a good thing—because we will be able to export our products to other countries around the world—and I'm sure a lot of people are very happy about that, especially in industry and the farming sector. My concern here is that in Australia we have a problem with multinationals paying their taxes. There are over 700 multinational companies in Australia that pay no tax at all. I hear the same old rhetoric from the government: 'We are addressing that and we are reining it in.' Under this free trade agreement, you are opening up the gates for multinational companies to come here, and they will be able to bring in their workers. My question to you is: if we are going to open it up to more multinational companies to come into Australia and work here, what is the government doing to ensure that they will pay their taxes here in Australia and not add to the over 700 companies already that pay no taxes in Australia, which costs the Australian taxpayer?

I think most of that was a comment rather than a question, but, in relation to paying tax, I think that is a perfect question for Senator Cormann in question time, because any companies operating here would be subject to exactly the same laws and enforcement on taxation and all other regulations. The issue you raise is one of enforcement under Australian law and is not directly relevant to this bill here today, but it is a good question, and I would encourage you to take that up with Minister Cormann.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:59):  I want to talk a little bit about ratification, because I heard the exchange between Senator Whish-Wilson and the minister. I just want to repeat a point that Mr Mina of DFAT, who is an expert in this field, made in his public testimony:


The second point is simply to note that three countries—Japan, Singapore and Mexico—have all ratified. Three more need to ratify for the agreement to enter into force. Developments are gathering apace in five other countries—


and he mentions them. He continued:


It is very possible that, if Australia isn't an early mover on ratification, we will not make one of the first six … We do, therefore, commend early ratification to the committee, and we're looking forward to answering any further questions you may have today.


There seems to be some confusion. I put it to you that Mr Mina is an expert in this field. He is very well respected. But this treaty, I presume, hasn't been ratified on the basis of the testimony of Mr Mina.


Moving on next to the point about relevance to the bill, again, this bill is enabling legislation for a treaty and it's very normal in committee stage to deal with consequences of bills, including consequences that are not directly related to the bill. Pretty much everything is in order when we're talking about the TPP.


In the government's consideration of the agreement, once again, after many years I'm sure that the government has done its due diligence on this. It is clear, in respect of labour market testing, that there are about 450 professions that could be covered by the term 'contractual service supplier'. And I note that, for those contractual service suppliers, we don't have to have labour market testing. They can simply come to Australia under the agreement and take the role of an Australian worker without testing. What analysis did the government do in terms of the numbers of likely foreign workers that would come to this country without that testing?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech
"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2018-10-17,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (12:01):  Thank you very much, Senator Patrick, for your several questions wrapped up into the one. The first one I'd like to address is that article that you were talking about. Again, I think there is a bit of danger in reading bits and pieces, so what I'd like to do, perhaps, is go through with you the risks of not ratifying quickly and wrap up some of those issues. In that context, analysis reveals Australian industries would be at immediate disadvantage if we fail to ratify the TPP-11.


In terms of the process, it will enter into force 60 days after six countries have ratified the agreement. Japan, Singapore and Mexico, as I've said previously in this place, have all ratified. New Zealand and Canada are close to ratifying. They have almost finished their own domestic processes. After ratification, New Zealand and Canada would receive an 11 per cent tariff cut for their fresh beef exports to Japan next year, giving them a tariff rate of 2.2 per cent, which is lower than our current preferential treatment under our free trade agreement with Japan. This is significant given the value of all our beef exports to Japan is over $2 billion a year. That would be giving New Zealand and Canada a significant preferential advantage over our own beef producers right here in Australia.


Senator Carr has already identified this as well in the chamber, but I'm very happy to keep going through this with you. It is not only the beef industry. The New Zealand wine industry would gain an edge over our own domestic industry. The Canadian wine industry, which is growing, would also have significant advantages with the elimination of Canada's tariff, which on wine is currently 4.68c a litre, upon entering into force of the TPP. Again, that's a significant disadvantage to us potentially, because our wine exports to Canada were valued at nearly $200 million last financial year.


We've got beef, we've got wine and we've also got dairy. Under the Japanese free trade agreement the tariff rates on our cheddar cheese exports into Japan currently sit at nearly 30 per cent. On ratification of the TPP-11 New Zealand and Canada would have their tariff rates immediately cut to 27.9 per cent, obviously less than ours. Again, that gives them a competitive advantage over our dairy producers, because Australia's tariff rate would continue to remain at nearly 30 per cent.


We've got beef, we've got wine and we've got dairy. Also, Australian exports of iron and steel to Vietnam are currently worth $146 million a year. If Australia is not amongst the first six countries in the TPP-11 and Vietnam is, then Australian iron ore and steel exporters will be at a significant disadvantage to their Japanese steelmaking competitors—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  It sounds hypothetical to me.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  I'll take that interjection. This is not hypothetical, this is a reality. That is what will happen under these agreements. Again, if Senator Whish-Wilson had actually read this material, he would understand that that is the case and this is an issue that is directly relevant to these customs and customs tariff amendment bills here today. But that's not it; there is more, Senator Patrick, in terms of disadvantage for Australia. Australia would receive enhanced quota volumes for wheat and barley. Canada would receive an additional 40,000 tonnes of wheat exports into Japan—again, a significant disadvantage for Australian farmers. Australia's exports of wheat and barley to Japan were worth over half a billion dollars last financial year. So, again, there will be tangible and specific disadvantages for a number of Australian industries if we are not in that first six. The TPP-11 will eliminate all remaining tariffs on Australian raw wool exports to TPP-11 countries from entry into force. Australian wool exports to TPP-11 countries are valued at $35 million and growing.


Finally, the TPP-11 links Australia with some of the world's major automotive producers, including Japan, Mexico and Canada, and we would not have preferential access to these markets for our steel products. Senator Patrick, again, the facts are very clear, and I welcome these questions on this issue because they are directly relevant to these bills and the consequence of not passing these bills.

 (South Australia) (12:07):  Minister, you are talking about the consequences of this treaty entering into force, and that's a very appropriate thing to do in this debate. But we shouldn't just talk about the positives; we also need to talk about the negatives—and I think that's what we have been doing and trying to do. Minister, you indicated to Senator Whish-Wilson that the treaty has been ratified when in actual fact it hasn't.



Senator Reynolds interjecting—




Senator PATRICK:
  No, I understand. It has been signed but it hasn't been ratified—and I note that, in your answer, you conceded that. I just wanted to make that relatively clear. We support free trade. We're just trying to deal with the unintended consequences—or maybe the intended negative consequences—and just trying to understand the magnitude of that consequence in order to make an informed decision about whether we allow legislation that would bring this agreement into force. I was asking questions about labour market testing. We know that, under this agreement, there are up to 450 categories of workers who may come in from overseas to fulfil a particular role for a multinational corporation. In the analysis and deliberations that took place, was there any measurement, modelling or calculation done as to how many workers per annum—assuming the treaty was being used effectively and benefits were flying on both sides—the government expects to come into the country as a result of this agreement?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (12:07):  I would again note a couple of things in relation to this. The labour market testing and the issues around that have been answered by you and others over many hours. So, in terms of the substance of that, I'll again point you to Hansard. Your specific question, which again is not relevant to these bills, relates to the debate before we signed the treaty back in March. Again, I'll point out that that is a discursive discussion better suited for estimates next week. However, as the senator well knows, that is almost a hypothetical, because it is market driven. So the government cannot tell you exactly how many, just as we couldn't with the Japanese, South Korean and Chinese free trade agreements because it is—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  But you can tell us how much diverted trade there's going to be.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  I know the Greens have no concept of what 'market driven' means, but Senator Patrick does. You know very well, Senator Patrick, that this is market driven. And you were in the chamber when I gave this answer to Senator Hanson. To get some indication, if you go back and look at the three free trade agreements—with Japan, South Korea and China—you will find that, since they were ratified, 457 visa numbers for those countries have fallen. While we cannot tell you a precise number, as you well know—because it is market driven—if you would like to go into the treaty policy analysis of cabinet, that is something you can ask the minister in estimates next week and have a much more discursive discussion, which is not relevant to these bills here today.

 (South Australia) (12:10):  I do understand the concept of 'market driven'; I was referring to discussions that may have taken place during the deliberations in respect of the treaty. Surely the government, as they were going through the machinations of considering the terms of the bill, would have looked at this and said, 'What does that mean for Australia?' I don't necessarily expect them to be right, because, as you correctly say, they're market driven. But it is not so much a hypothetical as it is an issue of fact. During the deliberations, when the Australian government was working on this agreement, did it ever look at the numbers of workers that it thought might come in as a result of the treaty coming into force?

As you well know, those are questions about policy development and implementation that the parliament has had five opportunities that I'm aware of to ask and have answered, including in many Senate estimates, which I know you have been involved in. Again, you and I both know these are not questions for this session. If you want to keep asking about issues of policy that don't relate in any way to the substance of these customs bills, I can only keep providing the same answer: that is not relevant to this discussion, because, as you know, it is self-evident. No matter how calmly and nicely you ask these questions and pad them out, the answer is still the same, Senator Patrick: government considers these questions in the course of any treaty negotiation and process. The parliament has had ample opportunity over the last two years in this most debated, discussed and reviewed treaty process. If you want to ask questions about that process again in relation to these bills, I again suggest you raise them directly with the minister either in question time or, more appropriately, in estimates next week.

 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (12:14):  Good grief! You are now having a lend of this chamber. You implied—in fact, you didn't imply; you said—I was seeking to gag debate in any way. We've had nearly 10 hours in this chamber in the second reading debate and probably at least seven hours on these same issues over and over again, which have been asked and answered many times. Many of the questions are completely irrelevant to this bill. You can ask these questions, as is your right. All of your colleagues in this chamber, the government and the opposition are according you the courtesy of allowing you to filibuster on this bill. And we will keep answering the questions. As long as you keep asking the questions, we will keep answering them, but the answers will be no different. You well know that these issues that you're raising now are not issues in relation to this bill or issues for this chamber at this time. But, of course, we will accord you the respect of allowing you to keep doing what you're doing. We're here to answer your questions as they're relevant.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:15):  Minister, you just accused me of being patronising a few minutes ago. Your idea is that somehow we are filibustering and trying to waste the committee's time by asking really important questions about supposedly the biggest multilateral trade and investment deal this country has ever signed. It has taken 13 years to get to this point. It has been highly controversial and extremely complex, and we still don't feel like we've got any answers out of this. I think you need to take on board that, if you're hearing similar questions repeated by various senators, it is probably because you didn't answer them in the first place.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (12:23):  by leave—I move Centre Alliance amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 8523 together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 3, page 8 (after line 6), at the end of Subdivision A, add:




153ZKUA


Cessation of effect of Division



 This Division ceases to have effect on 1 January 2020 unless all of the following come into force for Australia before that day:


(a) bilateral side letters exchanged between Australia and each other Party agreeing that Chapter 9 of the Agreement, which deals with investor-State disputes, does not apply in relation to an investment in Australia by an investor of the other Party;


(b) bilateral side letters exchanged between Australia and each other Party agreeing that labour market testing must occur in relation to contractual service suppliers entering, or proposing to enter, Australia from the other Party.




[sunsetting]



(2) Schedule 1, item 4, page 19 (after line 18), at the end of Division 4EB, add:




126AKM


Cessation of effect of Division



 This Division ceases to have effect on 1 January 2020 unless all of the following come into force for Australia before that day:


(a) bilateral side letters exchanged between Australia and each other Party agreeing that Chapter 9 of the Agreement, which deals with investor-State disputes, does not apply in relation to an investment in Australia by an investor of the other Party;


(b) bilateral side letters exchanged between Australia and each other Party agreeing that labour market testing must occur in relation to contractual service suppliers entering, or proposing to enter, Australia from the other Party.




[sunsetting]



I want to point out that the objective of this amendment is to include a sunset clause so that unless bilateral side letters are exchanged relating to ISDS provisions and labour market testing by 1 January 2020 this legislation is repealed. We believe that these amendments will allow the TPP-11 to enter into force but signal to other countries that Australia is planning to remove the ISDS clauses and reinstate labour market testing. If those arrangements haven't been made, the legislation will then be repealed.


These amendments give effect to the TPP. In that sense, they address the concerns raised by Senator Farrell in his statement yesterday, where he said that he was concerned that our exporters would miss out on a second tariff cut on 1 April 2019 for Japanese markets. That would give Canada and New Zealand an 11 per cent tariff cut on beef, making their rate lower than Australia's and hurting our beef producers. Our cheddar cheese producers would lose out to New Zealand, who would have a tariff rate four per cent lower than Australia's, et cetera.


Senator Carr, of course, raised some concerns about what would happen if we didn't enter into the TPP now. We respect those concerns. These amendments accommodate the Labor Party's announced intention to make sure that those provisions are removed, except that they provide a guarantee that is beyond Labor's control: if they are not elected next year, these sunset provisions will come into effect. That will, in effect, nullify our ratification and will keep their constituents—the unions and the hardworking Australians who vote for the Labor Party—happy. We would encourage Labor, in this instance, to support this.


I know a concern was raised by Senator Farrell that this may put in place an artificial deadline. Let's presume that the Labor Party were to form government next year and were to commence negotiations. If they felt that for some reason they weren't going to hit the deadline that was imposed by these amendments, I can then assure the Labor Party that we would be very open to a change. In good faith, they could come to us—or Senator Griff and myself, at the very least—and we would perhaps support a change to give more time for the Labor Party to have either these cancerous provisions removed or the labour market testing restored. In that context, I urge the Labor Party to support these amendments that not only are consistent with their national platform but are consistent with the plan that Mr Shorten has announced and made a commitment to in respect to their constituents.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2018-10-17,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (12:45):  The announcement by the Prime Minister to investigate the possibility of relocating the Australian embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv is to be applauded. Every sovereign nation has the right to determine the capital and its seat of government. Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East that abides by the rule of law, is slighted by elements of the world community not recognising its designated capital. It would be like countries saying to Australia, 'We don't recognise Canberra'—for whatever reason—'and, therefore, we will place our embassy in Goulburn.' No slight to Goulburn. I'm sure it's a great city and town in the state of New South Wales—




Senator Molan:
  Indeed it is.




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Molan agrees, so I'm glad I have that support in this debate. It is important to recognise that a sovereign nation has the right to determine its national capital. So I'm delighted that there is now a move within the world community to right this wrong. It is a move that has been discussed for a long time, and countries as diverse as Guatemala, Paraguay, the Czech Republic, Romania, Honduras and, indeed, the United States have engaged in this discussion.


In relation to the United States it is very informative to look at the history. The history is that former President Bill Clinton made the promise that he would move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. President George W Bush, through his two terms, also made that promise. And guess who else made that promise? It was none other than President Barack Obama, through his two terms. The two houses of Congress have passed motion after motion for over two decades supporting this move. And, yet, interestingly, when a United States President, the fourth in a row making this promise, actually delivers on the promise it is somehow to be condemned. I for one support the United States' stance in relation to this issue in delivering on a very clearly enunciated election promise by President Trump, and an election promise clearly enunciated on the basis of a fundamental principle as to what is right in all the circumstances.


In moving the embassy to Jerusalem, the false assertion is made that somehow this might prejudice the peace process. Let's be very clear that any consideration by Australia to move the embassy—and I stress it's only a consideration at this stage—would be to move it to West Jerusalem, which is not disputed territory in relation to the peace process between Israel and Palestine. West Jerusalem was part and parcel of the borders, or within the borders, of Israel prior to the 1967 war, and therefore it is not disputed territory. I think that is something that it is very important to recognise.


I do note that the Labor Party yesterday tried to use question time to argue against the investigation. Arguing against an investigation must simply be motivated by politics, pure and simple, unless there is another agenda. And whilst the Liberal Party, at both a federal council level and state council levels, has overwhelmingly passed motions supporting the move of the Australian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to West Jerusalem, I note that the Labor Party has listed at its conference later this year a debate on whether a future Labor government would recognise 'the Palestinian state'. Let's be clear: if you want to recognise 'the Palestinian state', you have a choice. The choice is to recognise the Hamas-run Gaza Strip—and Hamas is something that we in this country recognise as a terrorist organisation—or to recognise the Palestinian authority, which, if my memory serves me correctly, is currently in the 14th year of its three-year term of parliament. What a great beacon of democracy: in its 14th year, after having been elected for only a three-year term.


The other element for a peace process is that whoever might form the Palestinian government in the future has to recognise the right of Israel's existence, and that is something that those on the Palestinian side have continued to refuse to dedicate themselves to. Until such time as the Palestinian community is willing to recognise Israel's right to exist, there is an existential threat to Israel for its ongoing maintenance and existence. That is why, with a peace process, the very sensitive and sensible suggestion by the United States of moving its embassy to West Jerusalem, which is not in disputed territory, actually allows the peace process to continue. Whilst these acts of terrorism are emanating out of the Palestinian area, it is very important to recognise that Israel has a right to exist, that Israel is a state that is under severe threat on an ongoing basis. But here we have the Labor Party wanting to recognise the Palestinian state. Let them say whether they would want the Palestinian state to be run by the terrorist organisation Hamas or the Palestinian authority that has remained in power for 14 years after having been elected for a three-year term. And let them condemn, as indeed the Greens should condemn, the anti-Semitic—indeed, the racist—campaign of BDS, or 'boycott, divestment and sanctions', against Israel and the businesses that operate from Israel.


So, the announcement by the Prime Minister in recent days that Australia would have a look at moving its embassy is a very welcome move. It is based on the views of many countries around the world that this should happen. Countries are actually doing it as we speak. Within the Australian body politic there have been moves within the Liberal Party. And indeed Australia's most recent Ambassador to Israel, Dave Sharma, has seen the benefits of investigating this as well. You may know that Dave Sharma is the endorsed Liberal candidate for the seat of Wentworth—a man who was appointed as the youngest-ever ambassador for Australia under the previous Labor government. That is the high regard in which he is held on both sides of politics for his capacity.


That is why I am delighted that the Prime Minister, having listened to the wisdom and experience of such a wonderful former ambassador as Dave Sharma and to the Liberal Party councils and to other countries around the world, is now giving serious consideration to moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to West Jerusalem, which would right a wrong that has continued for far too long. I look forward to the outcomes of the investigation and trust that West Jerusalem will be chosen in due course to be the site of the Australian embassy in Israel.

I also need to correct Senator Moore's assertion that the government has changed a policy. The Prime Minister and I have very clearly stated that the issues that are of concern are matters which have been raised in public discourse in Australia. The Prime Minister has indicated that he wants to look at the matters which have been raised in that discourse, including the location of the Australian embassy and whether the JCPOA is delivering outcomes and is as effective as it is intended to be.

Again, Senator Moore misrepresents the position by asserting a complete change in policy. What the Prime Minister has indicated he wants to do is have a discussion to examine these extremely important issues of international policy. Those opposite seem incapable of participating in a discussion like that—incapable! They are only focused on process. They have no interest in Australia's foreign policy positions whatsoever, based on the sorts of questions that they've been asking. I would remind them that there are those opposite who have also canvassed these same issues, including Mr Danby, in May of this year, who suggested that it may be appropriate to look at the location of the embassy.

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (14:10):  I thank Senator Carr for his question. Most certainly, the issue of job losses in any industry, in any business, is always a matter of concern to government and to industry as well. The workers at ASC have been doing a significantly important job, particularly in the construction of the air warfare destroyers and the delivery of those vessels. They have been doing that job based on the last orders which were placed for vessels into the ASC shipyard which, of course, were placed by a coalition government.


In the six years in which those opposite were in the position of government in this country, they did not commission one single naval vessel. This government is commissioning 54 naval vessels from shipyards in Australia, focused on South Australia—the shipyard to which Senator Carr referred—and Western Australia. If that had not been done, then perhaps Senator Carr could take issue with this government's approach to policy in this matter. However, his approach and the approach of the government of which he was a member—he was the minister for industry, if I recall correctly—was that no work was done in this area whatsoever. In fact, it is known appropriately as Labor's valley of death. It was directed by them; it was authored by them; it was written by them. This government has turned it around, this government has turned around Australia's naval capability and this government will deliver.

I actually know why he doesn't understand it. It's because they had no experience at it whatever.


Let me tell you what this government has done to support jobs in a number of ways that go beyond the investment that I've already talked about. We have a targeted retention strategy, which is creating up to 200 positions within ASC submarines for current shipbuilders working on the Air Warfare Destroyer Program, including up to 100 workers supporting the Future Submarine program office and filling vacant positions in the Collins class sustainment office and up to 100 scholarships to workers to support opportunities to upskill in roles in operations management, computer aided design, engineering—

 (Tasmania) (14:15):  My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs. Minister, I refer you to the ongoing humanitarian calamity your government has created and overseen on Nauru by running a systemic regime of torture and child abuse. Can you confirm that Australia's senior IHMS medical officer on Nauru, Dr Nicole Montana, has been arrested overnight, issued with a deportation notice and has been deported—or very shortly is likely to be—from Nauru? This is after Medecins Sans Frontieres were booted off the island last week and after more than 5,500 doctors have demanded that the children you are torturing on Nauru and their families be brought to Australia for urgent medical treatment. Minister, why was Dr Montana deported and what are you doing about it?



The PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan on a point of order.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  I've raised this once before: this assertion, directed at personalities and us collectively, that we're torturing children has just got to be unparliamentary and I believe that the senator ought to withdraw it.



The PRESIDENT:  On the point of order, Senator McKim?




Senator McKim:
  I was very clear not to accuse any individual senator in this place of engaging in child abuse. What I said, very clearly, is that the government is running a systemic regime of torture and child abuse—and I respectfully put it to you that that is not out of order.



The PRESIDENT:  On the point of order raised by Senator O'Sullivan, there is no use of unparliamentary language or reflection upon another senator because it was not directed at another senator. However, Senator McKim, I urge you to read standing order 73. I have had discussions with party leaders about standing order 73 and its particular restriction that says questions shall not contain arguments, inferences, imputations, epithets or ironical expressions, among others things. That question, in my view, does not comply with standing order 73.

 (Western Australia—Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education) (14:17):  I'm assuming that, because we're on broadcast today, Senator McKim decided he would trump Senator Whish-Wilson and ask a question similar to that which he asked yesterday. But I completely dismiss the assertions that Senator McKim has made in relation to the situation on Nauru. I am aware of media reporting about the matter of an International Health and Medical Services senior medical officer departing Nauru on 17 October 2018. This is, of course, a matter for the government of Nauru. I am advised that there has been no impact to the continuity of care for transferees and refugees on Nauru and that another senior medical officer remains on the island. I am also advised that there are 65 health professionals contracted by the Australian government to provide health services on Nauru, including 33 mental health professionals. These services are available seven days a week and after hours. Colleagues may be interested to know that this equates to a ratio of one medical professional for every 11 transferees on the island.


Again, though, Senator McKim does need to be reminded of why this situation has occurred. And, yet again, Senator McKim, as we move towards the election, there is a very clear choice between those of us in the coalition government, who will always ensure that Australia's borders are secure, and those in the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party, who the minute they get into office, if they are elected, would ensure that the calamity and chaos that occurred under the previous Rudd-Gillard Labor government will occur yet again.

Again, though, Senator McKim does need to be reminded of exactly why—

Senator McKim:
  Yes, thank you, Mr President. The point of order is on the basis of relevance. I understand that the minister has said the words that she rejects the premise of the question. I do understand that. The issue, though, Mr President, is that I have directly put to the minister that the information she just gave to the parliament in her previous answer is inaccurate. I use the word 'lie' in relation to what the Department of Home Affairs has said. It's the same as the minister has said. So could you please direct the minister to answer the question and to be clear about whether her rejection of the premise is actually a rejection of that assertion.



The PRESIDENT:  Senators know I cannot direct a minister how to answer a question, as long as they are being directly relevant to the subject matter of the question. The minister is being directly relevant.

Senator CASH:
  Again, perhaps Senator McKim needs to understand exactly why we are in the situation of even having people on Nauru and Manus Island. Again, that is because of the policies that Senator McKim and those in the Australian Greens would delight in implementing if ever they are able to join with a Labor government and do so. Senator McKim, it is a reality that, because of the policies that your party supported, 50,000 people arrived here on in excess of 800 boats.

Senator RUSTON:
  The government recognises that small-amount credit lenders and consumer lease providers play an important role in the economy by providing credit to consumers who in many instances are unable to access mainstream forms of finance. The government has undertaken a review of the small-amount credit contract laws and is currently considering the review's recommendation. The government also notes the comments of Commissioner Hayne regarding the consumer credit industry in the interim report of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. The government would welcome any further scrutiny of the industry.

The speech read as follows—



AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING AMENDMENT (APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS) BILL 2018


Threats to the independence of the ABC are nothing new.


By my estimation, since the mid-1970s no fewer than four of the eleven ABC Board Chairs have had their terms cut short for failing to live up to the expectations of the government of the day — both coalition and Labor.


Three Managing Directors have met the same fate.


Some displeased the government of the day, some were not up to the job.


What unites them all is that they were subject to less than transparent processes which have cumulatively led to a loss of public confidence NOT in the independence of the ABC, but in its ability to withstand attacks on that independence.


Now it has happened again despite the 2012 introduction of new measures for board appointments designed to ensure, as stated by the government of the day, ""a transparent and democratic board appointment process that appoints non-executive directors on merit"".


But in recent years, the intention and the spirit of this process have been ignored on at least three occasions, leading to public disquiet about the independence and integrity of the ABC.


Three appointees to the ABC Board by this government were not recommended by the independent Nomination Panel; a fourth was highly rated by the Panel, but then withdrew from the process and was subsequently appointed by the Minister.


The National Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Act 2012 established an independent Nomination Panel designed to nominate appointments of non-executive directors to the boards of the ABC and SBS based ""on merit"".


According to the Act the nominees were required to have had ""experience in connection with the provision of broadcasting services or in communications or management""; ""expertise in financial or technical matters""; or ""cultural or other interests relevant to the oversight of a public organisation engaged in the provision of broadcasting"".


But the Act also enabled the Prime Minister of the day to ignore Panel nominations as long as he or she tabled ""the reasons for that appointment in each House of the Parliament no later than 15 sitting days ... after that appointment is made.""


The intention was honourable, but it has turned out to be a substantial deficiency.


As Senator Nick Minchin, then Shadow Communications Minister, said in this place on November the 17th 2009 when the legislation was introduced:


""While the government is establishing a Nomination Panel for the appointment process, at the end of the day the scope remains for the minister and the Prime Minister to ignore Panel nominations and appoint whoever they like.""


And so it has turned out to be, setting in train a course of events which once again sees the ABC with a Managing Director whose term has been cut short and a Chair whose actions have forced him to resign.


A bare majority of the current ABC Board was appointed as a result of recommendations from the independent Nomination Panel.


Two of the current board were not nominated as qualified candidates by the Panel; one did not even apply.


The amendment I am proposing is designed to remedy this situation by returning to the spirit and intention of the legislation which set up the independent Nomination Panel and the process surrounding it.


It is a modest proposal -- a multi-stage, graduated process designed to enhance independence, transparency, multi-partisanship and public confidence both in the appointment process and the future independence of the ABC.


What it is NOT is an attempt to impose US Senate-style confirmation hearings on Australian democracy. The Bill is consistent with the principles of Westminster government: the ultimate appointment of a non-executive director remains the prerogative of the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister or Minister.


The Bill requires the Prime Minister in the case of the Chair of the ABC or the Minister in the case of the other non-executive directors to publish the name of their proposed appointee if they intend to ignore the recommendations of the independent Nomination at least 30 days before the appointment proceeds.


This strengthens the integrity of the Panel process and of its members.


It maintains the confidentiality of those candidates not recommended by the Panel and enhances the authority of Panel nominations by putting them in the public domain.


The confidentiality of the nomination process before the Panel's announcement minimises the likelihood of well-qualified individuals being deterred from putting their names forward.


It reduces the prospect that the efforts of the Panel will have been a waste of time as former Panel member and former coalition government minister Neil Brown has pointed out when his and other Panel members' nominations were ignored.


The reasons must be published on the website of the Department of Communications and the Arts. The Opposition Leader must be informed in writing and invited to comment within a reasonable period.


If the Opposition Leader informs the Prime Minister (in the case of the Chairman) or the Minister (in the case of other non-executive directors) in writing within the specified period that he or she does not agree with the appointment the Prime Minister must cause a statement of reasons, including an assessment of the appointee against the selection criteria set down for the independent Nomination Panel, to be tabled in both Houses of Parliament.


In that situation, the Prime Minister or the Minister, must not recommend the Governor-General make the appointment until after the end of the 90 day period beginning when the statement was tabled in the second of the Houses.


This strengthens the current legislation which requires the Prime Minister consult the Opposition Leader only in the case of the appointment of the ABC Chair before recommending the appointment to the Governor-General.


Following tabling of the government's statement of reasons in both Houses of Parliament it would be open to the Senate to hold an inquiry into the nomination by the relevant committee.


It is to be hoped that this new final step need never be taken; that the modest, measured and graduated steps I am proposing would be sufficient to encourage governments to accept the nominations of the independent Nomination Panel.


Should they not, the voters would see where responsibility for the consequences of the government's actions lie — with the government and no one else.


And that is where responsibility for the recent episode centring on the former Chair and former Managing Director of the ABC lies — with the government and no one else.


They appointed Justin Milne; he headed the Board who appointed her. Neither process was sufficiently transparent.


We now know that the Minister was informed of the breakdown in relations between the Board and Ms Guthrie on September 12th, 12 days before her dismissal became public.


The Minister denies that he has ever ""in any way shape or form sought to involve himself in [ABC] staffing matters.""


Clearly, Mr Milne saw it differently.


In the report commissioned by the Minister from his Department Secretary Mr Milne does not deny that he wrote an email to Ms Guthrie about an article by ABC Chief Economics Correspondent Emma Alberici.


That email stated that ""they [the government] hate her.""


""We are tarred with her brush. I think it's simple. Get rid of her. We need to save the ABC ¬not Emma. There is no guarantee they [the Coalition] will lose the next election.""


According to the report of the Secretary of the Department of Communications and the Arts, the former ABC Chair acknowledges that a conversation with Ms Guthrie about ABC Political Editor Andrew Probyn ""was around what to do with him"".


Mr Milne does not recall, but does not deny having used the term ""to shoot him"" in reference to Mr Probyn in that conversation.


According to the report, Mr Milne ""does not consider that either communication was a direction to the MD.""


It does not matter what he thinks. What is significant is what Ms Guthrie thought was the import of Mr Milne's communications with her.


According to the report, Ms Guthrie does consider the Alberici email ""constituted a direction to take action"" and was ""consistent with what she regards as an interventionist approach to individual staffing and editorial matters which the Chair adopted.'


Equally, Ms Guthrie regards the Probyn phone call from Mr Milne as providing ""significant pressure to terminate Mr Probyn's employment.""


""Shoot him"", ""get rid of her"", ""bone her"", ""spear him"" — no one who uses colloquial Australian would have any doubt what they mean, whatever Mr Milne believes.


The current processes for appointing non-executive directors to the ABC board may have been well intentioned, but they have failed.


It is time for the Senate to pass the modest, measured, graduated steps I am proposing so that the chances for political interference in the ABC — real or perceived — are reduced and the public can be assured that the pre-eminent cultural institution is not only genuinely independence, but also has the protections to withstand attacks on that independence as well as its autonomy and integrity.


I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:28):  I rise to speak on the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018. Many Australians were horrified to learn that schools across Australia had the power to discriminate, expel and fire students and teachers simply on the basis of who they are, simply on the basis of their sexuality or gender identity. Australians were horrified to learn through the Ruddock review, a review that was intended to increase discrimination, that this discrimination existed in laws right across the country. We heard the Prime Minister say, during the course of that national debate, that he would introduce legislation to ensure that this area of discrimination in law would be removed so that no child is discriminated against, so that no student is expelled for simply being who they are. We want to give force to those words because we're yet to see any action from the government with regard to legislation that would make sure that no child and no teacher spends another day without these basic protections that should be afforded to them.


We have to accept that this discrimination has a real and harmful impact on many people right across the country. Firstly, we know that it has a direct and material impact, because this discrimination does happen and these laws are enforced by some religious schools and educational facilities. Just this week we heard the story of Craig Campbell, a teacher in Western Australia who lost his job after telling his school he was in a same-sex relationship. Craig was a practising Christian and had been teaching at the school for two years. The school mentioned nothing about his performance as an educator. It was a straightforward case of discrimination. He was sacked because he was gay. Those actions have no place in modern Australia. They have no place in any decent or civilised modern democracy.


In the lead-up to the Wentworth by-election, when there is a level of engagement on this and many other issues, it is one of those rare moments that political parties are listening to the Australian community about what their wants and desires are for this country—for the sort of community that their children grow up in, for the sort of environment that they live in, for what their workplaces look like. Today, through this debate, we've got the opportunity to end discrimination against those kids and, indeed, teachers who right now are struggling with their gender identity or sexuality. If this bill is passed, we will achieve something significant for all of those people. It's not just about where these laws have been enacted and enforced by individual schools. It is about the message that simply the existence of these laws sends, particularly to young people who are coming to terms with their own sexuality and hearing from their communities that the way they feel is somehow wrong, that it's morally repugnant. That's what these laws do; they send that message.


Only recently we went through a national debate on the marriage equality plebiscite, where the very worth of these young people was questioned. Their worth was questioned in a national debate so that they were made to feel somehow abnormal—that their rights, the way they felt, somehow did not fit the values we expect from members of our community. Well, that's got to stop, and that's what this bill will do. It will send a very strong statement whereby once again we will come together as a community and say that discrimination of this sort has no place in modern Australia.


The Prime Minister now has an opportunity to support this legislation and give force to the words he uttered only a few days ago, when he said he didn't support this sort of discrimination. But let's be very clear about this. We need to end discrimination not just for young people but for people in the workplace. We won't accept changes that simply deal with the issue of young students. It must be wholesale reform that also addresses the issue of discrimination directed at teachers. If we pass these changes today, it means that the Sex Discrimination Act will be amended once and for all across the nation to ensure that unfair exemptions against students, teachers and indeed contractors in religious schools would no longer exist.


Many people across the community haven't been aware that this is an issue that obviously impacts on the LGBTIQ+ community. They haven't been aware of it because it's not something that we as a nation have had the courage to discuss. Well, that's what we're doing today, right now. As a result of the Ruddock review, the whole nation is aware of these discriminatory exemptions, and the reality is that most people object. It is heartwarming to know the outrage that so many decent Australians felt when they became aware of this legislation. People right across the country reacted with anger at the thought that a teacher given the privilege of educating young children would be sacked simply because of the sort of relationship that they're in.


The government knew that the community would be appalled to learn this. They knew, given the result of the marriage plebiscite, that there would be that sort of response. They knew that Australians would be angered that LGBTIQ teachers could be sacked not because of their performance but because of who they are, because of their identity. They know because there's a by-election around the corner and they're hearing it from the people of Wentworth. But, rather than take action, they are simply mouthing empty promises. They've refused to put legislation before this parliament.


We know that the only reason that this legislation has been met with the reaction it has been met with is the Ruddock review and the coverage that it got. The government tried to bury that report. We had the spectacle where the Leader of the Government in the Senate refused to provide that report so that there could be some transparency and so that we knew the full impact of discrimination across a whole range of areas in law. He refused to provide that material to the Senate, citing cabinet confidentiality. The Prime Minister belled the cat only a few days later when he made it clear that, indeed, the cabinet had not considered the Ruddock review, so the basis for denying that report to the Australian community was proven to be a falsehood.


That's why we're concerned when the Prime Minister says, 'We're going to move to change discrimination in law,' on the eve of a by-election, without presenting legislation. That's why we're sceptical, and that's why it's so important that we have this debate today and that we hear from the Leader of the Government in the Senate, from members of the Morrison cabinet and from senior members of the government on the record that they are going to move to end discrimination against students and against teachers.


Of course, this bill doesn't say that religion doesn't matter. Of course, it matters to many, many Australians. It is central to the lives of many Australians, and we respect their right to practise their religion in the way that they see fit. Indeed, there are still provisions in this bill which exempt bodies established purely for religious purposes who are responsible for the ordainment of priests, ministers of religion or members of any religious order. We respect the freedom of those institutions to be able to educate those practitioners in a way that is consistent with their faith. We believe in the right to freedom of religion, but that freedom is not the freedom to discriminate. It's not the freedom to say to a young person, 'You are not valued in the same way as somebody else who might not express their sexuality or gender identity in the way that you do.'


We've stood by many communities in the name of equality and fairness, be they cultural, religious or LGBTIQ+ communities. Why? Because it's the right thing to do and because we have integrity. But a party that strategically suppresses documents so that discrimination, in law, continues to remain protected is not a party that has integrity. A party that promises to do one thing before an election but doesn't provide a commitment to this chamber that it will do it after the election is not a party with integrity.


It is critical that this bill be debated today and over the course of the next two days. It is the pressure of a by-election that is forcing this government to act. These are rare moments, when parties are too busy focusing on themselves, too busy settling old scores, too busy seeking vengeance and payback and too busy settling vendettas. This is one of those rare moments where a party with a very slim majority has got an ear out to what the electorate is saying. That's an opportunity to ensure that we get this legislation passed and that we hear very clearly from senior members of the government that they will end all forms of discrimination. We need action now. We need politicians from all persuasions to stand for what is right and what is decent.


I have to say that the support of the Labor Party and crossbench to ensure we have this debate is something that we appreciate, and we want to put on the record our thanks to members of the Labor Party and the crossbench for ensuring this Greens bill is debated at a moment when people right around the country are listening and when the opportunity for change is here. I say to you that if you stand for decency, if you stand for respect and if you stand for fairness and equality, then you should support this legislation

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (16:42):  The government will not be supporting the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018, as the Prime Minister has previously indicated. In fact, as the Prime Minister announced on Saturday, the government will be introducing our own bill to amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to ensure that no student of a non-state school can be expelled on the basis of their sexuality. As part of our consultations with the opposition, the Attorney-General is meeting today with the shadow Attorney-General to discuss our proposed draft amendments to give effect to that commitment. Subject to agreement between the government and the opposition in relation to our proposed amendments, we would be in a position to introduce those amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 as soon as possible during this sitting fortnight. Subject to agreement, it could be as early as tomorrow but certainly no later than next week.


I should also make very clear, as the Prime Minister has and other members of the government have, that our government does not support the expulsion of students from religious and non-state schools on the basis of their sexuality. This is a view that is widely shared, incidentally, by religious schools and communities across our country. The government is very happy and very keen to work with the opposition, with other parties and with other senators and members of parliament. We don't want to play politics with this. We just want to address the issue.


We are of the view that it is very sad that the inaccurate way the Ruddock review, in particular, has been reported has caused unnecessary anxiety amongst parents and amongst children. So we do want to see this issue addressed over this sitting fortnight. We will continue to work with the opposition and other interested members of parliament to help ensure that happens. I can again confirm on behalf of the government that the Attorney-General will be meeting today, or may have already started a meeting, with the shadow Attorney-General to discuss our proposed draft amendments to give effect to that commitment. We are in a position to move very swiftly and certainly during this sitting fortnight.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2018-10-17,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (16:45):  Labor welcomes the opportunity to address these issues, and I note Senator Cormann's remarks about moving forward with respect to them. Australia is a tolerant and accepting nation, and discrimination against LGBTI Australians has no place in our national laws. Equally, the right of our churches and churchgoers to live by their traditions and beliefs is also part of our national identity. Balancing these two things can be complex, and we know that there are many strong views in the current debate about how best to balance freedom of religion with the right of all Australians to live free from discrimination. We respect all of those views. We had hoped that this debate could be carried out in a mature and measured way. But, unfortunately, the government has had the review into religious freedom since May and has so far refused to release it so Australia can have a proper debate about these important issues. It's clear that they are doing this to hide it from the voters in Wentworth. Why else would they continue so consistently to refuse to release it?


Many religious education institutions have made it clear that they do not use these exemptions. However, we respect their view that they should be allowed to run their organisations in line with their beliefs. We respect the right of parents to send children to the school of their choice and to have their children educated in accordance with their religious convictions. We know that many parents choose religious schools because they want their children to be grounded in the identity and mission of a particular religious faith. We also understand that the mission of a religious school is delivered not just in religious education or scripture classes but also throughout the culture of the school via religious services, sporting activities, community service, student leadership and in many areas of the education curriculum.


When it comes to employment, we understand that religious schools and parents of students expect that teachers and staff support the ethos, values and principles of the particular faith, and not act in ways that undermine the school's mission. The reality is that staff who choose to work in religious schools understand this too, and that is why there are very few examples of faith based schools needing to rely on exemptions from the discrimination law based on identity when making employment decisions. We also believe that in 2018 these exemptions from discrimination for gender identity, sexual orientation and relationship status are out of step with community expectations and are no longer the best way to safeguard the mission and identity of religious schools.


While every employer is entitled to require employees to act and perform their duties in accordance with the stated policies and mission of their organisation, in the absence of such exemptions it is necessary to ensure that religious schools are positively entitled to teach and operate in accordance with their faith and mission.


We propose an affirmative position for religious schools that upholds their exercise of religious freedoms and freedom of association. Our approach to legislation on this issue would remove exemptions from the Sex Discrimination Act that would allow schools to discriminate against children and staff on the basis of sexuality or gender identity. We would also like to see in legislation a recognition that religious schools are entitled to require employees to act in their roles in a way that upholds the ethos and values of that faith, and that this requirement may be taken into account when a person is first employed and in the course of their employment.


This is where we have some concerns about the narrowness of the Discrimination Free Schools Bill that the Greens have introduced this week. Our concern is that, while the bill does appear to address one side of the equation—that is, removing discrimination—it appears to do so without addressing the other side of the equation that I've already talked about: the right of religious communities and their institutions, such as schools, to educate in accordance with the doctrines of their faith. We do not say that finding the right balance between these two principles is easy. I've already indicated that we respect that that's quite complex, particularly in the legislative context, but we are concerned that this bill does not appear to grapple with the problem and addresses only the question of removing discrimination.


Another concern we have about the bill is that it would appear that it might remove the right of religious seminaries—as opposed to religious schools—to discriminate. So while we in Labor will work to amend our laws so that religious schools are no longer able to discriminate against students and their staff on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status, we do not believe that this change to the law should extend to religious seminaries. As we have done previously, we call on the government to come to the table and work with the opposition and the crossbench on a suitable way forward. As I've previously noted, Senator Cormann has indicated some elements of that path. It is disappointing, though, that despite saying they were willing to do so earlier in the week, the government had so far refused to do so—so some benefit of the Greens introducing this bill has been to assist in bringing the government to the table. The government could start by releasing the religious freedom report so that we can discuss these issues constructively. Whilst the recommendations of the report have been leaked, we still lack the consideration, the discussion and the logic that the panel put to reaching those recommendations which address those very issues of balance in this area. We firmly believe that it is possible to protect religious freedom and protect people from discrimination. We call on the Senate, the government, the crossbench and the Greens to work together to do that in a respectful way.

 (Victoria) (16:52):  I'm proud to rise to speak on this Greens bill, the Discrimination Free Schools Bill, which would remove exemptions from our federal anti-discrimination laws that currently allow religious schools to expel lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or gender-diverse students and to fire LGBT teachers and staff members simply because of who they are. The Greens have been fighting for years to end these exemptions. They were written into our anti-discrimination laws by the Labor Party and have persisted for far too long. These exemptions must be removed.


Imagine being a student at a religious school and knowing that, if you come out as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, gender-diverse or non-binary, you risk being expelled. Imagine the extra stress and burden that that places on you at a time when you're already feeling particularly vulnerable. The majority of Australians have been unaware of these discriminatory exemptions, but for LGBT+ people working at religious schools, many of them have gone to work each day knowing that, should they come out or let slip something that they shouldn't, or somehow have their sexuality or their gender identity discovered, they risk being fired and losing their job—just because of who they are. These exemptions have a devastating impact on people's lives.


Over the past week, so many people have come forward sharing their stories. We've heard how some teachers and staff members have been forced back into the closet as soon as they've been offered a job. We've heard how they've feared holding their partner's hand in public in case they bump into a colleague or a student who could out them, which would see them lose their job and their livelihood. We also know that LGBT+ people already suffer worse mental health than their heterosexual and cisgendered peers, because of the stress of things like these exemptions, which mean they could be expelled from their school or fired from their workplace.


Rainbow Families Victoria have collected stories of LGBT+ families whose lives are being affected by our current discriminatory laws and have shared them with members and senators. A future stepmother of five children, who's engaged to her same-sex partner, spoke out this week saying:


I teach at a conservative Catholic primary school. I am constantly afraid that someone will find out and that I will lose my job. I am the main income earner and my employment is incredibly important. I worry that I will lose my job. I worry that my employer won't give me a good reference if she finds out. This could affect my future employment opportunities. I feel like a criminal and I have done nothing wrong.


For others, these discriminatory exemptions have prevented them from applying for their dream jobs. Tim Hoffmann in my home state of Victoria shared his story with The Age earlier this week:


I have a Masters in Theology and want to teach in religious schools. However, I will never apply. I have absolutely no chance as, though I'm Christian, I am an openly gay man.


It was almost a year ago that the marriage equality postal survey results came in showing that the majority of Australians supported ending the discrimination in our marriage laws and making marriage equality a reality. It was a hard-fought and, for many queer Australians, personally difficult win but it confirmed what we had known for years—that Australian people have opened their hearts and truly embraced their LGBTIQ+ family members, friends and colleagues. For years now the majority of Australians have stood side by side with LGBTIQ members of our community in our fight for equality and against discrimination, and on this issue it is no different. A Fairfax poll released this week showed that an overwhelming majority, 74 per cent, of Australians oppose this discrimination. I am so heartened and unsurprised that the vast majority of Australians do not support this legalised discrimination against LGBT Australians.


Our parliament must support the people we represent and fix up these discriminatory laws. Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ordered the Ruddock religious freedom review last year as parliament moved to legislate for marriage equality. It was said that he did this as a sop to the right-wing hate-filled conservatives who continue to fight against equality until the very end, but it now seems the Ruddock review has not quite turned out the way they thought. It's only through the review's recommendations being leaked that the Australian people have been alerted to these discriminatory exemptions that have sat within our antidiscrimination laws for many years.


This Saturday, voters in the seat of Wentworth will be going to the polls to elect their new representative to replace former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Despite the Liberals comfortably winning this seat in 2016, there is a very real chance the Liberals will lose Wentworth this Saturday, because the people of Wentworth are shocked by what this Liberal government has done—its devastating inaction on climate change, its ongoing torture of people seeking asylum and its interference with and funding cuts to the ABC. In the Liberals' desperation to cling on in Wentworth we've seen them release some shocking policies in the lead-up to this Saturday, yet we are still to see Prime Minister Scott Morrison release the full report of the Ruddock review, because the Liberals are afraid of drawing more attention to their awful policies towards LGBTIQ people. Ruddock is a former Liberal government minister after all. His review quite reasonably can be seen as a reflection of where this government is currently at with regard to allowing and entrenching discrimination.


We have now heard both Labor and the Liberals speak up big over the last week about how we need to make sure that LGBT students are not discriminated against. I was pleased to hear from Minister Cormann that he is now going to move quickly to amend legislation to stop the discrimination against LGBT students. It has been wonderful to see this backflip in the Liberals' position. It has also been wonderful to see the Labor Party come out to say that their position now is to end discrimination against students and to end discrimination against teachers and other staff. But it has only been because of the intense community pressure that both the Labor and the Liberal parties have changed their positions over the last fortnight. 


So, our bringing on this debate today is a very important opportunity. It's an opportunity to get the government and the Labor opposition on the record about ending this discrimination before the pressure comes off after the vote in Wentworth on Saturday. We heard Minister Cormann say that, yes, he was happy and the government are going to move to end discrimination against students. But when it comes to teachers and other staff, he is silent. Despite the impact that this discrimination is having on teachers and staff at schools, the government remain silent. One can only presume that their intention is to continue to prosecute the case for allowing those discriminations to continue on in our antidiscrimination laws, to allow the continuation of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender teachers and other staff. 


We've got the Wentworth by-election coming up, and it's important that the voters of Wentworth know, because they overwhelmingly voted for equality and against discrimination in the marriage equality postal survey last year. Wentworth delivered an 81 per cent yes vote in the postal survey last year. So they deserve to know. Through this debate, they are able to hear where Labor and the Liberals stand before Wentworth goes to the polls this Saturday. 


I'm really proud of the bill that we are debating today. It would remove exemptions not just for students at religious schools but for all teachers and staff members as well. And it would not just work to protect students, teachers and staff members on the basis of their sexuality and their sexual orientation but also on their gender identity. Trans and gender-diverse people have hardly been mentioned in the public debate over the last fortnight. We must ensure that trans and gender-diverse students cannot be expelled because of their gender identity and that trans and gender-diverse teachers and other staff members aren't able to be fired. 


Yesterday Prime Minister Morrison said, and I quote: 'We must act right now. We can deal with this once and for all.' Well, Mr Prime Minister, you have an opportunity to act right now and remove this unfair discrimination once and for all. To act now and, particularly, once and for all means we've got to remove discrimination against students but also against teachers and other staff. We need to do it now. Labor and Liberal must turn their words into action and vote for this bill, vote for our Greens bill, to protect students, teachers and other staff members from being expelled or fired by religious schools just because of who they are. So I call on both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to work with us in good faith and support this Greens bill today—no ifs, no buts. Together, we can end this unfair discrimination once and for all.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2018-10-17,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (17:03):  I'm very pleased to rise to speak on the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018. I'm pleased to do so because it provides me with an opportunity to reassure people who may have been concerned by inaccurate media reporting in the past week on this issue. Before I get into the detail, I want to start with a broader, more fundamental point. As Australians, we are united by many things, but we also have disagreements. That is completely normal in any free society. 


One area where we do disagree is matters of faith and morality. That is to be expected when we come from many different backgrounds. That disagreement, on its own, is not necessarily a problem. We do, however, have to find a framework to manage those differences that allows us to happily co-exist and live alongside each other, even though we disagree on some things. We need to do so in a way that respects the fundamental dignity of every Australian. Every Australian, whatever their beliefs, deserves to be treated with equal respect. They also deserve equal freedom to live their own lives according to their own values. No Australian should seek to impose on other Australians values that they don't share. We can, of course, do our best to persuade each other to our world view. But, if we are unsuccessful, we shouldn't resort to other means to force people to live as we choose to live. Effectively, what that means is that we need to accept our society is pluralistic. We can accommodate people of different views comfortably and happily if we all respect each other's freedom to live our own lives according to our own values. That does not require you to agree with or endorse other people's views. It does mean, though, that if you wish to enjoy your own freedom you have to respect the freedom of others, too. I think this is an intrinsically Australian trait. Almost all of us have a live-and-let-live attitude.


How does this apply to the bill before the Senate today? There are two groups of Australians who take a great interest in this issue. One group is gay Australians and their friends and families. The other group is people of faith. I want to reassure both. Firstly, I say to LGBTI kids: you might have read somewhere that someone wants to kick you out of school because you are gay; nothing could be further from the truth. I've been very actively involved in the religious freedom debate. I've met, corresponded with and heard from more people than I could count about religious liberty. In all that time, no-one, not once, has ever asked me to make it easier to kick gay kids out of school. Never. If they had, I would have told them, politely, where to go. I know that all my colleagues would have done the same. I know that life is not always easy for you. Nobody wants to make it any harder. You deserve to have the same right as anyone else to go to school without the fear of expulsion.


There is no proposal in the Ruddock review or anywhere else to make it easier to kick gay kids out of school. In fact, the Ruddock review actually recommends that the existing powers to do so should be substantially narrowed. The government will go one step further and will get rid of them altogether. We are doing so because a law that singles out gay kids has no place in Australia, and we're doing so with the full support of people of faith, their schools and their communities. They have told us that that this is a power that they don't use and don't want. They are not the intolerant bigots that they are sometimes unfairly made out to be. Incidentally, the law which permitted this at a federal level was in fact introduced by the former Gillard government and by the then Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus. This week, Labor senators have called this outdated. Australia certainly has changed since 2013, but not that much. It wasn't appropriate then, it's not appropriate now and our government will get rid of it.


The second group of people I want to reassure are people of faith. Your rights are no less important than those of any other Australian. Although I'm not personally religious, I know that, whatever your faith tradition, you are good Australians. You are not bigots, you are not reactionaries and you are not monolithic. You disagree with other people of faith as much as any other Australian, and I know you don't like all being put in one basket as if you were all the same. The government will act to protect your religious freedoms. We will do so because religious freedom is one of our most fundamental and cherished freedoms, although, sadly, today it is not well understood.


Religious freedom is the freedom to have faith, to not have faith, to change your faith or to leave your faith if you wish. It is a freedom for all Australians to enjoy equally and not just a freedom for those Australians who choose to worship on a weekly basis. We all have an interest in maintaining this freedom, regardless of our own beliefs. Societies without religious freedom are not societies any of us would want to live in, whether we are believers or not. Some societies have mandated one state religion. Others have banned religion altogether. Others still have made it a crime to change or leave your religion. What they have in common is that individual rights have been horribly trampled. None of us want to see Australia go down that road.


Religious freedom is also not just the freedom to believe in your faith. For people of faith, it is not sufficient just to believe. To live a life of integrity as a person of faith also means to live out those values in the world. Your actions, too, need to reflect your deepest and most sincerely held convictions. Forcing you to act contrary to them does limit your religious freedom. In this way, religious freedom is not really just about religion; it also encompasses free speech, freedom of association and freedom of conscience. That's not a coincidence. All of those fundamental freedoms—speech, association and conscience—were developed in the West in conjunction with, and as a result of, our evolving ideas about religious freedom. Philosophers like John Milton and John Locke developed our ideas about free speech in an explicitly religious context. For them, the question of the day was whether they should be free to speak about and debate religious questions. As Milton says:


Give me the liberty to know, to utter and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties.


Obviously, our understanding of free speech today is much broader. It is not just for religious debates but for all issues of concern to Australians. But free speech remains an essential freedom for the maintenance of religious freedom. How can any of us exercise our right to believe, not believe or change our beliefs if we don't have the opportunity to hear competing ideas about faith?


Freedom of association is a particularly relevant component of religious freedom in the context of this bill. In a pluralistic society, freedom of association is a vital freedom that people use to come together with others who share their values in order to give expression to those values. Religious schools are a good example of that. Parents send their kids to faith based schools for many reasons. One important reason is that they want to ensure that their children are raised in their faith tradition and according to their values. It's a right that all parents share.


Like any other organisation with a mission, it is vitally important that faith based schools are able to ensure that their staff share the values of the school and are willing and able to teach those values to their students. Not every teacher will want to do this. In a pluralistic society, that's okay. There are lots of other schools where that will not be a problem. But it would be wrong to force a school to hire teachers who do not support, or were unwilling to teach, the values of the school. It would undermine their mission. It would undermine school choice—something that the Liberal and National parties strongly support. Any organisation founded with a purpose deserves that same freedom. It would be equally wrong, for example, to force an LGBTI organisation to employ someone who was opposed to gay rights. The government understands how important this freedom is to faith based schools. We will ensure that this freedom remains protected in Australia.


I want to make one final broader observation about the Ruddock review and the process of addressing concerns Australians have about religious freedom. For some weeks now, people have demanded that the review should be released in full. Then, unfortunately, it appeared in a partial form in the media. The inaccurate reporting we have seen since and the concern that this has created in the community demonstrate exactly why a cautious approach is warranted. This is a complex area of law. It is not easily reduced to a sound bite. It understandably attracts strong views. It's entirely appropriate that the report be released in conjunction with the government response to that report, to ensure that there's no unnecessary panic about what the government might do in responding to that report. That's a process our Attorney-General, Christian Porter, is leading. I have complete confidence in his capacity do so. It would be unwise for any government to rush its response in order to meet on artificial political deadline. The best policy which resolves the sincere hopes and concerns that Australians have about this issue is most likely to come from careful consideration and proper process, not kneejerk responses to media-induced panics.


It's unfortunate that the heat and light of this debate so far has largely been confined to one recommendation. It gives the misleading impression that this is the only area of interest or concern to people of faith when it comes to religious freedom. The truth is that there are much broader and often less contentious areas which are also of very significant importance. We cannot and will not allow this to derail our efforts to better protect religious freedom in Australia. There will be plenty of time for a proper public debate about these broader issues, and the normal government and parliamentary consultation processes, to ensure that all Australians have input into the final outcome. Ultimately, what we seek to do is ensure that all Australians are able to live with dignity and respect according to their own values. That should not be beyond our ability.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-10-17,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:16):  In starting my remarks today, I want to reflect on some of the experiences of discrimination and bullying that Australian students in our nation have, unfortunately, experienced. This quote comes from a young trans person: 


If my school had been even remotely LGBTIQ-friendly, my entire life would have been different. If it had not been overtly homophobic, even that would have been a good start. But it was not and I had a very rough time and felt there was no way out. Feeling increasingly disconnected with my body and distressed by the way it was changing, in Year 10 I stumbled across a YouTube video of a transgender man and I thought I might have finally found my answer—but I also knew there was little I could do about it. I stopped eating in the hope that I could stop puberty and I was cutting myself. I cried in the back of the classroom each day, but no one noticed. In Year 12, I tried to kill myself for the first time.


When we think about these issues before the parliament today, we need to think of the educational and, even more importantly, very personal outcomes and the wellbeing of children in our nation's schools.


I'm glad that this debate has now come to the fore. It seems that, as Senator Paterson said, the government wants to wait before putting anything substantive on the table—to wait for the Ruddock review to be formally released and to release its legislative response then. On that note, I very much question why, if they want to do this in a holistic, meaningful way, they rushed out their statements regarding the protection of students, frankly, in the context of the Wentworth by-election. The government's reluctance to release the Ruddock review speaks very loudly. You've continued the covering up of the review, and, to my mind, you're trying to keep all bases covered, both the homophobic and transphobic content in the report, perhaps, and the need to keep religious organisations on side. But we now have an opportunity for a mature debate around these issues.


I note the recommendation of the Ruddock review that has been leaked. Notwithstanding the fact that it narrows the grounds for discrimination that schools might seek to apply, it does allow religious schools to continue to discriminate against students. From what I can tell from the recommendations—although we can't see them in their full context—it would allow them to expel students based on their sexuality or gender identity. As I have highlighted with the quotes from the young person that I have quoted today, students should not have to face the brunt of this discrimination based on their gender identity, on their sexuality or on any facet of their identity.


I am pleased that the government has come forward and said it will go further in terms of preventing discrimination against all these young people. Our young people in Australia deserve to have the opportunity to socialise and learn in a school environment without the fear of being discriminated against, without the fear of being bullied or harassed—and they should not be exposed to bullying and bigotry. As the quote I put forward highlights, we know that LGBTIQ children and young people suffer from higher rates of poor mental health and engaging in self-harm. This is due to the bullying they experience and the stigma attached to their sexuality and gender. As the report I quoted from just now highlights, young people themselves say that there's nothing intrinsic about being lesbian, gay or transgender that makes them feel that way; it is the prevailing views of society in regard to the way they present themselves and the stigma and discrimination they receive for their identity. So we have a very important duty of care to protect young people and not expose them to these kinds of harms.


I note that the Ruddock report also wants to provide religious schools with an ongoing ability to discriminate against staff or contractors on the basis of their sexuality or gender identity. Labor does not believe that schools should have an automatic, innate right to do this. An innate attribute should not be a ground for discrimination. I have seen many cases where LGBTIQ teachers have faced hidden and unspoken pressure to hide their sexuality lest they be found out and risk losing their jobs over their identity.


I don't want to see this debate mirror the toxic debate that came with the marriage equality debate. It stirred up a great deal of anxiety for LGBTIQ Australians, for parents and children, about whether we would ever be accepted and when those attacks would end. Happily, with the passing of marriage equality through this parliament, we did make a great step forward and we know very clearly the views of a majority of Australians on these issues.


We know that the Ruddock review was given to the government in May. It is now October. Supposedly, it's been kept from this place because it's covered by cabinet confidentiality, yet the government say cabinet has not even considered it. The Australian public deserve to know what is in that report. Why keep it a secret if it doesn't contain inflammatory and discriminatory content? The timing of the Wentworth by-election suggestions that this is a ploy by government to cling to the majority in their federal seats. You're trying to manage the potential backlash on both sides. Frankly, we just want to see this place have a mature and proper debate about the substantive issues here. Without the leaks from Fairfax we would never have known about these recommendations.


We have a Prime Minister who has ham-fistedly flip-flopped in his response to this report regarding the power religious schools would have to discriminate on the grounds of a student's sexuality or gender identity. The Prime Minister, when first asked about these recommendations, defended them. He defended them by pointing out that there are already existing laws allowing religious schools to turn away LGBTIQ students, and I take great offence at the attacks from those opposite that it was the Labor Party that entrenched this discrimination in the Sex Discrimination Act. These exemptions have existed since the Sex Discrimination Act was first put in place. They didn't exist so that religious schools and other institutions could discriminate against LGBTIQ people, because we weren't even in the act at that time. It was to allow continued discrimination on the basis of marital status, pregnancy and other attributes such as being divorced et cetera. The Prime Minister said nine times that he defended the existing recommendations of the Ruddock review. But I'm very pleased that we have moved on from that, because we don't want to see degrading legislation in our country.


I have to say many states have now moved to prevent discrimination and make it unlawful to allow schools to discriminate on the basis of sexuality or gender. Labor is against discrimination, and our laws should reflect this value. We are a tolerant and accepting nation. Discrimination against LGBTIQ people has no place in our national laws. We are, therefore, also committed to protecting LGBTIQ students and staff from being discriminated against by religious schools. Last year we voted for equality and fairness, not more discrimination. Our laws should apply equally regardless of what your faith is, where you come from or who you love.


I have, over many years, heard very real stories and experiences from LGBTIQ students and students with LGBTIQ parents about the discrimination they have faced in our schools. Let's make it clear: this is not just about the sexuality and gender of young people or the gender identity of children. It is also about the discrimination that young people have suffered because their parents might be trans or their parents might be in a same-sex relationship. I have had friends and family subjected to this kind of discrimination. It has caused great distress, caused significant mental health impacts and, at times, caused young people to leave school and not finish their education, with a lifelong impact on their future. In saying that, I know how real this is. In my own family, I have members who have experienced discrimination way back, a long time ago, in Catholic schools because they had a single mother and they were at a Catholic school. That discrimination then increased when the child turned out to be non-gender conforming and to be a lesbian, and she just didn't fit in with the school. Inevitably, along comes a change in school circumstances; but it has a lifelong impact on people. It undermines their capacity to continue and complete their education.


It has been said that most schools don't actively discriminate. I know of many schools, including religious schools, that have wonderful LGBTIQ inclusion policies and have LGBTIQ students who are very well accepted and supported within that school community. However, it's not the same in all schools, and the fact that schools currently retain the power to discriminate can mean that young people who are having a hard time with bullying don't always come forward to get the support that they need. The quote I started this speech with very firmly illustrates that.


We welcome removing exemptions in relation to children in religious schools, but we are very disappointed that the Prime Minister has rejected our suggestion that we should be removing the exemption for staff. As Labor's shadow assistant minister for equality, as a member of the LGBTIQ community and very much also as a parent who's co-parenting with other LGBTIQ people, I know how important these protections are not only for myself but for my child. I add to the community that no young person should be subjected to discrimination at school. Our children's right to an education must be our first and foremost responsibility. We need strong discrimination laws to ensure equal treatment.


I do acknowledge that this debate has other sides to it. It is about respecting the rights of parents to send children to the school of their choice and to have children educated in accordance with their religious convictions. We want to see young people worrying about their homework not living in fear of mistreatment because of who they are. We want to see Australia's young people protected.


The debate has exposed that there are fundamental rights and freedoms of Australians that are lacking recognition currently. I really want to thank the leadership of Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek for bringing forward this debate in relation to the discrimination faced by students and teachers. It is not only for students to be protected from discrimination but also for teachers. I know of too many teachers that have feared for their job security not just because of their LGBTI status but also because they are pregnant and unmarried. These are teachers who have conducted themselves in the school environment within the ethos of the school—totally within the ethos of the school. It just happens that in their personal and private lives they might be LGBTI, they might be unmarried or they might get pregnant outside of marriage, and it causes them great concern for their job security. This should not be the case in today's day and age. People should not have to be secretive about their personal life and identity at school. Work is such a major part of your life. You should not have to hide such fundamental parts of your life for fear of losing your job. These are wonderful teachers, dedicated to their school community, their students and their profession.


All schools need procedures for hiring and firing teachers and maintaining the quality of their teachers. There's a great deal of conduct that our schools cannot and should not tolerate, and the ethos of that kind of conduct will vary from school to school. Schools will have varying policies, and the ethos of each will vary based on its morals and educational ethos. For example, a religious school might need to sack a teacher because they refuse to stop teaching creationism in science classes—it might be outside the school's curriculum—or you might have a Scientologist teacher trying to recruit students at a Catholic school. There's nothing wrong with being a Scientologist or anything else—actually I don't like Scientology much—but if you don't overstep the mark, if you don't bring those attributes to the classroom, then you should stay out of harm's way within the ethos of that school.


There are many much worse ways in which teachers might create very real moral perils for school students. It could be because their conversations with students about sex are too overt, a female teacher talks about being attracted to male students or a teacher talks about, I don't know, visiting a sex worker. There are plenty of things that are morally wrong.


For some schools, promoting something like marriage equality within the school community might very much be outside the ethos of that particular school. But the intrinsic identity of a teacher or a student—who you are as an individual person—should not be grounds for discrimination, dismissal or the need to be performance managed in any way. There are many examples where the conduct of an otherwise good educator might fall outside a school's ethics and ethos. I remember when a male teacher formed a relationship with a female student at a school I attended, and both left the school. I know of an incident where someone I knew was kissed in a state school by a teacher of the same sex at a school formal. I think that at the time the secrecy attached to that teacher's lesbian identity within the school only contributed to her poor behaviour: 'you and me against the world'. If people can't be open about their identity and who they are within a school environment, then that's where risk comes from.


None of these very real moral perils can be dealt with by carve-outs in antidiscrimination law for non-government schools. Schools already need to manage these kinds of workplace and classroom performance issues for students who have teachers with poor boundaries or a poor moral compass or people who actively promote things that are in contradiction with the school's morals and ethics. But what is very clear to me is that the mere fact that someone speaks in an ordinary sense about themselves and their family, if they're acknowledged as being unmarried, divorced, gay, lesbian, transgender, intersex or in a same-sex relationship—that their family and status is known within the school community—should not be grounds for discrimination.

"Storer, Sen Timothy",IND,2018-10-17,"



Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (17:36):  I rise to support the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018. Late last year Australian voters overwhelmingly backed the abolition of laws preventing marriage equality. It was a reminder that on many issues the voters are well ahead of their elected representatives. A few months ago a YouGov Galaxy poll found that 82 per cent of those surveyed opposed laws currently allowing schools to expel students because of their sexual orientation. Nearly as many—79 per cent—opposed the ability of schools to sack teachers if they married people of the same sex. It is another sign that the voters are well in front of their elected representatives. As I've said before, I oppose any moves to increase discrimination against students and teachers based on their sexual orientation, and I am supporting this bill because it seeks to scrap current exemptions allowing some schools to discriminate against students, teachers and other staff on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identification.


This is not a theoretical problem. We have heard today, and I myself am aware, of schools where teachers, even principals, have had to hide their sexual orientation to avoid the sack. These were people who in some cases were committed Christians. These were teachers who were loved by their students and whose teaching and insights are remembered long after by the pupils they taught. This is not acceptable in a nation where gay marriage is now legal. Even so, there are still cases where teachers are being sacked for acknowledging that they are gay. One of these cases, reported by the ABC, involved Craig Campbell, a practising Christian who was employed as a teacher at a Baptist college south of Perth. He had previously been a student at the school, but his employment was terminated last year after he told the school that he was in a same-sex relationship. Speaking to the ABC, Mr Campbell wondered—legitimately, in my view—what existing laws allowing discrimination said about these schools and their attitude to religion. After all, as the Bible states in Paul's letter to the Galatians:


There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.


Mr Campbell asked:


What's the ultimate goal in not allowing these kids within your school?


Religious schools, their bigger purpose is to provide environments where kids can interact with their faith and so by excluding the students they lose that opportunity. To me, it seems nonsensical.


I could not agree more. It is beyond time to bring all schools in line with the prohibitions on sexual discrimination that operate elsewhere in society. It is high time that the laws allowing schools to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identification, martial status and pregnancy for students and staff are amended. I do hope that the Senate passes this legislation and that the government has the good sense to allow it to be debated in the other place so that it can become law. We do not want a repeat of the extreme words and actions that arose out of the marriage equality debate last year.

 (Victoria—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:39):  I rise today to speak on the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018, a bill put forward by my colleagues from the Greens, and particularly Senator Siewert, that seeks to amend the Sex Discrimination Act and the Fair Work Act. The objective of this bill, as we know, is to ensure that independent schools cannot reject either a student or a teacher based on their sexuality.


It's funny, I was reflecting as I was preparing for this how just over two years ago I came to this place thinking that my most valued and considered contributions would be economic—that I would stand in this place and speak with knowledge, authority and experience on tax, on superannuation, on investments, on banking or on property rights—and I find myself just over two years in, and here I've been talking about same-sex marriage and euthanasia and freedom of speech and now religious freedoms. It has taken me by surprise just how many of these issues have arisen in such a short space of time. I suppose, as a daughter of ageing parents, as a single woman who deals with the prejudices and preconceptions that that itself brings, as a sister of a teacher, and as a mother of school-aged children also on the cusp of adulthood, I find that—like all of us—even on issues in which I never used to think of myself as an expert, I have a contribution to make and a perspective to give. What an extraordinary privilege that is. I was particularly proud to contribute to those debates, and most particularly, I think, the same-sex marriage debate with Senator Smith. Some of those debates were highly emotional and emotive and very personal.


But I am also very proud to contribute to this debate, and I commend the sentiment of this legislation. Let me acknowledge the intent of Senator Siewert and the Greens in bringing this legislation forward today, because, of course, our priority here is children. Acting Deputy President, in approaching a debate such as this, it would be difficult to not first point out the profoundly meaningful statement of Harvey Milk—you will recall he was the first openly gay, publicly elected official in the state of California—who in 1977 said:


All young people, regardless of sexual orientation or identity, deserve a safe and supportive environment in which to achieve their full potential.


I genuinely appreciate the concern we all share for our children; indeed, my concern for my own is never far away. Australia's education system must secure our children from discrimination. That is why the government has worked very effectively already to reach this outcome—because, like Harvey Milk, like the most reasonable and fair-minded citizens, we seek an education system where our young people have the opportunity to reach their full potential. The suggestion otherwise—that they might not be protected—is unacceptable and, indeed, it is unthinkable. We all agree on this, and the suggestion that we don't agree on this is, quite frankly, an insult.


It is imperative to protect children from acceptance or rejection from a school on the basis of their sexuality. Such a notion is out of step with the values of parents, with school communities, with religious communities and with society. As a government, our first responsibility, we must remind ourselves, is to generations to come, and on this we can, mercifully, all agree.


It's worth reflecting on what led us here. The Ruddock review was commissioned by this government to examine where religious freedoms may be limited in contemporary legislation. Many of the arguments regarding the Ruddock review have been well canvassed. It requires re-emphasis, though, to remind the chamber that this was a report to government, not a report by government, that advocates protections for students from discrimination. That report has not yet been released. It has not yet been published. It has not yet been considered by cabinet. I personally haven't read it. What we have seen of the Ruddock review proposes restrictions to the laws introduced by the previous Labor government, which gave religious schools greater ability to expel students where the school considered it was necessary according to the doctrines of the religion in question.


I remind the Senate again that I have not read the Ruddock review in full; however, it is potentially worth drawing the attention of the chamber to recommendation 8, which we have seen published. It says:


Jurisdictions should abolish any exceptions to anti-discrimination laws that provide for discrimination by religious schools with respect to students on the basis of race, disability, pregnancy or intersex status.


Few people would find disagreement with that view because it goes to the heart of ensuring that Australia remains a tolerant and cohesive society, and a cohesive democracy. This government aims to balance the rights between religious freedom and freedom of conscience fairly with the right of our children to be free from discrimination. So let me reiterate my colleague Senator Paterson's sentiments that it's time to consider the report holistically and that's the only responsible response to the Ruddock review.


I'd also like to briefly reflect on the educational environment in Australia. We are so extraordinarily lucky in this country to have the education system that we have, not that it's perfect by any stretch. There is still much work to be done to ensure that our educational standards reflect our prosperity, our opportunity and the modern economy and flourishing democracy that we enjoy. But we are very lucky, largely because we have choice. We have a state education system that guarantees every child a quality education from prep right through to year 12, complimented by an independent education system that provides families with alternatives that better suit their personal priorities, objectives and values. Those schools have different fee structures and are subsidised to better ensure that they are accessible to families and communities that align with them. That choice is a very precious thing; not all countries have it. It is something that we cherish, and it is something that we should continue to nurture. It reflects the fundamental truth that parents and families are the people best placed to make decisions on behalf of their children. Parents know what's best for their children, not government.


As many in the chamber would know and as I mentioned earlier, I have three children—three teenagers all at various stages of adolescence, some of it uglier than others. They are all of school age. Their father and I made the decision a long time ago to send them to an independent school that reflected the values we held dear, and we've been very happy with that decision. The schools they go to are quite old and traditional, but their values are timeless and their attitudes are contemporary. They seek to create an environment of not just tolerance, which is a word I actively dislike—tolerance is something that you have for something you find distasteful or ugly. I prefer that my children's school creates a culture of acceptance and understanding, and values the contribution of every member of that school community. So my boys are at an Anglican school. They have a chapel and they have a chaplain. They also have a gay-straight alliance, which is a senior school student-led group. It works to break down stereotypes and build inclusiveness across peer groups, and that's something I value. Like many other contemporary schools, their faith is quite central to their values, but the school community makes it clear that it appreciates that diverse viewpoints and identities are what connect us all to the lives and experiences of others. They build our capacity for empathy and understanding, and they're what challenge our ideas about people and society, and that's what I want for my children. It may not be for every family. That's fine. That's what choice is all about, and that was the choice for my family. I don't believe it's an ethos that's particularly uncommon in contemporary independent schools.


It is the responsibility of government, however, to protect children, and that is exactly what we're doing. Our government does not support the expulsion of students from religious non-state schools on the basis of their sexuality. That is a view that, as I've said, is widely shared across our country. It is a view that is in line with community expectations. As a government, we are taking actions to ensure that amendments are introduced as soon as practicable to make it clear that no student of a non-state school should be expelled on the basis of their sexuality. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been unequivocal that we are here to ensure children are at the centre of our considerations of these issues. The law that we currently have, which the Labor Party brought in, doesn't do that.


There are wider implications which I wouldn't mind talking through in a little more detail. With the media attention and sensationalism around this topic we seem to have glossed over the reality that religious schools are not campaigning for the freedom to expel students on the basis of sexuality; in fact they have come out in support of amendments to protect against such a thing, rejecting the efforts of certain members of this parliament to sensationalise for their own political agenda, a very disappointing behaviour indeed. Let's imagine in some alternative universe that schools had the luxury of pondering on the sexuality of their students rather than focusing on delivering quality education. Let's imagine that teachers and even principals were out there expelling students willy-nilly on this basis and no other. Do members here genuinely believe the wider school community would accept this? Of course not. Would Australians accept this? Of course they wouldn't. There would be complete and utter outrage, and rightly so. We won't support the politicisation of our school students and we won't allow the Greens to make this an issue. We won't allow them to try to pit Australians against each other.


Independent and religious schools receive public funding and as such have a responsibility to operate in line with community and legal expectations, and they do. The gap in this legislation can be dealt with quickly and effectively, and that's what we will do. I am very proud of the fact that we're working constructively for our children on this issue, because we have that responsibility to determine the boundary to protect our most vulnerable. We have a responsibility to ensure legal protections are in place that protect children from any type of discrimination in a world that's becoming increasingly polarised. I need not labour the point that many children are struggling with their sexual identity and often face incredible pressures and even sometimes violence. Some may not even know that they face this as a result of sexuality, and they face unsafe and unsupportive environments that are confusing and quite traumatic. It would be unthinkable that this government or any would allow this to continue. That's why we're taking the steps that we are taking to end the right of any school to discriminate against students.


This is a consensus that we have reached. It is unfortunate that the Greens persist in waging a divisive campaign of identity politics. It is also our duty to respect parental choice. This is particularly important. The legislation that we have before us today seeks to go further than just protecting children; it seeks to compel religious schools to either hire or not release teachers who may not adhere to the religious values of that school. Let me go back to my own children's experience. There are so many different types of schools with hundreds of variations represented, but every school wants the same thing from their staff: passionate teachers that share the school's values and are committed to shaping students' futures, preparing our children for fulfilling and meaningful lives in which they are able to make a contribution. I know that my children's school, an Anglican school that values its faith and religion, has a number of teachers that would identify as LGBTIQ. That made no difference to my children's quality of education. Indeed sometimes I believe it may well have enhanced it.


I know that the call to protect teachers comes from a good place, and again I tip my hat to the Greens. I know their intentions here are good if not a little bit politically opportunistic, but teachers are adults, and they choose to work at the workplaces they do, where their values are reflected and their skill sets are valued. School communities are made up of adults who choose their teachers based on their values and skill sets, and teachers are adults who make that choice as well. This legislation treats both teachers and school communities not like the adults that they are but like the children that they teach, in need of protection by the state through rules set out by those who know better. I object to that patronising assumption that, without this legislation, suddenly LGBTIQ teachers will be persecuted or at risk, and that, unless the government and Big Brother comes in and prevents it, schools and school communities who today have shown no signs of discrimination in the hiring and firing of staff and value their teachers for the skills that they bring will suddenly tomorrow become laden with prejudice and intolerance, in need of laws to restrain their newly discovered bigotry and homophobia. As Liberals, we are always reluctant to legislate for a problem that doesn't exist. I am genuinely concerned that this is one of those times.


More importantly, though, I object to the implication in part of this legislation that there is an us-and-them mentality, that Australia is divided somehow into those who are tolerant and those who are waiting on the opportunity to persecute those of whom they disapprove. I have a much higher opinion of the common sense of school communities, religious groups and, indeed, all Australians than do my colleagues in the Greens. The government's position is that we need not conflate protecting young children from expulsion with the employment practices of adults. That conflation is opportunistic, it is intolerant and it is contemptuous.


The Ruddock review still hasn't been made public. It hasn't been considered appropriately by cabinet and, when it is considered, we will make recommendations in an objective and fulsome manner. The government will then choose which recommendations it agrees with and which it does not and it will act accordingly. It is not unreasonable, as the coalition asks, that we are given appropriate time and space in which to do this. Australians hold their freedoms very dear, whether it be freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press or freedom to pursue the faith of their choice without retribution or obstruction. Legislating for or against freedoms is not something that should ever be done lightly, hastily or thoughtlessly or, dare I say, motivated solely politically. 


My personal position is that teachers play such an important role in the lives of our children. They are educators, they are the tough cop on the beat and they are boundary setters, role models, mentors and inspirations. They are the bows from which are children, as living arrows, are sent forth. A person's sexuality should not be a consideration when judging somebody's moral worth. On this, we can agree. And, on this, independent schools already agree. Protecting our children is a clear responsibility of government and, indeed, it is a responsibility of society as a whole. The government is taking action to ensure that there are amendments introduced to the Sex Discrimination Act as soon as possible to make it clear that no student of a non-state school should be expelled on the basis of their sexuality. The Attorney-General is preparing those amendments right now, and the opposition will be consulted as a part of that process.


There are plenty of issues in this place on which our politicians across the divide disagree.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,22,1,speech
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2018-10-17,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:28):  I rise to speak on the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018. Many Australians were horrified to learn that schools across Australia had the power to discriminate, expel and fire students and teachers simply on the basis of who they are, simply on the basis of their sexuality or gender identity. Australians were horrified to learn through the Ruddock review, a review that was intended to increase discrimination, that this discrimination existed in laws right across the country. We heard the Prime Minister say, during the course of that national debate, that he would introduce legislation to ensure that this area of discrimination in law would be removed so that no child is discriminated against, so that no student is expelled for simply being who they are. We want to give force to those words because we're yet to see any action from the government with regard to legislation that would make sure that no child and no teacher spends another day without these basic protections that should be afforded to them.


We have to accept that this discrimination has a real and harmful impact on many people right across the country. Firstly, we know that it has a direct and material impact, because this discrimination does happen and these laws are enforced by some religious schools and educational facilities. Just this week we heard the story of Craig Campbell, a teacher in Western Australia who lost his job after telling his school he was in a same-sex relationship. Craig was a practising Christian and had been teaching at the school for two years. The school mentioned nothing about his performance as an educator. It was a straightforward case of discrimination. He was sacked because he was gay. Those actions have no place in modern Australia. They have no place in any decent or civilised modern democracy.


In the lead-up to the Wentworth by-election, when there is a level of engagement on this and many other issues, it is one of those rare moments that political parties are listening to the Australian community about what their wants and desires are for this country—for the sort of community that their children grow up in, for the sort of environment that they live in, for what their workplaces look like. Today, through this debate, we've got the opportunity to end discrimination against those kids and, indeed, teachers who right now are struggling with their gender identity or sexuality. If this bill is passed, we will achieve something significant for all of those people. It's not just about where these laws have been enacted and enforced by individual schools. It is about the message that simply the existence of these laws sends, particularly to young people who are coming to terms with their own sexuality and hearing from their communities that the way they feel is somehow wrong, that it's morally repugnant. That's what these laws do; they send that message.


Only recently we went through a national debate on the marriage equality plebiscite, where the very worth of these young people was questioned. Their worth was questioned in a national debate so that they were made to feel somehow abnormal—that their rights, the way they felt, somehow did not fit the values we expect from members of our community. Well, that's got to stop, and that's what this bill will do. It will send a very strong statement whereby once again we will come together as a community and say that discrimination of this sort has no place in modern Australia.


The Prime Minister now has an opportunity to support this legislation and give force to the words he uttered only a few days ago, when he said he didn't support this sort of discrimination. But let's be very clear about this. We need to end discrimination not just for young people but for people in the workplace. We won't accept changes that simply deal with the issue of young students. It must be wholesale reform that also addresses the issue of discrimination directed at teachers. If we pass these changes today, it means that the Sex Discrimination Act will be amended once and for all across the nation to ensure that unfair exemptions against students, teachers and indeed contractors in religious schools would no longer exist.


Many people across the community haven't been aware that this is an issue that obviously impacts on the LGBTIQ+ community. They haven't been aware of it because it's not something that we as a nation have had the courage to discuss. Well, that's what we're doing today, right now. As a result of the Ruddock review, the whole nation is aware of these discriminatory exemptions, and the reality is that most people object. It is heartwarming to know the outrage that so many decent Australians felt when they became aware of this legislation. People right across the country reacted with anger at the thought that a teacher given the privilege of educating young children would be sacked simply because of the sort of relationship that they're in.


The government knew that the community would be appalled to learn this. They knew, given the result of the marriage plebiscite, that there would be that sort of response. They knew that Australians would be angered that LGBTIQ teachers could be sacked not because of their performance but because of who they are, because of their identity. They know because there's a by-election around the corner and they're hearing it from the people of Wentworth. But, rather than take action, they are simply mouthing empty promises. They've refused to put legislation before this parliament.


We know that the only reason that this legislation has been met with the reaction it has been met with is the Ruddock review and the coverage that it got. The government tried to bury that report. We had the spectacle where the Leader of the Government in the Senate refused to provide that report so that there could be some transparency and so that we knew the full impact of discrimination across a whole range of areas in law. He refused to provide that material to the Senate, citing cabinet confidentiality. The Prime Minister belled the cat only a few days later when he made it clear that, indeed, the cabinet had not considered the Ruddock review, so the basis for denying that report to the Australian community was proven to be a falsehood.


That's why we're concerned when the Prime Minister says, 'We're going to move to change discrimination in law,' on the eve of a by-election, without presenting legislation. That's why we're sceptical, and that's why it's so important that we have this debate today and that we hear from the Leader of the Government in the Senate, from members of the Morrison cabinet and from senior members of the government on the record that they are going to move to end discrimination against students and against teachers.


Of course, this bill doesn't say that religion doesn't matter. Of course, it matters to many, many Australians. It is central to the lives of many Australians, and we respect their right to practise their religion in the way that they see fit. Indeed, there are still provisions in this bill which exempt bodies established purely for religious purposes who are responsible for the ordainment of priests, ministers of religion or members of any religious order. We respect the freedom of those institutions to be able to educate those practitioners in a way that is consistent with their faith. We believe in the right to freedom of religion, but that freedom is not the freedom to discriminate. It's not the freedom to say to a young person, 'You are not valued in the same way as somebody else who might not express their sexuality or gender identity in the way that you do.'


We've stood by many communities in the name of equality and fairness, be they cultural, religious or LGBTIQ+ communities. Why? Because it's the right thing to do and because we have integrity. But a party that strategically suppresses documents so that discrimination, in law, continues to remain protected is not a party that has integrity. A party that promises to do one thing before an election but doesn't provide a commitment to this chamber that it will do it after the election is not a party with integrity.


It is critical that this bill be debated today and over the course of the next two days. It is the pressure of a by-election that is forcing this government to act. These are rare moments, when parties are too busy focusing on themselves, too busy settling old scores, too busy seeking vengeance and payback and too busy settling vendettas. This is one of those rare moments where a party with a very slim majority has got an ear out to what the electorate is saying. That's an opportunity to ensure that we get this legislation passed and that we hear very clearly from senior members of the government that they will end all forms of discrimination. We need action now. We need politicians from all persuasions to stand for what is right and what is decent.


I have to say that the support of the Labor Party and crossbench to ensure we have this debate is something that we appreciate, and we want to put on the record our thanks to members of the Labor Party and the crossbench for ensuring this Greens bill is debated at a moment when people right around the country are listening and when the opportunity for change is here. I say to you that if you stand for decency, if you stand for respect and if you stand for fairness and equality, then you should support this legislation

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-10-17,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (16:42):  The government will not be supporting the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018, as the Prime Minister has previously indicated. In fact, as the Prime Minister announced on Saturday, the government will be introducing our own bill to amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to ensure that no student of a non-state school can be expelled on the basis of their sexuality. As part of our consultations with the opposition, the Attorney-General is meeting today with the shadow Attorney-General to discuss our proposed draft amendments to give effect to that commitment. Subject to agreement between the government and the opposition in relation to our proposed amendments, we would be in a position to introduce those amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 as soon as possible during this sitting fortnight. Subject to agreement, it could be as early as tomorrow but certainly no later than next week.


I should also make very clear, as the Prime Minister has and other members of the government have, that our government does not support the expulsion of students from religious and non-state schools on the basis of their sexuality. This is a view that is widely shared, incidentally, by religious schools and communities across our country. The government is very happy and very keen to work with the opposition, with other parties and with other senators and members of parliament. We don't want to play politics with this. We just want to address the issue.


We are of the view that it is very sad that the inaccurate way the Ruddock review, in particular, has been reported has caused unnecessary anxiety amongst parents and amongst children. So we do want to see this issue addressed over this sitting fortnight. We will continue to work with the opposition and other interested members of parliament to help ensure that happens. I can again confirm on behalf of the government that the Attorney-General will be meeting today, or may have already started a meeting, with the shadow Attorney-General to discuss our proposed draft amendments to give effect to that commitment. We are in a position to move very swiftly and certainly during this sitting fortnight.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2018-10-17,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (16:45):  Labor welcomes the opportunity to address these issues, and I note Senator Cormann's remarks about moving forward with respect to them. Australia is a tolerant and accepting nation, and discrimination against LGBTI Australians has no place in our national laws. Equally, the right of our churches and churchgoers to live by their traditions and beliefs is also part of our national identity. Balancing these two things can be complex, and we know that there are many strong views in the current debate about how best to balance freedom of religion with the right of all Australians to live free from discrimination. We respect all of those views. We had hoped that this debate could be carried out in a mature and measured way. But, unfortunately, the government has had the review into religious freedom since May and has so far refused to release it so Australia can have a proper debate about these important issues. It's clear that they are doing this to hide it from the voters in Wentworth. Why else would they continue so consistently to refuse to release it?


Many religious education institutions have made it clear that they do not use these exemptions. However, we respect their view that they should be allowed to run their organisations in line with their beliefs. We respect the right of parents to send children to the school of their choice and to have their children educated in accordance with their religious convictions. We know that many parents choose religious schools because they want their children to be grounded in the identity and mission of a particular religious faith. We also understand that the mission of a religious school is delivered not just in religious education or scripture classes but also throughout the culture of the school via religious services, sporting activities, community service, student leadership and in many areas of the education curriculum.


When it comes to employment, we understand that religious schools and parents of students expect that teachers and staff support the ethos, values and principles of the particular faith, and not act in ways that undermine the school's mission. The reality is that staff who choose to work in religious schools understand this too, and that is why there are very few examples of faith based schools needing to rely on exemptions from the discrimination law based on identity when making employment decisions. We also believe that in 2018 these exemptions from discrimination for gender identity, sexual orientation and relationship status are out of step with community expectations and are no longer the best way to safeguard the mission and identity of religious schools.


While every employer is entitled to require employees to act and perform their duties in accordance with the stated policies and mission of their organisation, in the absence of such exemptions it is necessary to ensure that religious schools are positively entitled to teach and operate in accordance with their faith and mission.


We propose an affirmative position for religious schools that upholds their exercise of religious freedoms and freedom of association. Our approach to legislation on this issue would remove exemptions from the Sex Discrimination Act that would allow schools to discriminate against children and staff on the basis of sexuality or gender identity. We would also like to see in legislation a recognition that religious schools are entitled to require employees to act in their roles in a way that upholds the ethos and values of that faith, and that this requirement may be taken into account when a person is first employed and in the course of their employment.


This is where we have some concerns about the narrowness of the Discrimination Free Schools Bill that the Greens have introduced this week. Our concern is that, while the bill does appear to address one side of the equation—that is, removing discrimination—it appears to do so without addressing the other side of the equation that I've already talked about: the right of religious communities and their institutions, such as schools, to educate in accordance with the doctrines of their faith. We do not say that finding the right balance between these two principles is easy. I've already indicated that we respect that that's quite complex, particularly in the legislative context, but we are concerned that this bill does not appear to grapple with the problem and addresses only the question of removing discrimination.


Another concern we have about the bill is that it would appear that it might remove the right of religious seminaries—as opposed to religious schools—to discriminate. So while we in Labor will work to amend our laws so that religious schools are no longer able to discriminate against students and their staff on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status, we do not believe that this change to the law should extend to religious seminaries. As we have done previously, we call on the government to come to the table and work with the opposition and the crossbench on a suitable way forward. As I've previously noted, Senator Cormann has indicated some elements of that path. It is disappointing, though, that despite saying they were willing to do so earlier in the week, the government had so far refused to do so—so some benefit of the Greens introducing this bill has been to assist in bringing the government to the table. The government could start by releasing the religious freedom report so that we can discuss these issues constructively. Whilst the recommendations of the report have been leaked, we still lack the consideration, the discussion and the logic that the panel put to reaching those recommendations which address those very issues of balance in this area. We firmly believe that it is possible to protect religious freedom and protect people from discrimination. We call on the Senate, the government, the crossbench and the Greens to work together to do that in a respectful way.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-10-17,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:52):  I'm proud to rise to speak on this Greens bill, the Discrimination Free Schools Bill, which would remove exemptions from our federal anti-discrimination laws that currently allow religious schools to expel lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or gender-diverse students and to fire LGBT teachers and staff members simply because of who they are. The Greens have been fighting for years to end these exemptions. They were written into our anti-discrimination laws by the Labor Party and have persisted for far too long. These exemptions must be removed.


Imagine being a student at a religious school and knowing that, if you come out as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, gender-diverse or non-binary, you risk being expelled. Imagine the extra stress and burden that that places on you at a time when you're already feeling particularly vulnerable. The majority of Australians have been unaware of these discriminatory exemptions, but for LGBT+ people working at religious schools, many of them have gone to work each day knowing that, should they come out or let slip something that they shouldn't, or somehow have their sexuality or their gender identity discovered, they risk being fired and losing their job—just because of who they are. These exemptions have a devastating impact on people's lives.


Over the past week, so many people have come forward sharing their stories. We've heard how some teachers and staff members have been forced back into the closet as soon as they've been offered a job. We've heard how they've feared holding their partner's hand in public in case they bump into a colleague or a student who could out them, which would see them lose their job and their livelihood. We also know that LGBT+ people already suffer worse mental health than their heterosexual and cisgendered peers, because of the stress of things like these exemptions, which mean they could be expelled from their school or fired from their workplace.


Rainbow Families Victoria have collected stories of LGBT+ families whose lives are being affected by our current discriminatory laws and have shared them with members and senators. A future stepmother of five children, who's engaged to her same-sex partner, spoke out this week saying:


I teach at a conservative Catholic primary school. I am constantly afraid that someone will find out and that I will lose my job. I am the main income earner and my employment is incredibly important. I worry that I will lose my job. I worry that my employer won't give me a good reference if she finds out. This could affect my future employment opportunities. I feel like a criminal and I have done nothing wrong.


For others, these discriminatory exemptions have prevented them from applying for their dream jobs. Tim Hoffmann in my home state of Victoria shared his story with The Age earlier this week:


I have a Masters in Theology and want to teach in religious schools. However, I will never apply. I have absolutely no chance as, though I'm Christian, I am an openly gay man.


It was almost a year ago that the marriage equality postal survey results came in showing that the majority of Australians supported ending the discrimination in our marriage laws and making marriage equality a reality. It was a hard-fought and, for many queer Australians, personally difficult win but it confirmed what we had known for years—that Australian people have opened their hearts and truly embraced their LGBTIQ+ family members, friends and colleagues. For years now the majority of Australians have stood side by side with LGBTIQ members of our community in our fight for equality and against discrimination, and on this issue it is no different. A Fairfax poll released this week showed that an overwhelming majority, 74 per cent, of Australians oppose this discrimination. I am so heartened and unsurprised that the vast majority of Australians do not support this legalised discrimination against LGBT Australians.


Our parliament must support the people we represent and fix up these discriminatory laws. Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ordered the Ruddock religious freedom review last year as parliament moved to legislate for marriage equality. It was said that he did this as a sop to the right-wing hate-filled conservatives who continue to fight against equality until the very end, but it now seems the Ruddock review has not quite turned out the way they thought. It's only through the review's recommendations being leaked that the Australian people have been alerted to these discriminatory exemptions that have sat within our antidiscrimination laws for many years.


This Saturday, voters in the seat of Wentworth will be going to the polls to elect their new representative to replace former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Despite the Liberals comfortably winning this seat in 2016, there is a very real chance the Liberals will lose Wentworth this Saturday, because the people of Wentworth are shocked by what this Liberal government has done—its devastating inaction on climate change, its ongoing torture of people seeking asylum and its interference with and funding cuts to the ABC. In the Liberals' desperation to cling on in Wentworth we've seen them release some shocking policies in the lead-up to this Saturday, yet we are still to see Prime Minister Scott Morrison release the full report of the Ruddock review, because the Liberals are afraid of drawing more attention to their awful policies towards LGBTIQ people. Ruddock is a former Liberal government minister after all. His review quite reasonably can be seen as a reflection of where this government is currently at with regard to allowing and entrenching discrimination.


We have now heard both Labor and the Liberals speak up big over the last week about how we need to make sure that LGBT students are not discriminated against. I was pleased to hear from Minister Cormann that he is now going to move quickly to amend legislation to stop the discrimination against LGBT students. It has been wonderful to see this backflip in the Liberals' position. It has also been wonderful to see the Labor Party come out to say that their position now is to end discrimination against students and to end discrimination against teachers and other staff. But it has only been because of the intense community pressure that both the Labor and the Liberal parties have changed their positions over the last fortnight. 


So, our bringing on this debate today is a very important opportunity. It's an opportunity to get the government and the Labor opposition on the record about ending this discrimination before the pressure comes off after the vote in Wentworth on Saturday. We heard Minister Cormann say that, yes, he was happy and the government are going to move to end discrimination against students. But when it comes to teachers and other staff, he is silent. Despite the impact that this discrimination is having on teachers and staff at schools, the government remain silent. One can only presume that their intention is to continue to prosecute the case for allowing those discriminations to continue on in our antidiscrimination laws, to allow the continuation of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender teachers and other staff. 


We've got the Wentworth by-election coming up, and it's important that the voters of Wentworth know, because they overwhelmingly voted for equality and against discrimination in the marriage equality postal survey last year. Wentworth delivered an 81 per cent yes vote in the postal survey last year. So they deserve to know. Through this debate, they are able to hear where Labor and the Liberals stand before Wentworth goes to the polls this Saturday. 


I'm really proud of the bill that we are debating today. It would remove exemptions not just for students at religious schools but for all teachers and staff members as well. And it would not just work to protect students, teachers and staff members on the basis of their sexuality and their sexual orientation but also on their gender identity. Trans and gender-diverse people have hardly been mentioned in the public debate over the last fortnight. We must ensure that trans and gender-diverse students cannot be expelled because of their gender identity and that trans and gender-diverse teachers and other staff members aren't able to be fired. 


Yesterday Prime Minister Morrison said, and I quote: 'We must act right now. We can deal with this once and for all.' Well, Mr Prime Minister, you have an opportunity to act right now and remove this unfair discrimination once and for all. To act now and, particularly, once and for all means we've got to remove discrimination against students but also against teachers and other staff. We need to do it now. Labor and Liberal must turn their words into action and vote for this bill, vote for our Greens bill, to protect students, teachers and other staff members from being expelled or fired by religious schools just because of who they are. So I call on both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to work with us in good faith and support this Greens bill today—no ifs, no buts. Together, we can end this unfair discrimination once and for all.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2018-10-17,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (17:03):  I'm very pleased to rise to speak on the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018. I'm pleased to do so because it provides me with an opportunity to reassure people who may have been concerned by inaccurate media reporting in the past week on this issue. Before I get into the detail, I want to start with a broader, more fundamental point. As Australians, we are united by many things, but we also have disagreements. That is completely normal in any free society. 


One area where we do disagree is matters of faith and morality. That is to be expected when we come from many different backgrounds. That disagreement, on its own, is not necessarily a problem. We do, however, have to find a framework to manage those differences that allows us to happily co-exist and live alongside each other, even though we disagree on some things. We need to do so in a way that respects the fundamental dignity of every Australian. Every Australian, whatever their beliefs, deserves to be treated with equal respect. They also deserve equal freedom to live their own lives according to their own values. No Australian should seek to impose on other Australians values that they don't share. We can, of course, do our best to persuade each other to our world view. But, if we are unsuccessful, we shouldn't resort to other means to force people to live as we choose to live. Effectively, what that means is that we need to accept our society is pluralistic. We can accommodate people of different views comfortably and happily if we all respect each other's freedom to live our own lives according to our own values. That does not require you to agree with or endorse other people's views. It does mean, though, that if you wish to enjoy your own freedom you have to respect the freedom of others, too. I think this is an intrinsically Australian trait. Almost all of us have a live-and-let-live attitude.


How does this apply to the bill before the Senate today? There are two groups of Australians who take a great interest in this issue. One group is gay Australians and their friends and families. The other group is people of faith. I want to reassure both. Firstly, I say to LGBTI kids: you might have read somewhere that someone wants to kick you out of school because you are gay; nothing could be further from the truth. I've been very actively involved in the religious freedom debate. I've met, corresponded with and heard from more people than I could count about religious liberty. In all that time, no-one, not once, has ever asked me to make it easier to kick gay kids out of school. Never. If they had, I would have told them, politely, where to go. I know that all my colleagues would have done the same. I know that life is not always easy for you. Nobody wants to make it any harder. You deserve to have the same right as anyone else to go to school without the fear of expulsion.


There is no proposal in the Ruddock review or anywhere else to make it easier to kick gay kids out of school. In fact, the Ruddock review actually recommends that the existing powers to do so should be substantially narrowed. The government will go one step further and will get rid of them altogether. We are doing so because a law that singles out gay kids has no place in Australia, and we're doing so with the full support of people of faith, their schools and their communities. They have told us that that this is a power that they don't use and don't want. They are not the intolerant bigots that they are sometimes unfairly made out to be. Incidentally, the law which permitted this at a federal level was in fact introduced by the former Gillard government and by the then Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus. This week, Labor senators have called this outdated. Australia certainly has changed since 2013, but not that much. It wasn't appropriate then, it's not appropriate now and our government will get rid of it.


The second group of people I want to reassure are people of faith. Your rights are no less important than those of any other Australian. Although I'm not personally religious, I know that, whatever your faith tradition, you are good Australians. You are not bigots, you are not reactionaries and you are not monolithic. You disagree with other people of faith as much as any other Australian, and I know you don't like all being put in one basket as if you were all the same. The government will act to protect your religious freedoms. We will do so because religious freedom is one of our most fundamental and cherished freedoms, although, sadly, today it is not well understood.


Religious freedom is the freedom to have faith, to not have faith, to change your faith or to leave your faith if you wish. It is a freedom for all Australians to enjoy equally and not just a freedom for those Australians who choose to worship on a weekly basis. We all have an interest in maintaining this freedom, regardless of our own beliefs. Societies without religious freedom are not societies any of us would want to live in, whether we are believers or not. Some societies have mandated one state religion. Others have banned religion altogether. Others still have made it a crime to change or leave your religion. What they have in common is that individual rights have been horribly trampled. None of us want to see Australia go down that road.


Religious freedom is also not just the freedom to believe in your faith. For people of faith, it is not sufficient just to believe. To live a life of integrity as a person of faith also means to live out those values in the world. Your actions, too, need to reflect your deepest and most sincerely held convictions. Forcing you to act contrary to them does limit your religious freedom. In this way, religious freedom is not really just about religion; it also encompasses free speech, freedom of association and freedom of conscience. That's not a coincidence. All of those fundamental freedoms—speech, association and conscience—were developed in the West in conjunction with, and as a result of, our evolving ideas about religious freedom. Philosophers like John Milton and John Locke developed our ideas about free speech in an explicitly religious context. For them, the question of the day was whether they should be free to speak about and debate religious questions. As Milton says:


Give me the liberty to know, to utter and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties.


Obviously, our understanding of free speech today is much broader. It is not just for religious debates but for all issues of concern to Australians. But free speech remains an essential freedom for the maintenance of religious freedom. How can any of us exercise our right to believe, not believe or change our beliefs if we don't have the opportunity to hear competing ideas about faith?


Freedom of association is a particularly relevant component of religious freedom in the context of this bill. In a pluralistic society, freedom of association is a vital freedom that people use to come together with others who share their values in order to give expression to those values. Religious schools are a good example of that. Parents send their kids to faith based schools for many reasons. One important reason is that they want to ensure that their children are raised in their faith tradition and according to their values. It's a right that all parents share.


Like any other organisation with a mission, it is vitally important that faith based schools are able to ensure that their staff share the values of the school and are willing and able to teach those values to their students. Not every teacher will want to do this. In a pluralistic society, that's okay. There are lots of other schools where that will not be a problem. But it would be wrong to force a school to hire teachers who do not support, or were unwilling to teach, the values of the school. It would undermine their mission. It would undermine school choice—something that the Liberal and National parties strongly support. Any organisation founded with a purpose deserves that same freedom. It would be equally wrong, for example, to force an LGBTI organisation to employ someone who was opposed to gay rights. The government understands how important this freedom is to faith based schools. We will ensure that this freedom remains protected in Australia.


I want to make one final broader observation about the Ruddock review and the process of addressing concerns Australians have about religious freedom. For some weeks now, people have demanded that the review should be released in full. Then, unfortunately, it appeared in a partial form in the media. The inaccurate reporting we have seen since and the concern that this has created in the community demonstrate exactly why a cautious approach is warranted. This is a complex area of law. It is not easily reduced to a sound bite. It understandably attracts strong views. It's entirely appropriate that the report be released in conjunction with the government response to that report, to ensure that there's no unnecessary panic about what the government might do in responding to that report. That's a process our Attorney-General, Christian Porter, is leading. I have complete confidence in his capacity do so. It would be unwise for any government to rush its response in order to meet on artificial political deadline. The best policy which resolves the sincere hopes and concerns that Australians have about this issue is most likely to come from careful consideration and proper process, not kneejerk responses to media-induced panics.


It's unfortunate that the heat and light of this debate so far has largely been confined to one recommendation. It gives the misleading impression that this is the only area of interest or concern to people of faith when it comes to religious freedom. The truth is that there are much broader and often less contentious areas which are also of very significant importance. We cannot and will not allow this to derail our efforts to better protect religious freedom in Australia. There will be plenty of time for a proper public debate about these broader issues, and the normal government and parliamentary consultation processes, to ensure that all Australians have input into the final outcome. Ultimately, what we seek to do is ensure that all Australians are able to live with dignity and respect according to their own values. That should not be beyond our ability.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-10-17,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:16):  In starting my remarks today, I want to reflect on some of the experiences of discrimination and bullying that Australian students in our nation have, unfortunately, experienced. This quote comes from a young trans person: 


If my school had been even remotely LGBTIQ-friendly, my entire life would have been different. If it had not been overtly homophobic, even that would have been a good start. But it was not and I had a very rough time and felt there was no way out. Feeling increasingly disconnected with my body and distressed by the way it was changing, in Year 10 I stumbled across a YouTube video of a transgender man and I thought I might have finally found my answer—but I also knew there was little I could do about it. I stopped eating in the hope that I could stop puberty and I was cutting myself. I cried in the back of the classroom each day, but no one noticed. In Year 12, I tried to kill myself for the first time.


When we think about these issues before the parliament today, we need to think of the educational and, even more importantly, very personal outcomes and the wellbeing of children in our nation's schools.


I'm glad that this debate has now come to the fore. It seems that, as Senator Paterson said, the government wants to wait before putting anything substantive on the table—to wait for the Ruddock review to be formally released and to release its legislative response then. On that note, I very much question why, if they want to do this in a holistic, meaningful way, they rushed out their statements regarding the protection of students, frankly, in the context of the Wentworth by-election. The government's reluctance to release the Ruddock review speaks very loudly. You've continued the covering up of the review, and, to my mind, you're trying to keep all bases covered, both the homophobic and transphobic content in the report, perhaps, and the need to keep religious organisations on side. But we now have an opportunity for a mature debate around these issues.


I note the recommendation of the Ruddock review that has been leaked. Notwithstanding the fact that it narrows the grounds for discrimination that schools might seek to apply, it does allow religious schools to continue to discriminate against students. From what I can tell from the recommendations—although we can't see them in their full context—it would allow them to expel students based on their sexuality or gender identity. As I have highlighted with the quotes from the young person that I have quoted today, students should not have to face the brunt of this discrimination based on their gender identity, on their sexuality or on any facet of their identity.


I am pleased that the government has come forward and said it will go further in terms of preventing discrimination against all these young people. Our young people in Australia deserve to have the opportunity to socialise and learn in a school environment without the fear of being discriminated against, without the fear of being bullied or harassed—and they should not be exposed to bullying and bigotry. As the quote I put forward highlights, we know that LGBTIQ children and young people suffer from higher rates of poor mental health and engaging in self-harm. This is due to the bullying they experience and the stigma attached to their sexuality and gender. As the report I quoted from just now highlights, young people themselves say that there's nothing intrinsic about being lesbian, gay or transgender that makes them feel that way; it is the prevailing views of society in regard to the way they present themselves and the stigma and discrimination they receive for their identity. So we have a very important duty of care to protect young people and not expose them to these kinds of harms.


I note that the Ruddock report also wants to provide religious schools with an ongoing ability to discriminate against staff or contractors on the basis of their sexuality or gender identity. Labor does not believe that schools should have an automatic, innate right to do this. An innate attribute should not be a ground for discrimination. I have seen many cases where LGBTIQ teachers have faced hidden and unspoken pressure to hide their sexuality lest they be found out and risk losing their jobs over their identity.


I don't want to see this debate mirror the toxic debate that came with the marriage equality debate. It stirred up a great deal of anxiety for LGBTIQ Australians, for parents and children, about whether we would ever be accepted and when those attacks would end. Happily, with the passing of marriage equality through this parliament, we did make a great step forward and we know very clearly the views of a majority of Australians on these issues.


We know that the Ruddock review was given to the government in May. It is now October. Supposedly, it's been kept from this place because it's covered by cabinet confidentiality, yet the government say cabinet has not even considered it. The Australian public deserve to know what is in that report. Why keep it a secret if it doesn't contain inflammatory and discriminatory content? The timing of the Wentworth by-election suggestions that this is a ploy by government to cling to the majority in their federal seats. You're trying to manage the potential backlash on both sides. Frankly, we just want to see this place have a mature and proper debate about the substantive issues here. Without the leaks from Fairfax we would never have known about these recommendations.


We have a Prime Minister who has ham-fistedly flip-flopped in his response to this report regarding the power religious schools would have to discriminate on the grounds of a student's sexuality or gender identity. The Prime Minister, when first asked about these recommendations, defended them. He defended them by pointing out that there are already existing laws allowing religious schools to turn away LGBTIQ students, and I take great offence at the attacks from those opposite that it was the Labor Party that entrenched this discrimination in the Sex Discrimination Act. These exemptions have existed since the Sex Discrimination Act was first put in place. They didn't exist so that religious schools and other institutions could discriminate against LGBTIQ people, because we weren't even in the act at that time. It was to allow continued discrimination on the basis of marital status, pregnancy and other attributes such as being divorced et cetera. The Prime Minister said nine times that he defended the existing recommendations of the Ruddock review. But I'm very pleased that we have moved on from that, because we don't want to see degrading legislation in our country.


I have to say many states have now moved to prevent discrimination and make it unlawful to allow schools to discriminate on the basis of sexuality or gender. Labor is against discrimination, and our laws should reflect this value. We are a tolerant and accepting nation. Discrimination against LGBTIQ people has no place in our national laws. We are, therefore, also committed to protecting LGBTIQ students and staff from being discriminated against by religious schools. Last year we voted for equality and fairness, not more discrimination. Our laws should apply equally regardless of what your faith is, where you come from or who you love.


I have, over many years, heard very real stories and experiences from LGBTIQ students and students with LGBTIQ parents about the discrimination they have faced in our schools. Let's make it clear: this is not just about the sexuality and gender of young people or the gender identity of children. It is also about the discrimination that young people have suffered because their parents might be trans or their parents might be in a same-sex relationship. I have had friends and family subjected to this kind of discrimination. It has caused great distress, caused significant mental health impacts and, at times, caused young people to leave school and not finish their education, with a lifelong impact on their future. In saying that, I know how real this is. In my own family, I have members who have experienced discrimination way back, a long time ago, in Catholic schools because they had a single mother and they were at a Catholic school. That discrimination then increased when the child turned out to be non-gender conforming and to be a lesbian, and she just didn't fit in with the school. Inevitably, along comes a change in school circumstances; but it has a lifelong impact on people. It undermines their capacity to continue and complete their education.


It has been said that most schools don't actively discriminate. I know of many schools, including religious schools, that have wonderful LGBTIQ inclusion policies and have LGBTIQ students who are very well accepted and supported within that school community. However, it's not the same in all schools, and the fact that schools currently retain the power to discriminate can mean that young people who are having a hard time with bullying don't always come forward to get the support that they need. The quote I started this speech with very firmly illustrates that.


We welcome removing exemptions in relation to children in religious schools, but we are very disappointed that the Prime Minister has rejected our suggestion that we should be removing the exemption for staff. As Labor's shadow assistant minister for equality, as a member of the LGBTIQ community and very much also as a parent who's co-parenting with other LGBTIQ people, I know how important these protections are not only for myself but for my child. I add to the community that no young person should be subjected to discrimination at school. Our children's right to an education must be our first and foremost responsibility. We need strong discrimination laws to ensure equal treatment.


I do acknowledge that this debate has other sides to it. It is about respecting the rights of parents to send children to the school of their choice and to have children educated in accordance with their religious convictions. We want to see young people worrying about their homework not living in fear of mistreatment because of who they are. We want to see Australia's young people protected.


The debate has exposed that there are fundamental rights and freedoms of Australians that are lacking recognition currently. I really want to thank the leadership of Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek for bringing forward this debate in relation to the discrimination faced by students and teachers. It is not only for students to be protected from discrimination but also for teachers. I know of too many teachers that have feared for their job security not just because of their LGBTI status but also because they are pregnant and unmarried. These are teachers who have conducted themselves in the school environment within the ethos of the school—totally within the ethos of the school. It just happens that in their personal and private lives they might be LGBTI, they might be unmarried or they might get pregnant outside of marriage, and it causes them great concern for their job security. This should not be the case in today's day and age. People should not have to be secretive about their personal life and identity at school. Work is such a major part of your life. You should not have to hide such fundamental parts of your life for fear of losing your job. These are wonderful teachers, dedicated to their school community, their students and their profession.


All schools need procedures for hiring and firing teachers and maintaining the quality of their teachers. There's a great deal of conduct that our schools cannot and should not tolerate, and the ethos of that kind of conduct will vary from school to school. Schools will have varying policies, and the ethos of each will vary based on its morals and educational ethos. For example, a religious school might need to sack a teacher because they refuse to stop teaching creationism in science classes—it might be outside the school's curriculum—or you might have a Scientologist teacher trying to recruit students at a Catholic school. There's nothing wrong with being a Scientologist or anything else—actually I don't like Scientology much—but if you don't overstep the mark, if you don't bring those attributes to the classroom, then you should stay out of harm's way within the ethos of that school.


There are many much worse ways in which teachers might create very real moral perils for school students. It could be because their conversations with students about sex are too overt, a female teacher talks about being attracted to male students or a teacher talks about, I don't know, visiting a sex worker. There are plenty of things that are morally wrong.


For some schools, promoting something like marriage equality within the school community might very much be outside the ethos of that particular school. But the intrinsic identity of a teacher or a student—who you are as an individual person—should not be grounds for discrimination, dismissal or the need to be performance managed in any way. There are many examples where the conduct of an otherwise good educator might fall outside a school's ethics and ethos. I remember when a male teacher formed a relationship with a female student at a school I attended, and both left the school. I know of an incident where someone I knew was kissed in a state school by a teacher of the same sex at a school formal. I think that at the time the secrecy attached to that teacher's lesbian identity within the school only contributed to her poor behaviour: 'you and me against the world'. If people can't be open about their identity and who they are within a school environment, then that's where risk comes from.


None of these very real moral perils can be dealt with by carve-outs in antidiscrimination law for non-government schools. Schools already need to manage these kinds of workplace and classroom performance issues for students who have teachers with poor boundaries or a poor moral compass or people who actively promote things that are in contradiction with the school's morals and ethics. But what is very clear to me is that the mere fact that someone speaks in an ordinary sense about themselves and their family, if they're acknowledged as being unmarried, divorced, gay, lesbian, transgender, intersex or in a same-sex relationship—that their family and status is known within the school community—should not be grounds for discrimination.

"Storer, Sen Timothy",IND,2018-10-17,"



Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (17:36):  I rise to support the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018. Late last year Australian voters overwhelmingly backed the abolition of laws preventing marriage equality. It was a reminder that on many issues the voters are well ahead of their elected representatives. A few months ago a YouGov Galaxy poll found that 82 per cent of those surveyed opposed laws currently allowing schools to expel students because of their sexual orientation. Nearly as many—79 per cent—opposed the ability of schools to sack teachers if they married people of the same sex. It is another sign that the voters are well in front of their elected representatives. As I've said before, I oppose any moves to increase discrimination against students and teachers based on their sexual orientation, and I am supporting this bill because it seeks to scrap current exemptions allowing some schools to discriminate against students, teachers and other staff on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identification.


This is not a theoretical problem. We have heard today, and I myself am aware, of schools where teachers, even principals, have had to hide their sexual orientation to avoid the sack. These were people who in some cases were committed Christians. These were teachers who were loved by their students and whose teaching and insights are remembered long after by the pupils they taught. This is not acceptable in a nation where gay marriage is now legal. Even so, there are still cases where teachers are being sacked for acknowledging that they are gay. One of these cases, reported by the ABC, involved Craig Campbell, a practising Christian who was employed as a teacher at a Baptist college south of Perth. He had previously been a student at the school, but his employment was terminated last year after he told the school that he was in a same-sex relationship. Speaking to the ABC, Mr Campbell wondered—legitimately, in my view—what existing laws allowing discrimination said about these schools and their attitude to religion. After all, as the Bible states in Paul's letter to the Galatians:


There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.


Mr Campbell asked:


What's the ultimate goal in not allowing these kids within your school?


Religious schools, their bigger purpose is to provide environments where kids can interact with their faith and so by excluding the students they lose that opportunity. To me, it seems nonsensical.


I could not agree more. It is beyond time to bring all schools in line with the prohibitions on sexual discrimination that operate elsewhere in society. It is high time that the laws allowing schools to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identification, martial status and pregnancy for students and staff are amended. I do hope that the Senate passes this legislation and that the government has the good sense to allow it to be debated in the other place so that it can become law. We do not want a repeat of the extreme words and actions that arose out of the marriage equality debate last year.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2018-10-17,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:39):  I rise today to speak on the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018, a bill put forward by my colleagues from the Greens, and particularly Senator Siewert, that seeks to amend the Sex Discrimination Act and the Fair Work Act. The objective of this bill, as we know, is to ensure that independent schools cannot reject either a student or a teacher based on their sexuality.


It's funny, I was reflecting as I was preparing for this how just over two years ago I came to this place thinking that my most valued and considered contributions would be economic—that I would stand in this place and speak with knowledge, authority and experience on tax, on superannuation, on investments, on banking or on property rights—and I find myself just over two years in, and here I've been talking about same-sex marriage and euthanasia and freedom of speech and now religious freedoms. It has taken me by surprise just how many of these issues have arisen in such a short space of time. I suppose, as a daughter of ageing parents, as a single woman who deals with the prejudices and preconceptions that that itself brings, as a sister of a teacher, and as a mother of school-aged children also on the cusp of adulthood, I find that—like all of us—even on issues in which I never used to think of myself as an expert, I have a contribution to make and a perspective to give. What an extraordinary privilege that is. I was particularly proud to contribute to those debates, and most particularly, I think, the same-sex marriage debate with Senator Smith. Some of those debates were highly emotional and emotive and very personal.


But I am also very proud to contribute to this debate, and I commend the sentiment of this legislation. Let me acknowledge the intent of Senator Siewert and the Greens in bringing this legislation forward today, because, of course, our priority here is children. Acting Deputy President, in approaching a debate such as this, it would be difficult to not first point out the profoundly meaningful statement of Harvey Milk—you will recall he was the first openly gay, publicly elected official in the state of California—who in 1977 said:


All young people, regardless of sexual orientation or identity, deserve a safe and supportive environment in which to achieve their full potential.


I genuinely appreciate the concern we all share for our children; indeed, my concern for my own is never far away. Australia's education system must secure our children from discrimination. That is why the government has worked very effectively already to reach this outcome—because, like Harvey Milk, like the most reasonable and fair-minded citizens, we seek an education system where our young people have the opportunity to reach their full potential. The suggestion otherwise—that they might not be protected—is unacceptable and, indeed, it is unthinkable. We all agree on this, and the suggestion that we don't agree on this is, quite frankly, an insult.


It is imperative to protect children from acceptance or rejection from a school on the basis of their sexuality. Such a notion is out of step with the values of parents, with school communities, with religious communities and with society. As a government, our first responsibility, we must remind ourselves, is to generations to come, and on this we can, mercifully, all agree.


It's worth reflecting on what led us here. The Ruddock review was commissioned by this government to examine where religious freedoms may be limited in contemporary legislation. Many of the arguments regarding the Ruddock review have been well canvassed. It requires re-emphasis, though, to remind the chamber that this was a report to government, not a report by government, that advocates protections for students from discrimination. That report has not yet been released. It has not yet been published. It has not yet been considered by cabinet. I personally haven't read it. What we have seen of the Ruddock review proposes restrictions to the laws introduced by the previous Labor government, which gave religious schools greater ability to expel students where the school considered it was necessary according to the doctrines of the religion in question.


I remind the Senate again that I have not read the Ruddock review in full; however, it is potentially worth drawing the attention of the chamber to recommendation 8, which we have seen published. It says:


Jurisdictions should abolish any exceptions to anti-discrimination laws that provide for discrimination by religious schools with respect to students on the basis of race, disability, pregnancy or intersex status.


Few people would find disagreement with that view because it goes to the heart of ensuring that Australia remains a tolerant and cohesive society, and a cohesive democracy. This government aims to balance the rights between religious freedom and freedom of conscience fairly with the right of our children to be free from discrimination. So let me reiterate my colleague Senator Paterson's sentiments that it's time to consider the report holistically and that's the only responsible response to the Ruddock review.


I'd also like to briefly reflect on the educational environment in Australia. We are so extraordinarily lucky in this country to have the education system that we have, not that it's perfect by any stretch. There is still much work to be done to ensure that our educational standards reflect our prosperity, our opportunity and the modern economy and flourishing democracy that we enjoy. But we are very lucky, largely because we have choice. We have a state education system that guarantees every child a quality education from prep right through to year 12, complimented by an independent education system that provides families with alternatives that better suit their personal priorities, objectives and values. Those schools have different fee structures and are subsidised to better ensure that they are accessible to families and communities that align with them. That choice is a very precious thing; not all countries have it. It is something that we cherish, and it is something that we should continue to nurture. It reflects the fundamental truth that parents and families are the people best placed to make decisions on behalf of their children. Parents know what's best for their children, not government.


As many in the chamber would know and as I mentioned earlier, I have three children—three teenagers all at various stages of adolescence, some of it uglier than others. They are all of school age. Their father and I made the decision a long time ago to send them to an independent school that reflected the values we held dear, and we've been very happy with that decision. The schools they go to are quite old and traditional, but their values are timeless and their attitudes are contemporary. They seek to create an environment of not just tolerance, which is a word I actively dislike—tolerance is something that you have for something you find distasteful or ugly. I prefer that my children's school creates a culture of acceptance and understanding, and values the contribution of every member of that school community. So my boys are at an Anglican school. They have a chapel and they have a chaplain. They also have a gay-straight alliance, which is a senior school student-led group. It works to break down stereotypes and build inclusiveness across peer groups, and that's something I value. Like many other contemporary schools, their faith is quite central to their values, but the school community makes it clear that it appreciates that diverse viewpoints and identities are what connect us all to the lives and experiences of others. They build our capacity for empathy and understanding, and they're what challenge our ideas about people and society, and that's what I want for my children. It may not be for every family. That's fine. That's what choice is all about, and that was the choice for my family. I don't believe it's an ethos that's particularly uncommon in contemporary independent schools.


It is the responsibility of government, however, to protect children, and that is exactly what we're doing. Our government does not support the expulsion of students from religious non-state schools on the basis of their sexuality. That is a view that, as I've said, is widely shared across our country. It is a view that is in line with community expectations. As a government, we are taking actions to ensure that amendments are introduced as soon as practicable to make it clear that no student of a non-state school should be expelled on the basis of their sexuality. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been unequivocal that we are here to ensure children are at the centre of our considerations of these issues. The law that we currently have, which the Labor Party brought in, doesn't do that.


There are wider implications which I wouldn't mind talking through in a little more detail. With the media attention and sensationalism around this topic we seem to have glossed over the reality that religious schools are not campaigning for the freedom to expel students on the basis of sexuality; in fact they have come out in support of amendments to protect against such a thing, rejecting the efforts of certain members of this parliament to sensationalise for their own political agenda, a very disappointing behaviour indeed. Let's imagine in some alternative universe that schools had the luxury of pondering on the sexuality of their students rather than focusing on delivering quality education. Let's imagine that teachers and even principals were out there expelling students willy-nilly on this basis and no other. Do members here genuinely believe the wider school community would accept this? Of course not. Would Australians accept this? Of course they wouldn't. There would be complete and utter outrage, and rightly so. We won't support the politicisation of our school students and we won't allow the Greens to make this an issue. We won't allow them to try to pit Australians against each other.


Independent and religious schools receive public funding and as such have a responsibility to operate in line with community and legal expectations, and they do. The gap in this legislation can be dealt with quickly and effectively, and that's what we will do. I am very proud of the fact that we're working constructively for our children on this issue, because we have that responsibility to determine the boundary to protect our most vulnerable. We have a responsibility to ensure legal protections are in place that protect children from any type of discrimination in a world that's becoming increasingly polarised. I need not labour the point that many children are struggling with their sexual identity and often face incredible pressures and even sometimes violence. Some may not even know that they face this as a result of sexuality, and they face unsafe and unsupportive environments that are confusing and quite traumatic. It would be unthinkable that this government or any would allow this to continue. That's why we're taking the steps that we are taking to end the right of any school to discriminate against students.


This is a consensus that we have reached. It is unfortunate that the Greens persist in waging a divisive campaign of identity politics. It is also our duty to respect parental choice. This is particularly important. The legislation that we have before us today seeks to go further than just protecting children; it seeks to compel religious schools to either hire or not release teachers who may not adhere to the religious values of that school. Let me go back to my own children's experience. There are so many different types of schools with hundreds of variations represented, but every school wants the same thing from their staff: passionate teachers that share the school's values and are committed to shaping students' futures, preparing our children for fulfilling and meaningful lives in which they are able to make a contribution. I know that my children's school, an Anglican school that values its faith and religion, has a number of teachers that would identify as LGBTIQ. That made no difference to my children's quality of education. Indeed sometimes I believe it may well have enhanced it.


I know that the call to protect teachers comes from a good place, and again I tip my hat to the Greens. I know their intentions here are good if not a little bit politically opportunistic, but teachers are adults, and they choose to work at the workplaces they do, where their values are reflected and their skill sets are valued. School communities are made up of adults who choose their teachers based on their values and skill sets, and teachers are adults who make that choice as well. This legislation treats both teachers and school communities not like the adults that they are but like the children that they teach, in need of protection by the state through rules set out by those who know better. I object to that patronising assumption that, without this legislation, suddenly LGBTIQ teachers will be persecuted or at risk, and that, unless the government and Big Brother comes in and prevents it, schools and school communities who today have shown no signs of discrimination in the hiring and firing of staff and value their teachers for the skills that they bring will suddenly tomorrow become laden with prejudice and intolerance, in need of laws to restrain their newly discovered bigotry and homophobia. As Liberals, we are always reluctant to legislate for a problem that doesn't exist. I am genuinely concerned that this is one of those times.


More importantly, though, I object to the implication in part of this legislation that there is an us-and-them mentality, that Australia is divided somehow into those who are tolerant and those who are waiting on the opportunity to persecute those of whom they disapprove. I have a much higher opinion of the common sense of school communities, religious groups and, indeed, all Australians than do my colleagues in the Greens. The government's position is that we need not conflate protecting young children from expulsion with the employment practices of adults. That conflation is opportunistic, it is intolerant and it is contemptuous.


The Ruddock review still hasn't been made public. It hasn't been considered appropriately by cabinet and, when it is considered, we will make recommendations in an objective and fulsome manner. The government will then choose which recommendations it agrees with and which it does not and it will act accordingly. It is not unreasonable, as the coalition asks, that we are given appropriate time and space in which to do this. Australians hold their freedoms very dear, whether it be freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press or freedom to pursue the faith of their choice without retribution or obstruction. Legislating for or against freedoms is not something that should ever be done lightly, hastily or thoughtlessly or, dare I say, motivated solely politically. 


My personal position is that teachers play such an important role in the lives of our children. They are educators, they are the tough cop on the beat and they are boundary setters, role models, mentors and inspirations. They are the bows from which are children, as living arrows, are sent forth. A person's sexuality should not be a consideration when judging somebody's moral worth. On this, we can agree. And, on this, independent schools already agree. Protecting our children is a clear responsibility of government and, indeed, it is a responsibility of society as a whole. The government is taking action to ensure that there are amendments introduced to the Sex Discrimination Act as soon as possible to make it clear that no student of a non-state school should be expelled on the basis of their sexuality. The Attorney-General is preparing those amendments right now, and the opposition will be consulted as a part of that process.


There are plenty of issues in this place on which our politicians across the divide disagree.

Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (17:58):  I present the report of the Education and Employment References Committee on industrial deaths in Australia, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee. I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This is an important report on industrial manslaughter. In tabling this report, I'd like to acknowledge the many families that are here in the public gallery today. These families are here because someone they loved dearly was killed at work and never came home. These families have travelled here at their own expense from all over Australia, including New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. They are here because they do not want other families to experience the suffering that they have. They are here because they are demanding change. Like all the families who participated in this inquiry, they have endured and are still enduring immense pain, anguish, grief and anger. The human impact of an industrial death is catastrophic and far reaching. For the families and friends of those individuals killed at work, the terrible and profound human cost and associated consequences they must suffer are lifelong and often all-consuming. The committee is keenly aware that the retelling of traumatic experience takes an emotional and physical toll. On behalf of my fellow committee members, I sincerely thank all the families for their courage and strength in sharing their stories and concerns, which have informed our deliberations on this very important topic.


I'd particularly like to acknowledge the advocacy of Mrs Kay Catanzariti, who is here in the gallery today. Kay's 21-year-old son Ben was tragically killed on a Canberra construction site in 2012. Kay has been tireless in her campaign to raise awareness of the issues impacting families with loved ones who never came home from work. Her lobbying efforts were instrumental in the referral of this inquiry, and she is highly committed to seeking legislative and regulatory change to improve the frameworks surrounding industrial deaths. I applaud her determination and strength in speaking out.


Safe Work advises that, as of 4 October, there have been 97 Australian workers killed at work in 2018. This is unacceptable. These workers and the thousands of workers killed before them did not go to war; they simply went to work. Every single workplace death is preventable. No-one should go to work and not come home. It is unacceptable that a rise in precarious employment practices and the pursuit by many companies of profit at any cost has led, in too many instances, to a corporate culture with a reckless disregard for the welfare of workers. We need to change the way workers are treated. Workers should never be treated as mere disposable assets. Workers must be treated with a proper regard for their workplace rights and safety. During the course of this inquiry, it became clear that the current legislative regulatory framework for dealing with workplace deaths is grossly inadequate.


Employers that disregard the risks to the lives of their workers and whose conduct negligently causes the death of a worker must be held responsible for such destructive behaviour. It is absolutely necessary for corporate entities to be held accountable for their actions, including facing prosecution for industrial manslaughter for the worst examples of corporate or individual behaviour. For those organisations that wilfully flout the existing work health and safety arrangements and whose actions result in a catastrophic outcome of loss of life, it is entirely warranted that serious consequences flow. This is particularly the case in organisations which are considered to be repeat offenders. This is why the committee recommends that Safe Work Australia, with the Commonwealth, state and territory governments, introduces a nationally consistent industrial manslaughter offence into the model work health and safety laws, using the current Queensland laws as a starting point. We believe that the offence of industrial manslaughter will send a clear message about the Australian community's expectations of safety in the workplace. Corporations must be held accountable both morally and legally. Where appropriate, the corporate veil must be pierced.


Another matter raised during the inquiry relating to the accountability of corporations was the existence of insurance policies designed to indemnify corporations and individual directors against financial penalties handed down for criminal breaches of the work health and safety legislation. Companies that take out this directors and officers insurance show an inexcusable disregard for the consequences of their actions. This behaviour in itself is reprehensible. Given that the prospect of personal liability for work health and safety breaches is one of the core drivers for the improvement of corporate safety culture, the committee has concluded that there is an urgent need to resolve this issue. The committee recommends that the model work health and safety legislation be swiftly amended to make it clear that contracts which purport to offer insurance against criminal penalties are unenforceable and illegal.


During the inquiry, the committee was disappointed to hear that investigations into industrial deaths were often compromised in terms of the duration of the investigation, the quality of the investigation process and some investigators' attitudes towards the investigation itself.


I draw a comparison between the way an industrial death is investigated and the way a road vehicle accident death is investigated. The road vehicle accident death is treated as a crime scene and the incident is investigated on the basis that it may lead to criminal charges. The life of a worker is no less precious during their working hours than it is during their commute to work, yet evidence provided to the committee indicates that such a rigorous and professional investigative approach is not equally applied to industrial deaths.


The committee finds it imperative that the work health and safety regulators and law enforcement agencies undertaking the investigation of an industrial death do so with the correct attitude—that is, that the death they are investigating is potentially a criminal matter, not merely an accident. 


This is why the committee recommends that Safe Work Australia work with work health and safety regulators in each jurisdiction to develop a policy that stipulates that all industrial deaths must be investigated as a potential crime scene.


The committee also recommends that Safe Work Australia work with the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and work health and safety regulators to develop and deliver standardised training modules for investigators. The committee hopes this will ensure all investigators have the appropriate skills, experience and attitude to carry out timely, high-quality investigations of industrial deaths and other serious breaches of work health and safety laws.


Throughout this inquiry the committee heard many compelling stories from families forced to navigate the myriad of complex formal processes that follow an industrial death, all while dealing with overwhelming grief and other mental, physical and financial burdens. 


Guided by these insights, the committee is making a number of recommendations aimed at improving the system for families. For example, the committee is recommending that Safe Work Australia work with the work health and safety regulators in each jurisdiction to identify and formalise family outreach mechanisms so that all impacted families are provided with the information and support they require in a timely manner. The committee is also recommending that each jurisdiction make funding available for a range of mental health and counselling support options, including in rural and regional areas. 


I am hopeful that, if implemented, these and other recommended measures will lead to greater support and transparency for these families who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in incredibly distressing and difficult circumstances.


This has been a comprehensive inquiry and the committee has made 34 recommendations. I would urge governments and policymakers to look carefully at the committee's recommendations and to consider seriously their implementation. Change is required so that no worker goes to work in Australia and then does not come home. 


I would like to once again thank all the individuals, families and organisations who assisted the committee during this inquiry. I would also like to thank my colleagues on their committee for their work over the past seven months. I would also like to give my very genuine thanks to the committee secretariat staff for again assisting in putting together what I think is a comprehensive and high-quality report. I now commend this report to the Senate.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2018-10-17,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (18:08):  As Deputy Chair of the Education and Employment References Committee I rise to briefly add some remarks on the same committee report. I certainly wish to associate myself with the remarks of Senator Marshall vis-a-vis the extraordinary work put in by the secretariat and by all our colleagues who participated in the inquiry. I have recently been appointed as deputy chair, so I was not participating throughout this inquiry. I only came along to the last hearing once I had joined the committee. But, from reading the transcripts of what had transpired beforehand, you certainly get a very strong sense that the situations that were being investigated and looked at by the committee were deeply, deeply harrowing for the families involved. Losing a loved one in an industrial accident is always going to be a tragedy, and nothing can help those people overcome that loss.


But I do wish to acknowledge all the work that went into the committee report. I thank the secretariat and thank all my fellow committee members. The report and its findings are an important step forward in the area of workplace health and safety. Workplace related injuries and illness carry significant tangible costs to the community, individuals, family, workmates and workplaces. The health and safety of workers is of the utmost importance to all, particularly the prevention of serious injuries and deaths in Australian workplaces. It has to be a fundamental objective of Australian safety laws and associated frameworks to ensure that all workers come home safely after every day at work.


The inquiry has taken into consideration extensive evidence from a wide range of sources and witnesses, including many of those who have lost loved ones. We have listened carefully to the evidence by family members, colleagues and friends of those who have died, and we thank them for their courage in sharing their stories and experiences. Their willingness to share these very painful experiences has been critical in helping our understanding of the importance of support for victims' families, and that I think is one of the key sets of recommendations to come out of this report.


There were a diverse range of views and approaches presented on the adequacy of the current framework surrounding prevention, investigation and prosecution of industrial deaths in Australia. Whilst coalition senators support many of the recommendations in the report, there are some that we support in part and there are others that we are not able to support. We believe that the key here is to have the most effective policy response to achieve the best outcome. And more Commonwealth law is not always the way to do that, particularly when you're looking at an ongoing harmonisation of a series of state jurisdictions where the states have significant responsibilities in this area.


It is also worth noting that we have seen a reduction in industrial deaths in workplace fatalities over the last decade. Yes, absolutely, any death is one death too many, but it is at least a positive to say that workplace fatalities have fallen by almost 50 per cent over that period of time.


Again, I wish to thank all my colleagues, but most particularly I wish to thank all those who gave evidence to the inquiry, particularly those who lost a loved one in an industrial accident. Thank you.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2018-10-17,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (18:12):  Every family should expect that their loved ones return home at the end of their shift or at the end of their day's work, but for the families of approximately 200 workers in Australia each year this doesn't happen. The impact of a death at work is devastating for families and it's devastating for the wider community and the economy as well.


The committee heard from parents, children, partners and loved ones, and I've got to say at times it was hard to listen, but I felt very privileged that the people, the witnesses, many of whom are up in the gallery today, gave that evidence to us. I felt very privileged to be on that committee and to be able to hear that evidence, because it's not easy to do—it's not easy to stand up and talk to someone about the grief you're feeling. For them to have done that is just so highly commendable. But we can and we must do better, and we know that.


While I remember, I'd also like to thank the secretariat involved in this committee, because I don't think it was easy for them to sit and hear the evidence every day either, and they did such a sterling effort, as they always do.


This committee report makes 34 recommendations, which the committee believes will make workplaces across the country safer. As Senator Marshall said, the report was quite extensive, so today I'll only have the time to address a few of the issues raised. The committee held eight public hearings across Australia, including in Hobart in my home state of Tasmania. From evidence given by the ETU at the Tasmania hearing we know that Tasmania has the second highest fatality rate in the country, behind the Northern Territory, and nearly double the third highest jurisdictions of Queensland and Western Australia. We have to ask why the rates are so high in Tasmania. Tasmania has the highest rates of fatalities in agriculture, forestry and fishing as well as in the public sector. So I would urge the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian governments to work together in ending this human tragedy.


Nationwide in 2016 almost 70 per cent of worker fatalities occurred in just three industries: the transport, postal and warehousing industries, with 47 fatalities. There were 44 worker fatalities in the agricultural, forestry and fishing industries and 35 worker fatalities in the construction industry. Of course, some occupations, like truck driving, are particularly dangerous, and I spoke earlier today with regard to that.


In their submission to the committee, the Transport Workers' Union quoted Professor Ann Williamson as saying: 


Heavy trucks are disproportionately involved in fatal crashes on our roads and the trucking industry represents the highest number of work related fatalities across all industries in Australia.


Their submission went on to say:


During the 12 months to the end of March 2008, 184 people were killed in 163 fatal crashes involving heavy trucks, with fatal crashes involving heavy rigid trucks increasing. 


Any truck driver or TWU official knows of the high rate of industrial deaths in that industry. One of the truck drivers, John Waltis, told the committee in Sydney:


I've been in the industry for over 40 years and, yes, we had accidents back in the early days, 40-odd years ago, but nowhere near as many as what we're having now, and it is because of the undue pressure put on the drivers through the corporations or the companies they subcontract to do the work.


…   …   … 


I have known of over 50 deaths in the industry because I've been in it such a long time. I don't want to see one more. 


I too share the belief that too many truck drivers are dying on the road, and I don't think the government's done enough to reduce that tragic statistic. While some Safe Work Australia figures argue that the number of industrial deaths in Australia is declining, even one work related death is one too many, and these figures aren't declining fast enough.


We're also seeing many deaths occurring due to occupational exposure to substances that result in industrial diseases which ultimately lead to the workers' deaths, such as asbestosis, mesothelioma and black lung disease. A witness at the Hobart hearing, Trevor Gauld, from the Electrical Trades Union, outlined why he felt the Safe Work Australia figures were misleading. He said: 


What we're seeing is latent illnesses; cancer clusters and these sorts of things—long-term exposures to chemicals. It's different industries. For whatever reason, as you're aware, Senator, your government did the things it did around manufacturing and we have less of that now. So it's a different risk profile. I think what the statistics show is that change; they don't show a decline.


He also said:


It's not that I don't accept the figures; I just think that they mischaracterise the circumstances. We have a significant increase in the change of the modes of employment, for example, and the way that that might get counted, as opposed to someone being deemed an employee or not deemed an employee. We also have issues around the way Safe Work Australia captures that data. All the jurisdictions don't feed the same data in. So what's classed as a workplace fatality in one jurisdiction isn't necessarily classed as a workplace fatality in the Safe Work Australia statistical data capture—the datasets that they gather.


Given that, the committee recommends that Safe Work Australia expand the work-related traumatic injury fatalities dataset to capture data on deaths resulting from industrial diseases.


One of the issues that challenge employers, employees and unions alike is that there are variances in work health and safety laws across jurisdictions. While Australia has a set of model work health and safety laws developed in 2011 by Safe Work Australia, they have not been implemented in Victoria and Western Australia. The aim of the work health and safety model laws is to provide all workers in Australia with the same standard of health and safety protection regardless of the work they do or where they work. The model work health and safety laws comprise the Model Work Health and Safety Act, the Model Work Health and Safety Regulations and the model codes of practice. In addition, a state or territory can also elect to amend the model laws as they apply in their own jurisdictions. Given this situation, the committee recommends that Safe Work Australia maintain a public list of amendments that jurisdictions make to the model work health and safety laws.


One of the first things you need to improve a situation is data that accurately reflects what is happening. The committee found that Safe Work Australia data in relation to compliance enforcement activity does not reflect the prosecution outcomes for industrial deaths, which are a smaller but unqualified subset of disaggregated work health and safety data. The committee is of the strong opinion that Safe Work Australia must work with each jurisdiction to collect and maintain a dataset with more detailed information on the prosecution processes and outcomes of industrial death incidents.


The changing nature of work is having a dramatic and negative impact on the safety of work. The committee heard that the rise of precarious employment practices had led to a corporate culture where there is a distinct lack of care for the safety of workers. Maurice Blackburn, in their submission, detailed the situation:


Over the past two decades, business operators have continued to find new ways to avoid their responsibilities under Fair Work legislation and other legal and regulatory structures, including WHS and workers’ compensation frameworks. ‘Gig economy’, sham contract and labour hire arrangements require the service provider to be a self-employed independent contractor, rather than an employee, thereby abrogating the business operators of employer responsibilities.


…   …   …


By insisting that people who work for them be self-employed independent contractors, business operators avoid having to take responsibility for the provision of safety nets that Australians have come to expect, including the right to be safe at work.


The committee is persuaded by the evidence that there are negative safety implications relating to the increased use of temporary and labour hire workers and other forms of precarious work. Additionally, the committee agrees that the rise of such precarious employment practices has led in some instances to a corporate culture where there exists a distinct lack of care for the safety of the worker.


Although nothing will bring back those who have lost their lives or even ease the heartbreak, the committee made a number of recommendations to improve the use of compliance and enforcement tools and penalties for breaches of work health and safety laws, which can vary greatly from state to state. And we have to ask: why is a life in one state or territory worth more than in another state? As I mentioned at the beginning of my contribution, the report and the recommendations are too long to cover in their entirety in the short time allocated to me, but the gist of the report is this: too many Australians are dying at work. We can and we must do better as a nation.


As an aside, this morning I met a young lad whose name is Charlie. Charlie was up in the gallery a minute ago. Charlie is 16 months old, and I was devastated to hear, when I was talking to Charlie's mum, that Charlie's grandad died six months ago, as an industrial death. I have thought all afternoon about what Charlie will miss out on by not having his grandad around. He won't have his grandad at his birthday parties or at Christmas time. He won't have his grandad to share all those special moments that grandads share. I say to Charlie's family and to all the other witnesses up in the gallery: we can't quite feel your pain, of course, but we do really want to make a difference. I think that this committee has worked really hard to come up with recommendations that will make a difference.


We've got the report. It's now up to the Commonwealth government and governments around the nation to adopt its recommendations. It's the least that we can do and the least that we owe those hundreds of Australians who die at work unnecessarily each year.

"Faruqi, Sen Mehreen",AG,2018-10-17,"



Senator FARUQI
 (New South Wales) (18:22):  I rise on behalf of the Greens to speak on the report on the inquiry into the prevention, investigation and prosecution of industrial deaths in Australia. This inquiry was much needed because the safety of our workers is of utmost importance. We really must have zero tolerance for work related deaths. I started my working life as a civil and structural engineer, so I do know firsthand the dangers that lurk on construction sites, which are among the deadliest sites for workers. There is absolutely no excuse for employers to not provide a safe workplace and there should be zero tolerance for negligent behaviour on worksites. It is quite apt, I must say, that the committee is handing down its report during National Safe Work Month, but, of course, safety should be a priority not just in October but every single day.


The Australian Greens do welcome the inquiry and support the recommendations made by the committee. Most importantly, this report is a move towards creating a new offence for industrial manslaughter, which has long been Greens policy. Grieving families and friends have long demanded this change, and it gives me hope when I see the other political parties also becoming receptive to this. As a general principle, the Greens have a preference for a model that puts industrial manslaughter into the Crimes Act. But, through this inquiry, I also note the broad support for the Queensland model, and the Greens welcome moves to have this extended throughout Australia.


Another very important aspect of this issue is how industrial deaths are actually defined. The definition needs to be broadened to include all work related deaths, not just traumatic fatalities. This includes, in particular, deaths caused by work related diseases, which the recommendations address, and suicides should also be covered. This would much more accurately reflect the impact on workers and would allow their families to access appropriate remedies. Consideration of workers who die by suicide, particularly after poor handling of compensation claims, is also currently inadequate and should be addressed in any new reforms. 


Further, there is also a very strong case for the collection of data and statistics regarding industrial deaths. The statistics we get from Safe Work Australia, as has been said earlier, do not accurately reflect the scale of work related deaths that actually occur in Australia. The Australian Council of Trade Unions raised these concerns with the committee, saying the current state of our data continues to result in an underestimation of the true extent of work related deaths, including those arising from work related diseases. The fact of the matter is that any work related death should not only be counted but also be completely unacceptable. 


With respect to recommendation 31 regarding the establishment of pro bono legal assistance to families during coronial inquests, we think this should be extended to include 'and any other assistance deemed necessary'. We are aware of cases where even accessing inquests has been particularly difficult, because of financial constraints, for example. 


This inquiry was nearing its end when I joined the Senate. But, in my brief participation in the inquiry, I met with Ms Robyn Colson, whose 24-year-old son, David James Colson, was killed in a workplace incident on 8 October 2007. This month marks 11 years since Ms Colson lost her son—a tragedy, the scale of which, of course, is unimaginable to anyone who has not gone through something like this. David was an abalone diver in Tasmania. However, on this particular day, he was working as a deckhand for another abalone diver. Ms Colson told us at the inquiry hearing:


The boat he was working on sank and he swam for 5½ hours before dying of hypothermia. He was a wonderful person who did not deserve to have his life stolen from him. Losing a child this way is unlike any other type of grief and it is permanent. A part of our soul is missing. We live a divided life: the time before the workplace accident and the time after. 


This is heartbreaking, but what happened next didn't make it any easier on the Colson family. The coronial inquest into David's death took so long that the family could never bring criminal charges, as the limitation period for prosecutions had expired. This is quite an unacceptable situation and further highlights the inadequacy of our work health and safety laws. Other families also spoke about coronial inquests taking a long time and extending their anguish, with no answers at hand and no-one held responsible. 


I do hope the government adopts all the recommendations of this report, but, more importantly, that they implement them speedily and act on them. The friends and families of people whose loved ones have suffered industrial deaths want the government to make strong reforms and make them now. Some of them are here today in this chamber, and I welcome them here. It was my absolute privilege to meet them earlier this afternoon, and I thank them for the immense amount of courage and strength that they have shown to push for workplace safety reforms so that no-one else has to go through the trauma and heartbreak that they have. 


For the families, friends and loved ones of those people who have been killed at work or who have died as a result of workplace related disease and suicide, the heartbreak, pain and anguish are lifelong realities. This inquiry and the resulting recommendations are a welcome step in fixing our laws. It is also important that adequate funding and resources are directed towards work health and safety regulators, who can then ensure compliance and allow for more effective preventative measures to be put in place, because our aim should be absolutely zero work related deaths. Every worker has a right to a safe workplace, and they deserve to come back home safe, healthy and well from work.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (18:29):  I rise to make my contribution on the arrival in this chamber of this very significant report on industrial deaths. I acknowledge those who have travelled here, physically, from New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and as far away as Western Australia, but the journeys that you've undertaken with your bodies are nothing in comparison to the journeys of the heart that you're undertaking right now. 


I want to particularly acknowledge one woman who's sitting up there, Mrs Kay Catanzariti, who, in a great leap of hope in a time when politics is treated in our media and in our society as an instrument that can deliver nothing except conflict, contacted Senator Marshall, a Labor senator from the great state of Victoria—not as great as New South Wales, of course, but he had an open heart, open ears and a willingness to work on this issue, which has plagued this nation for far too long.


We heard from Senator Bilyk that 200-plus people die per year. As one of the parents said earlier today in a meeting that we had at nine o'clock in Bill Shorten's office, 'Australians accept deaths in the workplace.' That is a chilling sentence, and we can no longer allow that culture to prevail. That is what this report is addressing—that cultural reality that we live with today.


You are here today as citizens in a democracy making history. You're in a historic building. I know that you just think you're ordinary Australians, but this is what's great about this country. Ordinary Australians, when we stand up for what we believe in and fight for what's right, can do amazing things. You've already done amazing things, and now we will try to do our best with what you have given us.


Words matter. It will surprise you, as it often surprises me, that across this nation right now there will be hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people who are listening as they're driving home from work—happily, I hope—to their families, and they'll hear what we're doing here. So today, in preparing my speech for this moment, I thought: what words could I say? We talk about the work ahead of us, and I acknowledge the great contributions of the senators who have spoken here before me this evening, but I'm going to do what I can to get as many of your words on the record as possible, because they were so powerful. I'm sure some of you sat in English classes and thought you'd never have the gift of the gab and you'd never say things that would matter, but I'm going to try to read as much as I can of what you gave us into the Hansard record to be part of the history of this nation, because you've done something very powerful and significant by participating in this inquiry and bringing it to be. Mr Jack Brownlee was killed at work in 2018, aged 21. Dave and Janine Brownlee, his mum and dad, are here. Mr Dave Brownlee, I bet you don't even remember what you said, but this is just a bit of what you put on the record, and it was pretty amazing, because truth has a voice:


I'm here with my wife and also representing my two sons, Mitchell Brownlee and Jack Brownlee. Jack was 21 years old, and he will always be 21 years old. He will never age. He went to work on 21 March and was caught in a trench collapse that covered the boy up to his neck, with one arm free. About 9.30 on that day was the last time they—


Jack and his co-worker Charlie Howkins—


were seen and they weren't found until 11.30. They weren't rescued until 2.30. In the first two hours, Jack would have had the most horrific time. His mate—


Charlie Howkins, Lana Cormie's husband—


was dead beside him, metres away.


Jack would have been screaming for help, and the other boys were at smoko. They were left on their own. There was no supervision of these boys. There was nothing. At the time, I was at the hospital with my wife, who was suffering severe migraines. We received no phone call from the company until 5.30 that afternoon.


Beforehand, I had a friend who worked in Geelong. He rang me and informed me. Things were on Facebook about a trench collapse in Ballarat and he thought our son Jack was involved. I raced up there to the site and was met at the roadblock by the police. We weren't allowed in. Jack had just been evacuated, they said, and they were putting him in an induced coma. I was informed by the police that the best thing to do was to hightail down to Melbourne and meet him at the hospital. We still had not heard from the company.


This is an excerpt of what Mrs Janine Brownlee said:


The hardest thing for us was to leave our son and drive home. The hardest thing was to drive there in the first place, getting updates telling us, 'Hurry up. Your son mightn't make it.' And then the hardest thing was to drive home the next day, leaving our boy at the hospital. That was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do: knowing he was there on his own; leaving my baby there … Things need to change. How we were treated was so wrong.


Mr Charlie Howkins was killed at work in 2018, aged 34. His wife is here, Dr Lana Cormie. She said:


I am a doctor of veterinary science and I am married to Charlie Howkins, who was a registered building practitioner and worked in civil construction at the time of his death. I am—and we were—parents to two small children: Sophie, who is four, and George, who is one year old. Charlie went to work one day in March and he never came home. He became just another of the dead bodies which are carried out of a workplace every second day in Australia. Words simply cannot do justice to the devastation which has followed. His death is a result of a failure in the culture, values, systems and laws of our country. What is left in the wake of this failure is our broken family.


Mr Robert Cunico was killed at work in 2018, aged 60. Robert's daughter, Ms Ashlea Castle, is here and so is his wife, Debby Cunico. Ms Castle said:


My dad lived for almost an hour in the most horrific conditions while being cradled in the arms of a colleague before succumbing to his injuries. Despite the efforts made by the first responders and emergency services, his injuries were so catastrophic that he was never going to survive. My father should never have sustained even a paper cut whilst he was on the job, let alone injuries so severe that his life was ended. My dad was a son, a brother, a husband, a father, a grandfather, an uncle and a friend to many.


Mr Luke Murrie was killed at work in 2007, aged 22. Luke's parents, Mark and Janice Murrie, are here. Mr Murrie said:


Luke was 22 when he was killed. He was killed in an unsafe work environment where inexperienced workers were instructed to do an unsafe lift. The unsafe method was quicker and therefore it was cheaper. There was no meaningful deterrent for the employer to do it safely. He put the dollar before safety.


Mr Ben Catanzariti was killed at work in 2012, aged 21. His parents, Kay and Barney, are here today. Kay said:


I'm here today not by choice. I'm here because my son Ben, who was 21 years old … was killed when a 39-metre, three-tonne concrete boom collapsed and crushed his skull in 2012. You senators have chosen this career to represent the Australian people first and foremost, to listen and to protect all Australians and take responsibility for their health and wellbeing in our ever-changing world, and we need to unite regardless of which party we belong to. We are all the same. We are human beings. We have the right to live our lives without fear of going to work and not coming home.


Mr Jason Garrels was killed at work in 2012, aged 20. Jason's parents, Michael and Lee Garrels, are here. Lee said:


My son Jason Garrels aged 20 was fatally electrocuted on the 27th February 2012 in Clermont, Queensland. My son was employed as a labourer for approx 9 days with Daytona Trading Pty Ltd … I went to assist at the resuscitation not knowing it was my son. Words cannot describe the impact that it has had on me and my family; I was thrown into a life that was a surreal nightmare which became my reality.


I want to acknowledge: Mr Glen Biddle, killed at work in 2007, aged 39, and his sister Shauna; Iremar Moussa, killed at work in 2016, aged 55, and wife Linda; Mr Jarrod Hampton—Troy and Robert Hampton are here today; Mr Daniel Bradshaw, killed at work in 2017, aged 37; Mr Jayden Zappelli, killed at work in 2013, aged 18, and his father, Greg; Mr Chris Patrick, killed at work in 2014, aged 25, and his partner, Christiana Paterson and Mr Wesley Ballantine, killed at work, aged 17, and his mother, Regan Ballantine. Thank you for coming to be here today for the reception of this report. Thank you for your work as Australians. We honour you and we'll do what we can.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-10-17,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:39):  I was not intending to speak on this report. I happen to be here for chamber duty. But listening to those very forceful contributions from senators, I thought that as a former national union official and someone who has witnessed workers being killed and who had to talk to their families I just had to say a few things about this report on industrial deaths in Australia. Firstly, I thank those senators involved in the report and those senators who have contributed to what should be significant changes to protect workers at work in this country. I also acknowledge the families who are here and thank them for being here and for their involvement and support for the inquiry.


Senator Brockman spoke about statistics. I don't think anyone really sees a worker who is maimed, injured or killed at work as simply a statistic. As Senator O'Neill said, they're a father, a brother, a sister, a grandfather, a husband or a wife. They're a friend. This is just a terrible situation. And I know that we talk about statistics a lot in this place. But I don't think Senator Brockman should have been quoting statistics at such a time. It's a terrible situation that families find themselves in. One death is one death too many. One death means that a family is in grief, that a family has lost a loved one, that a family's life is changed forever. It's just unacceptable in a modern society that people who profit from the labour of working class Australians are not held accountable for the death of that worker and the tragedy that it brings on individual families and communities around this country.


The last time I spoke in this place about a worker being killed was in relation to a young man who was killed at the Barangaroo ferry hub, Mr Tim Macpherson—a young man with a young family, his whole life before him, with a fantastic wife and a young family—just taken from us because he was unlucky enough to be working on a rust bucket barge that shouldn't have been in New South Wales. It came down from Queensland and didn't have the proper certificates to undertake that journey. The health and safety on that barge were poor, the conditions were terrible and Tim ended up dead—unacceptable.


The union movement have been calling for industrial manslaughter laws in this country for I think longer than the Greens have even been a party. I remember having these debates over 20 years ago in my union, the AMWU. These calls grew even louder when we saw the behaviour of James Hardie when they knew that their product was killing their employees. James Hardie covered it up, James Hardie made huge profits and James Hardie did that with impunity. If ever there was a reason, regardless of all the other families that have suffered terribly, James Hardie on their own should have been enough in this country to hold businesses accountable for their lack of concern and their breaches of safety against working people in this country.


I remember the then state secretary of the AMWU—Paul Bastian, a great Australian and a great trade unionist—going over to Holland and chasing James Hardie, who were moving their business headquarters around the world to try to avoid their responsibility for working people in this country. Paul Bastian did a great job, supported by Greg Combet. The union movement and the ACTU did a fantastic job. I remember the coalition and John Howard opposing the ban on the importation of asbestos in this country. I remember watching a great mate of mine—the former president of the AMWU, Brian Fraser, who was a big, six-foot-plus Irishman—dying with mesothelioma. He couldn't grab a breath. The companies and the insurance companies tried to avoid any responsibility. We had deathbed hearings to deal with it. Workers don't get a fair go in this country. Employers get it far too easy when it comes to workplace deaths.


I do want to acknowledge Senator Williams. Senator Williams was a farmer. Senator Williams knows what happens to farmers in this country and to workers in the farming sector. It is one of the most dangerous industries in the country. I was fortunate enough for Senator Williams to support me when I was arguing for the National Workers Memorial, which has been built in Canberra with the support of Senator Williams. We can build as many memorials as we like, but it is important to recognise the symbolic importance of the workers who built this country. We had memorials for everything in Canberra, but nothing for the workers who died building this country. I acknowledge and thank Senator Williams for the support he gave in ensuring that the National Workers Memorial was built.


I just finish on this: if the coalition government spent a fraction of the amount of money they spend on attacking the trade union movement and on stopping trade union officials from getting on to jobs to support workers then there would be far fewer deaths in this country. We've got an organisation, the ABCC, that is a disgrace. It gets in there and stops workers getting access to their union so that the union can make sure they are on safe work sites. Not only is there a need for laws to be changed on penalties, regulations and legislation to hold employers accountable but there need to be changes in legislation in this country to allow workers to get access to their union so that the unions can make sure that they go home safely. This is a huge issue.


Again, I want to express my sympathy to the families that are here. I can tell you that the Labor Party will continue to do whatever we need to do to make sure that your tragedy doesn't happen to other families.

Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (17:58):  I present the report of the Education and Employment References Committee on industrial deaths in Australia, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee. I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This is an important report on industrial manslaughter. In tabling this report, I'd like to acknowledge the many families that are here in the public gallery today. These families are here because someone they loved dearly was killed at work and never came home. These families have travelled here at their own expense from all over Australia, including New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. They are here because they do not want other families to experience the suffering that they have. They are here because they are demanding change. Like all the families who participated in this inquiry, they have endured and are still enduring immense pain, anguish, grief and anger. The human impact of an industrial death is catastrophic and far reaching. For the families and friends of those individuals killed at work, the terrible and profound human cost and associated consequences they must suffer are lifelong and often all-consuming. The committee is keenly aware that the retelling of traumatic experience takes an emotional and physical toll. On behalf of my fellow committee members, I sincerely thank all the families for their courage and strength in sharing their stories and concerns, which have informed our deliberations on this very important topic.


I'd particularly like to acknowledge the advocacy of Mrs Kay Catanzariti, who is here in the gallery today. Kay's 21-year-old son Ben was tragically killed on a Canberra construction site in 2012. Kay has been tireless in her campaign to raise awareness of the issues impacting families with loved ones who never came home from work. Her lobbying efforts were instrumental in the referral of this inquiry, and she is highly committed to seeking legislative and regulatory change to improve the frameworks surrounding industrial deaths. I applaud her determination and strength in speaking out.


Safe Work advises that, as of 4 October, there have been 97 Australian workers killed at work in 2018. This is unacceptable. These workers and the thousands of workers killed before them did not go to war; they simply went to work. Every single workplace death is preventable. No-one should go to work and not come home. It is unacceptable that a rise in precarious employment practices and the pursuit by many companies of profit at any cost has led, in too many instances, to a corporate culture with a reckless disregard for the welfare of workers. We need to change the way workers are treated. Workers should never be treated as mere disposable assets. Workers must be treated with a proper regard for their workplace rights and safety. During the course of this inquiry, it became clear that the current legislative regulatory framework for dealing with workplace deaths is grossly inadequate.


Employers that disregard the risks to the lives of their workers and whose conduct negligently causes the death of a worker must be held responsible for such destructive behaviour. It is absolutely necessary for corporate entities to be held accountable for their actions, including facing prosecution for industrial manslaughter for the worst examples of corporate or individual behaviour. For those organisations that wilfully flout the existing work health and safety arrangements and whose actions result in a catastrophic outcome of loss of life, it is entirely warranted that serious consequences flow. This is particularly the case in organisations which are considered to be repeat offenders. This is why the committee recommends that Safe Work Australia, with the Commonwealth, state and territory governments, introduces a nationally consistent industrial manslaughter offence into the model work health and safety laws, using the current Queensland laws as a starting point. We believe that the offence of industrial manslaughter will send a clear message about the Australian community's expectations of safety in the workplace. Corporations must be held accountable both morally and legally. Where appropriate, the corporate veil must be pierced.


Another matter raised during the inquiry relating to the accountability of corporations was the existence of insurance policies designed to indemnify corporations and individual directors against financial penalties handed down for criminal breaches of the work health and safety legislation. Companies that take out this directors and officers insurance show an inexcusable disregard for the consequences of their actions. This behaviour in itself is reprehensible. Given that the prospect of personal liability for work health and safety breaches is one of the core drivers for the improvement of corporate safety culture, the committee has concluded that there is an urgent need to resolve this issue. The committee recommends that the model work health and safety legislation be swiftly amended to make it clear that contracts which purport to offer insurance against criminal penalties are unenforceable and illegal.


During the inquiry, the committee was disappointed to hear that investigations into industrial deaths were often compromised in terms of the duration of the investigation, the quality of the investigation process and some investigators' attitudes towards the investigation itself.


I draw a comparison between the way an industrial death is investigated and the way a road vehicle accident death is investigated. The road vehicle accident death is treated as a crime scene and the incident is investigated on the basis that it may lead to criminal charges. The life of a worker is no less precious during their working hours than it is during their commute to work, yet evidence provided to the committee indicates that such a rigorous and professional investigative approach is not equally applied to industrial deaths.


The committee finds it imperative that the work health and safety regulators and law enforcement agencies undertaking the investigation of an industrial death do so with the correct attitude—that is, that the death they are investigating is potentially a criminal matter, not merely an accident. 


This is why the committee recommends that Safe Work Australia work with work health and safety regulators in each jurisdiction to develop a policy that stipulates that all industrial deaths must be investigated as a potential crime scene.


The committee also recommends that Safe Work Australia work with the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and work health and safety regulators to develop and deliver standardised training modules for investigators. The committee hopes this will ensure all investigators have the appropriate skills, experience and attitude to carry out timely, high-quality investigations of industrial deaths and other serious breaches of work health and safety laws.


Throughout this inquiry the committee heard many compelling stories from families forced to navigate the myriad of complex formal processes that follow an industrial death, all while dealing with overwhelming grief and other mental, physical and financial burdens. 


Guided by these insights, the committee is making a number of recommendations aimed at improving the system for families. For example, the committee is recommending that Safe Work Australia work with the work health and safety regulators in each jurisdiction to identify and formalise family outreach mechanisms so that all impacted families are provided with the information and support they require in a timely manner. The committee is also recommending that each jurisdiction make funding available for a range of mental health and counselling support options, including in rural and regional areas. 


I am hopeful that, if implemented, these and other recommended measures will lead to greater support and transparency for these families who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in incredibly distressing and difficult circumstances.


This has been a comprehensive inquiry and the committee has made 34 recommendations. I would urge governments and policymakers to look carefully at the committee's recommendations and to consider seriously their implementation. Change is required so that no worker goes to work in Australia and then does not come home. 


I would like to once again thank all the individuals, families and organisations who assisted the committee during this inquiry. I would also like to thank my colleagues on their committee for their work over the past seven months. I would also like to give my very genuine thanks to the committee secretariat staff for again assisting in putting together what I think is a comprehensive and high-quality report. I now commend this report to the Senate.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2018-10-17,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (18:08):  As Deputy Chair of the Education and Employment References Committee I rise to briefly add some remarks on the same committee report. I certainly wish to associate myself with the remarks of Senator Marshall vis-a-vis the extraordinary work put in by the secretariat and by all our colleagues who participated in the inquiry. I have recently been appointed as deputy chair, so I was not participating throughout this inquiry. I only came along to the last hearing once I had joined the committee. But, from reading the transcripts of what had transpired beforehand, you certainly get a very strong sense that the situations that were being investigated and looked at by the committee were deeply, deeply harrowing for the families involved. Losing a loved one in an industrial accident is always going to be a tragedy, and nothing can help those people overcome that loss.


But I do wish to acknowledge all the work that went into the committee report. I thank the secretariat and thank all my fellow committee members. The report and its findings are an important step forward in the area of workplace health and safety. Workplace related injuries and illness carry significant tangible costs to the community, individuals, family, workmates and workplaces. The health and safety of workers is of the utmost importance to all, particularly the prevention of serious injuries and deaths in Australian workplaces. It has to be a fundamental objective of Australian safety laws and associated frameworks to ensure that all workers come home safely after every day at work.


The inquiry has taken into consideration extensive evidence from a wide range of sources and witnesses, including many of those who have lost loved ones. We have listened carefully to the evidence by family members, colleagues and friends of those who have died, and we thank them for their courage in sharing their stories and experiences. Their willingness to share these very painful experiences has been critical in helping our understanding of the importance of support for victims' families, and that I think is one of the key sets of recommendations to come out of this report.


There were a diverse range of views and approaches presented on the adequacy of the current framework surrounding prevention, investigation and prosecution of industrial deaths in Australia. Whilst coalition senators support many of the recommendations in the report, there are some that we support in part and there are others that we are not able to support. We believe that the key here is to have the most effective policy response to achieve the best outcome. And more Commonwealth law is not always the way to do that, particularly when you're looking at an ongoing harmonisation of a series of state jurisdictions where the states have significant responsibilities in this area.


It is also worth noting that we have seen a reduction in industrial deaths in workplace fatalities over the last decade. Yes, absolutely, any death is one death too many, but it is at least a positive to say that workplace fatalities have fallen by almost 50 per cent over that period of time.


Again, I wish to thank all my colleagues, but most particularly I wish to thank all those who gave evidence to the inquiry, particularly those who lost a loved one in an industrial accident. Thank you.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2018-10-17,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (18:12):  Every family should expect that their loved ones return home at the end of their shift or at the end of their day's work, but for the families of approximately 200 workers in Australia each year this doesn't happen. The impact of a death at work is devastating for families and it's devastating for the wider community and the economy as well.


The committee heard from parents, children, partners and loved ones, and I've got to say at times it was hard to listen, but I felt very privileged that the people, the witnesses, many of whom are up in the gallery today, gave that evidence to us. I felt very privileged to be on that committee and to be able to hear that evidence, because it's not easy to do—it's not easy to stand up and talk to someone about the grief you're feeling. For them to have done that is just so highly commendable. But we can and we must do better, and we know that.


While I remember, I'd also like to thank the secretariat involved in this committee, because I don't think it was easy for them to sit and hear the evidence every day either, and they did such a sterling effort, as they always do.


This committee report makes 34 recommendations, which the committee believes will make workplaces across the country safer. As Senator Marshall said, the report was quite extensive, so today I'll only have the time to address a few of the issues raised. The committee held eight public hearings across Australia, including in Hobart in my home state of Tasmania. From evidence given by the ETU at the Tasmania hearing we know that Tasmania has the second highest fatality rate in the country, behind the Northern Territory, and nearly double the third highest jurisdictions of Queensland and Western Australia. We have to ask why the rates are so high in Tasmania. Tasmania has the highest rates of fatalities in agriculture, forestry and fishing as well as in the public sector. So I would urge the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian governments to work together in ending this human tragedy.


Nationwide in 2016 almost 70 per cent of worker fatalities occurred in just three industries: the transport, postal and warehousing industries, with 47 fatalities. There were 44 worker fatalities in the agricultural, forestry and fishing industries and 35 worker fatalities in the construction industry. Of course, some occupations, like truck driving, are particularly dangerous, and I spoke earlier today with regard to that.


In their submission to the committee, the Transport Workers' Union quoted Professor Ann Williamson as saying: 


Heavy trucks are disproportionately involved in fatal crashes on our roads and the trucking industry represents the highest number of work related fatalities across all industries in Australia.


Their submission went on to say:


During the 12 months to the end of March 2008, 184 people were killed in 163 fatal crashes involving heavy trucks, with fatal crashes involving heavy rigid trucks increasing. 


Any truck driver or TWU official knows of the high rate of industrial deaths in that industry. One of the truck drivers, John Waltis, told the committee in Sydney:


I've been in the industry for over 40 years and, yes, we had accidents back in the early days, 40-odd years ago, but nowhere near as many as what we're having now, and it is because of the undue pressure put on the drivers through the corporations or the companies they subcontract to do the work.


…   …   … 


I have known of over 50 deaths in the industry because I've been in it such a long time. I don't want to see one more. 


I too share the belief that too many truck drivers are dying on the road, and I don't think the government's done enough to reduce that tragic statistic. While some Safe Work Australia figures argue that the number of industrial deaths in Australia is declining, even one work related death is one too many, and these figures aren't declining fast enough.


We're also seeing many deaths occurring due to occupational exposure to substances that result in industrial diseases which ultimately lead to the workers' deaths, such as asbestosis, mesothelioma and black lung disease. A witness at the Hobart hearing, Trevor Gauld, from the Electrical Trades Union, outlined why he felt the Safe Work Australia figures were misleading. He said: 


What we're seeing is latent illnesses; cancer clusters and these sorts of things—long-term exposures to chemicals. It's different industries. For whatever reason, as you're aware, Senator, your government did the things it did around manufacturing and we have less of that now. So it's a different risk profile. I think what the statistics show is that change; they don't show a decline.


He also said:


It's not that I don't accept the figures; I just think that they mischaracterise the circumstances. We have a significant increase in the change of the modes of employment, for example, and the way that that might get counted, as opposed to someone being deemed an employee or not deemed an employee. We also have issues around the way Safe Work Australia captures that data. All the jurisdictions don't feed the same data in. So what's classed as a workplace fatality in one jurisdiction isn't necessarily classed as a workplace fatality in the Safe Work Australia statistical data capture—the datasets that they gather.


Given that, the committee recommends that Safe Work Australia expand the work-related traumatic injury fatalities dataset to capture data on deaths resulting from industrial diseases.


One of the issues that challenge employers, employees and unions alike is that there are variances in work health and safety laws across jurisdictions. While Australia has a set of model work health and safety laws developed in 2011 by Safe Work Australia, they have not been implemented in Victoria and Western Australia. The aim of the work health and safety model laws is to provide all workers in Australia with the same standard of health and safety protection regardless of the work they do or where they work. The model work health and safety laws comprise the Model Work Health and Safety Act, the Model Work Health and Safety Regulations and the model codes of practice. In addition, a state or territory can also elect to amend the model laws as they apply in their own jurisdictions. Given this situation, the committee recommends that Safe Work Australia maintain a public list of amendments that jurisdictions make to the model work health and safety laws.


One of the first things you need to improve a situation is data that accurately reflects what is happening. The committee found that Safe Work Australia data in relation to compliance enforcement activity does not reflect the prosecution outcomes for industrial deaths, which are a smaller but unqualified subset of disaggregated work health and safety data. The committee is of the strong opinion that Safe Work Australia must work with each jurisdiction to collect and maintain a dataset with more detailed information on the prosecution processes and outcomes of industrial death incidents.


The changing nature of work is having a dramatic and negative impact on the safety of work. The committee heard that the rise of precarious employment practices had led to a corporate culture where there is a distinct lack of care for the safety of workers. Maurice Blackburn, in their submission, detailed the situation:


Over the past two decades, business operators have continued to find new ways to avoid their responsibilities under Fair Work legislation and other legal and regulatory structures, including WHS and workers’ compensation frameworks. ‘Gig economy’, sham contract and labour hire arrangements require the service provider to be a self-employed independent contractor, rather than an employee, thereby abrogating the business operators of employer responsibilities.


…   …   …


By insisting that people who work for them be self-employed independent contractors, business operators avoid having to take responsibility for the provision of safety nets that Australians have come to expect, including the right to be safe at work.


The committee is persuaded by the evidence that there are negative safety implications relating to the increased use of temporary and labour hire workers and other forms of precarious work. Additionally, the committee agrees that the rise of such precarious employment practices has led in some instances to a corporate culture where there exists a distinct lack of care for the safety of the worker.


Although nothing will bring back those who have lost their lives or even ease the heartbreak, the committee made a number of recommendations to improve the use of compliance and enforcement tools and penalties for breaches of work health and safety laws, which can vary greatly from state to state. And we have to ask: why is a life in one state or territory worth more than in another state? As I mentioned at the beginning of my contribution, the report and the recommendations are too long to cover in their entirety in the short time allocated to me, but the gist of the report is this: too many Australians are dying at work. We can and we must do better as a nation.


As an aside, this morning I met a young lad whose name is Charlie. Charlie was up in the gallery a minute ago. Charlie is 16 months old, and I was devastated to hear, when I was talking to Charlie's mum, that Charlie's grandad died six months ago, as an industrial death. I have thought all afternoon about what Charlie will miss out on by not having his grandad around. He won't have his grandad at his birthday parties or at Christmas time. He won't have his grandad to share all those special moments that grandads share. I say to Charlie's family and to all the other witnesses up in the gallery: we can't quite feel your pain, of course, but we do really want to make a difference. I think that this committee has worked really hard to come up with recommendations that will make a difference.


We've got the report. It's now up to the Commonwealth government and governments around the nation to adopt its recommendations. It's the least that we can do and the least that we owe those hundreds of Australians who die at work unnecessarily each year.

"Faruqi, Sen Mehreen",AG,2018-10-17,"



Senator FARUQI
 (New South Wales) (18:22):  I rise on behalf of the Greens to speak on the report on the inquiry into the prevention, investigation and prosecution of industrial deaths in Australia. This inquiry was much needed because the safety of our workers is of utmost importance. We really must have zero tolerance for work related deaths. I started my working life as a civil and structural engineer, so I do know firsthand the dangers that lurk on construction sites, which are among the deadliest sites for workers. There is absolutely no excuse for employers to not provide a safe workplace and there should be zero tolerance for negligent behaviour on worksites. It is quite apt, I must say, that the committee is handing down its report during National Safe Work Month, but, of course, safety should be a priority not just in October but every single day.


The Australian Greens do welcome the inquiry and support the recommendations made by the committee. Most importantly, this report is a move towards creating a new offence for industrial manslaughter, which has long been Greens policy. Grieving families and friends have long demanded this change, and it gives me hope when I see the other political parties also becoming receptive to this. As a general principle, the Greens have a preference for a model that puts industrial manslaughter into the Crimes Act. But, through this inquiry, I also note the broad support for the Queensland model, and the Greens welcome moves to have this extended throughout Australia.


Another very important aspect of this issue is how industrial deaths are actually defined. The definition needs to be broadened to include all work related deaths, not just traumatic fatalities. This includes, in particular, deaths caused by work related diseases, which the recommendations address, and suicides should also be covered. This would much more accurately reflect the impact on workers and would allow their families to access appropriate remedies. Consideration of workers who die by suicide, particularly after poor handling of compensation claims, is also currently inadequate and should be addressed in any new reforms. 


Further, there is also a very strong case for the collection of data and statistics regarding industrial deaths. The statistics we get from Safe Work Australia, as has been said earlier, do not accurately reflect the scale of work related deaths that actually occur in Australia. The Australian Council of Trade Unions raised these concerns with the committee, saying the current state of our data continues to result in an underestimation of the true extent of work related deaths, including those arising from work related diseases. The fact of the matter is that any work related death should not only be counted but also be completely unacceptable. 


With respect to recommendation 31 regarding the establishment of pro bono legal assistance to families during coronial inquests, we think this should be extended to include 'and any other assistance deemed necessary'. We are aware of cases where even accessing inquests has been particularly difficult, because of financial constraints, for example. 


This inquiry was nearing its end when I joined the Senate. But, in my brief participation in the inquiry, I met with Ms Robyn Colson, whose 24-year-old son, David James Colson, was killed in a workplace incident on 8 October 2007. This month marks 11 years since Ms Colson lost her son—a tragedy, the scale of which, of course, is unimaginable to anyone who has not gone through something like this. David was an abalone diver in Tasmania. However, on this particular day, he was working as a deckhand for another abalone diver. Ms Colson told us at the inquiry hearing:


The boat he was working on sank and he swam for 5½ hours before dying of hypothermia. He was a wonderful person who did not deserve to have his life stolen from him. Losing a child this way is unlike any other type of grief and it is permanent. A part of our soul is missing. We live a divided life: the time before the workplace accident and the time after. 


This is heartbreaking, but what happened next didn't make it any easier on the Colson family. The coronial inquest into David's death took so long that the family could never bring criminal charges, as the limitation period for prosecutions had expired. This is quite an unacceptable situation and further highlights the inadequacy of our work health and safety laws. Other families also spoke about coronial inquests taking a long time and extending their anguish, with no answers at hand and no-one held responsible. 


I do hope the government adopts all the recommendations of this report, but, more importantly, that they implement them speedily and act on them. The friends and families of people whose loved ones have suffered industrial deaths want the government to make strong reforms and make them now. Some of them are here today in this chamber, and I welcome them here. It was my absolute privilege to meet them earlier this afternoon, and I thank them for the immense amount of courage and strength that they have shown to push for workplace safety reforms so that no-one else has to go through the trauma and heartbreak that they have. 


For the families, friends and loved ones of those people who have been killed at work or who have died as a result of workplace related disease and suicide, the heartbreak, pain and anguish are lifelong realities. This inquiry and the resulting recommendations are a welcome step in fixing our laws. It is also important that adequate funding and resources are directed towards work health and safety regulators, who can then ensure compliance and allow for more effective preventative measures to be put in place, because our aim should be absolutely zero work related deaths. Every worker has a right to a safe workplace, and they deserve to come back home safe, healthy and well from work.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-10-17,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (18:29):  I rise to make my contribution on the arrival in this chamber of this very significant report on industrial deaths. I acknowledge those who have travelled here, physically, from New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and as far away as Western Australia, but the journeys that you've undertaken with your bodies are nothing in comparison to the journeys of the heart that you're undertaking right now. 


I want to particularly acknowledge one woman who's sitting up there, Mrs Kay Catanzariti, who, in a great leap of hope in a time when politics is treated in our media and in our society as an instrument that can deliver nothing except conflict, contacted Senator Marshall, a Labor senator from the great state of Victoria—not as great as New South Wales, of course, but he had an open heart, open ears and a willingness to work on this issue, which has plagued this nation for far too long.


We heard from Senator Bilyk that 200-plus people die per year. As one of the parents said earlier today in a meeting that we had at nine o'clock in Bill Shorten's office, 'Australians accept deaths in the workplace.' That is a chilling sentence, and we can no longer allow that culture to prevail. That is what this report is addressing—that cultural reality that we live with today.


You are here today as citizens in a democracy making history. You're in a historic building. I know that you just think you're ordinary Australians, but this is what's great about this country. Ordinary Australians, when we stand up for what we believe in and fight for what's right, can do amazing things. You've already done amazing things, and now we will try to do our best with what you have given us.


Words matter. It will surprise you, as it often surprises me, that across this nation right now there will be hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people who are listening as they're driving home from work—happily, I hope—to their families, and they'll hear what we're doing here. So today, in preparing my speech for this moment, I thought: what words could I say? We talk about the work ahead of us, and I acknowledge the great contributions of the senators who have spoken here before me this evening, but I'm going to do what I can to get as many of your words on the record as possible, because they were so powerful. I'm sure some of you sat in English classes and thought you'd never have the gift of the gab and you'd never say things that would matter, but I'm going to try to read as much as I can of what you gave us into the Hansard record to be part of the history of this nation, because you've done something very powerful and significant by participating in this inquiry and bringing it to be. Mr Jack Brownlee was killed at work in 2018, aged 21. Dave and Janine Brownlee, his mum and dad, are here. Mr Dave Brownlee, I bet you don't even remember what you said, but this is just a bit of what you put on the record, and it was pretty amazing, because truth has a voice:


I'm here with my wife and also representing my two sons, Mitchell Brownlee and Jack Brownlee. Jack was 21 years old, and he will always be 21 years old. He will never age. He went to work on 21 March and was caught in a trench collapse that covered the boy up to his neck, with one arm free. About 9.30 on that day was the last time they—


Jack and his co-worker Charlie Howkins—


were seen and they weren't found until 11.30. They weren't rescued until 2.30. In the first two hours, Jack would have had the most horrific time. His mate—


Charlie Howkins, Lana Cormie's husband—


was dead beside him, metres away.


Jack would have been screaming for help, and the other boys were at smoko. They were left on their own. There was no supervision of these boys. There was nothing. At the time, I was at the hospital with my wife, who was suffering severe migraines. We received no phone call from the company until 5.30 that afternoon.


Beforehand, I had a friend who worked in Geelong. He rang me and informed me. Things were on Facebook about a trench collapse in Ballarat and he thought our son Jack was involved. I raced up there to the site and was met at the roadblock by the police. We weren't allowed in. Jack had just been evacuated, they said, and they were putting him in an induced coma. I was informed by the police that the best thing to do was to hightail down to Melbourne and meet him at the hospital. We still had not heard from the company.


This is an excerpt of what Mrs Janine Brownlee said:


The hardest thing for us was to leave our son and drive home. The hardest thing was to drive there in the first place, getting updates telling us, 'Hurry up. Your son mightn't make it.' And then the hardest thing was to drive home the next day, leaving our boy at the hospital. That was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do: knowing he was there on his own; leaving my baby there … Things need to change. How we were treated was so wrong.


Mr Charlie Howkins was killed at work in 2018, aged 34. His wife is here, Dr Lana Cormie. She said:


I am a doctor of veterinary science and I am married to Charlie Howkins, who was a registered building practitioner and worked in civil construction at the time of his death. I am—and we were—parents to two small children: Sophie, who is four, and George, who is one year old. Charlie went to work one day in March and he never came home. He became just another of the dead bodies which are carried out of a workplace every second day in Australia. Words simply cannot do justice to the devastation which has followed. His death is a result of a failure in the culture, values, systems and laws of our country. What is left in the wake of this failure is our broken family.


Mr Robert Cunico was killed at work in 2018, aged 60. Robert's daughter, Ms Ashlea Castle, is here and so is his wife, Debby Cunico. Ms Castle said:


My dad lived for almost an hour in the most horrific conditions while being cradled in the arms of a colleague before succumbing to his injuries. Despite the efforts made by the first responders and emergency services, his injuries were so catastrophic that he was never going to survive. My father should never have sustained even a paper cut whilst he was on the job, let alone injuries so severe that his life was ended. My dad was a son, a brother, a husband, a father, a grandfather, an uncle and a friend to many.


Mr Luke Murrie was killed at work in 2007, aged 22. Luke's parents, Mark and Janice Murrie, are here. Mr Murrie said:


Luke was 22 when he was killed. He was killed in an unsafe work environment where inexperienced workers were instructed to do an unsafe lift. The unsafe method was quicker and therefore it was cheaper. There was no meaningful deterrent for the employer to do it safely. He put the dollar before safety.


Mr Ben Catanzariti was killed at work in 2012, aged 21. His parents, Kay and Barney, are here today. Kay said:


I'm here today not by choice. I'm here because my son Ben, who was 21 years old … was killed when a 39-metre, three-tonne concrete boom collapsed and crushed his skull in 2012. You senators have chosen this career to represent the Australian people first and foremost, to listen and to protect all Australians and take responsibility for their health and wellbeing in our ever-changing world, and we need to unite regardless of which party we belong to. We are all the same. We are human beings. We have the right to live our lives without fear of going to work and not coming home.


Mr Jason Garrels was killed at work in 2012, aged 20. Jason's parents, Michael and Lee Garrels, are here. Lee said:


My son Jason Garrels aged 20 was fatally electrocuted on the 27th February 2012 in Clermont, Queensland. My son was employed as a labourer for approx 9 days with Daytona Trading Pty Ltd … I went to assist at the resuscitation not knowing it was my son. Words cannot describe the impact that it has had on me and my family; I was thrown into a life that was a surreal nightmare which became my reality.


I want to acknowledge: Mr Glen Biddle, killed at work in 2007, aged 39, and his sister Shauna; Iremar Moussa, killed at work in 2016, aged 55, and wife Linda; Mr Jarrod Hampton—Troy and Robert Hampton are here today; Mr Daniel Bradshaw, killed at work in 2017, aged 37; Mr Jayden Zappelli, killed at work in 2013, aged 18, and his father, Greg; Mr Chris Patrick, killed at work in 2014, aged 25, and his partner, Christiana Paterson and Mr Wesley Ballantine, killed at work, aged 17, and his mother, Regan Ballantine. Thank you for coming to be here today for the reception of this report. Thank you for your work as Australians. We honour you and we'll do what we can.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-10-17,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:39):  I was not intending to speak on this report. I happen to be here for chamber duty. But listening to those very forceful contributions from senators, I thought that as a former national union official and someone who has witnessed workers being killed and who had to talk to their families I just had to say a few things about this report on industrial deaths in Australia. Firstly, I thank those senators involved in the report and those senators who have contributed to what should be significant changes to protect workers at work in this country. I also acknowledge the families who are here and thank them for being here and for their involvement and support for the inquiry.


Senator Brockman spoke about statistics. I don't think anyone really sees a worker who is maimed, injured or killed at work as simply a statistic. As Senator O'Neill said, they're a father, a brother, a sister, a grandfather, a husband or a wife. They're a friend. This is just a terrible situation. And I know that we talk about statistics a lot in this place. But I don't think Senator Brockman should have been quoting statistics at such a time. It's a terrible situation that families find themselves in. One death is one death too many. One death means that a family is in grief, that a family has lost a loved one, that a family's life is changed forever. It's just unacceptable in a modern society that people who profit from the labour of working class Australians are not held accountable for the death of that worker and the tragedy that it brings on individual families and communities around this country.


The last time I spoke in this place about a worker being killed was in relation to a young man who was killed at the Barangaroo ferry hub, Mr Tim Macpherson—a young man with a young family, his whole life before him, with a fantastic wife and a young family—just taken from us because he was unlucky enough to be working on a rust bucket barge that shouldn't have been in New South Wales. It came down from Queensland and didn't have the proper certificates to undertake that journey. The health and safety on that barge were poor, the conditions were terrible and Tim ended up dead—unacceptable.


The union movement have been calling for industrial manslaughter laws in this country for I think longer than the Greens have even been a party. I remember having these debates over 20 years ago in my union, the AMWU. These calls grew even louder when we saw the behaviour of James Hardie when they knew that their product was killing their employees. James Hardie covered it up, James Hardie made huge profits and James Hardie did that with impunity. If ever there was a reason, regardless of all the other families that have suffered terribly, James Hardie on their own should have been enough in this country to hold businesses accountable for their lack of concern and their breaches of safety against working people in this country.


I remember the then state secretary of the AMWU—Paul Bastian, a great Australian and a great trade unionist—going over to Holland and chasing James Hardie, who were moving their business headquarters around the world to try to avoid their responsibility for working people in this country. Paul Bastian did a great job, supported by Greg Combet. The union movement and the ACTU did a fantastic job. I remember the coalition and John Howard opposing the ban on the importation of asbestos in this country. I remember watching a great mate of mine—the former president of the AMWU, Brian Fraser, who was a big, six-foot-plus Irishman—dying with mesothelioma. He couldn't grab a breath. The companies and the insurance companies tried to avoid any responsibility. We had deathbed hearings to deal with it. Workers don't get a fair go in this country. Employers get it far too easy when it comes to workplace deaths.


I do want to acknowledge Senator Williams. Senator Williams was a farmer. Senator Williams knows what happens to farmers in this country and to workers in the farming sector. It is one of the most dangerous industries in the country. I was fortunate enough for Senator Williams to support me when I was arguing for the National Workers Memorial, which has been built in Canberra with the support of Senator Williams. We can build as many memorials as we like, but it is important to recognise the symbolic importance of the workers who built this country. We had memorials for everything in Canberra, but nothing for the workers who died building this country. I acknowledge and thank Senator Williams for the support he gave in ensuring that the National Workers Memorial was built.


I just finish on this: if the coalition government spent a fraction of the amount of money they spend on attacking the trade union movement and on stopping trade union officials from getting on to jobs to support workers then there would be far fewer deaths in this country. We've got an organisation, the ABCC, that is a disgrace. It gets in there and stops workers getting access to their union so that the union can make sure they are on safe work sites. Not only is there a need for laws to be changed on penalties, regulations and legislation to hold employers accountable but there need to be changes in legislation in this country to allow workers to get access to their union so that the unions can make sure that they go home safely. This is a huge issue.


Again, I want to express my sympathy to the families that are here. I can tell you that the Labor Party will continue to do whatever we need to do to make sure that your tragedy doesn't happen to other families.

CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (COLLECTING TOBACCO DUTIES AT THE BORDER) BILL 2018


The Australian Government is committed to combating the illicit tobacco black market. 


In October 2017, the Black Economy Taskforce delivered their final report to Government. The 2018-19 Budget Black Economy Package – combatting illicit tobacco gives effect to the report's recommendations, including establishing a new framework to protect tobacco duty, a permit system to import tobacco, and the Australian Border Force-led Illicit Tobacco Taskforce. 


Together, these measures will disrupt illicit tobacco supply chains and deny criminal groups access to illicit profits that fund their other criminal and black economy activities.


To give effect to the new framework to protect tobacco duty, the Government is introducing the Customs Amendment (Collecting Tobacco Duties at the Border) Bill. 


Current legislation allows duties on tobacco to be paid at the point that tobacco products leave licensed warehouses, as well as when it is imported. Leakage from these warehouses to the black market contributes to around a quarter of illicit tobacco in Australia.


From 1 July 2019, tobacco importers will be required to pay all duties on tobacco upon importation. From that date, the option to enter imported tobacco into a licensed warehouse and delay the payment of duties will no longer be available. This will deny criminal groups the opportunity to defraud the Commonwealth of revenue that secures essential services for all Australians, prevent criminals from undermining Government strategies to improve public health outcomes, and it will protect law-abiding local business operators.


The Bill will also include transitional arrangements for the treatment of tobacco that is in warehouses at 1 July 2019. 


By tackling black economy activities in the tobacco warehousing environment, the Government will protect Australian revenue, protect the health of Australians, reduce criminal activity, and provide an estimated $3.3 billion in revenue to the Commonwealth.


CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (PRODUCT SPECIFIC RULE MODERNISATION) BILL 2018


The Customs Amendment (Product Specific Rule Modernisation) Bill 2018 amends the Customs Act 1901 (Customs Act) to streamline the implementation of our free trade agreements (FTAs) and help facilitate smoother trade between Australia and our FTA partners.


The Bill does this by changing the way the product specific rules (PSRs) of Australia's FTAs are given effect in domestic legislation.


Australia's in force FTAs contain Rules of Origin and PSRs. PSRs define the minimum requirements that must be met for goods that are comprised of materials that do not originate in a party to the FTA — to be considered eligible for a preferential rate of customs duty in accordance with the FTA. The PSRs are based upon the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonized System).


The Harmonised System is an international naming system for the classification of traded products. It currently covers thousands of commodity groups, and is used by more than 200 economies as a basis for customs tariffs and the collection of international trade statistics. Over 98 per cent of merchandise in international trade is classified in terms of the Harmonised System.


Each FTA has a separate PSR Annex, which is currently (with the exception of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA)), implemented domestically in Rules of Origin regulations (ROO regulations) for each FTA. Five yearly revisions of the Harmonized System by the World Customs Organization usually compel FTA parties to update their agreements' PSRs, which, in Australia's case, mean subsequent amendments to the FTA's ROO regulations. The size of these regulations ranges from 257 to 1,977 pages. Due to their size and the steadily increasing number of FTAs (currently 10), amendment of the ROO regulations to update the PSRs requires considerable time and resources for what are essentially technical changes that do not alter the operation of the treaty and do not have any direct financial implications for government, traders or consumers.


The proposed amendments seek to simplify this process by amending the Customs Act to apply FTA PSR annexes agreed by Parties by direct reference and remove the need to replicate PSR annexes in ROO Regulations.


The proposed amendments to the Act are technical in nature. They will not affect the practical operation of the legislation or the agreements that are the subject of the Bill.


Parties to the Agreement to Establish the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area, otherwise known as the `AANZFTA' (pronounced: `Anz-F'Ta') have agreed to take whatever steps are necessary to bring the HS2017 PSR schedule into force domestically on 1 January 2019.


These amendments will ensure that Australia is able to meet its AANZFTA deadline, to minimise the administrative burden on Australian businesses and officials in trying to juggle new and old HS codes, and will further streamline trade between Australia and our FTA partners. In 2017, trade with Australia under AANZFTA totalled AUD120 billion.


ChAFTA and JAEPA PSR annexes are also included in the amendments, which will simplify the transposition process for these agreements once the FTA Parties have agreed them. Further similar amendments to the Customs Act will be brought to Parliament to facilitate the update of the PSRs of Australia's other existing FTAs in the foreseeable future.


The Bill before this Chamber will allow the revised PSR schedules of these FTAs to enter into force in a far more efficient and timely manner. Once these amendments are made, future changes to the PSR annexes for AANZFTA, ChAFTA, and JAEPA will be able to be made simply by the completion of any provisions contained in the agreement pertaining to such updates, and completion of Australia's domestic treaty-making process.


The Bill also refers to and applies the Annex containing the Chemical Rules of the SAFTA, which were not included in the amendments to the Customs Act that implemented the Agreement to Amend the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement in 2017. The Bill also makes minor amendments to existing FTA Divisions in the Customs Act. These minor amendments will ensure consistency between our legislation and the FTA text in the Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and ASEAN-New Zealand FTAs.


The Government is committed to the passage of these amendments in 2018. They will greatly reduce the administrative burden of the current transposition process, cutting costs for business and taxpayers, with flow on benefits to consumers and households.


In passing this Bill, the Government honours its commitments to its FTA partners to ensure our agreements remain up to date, supporting our jobs and growth agenda, reducing red-tape for Australian businesses, and helping to keep costs down for Australian households.


I commend the bill to this Chamber.



 


TREASURY LAWS AMENDMENT (GIFT CARDS) BILL 2018


This Bill amends the Australian Consumer Law, contained in Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, to introduce a national regime for the regulation of gift cards. 


It introduces a minimum three year expiry period, requires expiry date information to be disclosed and bans the charging of post-supply fees to provide consumers with greater confidence and make gift cards simpler and fairer for all consumers. 


At the same time, the reforms will ensure Australian businesses have one set of clear rules to follow relating to the regulation of gift cards. 


Gift card terms and conditions vary widely, making it hard for consumers to understand what their rights and obligations are. Consumers often experience frustration and financial loss from an expired gift card. 


There is currently no uniform regulation for minimum expiry periods and post-supply fees, with different rules applying across jurisdictions. The inconsistencies have created uncertainty for consumers and a regulatory burden for businesses.


On 18 October 2017, the New South Wales Parliament passed the Fair Trading Amendment (Ticket Scalping and Gift Cards) Act 2017. This law commenced on 31 March 2018, introducing a minimum three year expiry for gift cards sold in New South Wales. 


Similarly, the South Australian Parliament recently introduced the Fair Trading (Gift cards) Amendment Bill 2018 to impose a three year minimum expiry date for gift cards sold in South Australia.


Three years has generally been considered a reasonable period for consumers to use gift cards and simultaneously provides businesses with sufficient certainty to manage their liabilities. To date a number of national retailers have already adopted the three year minimum expiry period or longer terms following the introduction of gift card laws in New South Wales. 


The Bill imposes a three year minimum nationally, balancing consumer rights and business compliance. It will also require the expiry date information to be prominently displayed on the card itself. This will ensure consumers are able to make informed purchasing decisions by having access to this information at the time it is needed and on the gift card itself, rather than on accompanying packaging or on a website. 


When a gift card is given, it is not necessarily the case the expiry date information is clear to the gift recipient. The form of disclosure provides the needed flexibility to businesses while being clear for consumers. 


Further, under the national regime the charging of post-supply fees, such as inactivity and balance checking fees, after the gift card has been supplied will be prohibited. The Bill's regulation-making power will also allow the Government to provide an exhaustive list of fees for gift cards that can be charged post-supply.


In addition, regulation-making powers contained in the bill allow for certain gift cards, persons and gift cards supplied in particular circumstances to be exempt from all or some of the requirements imposed by this reform. This will provide flexibility to support industry to adopt innovative marketing techniques to encourage demand and manage stock levels. It will also allow the law to adapt to changes in technology and business activities to ensure essential activities involving gift cards are not curtailed to the detriment of businesses and consumers. 


It is an offence to contravene the reforms contained in the bill. This will act as a strong deterrent against misconduct that can have serious detriment for consumers, thereby enhancing the integrity of the regulatory regime.


A contravention of the minimum three year expiry period, disclosure of expiry information and post-supply fee requirements carries a maximum penalty of $30,000 for a body corporate and $6,000 for persons other than a body corporate. The maximum penalties are consistent with similar consumer protections in the Australian Consumer Law. 


Compliance with these reforms will be monitored and enforced by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.


To provide industry with time to adapt to the new regime, the reforms will commence on 


1 November 2019. This will also ensure that these important protections for consumers are in place for the 2019 Christmas period. 


Consumers and businesses support this reform as it improves consumer outcomes, provides consistency and is workable for business. The states and territories have also shown their support for a national regime. 


Full details of the measure are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.


VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 2018


The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2018 demonstrates the commitment this Government made in 2016 and 2017 to put veterans first and continues on measures we introduced earlier this year under the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No.1) Act 2018 and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No.2) Act 2018.


The Bill is designed to improve outcomes for serving Australian Defence Force members, veterans and their families and will ensure that essential services are available to veterans when they need it. This Bill will:


extend claim avenues to include the Chief of Defence Force;


resolve veterans' claims more quickly by strengthening the ability of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to obtain information from third parties;


and


expedite lump sum exemptions for veterans by simplifying DVA and Department of Human Services' processes.


Schedule 1 of the Bill would amend the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 to enable the Chief of the Defence Force to make a claim for liability on behalf of a current serving Australian Defence Force member, where the member suffers a service injury or disease and agrees to the Chief of the Defence Force or his delegate making the claim. This amendment would provide an alternative way that a claim for liability may be made. In some cases, it may facilitate an earlier acceptance of liability.


The amendment is intended to benefit veterans by minimising some of the difficulties that may be encountered when making an initial claim for liability some time after the injury was sustained or the disease contracted. 


Veterans will also benefit in having their future claims for related diseases and conditions that manifest after their service more easily accepted. For example if DVA accepts a knee injury at the time of the injury via a claim from the CDF, accepting osteoarthritis of the knee in the future will be much easier.


DVA will be able to use the additional claim data at the point of injury to better inform decisions around trends in injuries and onset of other conditions. This may inform later policy on simplifying and streamlining the claims process. 



Schedule 2 of the Bill would enable the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to obtain information in determining a claim for compensation under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related) Claims Act 1988 (DRCA).


Veterans can be adversely affected when information critical to their claim is not provided by third parties. These provisions will provide veterans and their families with easier access to information relevant to their compensation claims. 


The provisions will require Commonwealth, State or Territory Departments, authorities and other persons such as current or former treatment providers or other parties to provide information, on request of the Commission. This will ensure that the Commission has access to all the information necessary to make decisions on claims. 


The amendments would bring the DRCA in line with the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.


Schedule 3 would improve administrative practices in the Department of Veterans' Affairs concerning income support clients and the exempting of certain lump sum payments from the income test.


The amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 would allow certain exempt lump sum determinations made by the Secretary for Social Services to apply to income support clients, where the determination is consistent with Department of Veterans' Affairs legislation and policy.


Currently, the Repatriation Commission makes separate, yet identical, exempt lump sum determinations for payments that have already been exempted under the Social Security Act 1991 by the Secretary for Social Services. 


Under the new arrangements, DSS will advise DVA of its determination, which will be applied to DVA income support clients without the requirement to register an additional instrument.


The Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 will retain the authority for the Repatriation Commission to make a determination to specify an exempt lump sum is an amount that the Repatriation Commission determines to be an exempt lump sum. The amendment will not change the current exclusions of the determination as it applies to companies, trusts and primary production. 


Each of these amendments will mean better outcomes for veterans and their families.


I commend this Bill.

Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (19:20):  I rise tonight to continue my remarks on a topic which I spoke about earlier in the day, which is the attack on the use of the chemical glyphosate in the farming industries of Australia. I wanted to continue my remarks on this topic because this is a very important chemical for agriculture in Australia, particularly in relation to no-till or minimum-till farming. 


The use of minimum-till techniques in terms of stopping erosion, stopping water loss and maximising the nutritional retention of fertiliser in the soil is a significant environmental benefit. I think it is quite ironic that, while certain groups are trying to see a herbicide like glyphosate banned, they are, at the same time, actively working against the use of modern plant breeding techniques that would have potentially enormous benefits for both the Australian agricultural sector and the world in terms of feeding a growing population. 


The case I'll bring up is the recent European Court of Justice ruling on GMO rules. What the European Court of Justice found was that organisms obtained by mutagenesis, which is a set of techniques that make it possible to alter the genome of a living species, are GMOs. Now, this is a very interesting decision and it is a completely illogical decision when based on the science. What they've had to do in order to preserve all the crops that are currently in production, including all the crops that are currently used by organic farmers, is effectively say that mutagenesis is a form of GMO. However, they're going to carve out an exemption for mutagenesis that has come from traditional plant breeding techniques, involving things like the exposing of the genome to radiation or chemicals, which are random mutations with unknown effects but which have been around for a long time. That carve out, in effect, makes absolutely no logical sense. It makes no sense based on the modern science of genetics, which understands that techniques like the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, which involves very discreet changes to the genome, are much more precise, much safer and much more understandable in their outcome on human health and safety than a random set of mutations caused by the exposure of the genome to radiation or chemicals. 


So you have here the same people, the same groups, the radical green groups, trying to eliminate the use of glyphosate while, at the same time, stopping farmers from all around the world, but particularly stopping Australian farmers, from accessing the new techniques of plant breeding that would actually offer solutions both to using much, much less chemical and to dealing with changes to the climate, changes to rainfall patterns and changes to the demand for food based on a growing population. So the very same people who are trying to stop the use of a particular chemical are, at the same time, stopping the techniques that would actually mean that that chemical wasn't needed. The irony of this should be lost on no-one. We need, when making these decisions, to always look to the science of these matters. What is safe? What is effective? What is going to give Australian farmers the tools and the techniques that they need to produce the high-quality food that the world will need into future? Thank you.
