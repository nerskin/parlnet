"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2002-09-26,"—I give notice that, 15 sitting days hence, I shall move:
That regulations 65.060 and 65.270 in item [1] of Schedule 1 of the Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2002 (No. 2), as contained in Statutory Rules 2002 No. 167 and made under the Civil Aviation Act 1988, be disallowed. 
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the committee's concerns with these regulations.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2002 (No. 2), Statutory Rules 2002 No. 167
The Regulations establish an appropriate framework of safety regulations for the provision of air traffic services and aerodrome rescue and fire fighting services. The Committee has raised the following concerns with the Minister.
Regulation 65.060 prohibits carrying out an unauthorised flight service function. This is a strict liability offence. The Committee notes that 65.045 prohibits carrying out an unauthorised air traffic control function but provides for a defence to a charge under this regulation where the relevant action was reasonable in the interests of safety of aerial navigation. No comparable defence is supplied for regulation 65.060.
Paragraph 65.270(1)(d) provides that CASA may cancel or suspend a licence (etc) if the holder “appears not to have the characteristics of personality, and other psychological attributes” that are necessary to carry out the duties of an air traffic controller or flight service officer. The Committee has sought clarification of how this paragraph is to be applied. For example, what criteria are to be used in determining a person's personality characteristics?

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-09-26,"—by leave—It might be all right for the Manager of Government Business in the Senate to talk about rolling over. If there are amendments to the second reading of a bill, that is then not a non-controversial bill as far as I am concerned. Unless I can be otherwise convinced, that is my current attitude to whether or not a bill is non-controversial. If there is a second reading amendment, clearly it must raise issues of controversy.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-09-26,"— With respect to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002, the opposition will be supporting the government's motion. It is all too clear that we do so in a context where the government has had to acknowledge that attempts to define serious educational policy and then to legislate on it cannot be made on the basis of secret deals. They cannot be done on the basis of what is essentially a policy lazy approach, whereby the government goes off, talks to a couple of people, makes an election announcement and determines to pay substantial public subsidies to a small group of people in the private sector. We have raised our concerns in this regard, essentially because we think that there ought to be some rationality to government policy. After all, if you are going to hand out large sums of public money, you should at least be able to explain why you are doing it.
To date we have had nothing more than the proposition that the government had made an election commitment. It was an election commitment to provide public subsidies to a small group of people, which gave a distinct market advantage to that group of people over and above potentially up to 80 other providers, who may, in turn, seek access to the same public subsidies. There are some serious issues here about policy consistency. There are some very grave concerns about accountability. It is just not good enough for the government to go out and make private arrangements which have serious implications and set precedents for others, who can now rightfully and with great legitimacy say, `This group has got a public subsidy; why haven't we?' This is in the face of a public lobby on behalf of the private sector in education, which actually want to see this subsidy extended to them and have stated so explicitly. This is not only with regard to PELS—the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme—but also with regard to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. There are important questions for us to consider in this regard.
There is a further and substantive issue of quality assurance and the accreditation process. It is about the capacity of this parliament to be confident that the money it is appropriating in education is spent in a manner consistent with the aspirations and the national objectives that are in place in order to produce a very high quality education system which should be the envy of the world. If the government makes private arrangements and relies upon particular accreditation processes based on administrative practices which are now very much out of date—practices which were in fact put in place long before the conditions set down in the national protocols for approval of higher education institutions— then it is possible that the government is performing at somewhat less than optimum best practice.
It is important that we are able to say to students that when they enrol in an Australian educational institution accredited by the government they have the best education available to them and that it is equal to all the educational services offered across the country. We have a standard that we want to protect. This is extremely important for our international reputation. It is also extremely important for individual students to have a qualification that means something. Further, it is very important that we do not have a race to the bottom with the new competitive environment that the government is now trying to foist upon our higher education institutions. The opposition has argued that there ought to be consistency with respect to the accountability requirements and the quality assurance requirements in that regard.
We have a situation where the government have brought a bill into the parliament which was badly thought out. We have been able to expose the extraordinary inadequacies of public administration. The government have relied upon a state government authority that some five or six years ago, under a Liberal government in South Australia, accredited courses on the basis of vocational education performance measures and applied them to a higher education program. There seems to be, in some quarters of the government, a failure to understand the significance of that problem. It has been up to the Labor Party to come forward and help the government out. We are good like that. We see the need to help this mob out because they certainly need a great deal of assistance. They need a considerable amount of assistance, because they are determined to muck it up. 
—So you've done your bit on the bill?
—We have done our best to deal with a very difficult situation as a result of the government's gross incompetence. Now we have had to say to the government, `We'll step in.' Jenny Macklin, Labor's education spokesman, has been able to move amendments in the House of Representatives which the government have had to accept. The logic of our position is quite clearly difficult for the government to resist. Occasionally they have to face facts—and they do on this occasion. Labor has had to salvage something from this terrible situation. It has forced the government to acknowledge the weaknesses of their ways. What is now apparent is that the government have had to acknowledge that Labor was right. Labor was right, and we have won the argument that the quality assurance processes should be made explicit and absolutely consistent with the national protocols. Those national protocols are extremely important for the protection of students and our higher educational institutions.
Importantly, under the amendments that we will see now, there is an opportunity for a watching brief on the issue to be extended by this parliament to ensure that the new system works to the best extent possible and that the states and territories are able to meet their obligations under the national protocols and make sure that there are not accreditations occurring outside those protocols. Obviously, we do not think the whole situation has been resolved. We do not think that is the end of the matter. We believe this issue should be revisited, and we will revisit it. We have, however, substantially improved the accountability requirements. Ms Macklin's amendments do just that. That is why we will be urging the Senate to accept these amendments. These are Labor amendments; the government have been obliged to accept them, and they have to acknowledge that they have made a mistake in the way in which they have approached this issue.
We have been able to achieve the creation of an enduring link in the legislation to ensure that there are reporting requirements which are consistent with those for public institutions. Why shouldn't it be so? Why shouldn't private institutions in receipt of public subsidies be obliged to meet the same requirements as public institutions? Why should there be a lower standard for students in the private sector than for students in the public sector? The other opportunity is that the government are given a mechanism to address issues such as equity and make sure that people are not discriminated against because they are enrolled in private institutions and also to make sure that those private institutions meet their obligations in regard to admissions policy and research activity. This is not our choice of outcomes. Obviously, I do not say to you that this is a course of action that a Labor government would have followed, because it was flawed from the beginning. However, Labor has salvaged the situation and, through these amendments, there is a huge improvement on the original.
—Is there?
—There is a huge improvement, Senator Stott Despoja. The government have had to back down; the government have had to acknowledge that they made a terrible mistake, and for this minister it is a bit of a humiliation. I think it is only fair to acknowledge that. It must be difficult for him to face this, but, truth be known, this was never his agenda. I think we have to acknowledge that it was not Dr Nelson's agenda—
—Are you sure?
—I am absolutely certain that Dr Nelson has bigger fish to fry; I acknowledge that. He has essentially had forced upon him an ideologically blinkered strategy left over—in fact, it is part of the debris—from the Kemp regime. He is trying to clear it away. 
—Don't give him that credit!
—He is trying to clear it away. We should give credit where it is due. He has had to face up to the humiliation that the government have been obliged to follow.
 (Senator Ferguson)—Senator Carr, please address your remarks through the chair.
—I certainly will. I have just been provoked! Labor senators are very concerned about the government's failure here and they do see that there has been this gross error.
—You're being too soft!
—I think that Dr Nelson has had a poisoned chalice handed to him by Dr Kemp: a policy that was built on an election commitment which was a private deal, an arrangement entered into where special privileges were extended to a particular group of people at the expense of the rest of the industry. It is quite inconsistent with the normal free market strategies pursued by Dr Kemp, but I suppose policy consistency is not a hallmark of conservative governments. I think we have to acknowledge that the government are wrong, they have been embarrassed by this and they have now acknowledged their weaknesses in this regard. I trust the officers from the department who are here with us today will be able to influence the government's direction more effectively in the future, because I am sure they would understand how wrong it is to introduce these sorts of inconsistencies into the Higher Education Funding Act. They would acknowledge in their private moments how relieved they are that there are at least some mechanisms now that they will be able to talk to the states about to ensure that the states do their job.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-09-26,"—I rise to speak to the message from the House of Representatives relating to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and the Australian Research Council Act 2001. In noting that the House have acquainted the Senate that they have accepted some amendments, rejected others and also drafted amendments in place of certain Senate amendments, I would like to take note of the alternatives the House of Representatives have presented the Senate with. I will speak first of all about item 20, `Eligible private institutions to include information in annual report'. Proposed subsection (1) says:
The Minister must, as soon as practicable after the end of 30 June in each year, cause an annual report to be prepared by each eligible private institution that offers an eligible post-graduate course of study. The annual report must include (but is not limited to) ...
Then it sets out a series of requirements. Proposed subsection (2) says:
The Minister must cause copies of any annual report prepared under subsection (1) to be laid before each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after completion of the annual report.
I believe that is the tenor of what the Senate was actually asking the original bill to be amended to. I draw your attention, Chair, to House of Representatives proposed amendment (4). I am now quoting from proposed section 98JA, `Eligible private institution to report information':
(1) The Minister must, as soon as practicable after 31 December in each year, require each eligible private institution that offers an eligible post-graduate course of study to report to the Minister, in an approved form, information regarding their operations during that year.
(2) The eligible private institution must comply with a requirement under subsection (1) as soon as practicable.
What does `as soon as practicable' mean? Does it mean that the institution can take six months or 12 months? We have a requirement for the institutions to actually provide the minister by 30 June each year with a report and then we have this open-ended proposed section. In accepting some of the Senate's amendments, the government has definitely improved the bill. The tenor of the amendments that we have before us appears to go a long way to recognising the issues that the Senate has raised, but we have this amendment on the requirement of the institutions that I believe is far too open ended.
In concluding, I would like to put on the record that the government has still not accepted the main issue that has been raised in this debate, and that is the issue that, for the first time, the government has listed two non-self-accrediting institutions to have access to PELS. I realise that during the debate the minister very clearly indicated that no institutions other than those that are set out in column 2—Christian Heritage College in Queensland and Tabor College in South Australia—will have access under this legislation. But the clear concern that was expressed by the vice-chancellors that we consulted was that they believed that this would start a process where other institutions would have leverage to be able to voice their particular position to also have access to the PELS scheme. I want to place very clearly on the record that the vice-chancellors are not saying that those non-self-accrediting institutions should not be financed—that is not their position. They clearly believe that the government should provide funding for those non-self-accrediting institutions through a different budgetary process. Their concern primarily stemmed from the fact that the $18.5 million that is available for PELS to approximately 120 institutions would be further diluted by access given to other non-self-accrediting institutions. I will place on the record that One Nation will support the passage of the bill, but it is disappointing that the government has not taken into account the concerns of the vice-chancellors of the universities.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-09-26,"—Like Senator Harris, the Australian Democrats have pointed out on numerous occasions our concern with this legislation, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002, for some of the reasons outlined in both Senator Harris's and Senator Carr's contributions. This legislation pre-empts the so-called comprehensive review of higher education, the Crossroads process that has been put in place by Minister Nelson. Also, we did not think an appropriate rationale or even an adequate rationale was put to the chamber as to why these four institutions, in particular the two non-self-accrediting institutions to which Senator Harris referred, should be given public subsidy. By that I mean private institutions getting public education money—that is, taxpayers' dollars, money that is provided by Australian taxpayers, going to these private institutions, particularly those two non-self-accrediting private institutions.
The Democrats do not resile from our earlier criticisms and our concerns but, without meaning to reflect on a vote of the Senate, we all know that the amendments put forward by me, Senator Harris and Senator Nettle went down; they were not supported in the debate on this legislation. The Democrats supported the opposition amendments in an attempt to see increased accountability mechanisms built into this legislation. We recognise and we acknowledge, having looked at these amendments—I am seeing these amendments and the House of Representatives message for the first time; indeed I do not know if anyone, apart from the government and the Labor Party, had much warning that this debate was coming on; it was a bit of a surprise to me and, through you, Chair, obviously it was a surprise to Senator Harris as well—that they represent a marginal improvement to this legislation.
When I heard Senator Carr's contribution earlier, as I was running down to the chamber expressing surprise that this was coming on, I thought, `My gosh, the government's agreed to everything. This is fantastic.' But then I realised it was Senator Carr putting on a very good performance, trying to make a marginal improvement to the bill sound like an extraordinary opposition victory.
—It was.
—Senator Carr, that is a marginal improvement and you know it. You and I have worked on higher education policy long enough to know that this is a marginal improvement. Given that this represents a backdown, somewhat, by the Australian Labor Party, I would like Senator Carr—and the minister, if he would like to—to tell us about the amendment to which Senator Harris referred.
Senator Harris picked up on one of the key amendments that have been lost in this message from the House. Amendment (16) talked about more than the annual report, the annual reporting date and the issue of practicability, as Senator Harris pointed out. Look at the original size of this amendment. It talked about the annual report, including the following: evidence that course requirements and learning outcomes are comparable to those of a similar field of study at an Australian university; evidence of staff quality, qualifications, research output, referred research publications and citation indices; institutional governance, facilities and student services; financial status and operation; student and staff data; equity plans and outcomes for students and staff; and planning data. I do not see that reflected in the amendment that has been accepted by the House, which is something along the lines of:  
The Minister must, as soon as practicable after 31 December in each year, require each eligible private institution that offers an eligible post-graduate course of study to report to the Minister, in an approved form, information regarding their operations during that year.
What information during that year will be made available? Senator Harris, let alone the issue of when the information will be made available, the issue is how much information and what information will be provided. I think that is a significant backdown by the Labor Party in that respect.
We supported the Labor Party's original amendments because, yes, we recognised there were issues of institutional governance, issues of accountability and, indeed, as referred to in that original amendment, issues to do with access and equity and that nexus between research and teaching to which I referred many times in my contributions to the debate on this legislation. I am just wondering whether someone from the government or the Labor Party would like to enlighten us as to what guarantees the Labor Party has been given by the government that the reporting requirements will be as stringent as we had originally hoped, given the fact that there is an unprecedented element in relation to this legislation—namely, money being given to those non-self-accrediting private institutions.
Generally, let us not forget that we have put four private institutions into the HEFA schedule. We have had the debate previously about Notre Dame and others, but we are now talking about four more private institutions accessing public education funds. That is the fundamental issue that the Democrats were concerned about in relation to this legislation. I was convinced that there was an element of concern from the Labor Party as well but, instead of rejecting outright this further extension of public education dollars to private institutions, they sought to amend it in a way that increased those accountability provisions. We supported that. We were disappointed they did not support our amendments but that is not the issue now.
Having said that we supported the ALP amendments, we expected them to stick to them. I recognise that Senator Carr and the shadow minister, Ms Macklin, have gained some marginal improvements through negotiations with the government but I am just wondering, really, how satisfactory these amendments are. Senator Carr, what guarantees have you been given by the government, by the minister, that you will get those stringent reporting requirements that you demanded and that you passed in a resolution of this Senate?",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-09-26,"—I will briefly respond to Senator Stott Despoja's remarks. Firstly, I suppose it is not to be unexpected that, when there is success in this approach, the Democrats would try and play it down. I accept that that is the way it works; that is fine. We, however, are very confident that there has been a significant improvement in the situation and we will argue that position. We are more than happy to argue that publicly.
Secondly, there was an imputation that there had been, somehow or other, arrangements made by the government and the opposition with regard to the timing of this bill. I can assure Senator Stott Despoja that, like her, I knew that this matter was coming on when I read the red this morning. That is the long and short of it: I had as much notice as she did about this bill being returned at this time. I knew it was debated yesterday in the House but I read the red this morning and that was my notification.
—They would have got the draft yesterday. 
—The manager points out to me that there were, in fact, draft reds available. I will confess that I did not read the draft red last night but I did read the red this morning. 
—I just wanted to know what you agreed on—
 (Senator Ferguson)—Order! Senator Stott Despoja, this is a not a debate with Senator Carr; I ask you to cease interjecting. Senator Carr, would you please address your remarks through the chair.
—Of course I will address my remarks through the chair. These are matters being canvassed across the chamber and the committee tends to be a little more informal than, I understand, the standing orders would otherwise properly allow. The substantive question is: when did we know when the amendments were going to be agreed to by the government? I understand that that was the case yesterday and that they were moved by us. These amendments were moved by us. So, again, it was no great secret. The member for Jagajaga moved these amendments. Therefore, it should not be a surprise to the Democrats that I would support those amendments here. They are Labor Party amendments which the government has been obliged to accept.
Concerning the question of guarantees, we know that when dealing with this government guarantees mean very little. So often before we have heard words about their guarantees. What we can say is this: in the discussions around these amendments we are firmly of the view and it is our clear understanding that these institutions will be required to report on the same basis as public institutions. We will see in their annual reports and in the government's published statistics the effect of the policies being pursued in regard to admissions and research and the other matters that we would expect from any other public institution. So the reports will be as rigorous as they are for public institutions. 
You may well argue that that in itself opens up a few other questions, but that is their understanding. We have also said that, if their understandings are shown to be incorrect, we will revisit the issue—I have stated that already. After the next election I anticipate that there will be a change of government, and I am sure all the senators will acknowledge that, and we will have plenty of opportunities.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-09-26,"—I am a little puzzled and disappointed that it appears Senator Alston is not going to address the substantive issue that I have raised of the difference between the original amendment that was proposed and passed by the Senate and the alternative amendment that has actually been presented to the Senate. The original amendment stated:
The Minister must, as soon as practicable after the end of the 30 June in each year, cause an annual report to be prepared ...
The minister was then required within 15 days of that report having been produced to provide a copy of that by laying it before each house of parliament. 
When we look at the proposed amendment that the government is asking us to accept, the date of causing the report to be produced has changed. There is not an enormous amount of angst about that. But there is nothing in the proposed amendment that requires the minister to table that at a particular time. So the government is asking us to move from a position where the minister is obliged to table a report after it has been produced to a position where the minister does not have to do anything with a report once it is produced. 
We also have the issue that I raised before—and I am speaking now about page 5 of the amendments, subsection (2), where it says:
The eligible private institution must comply with the requirement under subsection (1) as soon as practicable.
Senator Alston has not in any way indicated to the chamber what that means. Can they take the entire year to provide that report? Can they take from 31 December one year to 31 December the next year to provide the minister with that report? As this amendment stands, that is exactly what it says. I would like Senator Alston to convey to the chamber whether there is a requirement for the minister to table that report once he receives it and to comment on the open-endedness of subsection (2) on page 5? ",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-09-26,"—I was not here for the start of the debate, so I apologise for that. The original amendment, to which I believe Senator Harris is referring, is the one that would have massively duplicated the existing state accreditation processes, so it was basically a Commonwealth land grab. I hesitate to say it, but I think Senator Carr's summary was pretty accurate as to the effects of the amendment, because it does ensure that the institutions will report consistently with the obligations imposed on public institutions and it will provide a range of information that he had adverted to as well.
As Senator Harris rightly points out, the legislation simply requires that information be provided as soon as practicable. I am authorised to undertake to the chamber not only that that information will be provided and incorporated in the triennial funding reports but also that those reports will be tabled on an annual basis. So the information will be there regularly. You will have the certain knowledge of progress and you will have it on a rolling basis, so I think that pretty much satisfies most of the concerns.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-09-26,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I introduced the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2001 [2002] as a private senator's bill in June of last year. The report of the committee, which is a unanimous one, is an invaluable addition to the body of work on this vital accountability area. I thank the witnesses for their input, without which we could not have got the insights that we have. This bill is based on one simple principle: that those who have the courage to speak out against corruption and impropriety deserve protection. Despite strong and generally unanimous Senate pressure, certainly since 1994, successive federal governments have shown a reluctance to embrace this principle and to establish comprehensive protection for whistleblowers. The only protection available for the public sector is under section 16 of the Public Service Act 1999, and it is manifestly inadequate—a point the committee unanimously makes.
Whistleblowers play an important role in ensuring the accountability of government. They are individuals who, by reason of their employment, come across information that reveals corruption, dishonesty or improper conduct at any level of government. When such people bring this information to the attention of the appropriate authorities, they must be protected from retribution. Whistleblowing is often the only way that impropriety can be exposed. However, this can come at a significant personal and career cost to the whistleblower. The often justified fear of reprisal can stop potential whistleblowers from coming forward. We should always recognise that whistleblowers are acting in the interests of us all when they expose corruption or improper conduct. Unless we can provide a means of encouraging them, corruption or improper conduct can continue unchecked.
This state of affairs is clearly not in the public interest. The state and territory governments almost unanimously now have whistleblower protection bills, and the federal government needs to catch up. While the exposure of improper conduct can be embarrassing for federal governments, this does not justify allowing such conduct to continue by refusing to protect those who would expose it. Experience both in Australia and overseas has shown that whistleblowers and their families are often harassed and suffer emotionally and financially as a consequence of the whistleblower having exposed unacceptable conduct within the organisation. The public interest demands that public employees be able to expose impropriety without that fear of reprisal. 
The bill that I introduced, which was not perfect and would be considerably improved by the recommendations of the committee, is an important step in the right direction. The committee's report is another important step. It points to good improvements that can be made to the bill and is a welcome consideration of the necessary features of a legislative regime to protect public interest disclosures. I am hopeful that it may provide the impetus for a legislative response by the government on this issue. The response will not come until there is an appreciation by government both of the public interest in encouraging whistleblowing and of the general support of parliament and parliamentarians for it. Those witnesses who appeared before the committee illustrated both points, and I hope that the government will carefully consider their testimony and the committee report which arose from it.
In conclusion, I return to the principle that people should be encouraged to make disclosures that are in the public interest to the proper authorities without fear of recrimination. Those people who put their careers and livelihoods on the line to expose impropriety for the benefit of the community as a whole deserve our protection. I thank the chair, the committee members and, in particular, the committee secretariat for their hard work on this report. I thank the witnesses. I strongly encourage the government to consider the report carefully with a view either to accepting my own bill, as appropriately amended, or to developing their own legislative response.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-09-26,"—I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Espionage and Related Matters) Bill 2002. Earlier this month we paid respect to those who lost their lives in New York on September 11. It is said that a lot has changed since that tragic day. Indeed, it has. In a little over a year the laws of our country have fundamentally changed. The antiterrorism legislation passed by the Australian parliament has been deeply disturbing to those who cherish freedom and the Australian way of life. Perhaps the most disturbing change is the government's apparent belief that our society cannot be both safe and free at the same time. Freedom and democracy are the foundations of our country: they define us as a people, they are the source of our strength as a nation and they are our beliefs that thousands of Australians have sacrificed their lives for. Defending those beliefs in times of international crisis is more than an act of patriotism, it is a moral imperative. 
The Criminal Code Amendment (Espionage and Related Matters) Bill 2002 extends and toughens the laws against alleged espionage with serious implications for basic democratic rights. Espionage provisions formed part of the Crimes Act 1914 when it was first enacted. Part 7 of the act, then entitled `Breach of Official Secrecy', contained and continues to contain the relevant offences. The act was amended in 1960 to include the current espionage provisions. In 1987 the government established an independent review committee on Commonwealth criminal law chaired by the former Chief Justice of Australia, Sir Harry Gibbs. The review examined part 7 of the Crimes Act 1914. In 1999 the Australian intelligence system and the espionage provisions came under scrutiny when a former member of the Defence Intelligence Organisation, Mr Jean-Philippe Wispelaere, was arrested in the United States and charged with a range of offences associated with the unauthorised disclosure of United States intelligence material. The Commonwealth Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security was commissioned to review security procedures. He reported in 2000 and made more than 50 recommendations. These are not publicly available because of the sensitive nature of many of the measures.
The bill before us today affects Australian espionage laws in four ways. Firstly, the bill refers to conduct that may prejudice Australian security and defence rather than safety and defence, and explicitly defines this term, consequently affording protection to a range of material that may not be protected under the current law. The terms `security' and `defence' will apply to both the espionage offences as well as the existing official secrets offences in section 79 of the Crimes Act.
Secondly, the bill expands the range of activity that may constitute espionage to cover situations where a person discloses information concerning the Commonwealth's security or defence with the intention of prejudicing the Commonwealth's security or defence, or the intention of giving advantage to the security or defence of another country. Thirdly, the bill affords the same protection to foreign sourced information belonging to Australia as it does to Australian generated information. Fourthly, the bill increases the maximum penalty for a person convicted of espionage from seven years imprisonment to 25 years imprisonment.
Turning to the problems of the bill, One Nation has a number of key criticisms. The bill widens the meaning of Australia's defence and security to include the operations and methods of intelligence and security agencies. This means that exposure of an illegal action of a security agency or even the revelation of a security bungle could fall within the meaning of an act of espionage. There are several problems with these new terms. Further, the definition of `security' or `defence' contained in the bill is an inclusive definition; it does not exclude the ordinary meaning of `security' or `defence'. This is a very wide provision and it means that the offences created under it have application for issues of defence which may relate to the defence forces as such or the specific geographic requirements of Australia's defence and are therefore wide and imprecise.
In evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, the Hon. Justice Dowd, President of the International Commission of Jurists, explained this issue in the following terms:
The use of the word `includes' is a very dangerous drafting technique because it does not define at all; it simply expands. If you are doing something as clearly important as this, you should define it. You have not defined `defence', you have not defined `security' and therefore there are three concepts: security undefined, defence undefined and an expansion of both. That is no way to draft legislation for serious offences such as this; you should in fact define it.
It is in the public interest to discuss the methods and operation of security agencies and under this legislation such discussions will become an offence liable to prosecution.
This is another bill where we see many sweeping definitions. For example, `information' means information of any kind, whether true or false and whether or not in a material form. It includes an opinion or even a report of a conversation. Under the terms of the bill, `information' is not limited to classified information and it could include information that is already in the public domain. The information does not have to be obtained directly from the Commonwealth, it is enough for it to be in its possession or control. 
Mr David Bernie, Vice-President of the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, has stated that the definition of `information' is extremely broad and does not just relate to classified information. He explained to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee:
I understand there is a system of classification in relation to information. I think if we are going to be dealing with information we should be dealing with classified information. We should not be dealing with information that deals with the amount of tea and biscuits that might be consumed by the Department of Defence or ASIO. It should be about classified information because we are talking about offences here which will have a penalty of imprisonment for 25 years.
An element of the offences relating to espionage and similar activities involves communicating or making known information that is or has been in the possession or control of the Commonwealth. One Nation is concerned that this bill may preclude the release, in the public interest, of information that is not in the public domain. These offences are punishable by imprisonment for 25 years.
The New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties has observed that the Commonwealth obtains a very broad range of information, all of which may be regarded as information for the purposes of the bill. It has said:
Given the wide definition of information this could include ministerial briefings of many kinds to, for example, the defence or foreign minister and as the information is not limited to classified information could include information that is in the public domain in any event. The information does not have to be obtained from the Commonwealth; it is enough for it to be in its possession or control.
Yet again with this bill we see the government trying to introduce the reversal of the onus of proof. Under the proposed legislation, the defendant in a prosecution will be required to prove one of the defences. This is contrary to the fundamental principles of justice under our system of law. As with the antiterrorism bills, the government is attempting to overturn one of our important common law principles and a democratic right—that is, that we are innocent until proven guilty. On this point, the International Commission of Jurists has noted that the bill:
... reverses the criminal onus and is contrary to the overwhelming nature of criminal offences and obliges a person whom may have quite innocently obtained information who [may be] making soundings for quite [l]awful purposes to go into evidence to show that the taking of soundings was lawful. This offence should be presented in the normal form and require the Crown to negative the items included as defences.
Reversing the onus of proof places too much responsibility on the defendant to prove their innocence. The defendant should have all the protection that the law provides, which the common law, as we understand it, has had built into it for hundreds of years.
In conclusion, by passing this bill in its present form the government will seriously erode the public's right to information. This legislation threatens scrutiny of government in Australia. It has potential to stifle public debate and should be withdrawn. One Nation echo the sentiments of thousands of Australians when we say that the government's antiterrorist strategy is badly flawed when it includes attempts to limit the circulation of information generally. Democratic governments should not use the war on terrorism as an excuse to crack down on citizens. The problem with this bill is how these provisions will be applied not only today but also years from now. In the wrong hands, it could be extremely dangerous. If passed in its present form, the bill will seriously erode civil liberties. Key elements of the bill are an overreaction. Coupled with the government's proposal to give ASIO greater powers to detain people, the proposed bill constitutes an insidious threat to our freedom.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (ESPIONAGE AND RELATED MATTERS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2002-09-26,"—I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Espionage and Related Matters) Bill 2002. This bill is a worthwhile piece of legislation and it has the opposition's support. Espionage is a very serious crime—one of the most serious that can be waged against the security of a country—and our laws must make that clear. The issue of protecting our national security is one which the Labor Party take very seriously and we certainly support measures which balance the fine line between protecting our nation and its secrets and protecting individual civil liberties. This bill updates Australia's antiquated laws in this area and strengthens the penalties for breaches of the legislation. 
A number of matters have recently shone new light on intelligence agencies, not least of all the September 11 attacks which have made the entire world nervous as to the consequences when intelligence fails to predict the horrifying. There was the case of Jean-Philippe Wispelaere, the Australian now serving 15 years in a US prison for espionage, and the case of R v. Lappas, both of which drew attention to our current espionage laws, which were created before the First World War. It is imperative that our parliament craft intelligence legislation carefully and reasonably to have a framework that can punish those who are the actual perpetrators of espionage and to protect the innocence of those who are not.
It was as early as 1991 that the focus on espionage began in the form of the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law headed by former High Court justice, Sir Harry Gibbs. More recently, there was an inquiry headed by Bill Blick, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Mr Blick's report confirmed the need to update our espionage laws and to impose tougher penalties on those who break these laws. The report made more than 50 recommendations, which were not made publicly available due to their `sensitive nature'. According to the Attorney-General, this bill `evolved as a result of both the Gibbs and Blick reviews'.
The proposed legislation was originally tabled before the November 2001 election and before I was a member of this parliament. The bill lapsed with the dissolution of parliament but has now reappeared as a very different document. The original bill caused great concern among Australia's press and academia. In addition to the espionage provisions that are in the bill we are considering today, the original bill also transferred the official secrets provisions of part 7 of the Crimes Act 1914 to chapter 5 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. This aspect of the bill was heavily criticised for containing jail terms for secondary disclosure or whistleblowing in relation to non-national security matters, even when the information was disclosed or published on public interest grounds. While Western parliaments have for many years attempted to protect the rights of whistleblowers, it seems as though the mission of this government in its original bill was to punish them. For some reason, it appeared as though the government was nervous about people revealing to the public important issues such as the trials and tribulations of former Minister Reith, his son and his telecard. There was wide concern that journalists could be prosecuted for unauthorised leaks, even if they were in the public interest. The secretary of the journalists union, Chris Warren, in regard to unauthorised leaks said:
[A]n unauthorised disclosure is nothing more than a stage-managed story by a politician. The government is using the ghosts of the September 11 tragedy to revive some very bad laws, which have been dormant for several years.
Academics were also strongly critical of the bill in its original form. For example, Don McMaster in the Australian Journal of International Affairs said:
[T]he proposed legislation is of concern in that, if implemented, it may contravene internationally recognised human rights, including the rights to liberty, fair trial and freedom of association.
Any bill which has the possibility—or, in the case of the original bill, the almost certain probability—of catching innocent people simply to seem tough on crime and terrorism is a particularly dangerous and shameful development. We can fight terrorism without impacting on our individual civil liberties and we can fight terrorism without impacting upon Australia's free and open media. 
The report of the review headed by respected former High Court justice Sir Harry Gibbs recommended the decriminalisation of non-security disclosure of information. The government decided to ignore this recommendation despite its claim that the original bill was based on the Gibbs review. The opposition are opposed to any draconian security legislation that unfairly infringes the rights of ordinary Australians such as journalists and ordinary public servants and bars them from revealing government scandals. We applaud the fact that, under considerable public pressure, the government has removed the provisions regarding official secrets from the current bill. 
Turning now to the current bill: the opposition believes that the bill in its current form will modernise and strengthen Australia's espionage laws. Now that the sweeping official secrets provisions have been removed and other minor amendments proposed, it can be said that the bill strikes the right balance. Labor supports measures which take a strong and principled stand against terrorism and against espionage, but the government must be wary of going too far and creating an Australia where agencies can too easily interfere with the civil and political rights of individuals. The bill before us today, with the official secrets provisions removed, is a good law for Australia.
The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee considered the current bill, and its unanimous report was tabled in May this year. With the more controversial provisions of the original bill removed, the committee supported the legislation but suggested amendments, which the government has agreed to. The committee had four remaining issues of concern with the bill. The first of these was information in the Commonwealth's possession. An element of the offences relating to espionage and similar activities involves communicating or making known information that is or has been in the possession of the Commonwealth. Concerns were raised about whether information both within the possession of the Commonwealth and in the broader public domain would still technically fall within the offence provisions. The specific concern was that there would be much information now within the public domain that would be unlawful simply because it was once in the possession of the government. While the Attorney-General's Department advised that this was not the intention of the bill, the Senate committee still insisted that this provision be amended. The government has now responded to this concern by proposing an amendment changing this provision and creating a defence against liability if the information was already in the public domain.
The second area of concern of the Senate committee was disclosure of information. The committee also expressed concern, as I said, that there was some uncertainty surrounding the section that stated that it was unlawful to disclose information to `another country or foreign organisation'. The committee was concerned that the proposed offences would inadvertently cover government disclosure of protected information through lawful or official channels such as under the intelligence-sharing agreements that Australia has with other countries. The committee quite rightly saw the flaws in this section, for our intelligence communities need to consult with allies on a regular basis. That essential practice should not be made illegal. Once again, I am pleased to say that the government has altered the bill to the satisfaction of the opposition so as to address this issue.
The third area of concern that the Senate committee had was knowledge of information in the possession of the Commonwealth. The committee shared the concerns of the International Commission of Jurists in evidence that was given to the committee that a person who communicates information to another country not knowing that the information is in the possession or control of the Commonwealth might have committed an offence. The committee recommended that the bill be amended so that an element of each offence is that a person knows that the information is or has been in the possession or control of the Commonwealth. Again, this recommendation of the Senate committee is reflected in the government's amendments.
The fourth and final area of concern that the Senate committee had related to the offence of illegal soundings. The Crimes Act 1914 contains an offence of communicating to anyone outside Australia information on hydrographical soundings of the sea surrounding Australia. The bill proposed to translate that offence across to the Criminal Code Act 1995. In 1991 the Gibbs Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law recommended that, because of the questionable need for the provision in light of technological developments, the sounding offence should be repealed. Despite this recommendation of the Gibbs review, the government chose to retain the offence in the current bill. 
The Senate committee took evidence about the unintended application of such an offence—for example, by foreign-owned fishing vessels sending soundings information back to their country of origin and thereby committing an offence. The committee also raised concerns that, where the taking and recording of soundings is required under law, ships' masters were inadvertently potentially committing an offence. The committee therefore proposed that the current provisions relating to soundings be repealed and the bill amended to delete the proposed division 92. The government has agreed not to proceed with the soundings provisions contained in the bill. The government introduced amendments to the bill that substantially give effect to the recommendations of the Senate committee to which I have just referred. The House of Representatives unanimously adopted those amendments.
I turn now to some of the specific provisions in the bill, beginning with the penalties provisions. The Attorney-General has stated that the real purpose of the bill is to increase the penalty for espionage from a maximum of seven years to 25 years in jail. Based on international standards, our penalty for espionage is small. This is compared with the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, which have penalties almost double those of ours. The United States, on the other hand, has penalties that can range from life imprisonment to even death if the offence involves the death of a US agent or if it involves particularly sensitive information. Certainly Australia should not head too far in that direction—and more than trebling our current maximum penalty, as this bill does, is not a particularly desirable outcome. But, hopefully, increasing jail sentences is not the government's sole law enforcement mechanism. However, an increase in penalty is a needed outcome from this legislation to bring it into line with international standards and the penalty created in this bill is, in my view, sufficient.
Another effective change that this legislation will bring about is changing the language of the offence of espionage from conduct that may prejudice Australia's `safety or defence' to Australia's `security or defence'. Using the word `security' rather than `safety' will expand the definition of the offence to cover more material than is currently protected. The parliament's intention is reflected in the words that the legislation contains. We must, therefore, be thorough and attentive to ensure that we have solid language so that the courts can interpret legislation as the parliament intended. The changing of the word `safety' to `security' will not now allow cases to fall through technical cracks. `Security or defence' is defined in clause 90.1 of the bill as including `operations, capabilities and technologies of, and methods and sources used by, the country's intelligence or security agencies'.
This definition did attract criticism from the New South Wales Council of Civil Liberties and the Law Institute of Victoria for the reason that it prevents exposure of illegal activities within security organisations. Despite a lacklustre defence of this definition at the Senate committee hearings by the Attorney-General's Department, this provision remains in the legislation. We must, therefore, be aware that this bill quite generally will prevent information from being leaked from intelligence agencies even if it is in the public interest. In regard to this definition, Michael Head, from the University of Western Sydney, stated in an article in the Alternative Law Journal:
It could apply to the revelation that the Howard government used the DSD to monitor communications with the Norwegian freighter the Tampa during the August-September 2001 confrontation over the government's refusal to allow the ship's rescued refugees to enter Australia.
Despite the criticisms that this definition attracted, the definition should be strong and encompassing. I do not believe that it will substantially interfere with the public interest. Our security organisations need to have a legislative framework for security of their information and this section will provide that. 
Another aim of this bill is to offer the same protection to foreign-sourced information belonging to Australia as it does to Australian-generated information. This is important because Australia, having a relatively small intelligence community, must share the resources of our closest allies, and we must ensure that we maintain the integrity and safety of our allies information. Thankfully, Australia has had very few espionage cases over the years—so, while this legislation is important, it is not of immediate concern in a safe, predominantly peaceful country such as Australia. This should not, however, dissuade us from preparing for any eventualities that may occur. We must do this carefully to ensure that we punish the right people in the right way. We must ensure that innocent people are not jailed as a consequence of this legislation, and we should not fast-track this legislation because of recent tragic international incidents.
Espionage is a crime that threatens the security of this country and the continuation of our freedoms. We must ensure against this, as the consequences of espionage could be both dangerous and catastrophic. As mentioned by my colleague Senator Faulkner, the government has recently entered into a legally binding agreement with the United States governing the exchange of information between the two countries. Senator Faulkner pointed out that the foreign minister has said that this agreement will involve a requirement that personnel accessing classified information be security cleared to an appropriate level. The United States uses techniques such as polygraph tests that are not usually used in Australia. I understand that ASIO is currently undertaking a one-year test of polygraphs. I would hope that before these are introduced into this country, parliament will have the opportunity to fully scrutinise their proposed use.
By way of conclusion, it is encouraging that the Attorney-General has, of late, taken a positive approach to this legislation by taking an unacceptable bill and putting it in a workable form. He has done so, firstly, by removing the dangerous elements of the 2001 bill and, secondly, by incorporating the Senate committee's recommendations into appropriate amendments.
Australia needs tough but fair measures to fight crimes such as terrorism which our intelligence community protects us from. This bill in its amended form is now in a form which is both tough and fair. I support the bill and I hope that it will become an effective piece of legislation that can assist in preventing and penalising the dangerous crime of espionage.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (ESPIONAGE AND RELATED MATTERS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2002-09-26,"—I welcome the opportunity to participate in the second reading debate on the Criminal Code Amendment (Espionage and Related Matters) Bill 2002. The bill was introduced before the prorogation of the previous parliament and has been reintroduced by the government for consideration in these sittings. Its main effect is to establish new espionage offences in part 5.2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. It is intended to strengthen Australia's espionage laws in a number of ways. There are four particular points in that regard that I wish to allude to.
Firstly, the bill refers to conduct that may prejudice Australia's `security and defence' rather than Australia's `safety and defence' and explicitly defines that term, consequently making protection available to a range of material that may not be protected under current laws. The term `security and defence' will apply to both the espionage offence and the existing official secrets offences contained in section 79 of the Crimes Act.
I want to make a brief further reference to the matter of security and defence which was alluded to by the previous speaker. The change to the term `security and defence' in the bill is, as I understand it, intended to reflect the more modern intelligence environment, if you like. The term `security' is intended to capture information about not only the operations but also the capabilities and technologies, the methods and sources of Australian intelligence and security agencies. It was the view of the government that the term `safety' was unlikely to include such information. The broad definition of `security and defence' is available in clause 90.1 of the bill. 
The bill also expands the range of activities that may constitute espionage to include those situations where a person has communicated or made available information that concerns the Commonwealth's security or defence with the intention of prejudicing the Commonwealth's security or defence or advantaging the security or defence of another country. These are obviously very serious matters, as previous speakers have also alluded to. It also affords the same protection to foreign sourced information that belongs to Australia as it does to Australian generated information. As Senator Kirk alluded to, it increases the maximum penalty for a person who is convicted of an espionage offence from seven years to 25 years imprisonment. These are all particularly important components of the legislation.
I propose to speak briefly today about what is contained in the bill, because I think that is perhaps more relevant to consider than those areas that are not in the bill that is before the chamber. As I indicated, one of the key areas is the increase in penalty from seven to 25 years imprisonment. That is regarded as a recognition of the serious nature of the crimes of espionage and associated activities and in the current environment is a particularly appropriate step for this parliament to take.
The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which I have the honour of chairing, considered this bill and inquired into it earlier this year and reported to the Senate in May. That report contained five particular recommendations, including one that the bill progress subject to the consideration of those recommendations. I want to acknowledge this morning and draw attention to the very important recognition that the Attorney-General has given to the work of that committee—of all of its senators—in bringing forward those recommendations and in the consideration of the amendments that the government has put in this bill as it is now presented. It is important to acknowledge that the committee process of the Senate is taken very seriously by the Attorney-General in that regard. Speaking on my own behalf, I am very grateful for the Attorney-General's interest in that process and for the support of the Attorney-General's Department in making information and material available to the committee to ensure our deliberations are well informed.
With respect to the first of those recommendations, the committee suggested that it be made explicit in the bill that a person would not be liable for prosecution under these espionage offences where they communicated information that was in the public domain. From the committee's perspective there was some concern that that had not been made clear in the drafting process. The government have indicated they propose to accept that recommendation, and the amendments contained in the legislation that is before us create a defence to the espionage offences where the information that is being communicated is already in the public domain with the lawful authority of the Commonwealth. From the committee's perspective, that is an important recognition of that particular recommendation.
The second of the committee's recommendations related to subclauses 91.1(1)(c) and 91.1(2)(c), which involved a person's action perhaps resulting in information being disclosed to another country or a foreign organisation. The committee noted the potential for an unintended consequence because of the use of the word `disclosed' in that context—that a person who communicates or makes available information to a foreign country with the intention of prejudicing the security or defence of the Commonwealth may not be liable for prosecution where that information is already known to the foreign country. So the committee recommended that the bill be amended to address any possible uncertainty arising from the term `disclosed to another country or a foreign organisation'. As a result of that, the references in the espionage offence provisions in division 91— those subclauses to which I referred previously—to information `disclosed' will be replaced with the words `information communicated or made available'. That does address the committee's concerns in that regard.
The third of the key recommendations from the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report reflected the concern that an offence might be committed by a person who communicates information to another country, not knowing that the information is in the possession or control of the Commonwealth; that is, that there was not an element of knowledge in the provision as it was initially drafted. 
The committee's recommendation was that the bill be amended so that an element of each offence in this category would be that a person knows that the information is, or has been, in the possession or control of the Commonwealth. The amendments that the bill comes forward with now will replace the reference that I have just cited with a reference to information that:
... the person acquired (whether directly or indirectly) from the Commonwealth ...
That is an acknowledgment of the committee's concerns in that regard. The fault element that will be present in that offence will be the element of recklessness—that is to say that the person was reckless as to whether they acquired the information, either directly or indirectly, from the Commonwealth. I am pleased also to welcome that amendment in the new bill before the Senate today.
An issue of some interest—and an area of new examination for some members of the committee—was the soundings provisions that were located in the bill. The committee recommended that those offences be repealed. There are a number of reasons for that. It is important and appropriate to acknowledge the expertise of my coalition colleague Senator Scullion on the committee in this regard. He has significant experience and expertise in this area, and committee members and some people in the Attorney-General's Department were very grateful for Senator Scullion's specialist knowledge in this area.
The intent of the amendments is that the soundings provisions that are currently in division 92 of the bill will be removed, but the existing soundings provisions in section 83 of the Crimes Act will be retained in their current form. That is because the government considers that it is not appropriate that the existing provisions be repealed until there has been an opportunity to assess the continuing utility of the provisions as they stand. As I understand it, the Attorney-General's Department continues to work with the Department of Defence to look at what the most appropriate legislative and administrative measures are to protect soundings. These are obviously very important issues for Australia's commercial, navigational safety and security interests, and it is important that they are taken very seriously by the departments concerned and, of course, by the government.
Finally, having this bill before the Senate now is a continuation of the government's commitment to protect Australia's national security, to deter the very serious crimes of espionage and to ensure that the penalty for any action aimed at betraying Australia's security interests is very serious. This is an important step in ensuring that the legal framework we have in place supports that commitment. Not only does the bill strengthen and restate the existing provisions in the Crimes Act that prohibit deliberate disclosure of national security information to a foreign power, but, as I said at the commencement of my remarks, it also increases the maximum penalty for those offences from seven years to 25 years imprisonment. It is worth noting that the report on this bill by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee was unanimous, and I am sure all committee members will welcome the government's adoption of our recommendations. I commend the bill to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (ESPIONAGE AND RELATED MATTERS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-09-26,"—I want to speak on this important bill on behalf of my colleague Kerry Nettle and the Australian Greens. I am grateful to Katrina Willis in Senator Nettle's office for her briefing on the matter as well. We have a different point of view to that of the last two speakers on the matter. The Criminal Code Amendment (Espionage and Related Matters) Bill 2002 substantially widens the scope of Commonwealth activities and information to be kept secret from the Australian public. It does this by expanding the definition of espionage from `activities that may prejudice Australia's safety and defence' to `activities that may prejudice Australia's security and defence'. `Security', of course, is a popular term with governments at the moment. 
The bill creates four new espionage offences and extends protection to the operations, capabilities and technologies of, and the methods and sources used by, Australia's intelligence and security services. It will have the widest possible jurisdiction, extending beyond Australia's borders to anywhere in the world. Under this bill it will be an offence to disclose information about the Commonwealth's security or defence with the intention of prejudicing those things, and it will also be an offence to disclose information about the Commonwealth's security or defence to advantage another country's security or defence. Let us put this in context. The government has stated that the bill has its genesis in the arrest and charging of the Australian citizen Jean-Philippe Wispelaere in 1999 with offences relating to the unauthorised disclosure of United States intelligence material. Indeed, the offences relating to disclosure of non-Australian material being held by the Commonwealth are designed to cover such circumstances.
This bill also aims to give the same level of protection to foreign sourced security and defence information belonging to Australia as to Australian information, both in Australia and overseas. We are witnessing another grab for power by the executive and its agencies. Through this extension, the government wants the authority to hide from public view even more information about what it does in the name of protecting our nation's interests. History shows us that governments have a propensity to engage in all manner of activities, including those of a dubious nature, in the name of protecting the nation. Of course, the very great difficulty is where to draw the line between our time-honoured civil liberties and the clandestine works of security agencies, intelligence gathering agencies and the parliament that designs the laws in which they work.
The Attorney-General has said that the bill, if enacted, would create in Australia one of the tightest, strongest pieces of legislation on sensitive information amongst the countries with which Australia exchanges such information, but when you look at it the bill bears all the hallmarks of the government's ill-considered new anti-terror agenda. As with other legislative components of this agenda that have been brought before the parliament in recent months, this bill seeks to give even more power to unaccountable forces, all in the name of protecting the national interest. The government has been doing its best to whip up hysteria about the threats Australia faces. Just this week the Attorney-General, speaking about the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002, confirmed there is no specific threat to Australia; yet we are told that we are on heightened security alert all the same.
The Attorney-General warned the parliament to expect more measures to curtail the freedom of citizens. He said:
... as the threat environment evolves, we will need to review the appropriateness of our tools in the fight against terrorism.
The Greens believe that we should be wary about demands from the government for greater protection of its activities from public scrutiny, remembering, of course, that we already have very extensive laws in place both for the surveillance and for the tracking down of people who might be a threat to our security. We should be particularly wary at a time when the government seems to be trying to ready Australians for a war—namely, the Bush led invasion of Iraq. The Australian section of the International Commission of Jurists told the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill:
Considerable care has to be taken in terms of Security and Espionage Legislation ... in times of war ... when the institutions of our society are under threat ...
The International Commission of Jurists also expressed concern about the scope of the new definitions of espionage that this bill proposes. The definitions of `security' and `defence' are very wide. Likewise, the use of the word `prejudice' is very subjective and difficult to define. The New South Wales Council of Civil Liberties also criticised the definitions, stating that they would include the operations and methods of intelligence security agencies. The council said that this could mean that the exposure of an illegal action by a security agency could fall within the meaning of `an act of espionage'. That means that, in talking about an illegal act being undertaken by an espionage agency, citizens could fall foul of this bill. Human rights watch groups could also find themselves charged and convicted for publicising the security operations of repressive regimes in other countries or publicising human rights breaches by Australian authorities. The Council of Civil Liberties recommended a general defence for whistleblowers and activities of such organisations. 
Senator Nettle or I will be moving an amendment in the committee of the whole. We will be further elaborating on how important it is that we have that defence of whistleblowers and the activities of civil rights groups in this country against the potential overreach of this bill. The bill lengthens the maximum term of imprisonment for espionage offences from seven years for similar existing offences to 25 years. That is more than three times the current period. In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General stated:
... the proposed offences are consistent with equivalent provisions in the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada.
He said:
We should regard espionage as seriously as these countries.
Yet with the exception of United States, where the death penalty is applied in some espionage offences—an unacceptable penalty in any circumstances—the maximum penalty for these equivalent provisions in the countries cited is 14 years, not 25 years, as the Attorney-General averred.
Depriving a person of his or her liberty is a most serious matter. Twenty-five years is a very long time to be imprisoned, and the government has proposed no compelling argument in support of substantially extending the maximum term as it is currently laid out. If the government considers it adequate to rely on overseas comparisons for creating these new offences then the overseas terms of imprisonment should also be adequate. They are about half of the term the government is proposing. The Australian Greens will be moving an amendment to make the maximum term of imprisonment 14 years. This retains discretion for a judge to impose a lesser penalty, of course.
This bill retains the existing penalty of the maximum five years in jail for breaching an order by a judge acting in a federal jurisdiction to restrict the publication of and access to evidence relating to an application or other proceeding. But, because this bill expands the range of information shielded from public scrutiny, this penalty provision has the potential to be applied far more widely than in the past. We believe that it is inappropriate to jail anyone for breaching a suppression order in these circumstances. There may be occasions when there is a genuine public interest in disclosing the subject of court proceedings, particularly in the case of what Commonwealth intelligence and security agents are doing in the name of Australians. Putting a jail sentence on this is inappropriate and too harsh. The Australian Greens will be moving an amendment to delete the maximum five years imprisonment penalty and replace it with a fine. This is consistent with practice in New Zealand, where the maximum penalty for breaching a suppression order, including in relation to espionage offences, is $NZ1,000.
Under the bill only a judge in a state or territory supreme court can decide whether to grant bail to a person charged with an espionage offence. The Australian Federal Police Commissioner will issue an order to all members of the AFP that bail should be opposed in espionage cases as a general policy. We do not support that. Depriving somebody of their liberty should be done in exceptional circumstances and should relate to those particular circumstances. We see this bill as part of the government's agenda to crack down on civil liberties through the guise of the so-called war on terrorism. The Australian Greens repeat that there are very extensive existing laws to track down, keep watch on, suppress, arrest and bring to justice people who are engaged in activities which are inimical to the nation. We are extremely wary of the proposals by this government that further limit and truncate the civil liberties of Australians. ",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (ESPIONAGE AND RELATED MATTERS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-09-26,"—I thank senators for their contribution on what is a very important bill. We are dealing with the Criminal Code Amendment (Espionage and Related Matters) Bill 2002. I will refer to a number of points made by senators. Senators Faulkner and Kirk reiterated issues raised by a number of people in the other place about the agreement between Australia and the United States concerning security measures for the reciprocal protection of classified information which was signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, and Ambassador Schieffer on 25 June this year. Senator Faulkner has repeated claims which are ill-informed—that the agreement will hinder the access of elected representatives to classified information or that elected representatives would need to be subjected to a personnel security clearance. This is simply not the case. The agreement will not in any way prejudice the existing procedures for access to classified information by parliamentary representatives. The issue was specifically considered at the time of signing the agreement. The continuation of the current practice in relation to parliamentary representatives was expressly confirmed in an exchange of letters by both parties at the same time as the treaty. The letter stated:
In respect of the requirement for security clearances in the agreement, the parties acknowledge the special status of elected representatives at the federal level and confirm their intention to continue to apply their current practices to them.
This information is readily available from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It was also made crystal clear by the Attorney-General in his speech in reply in the other place, and I suggest that those who want to raise this issue do their homework and have a look at what was said. The new agreement merely updates, simplifies and strengthens a framework for the bilateral exchange of classified information which has been in place and worked well since 1962. It does not change domestic law or policy.
The agreement was tabled in parliament on 27 August this year and considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on 16 September. Until such time as that committee reports on the agreement, no action will be taken to bring it into force. A national interest analysis summarising the agreement was circulated when the agreement was tabled. May I remind the opposition and Senator Faulkner that it was the Howard government that introduced the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties as part of the Howard government's landmark reforms of Australia's treaty making process in May 1996. I recall it very well because I was the chair of the committee which led to that new process. The result of those reforms is of course a much more transparent process which gives Australians unparalleled input into and opportunity to understand the work of government in making new international laws.
Senator Faulkner also repeated concerns about the ASIO polygraph trials which were raised by the member for Banks, Mr Melham, in the other place. The polygraph trial being undertaken within the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation is still in progress. I can advise the Senate that, as the Attorney-General stated in his press release of 21 September 2000, it is a voluntary trial being undertaken to evaluate the potential of the polygraph as a personnel security tool. For reasons of security, details of the trial are not being made public. I am not aware of any discussions between the Australian and US governments concerning possible requirements for polygraph testing of Australian personnel granted access to classified information released by the US. The ASIO trial commenced in response to recommendations by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Mr Bill Blick. Mr Blick was commissioned by the Prime Minister to undertake a review of security procedures following the 1999 arrest of a former Commonwealth officer, Jean-Philippe Wispelaere, on charges of attempting to sell highly classified material. ASIO agreed to undertake an internal and voluntary trial of polygraph tests to evaluate the potential of those tests as a personnel security tool.
Senator Greig touched on some of these issues. He outlined the history of Jean-Philippe Wispelaere, who, as I stated, was formerly a Commonwealth officer in the Australian Defence Intelligence Organisation. He of course has been convicted and is serving a sentence in the United States. Senator Greig suggested that Mr Wispelaere's father intends to sue the Australian government, alleging negligence in giving security clearance to his son, on the basis that they failed to detect schizophrenia and his addiction to steroids. Can I say quite frankly that there have not been any proceedings commenced as yet. Of course, if proceedings are commenced then any allegations or claims by Mr Wispelaere's father can be tested in a court of law. Otherwise, the government denies what has been said. We believe that this really is of no great moment. 
Senator Greig also raised the question of a prisoner transfer agreement between the United States and Australia. Of course, we have passed the Commonwealth International Transfer of Prisoners Act 1997. That does enable transfer of prisoners between Australia and foreign countries in certain circumstances. However, in order for there to be a transfer between the United States and Australia, we do need to have an agreement. Such an agreement can be addressed in the form of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners, which will not take effect until 1 January, or we can have a specific agreement between the United States and Australia. As I understand it, from 1 January 2003, transfer of prisoners between Australia and the United States will be possible, subject to terms and conditions established under the convention I mentioned and to each country's domestic legislation. I think that deals with the aspect of transfer of prisoners.
Senator Greig also referred to the lack of whistleblowing provisions in the espionage bill. The bill was never intended to deal with the issue of whistleblowing. Its purpose is to strengthen Australia's espionage laws. The Public Service Act 1999, which commenced on 5 December 1999, introduced a whistleblowing scheme for the Commonwealth public sector. Public servants who want to make a genuine public interest disclosure can make such disclosures to persons who are authorised to receive such disclosures. That was dealt with extensively in that legislation.
Turning back to this bill, this bill establishes an effective legal framework to both deter and punish people who intend to betray Australia's security interests. That is the straightforward intent of this bill. It is a very important one, one that is needed especially in our modern times. As a result of this bill, we will have one of the tightest, strongest pieces of legislation to protect sensitive information among our information exchange partners. This bill will strengthen Australia's espionage laws in a number of ways. The type of activity that may constitute espionage has been expanded. A person may be guilty of an espionage offence if they disclose information concerning the Commonwealth's security or defence while intending to prejudice the Commonwealth's security or defence. They may also be guilty of an offence if they disclose without authorisation information concerning the Commonwealth's security or defence, to advantage the security or defence of another country. Importantly, the new offences will also protect foreign sourced information belonging to Australia. As a result, we can offer greater assurances to our information exchange partners that, when they provide information to us in confidence, we will protect that information in the same way that we protect our own sensitive information. A person who compromises foreign information in our possession will face the same penalty as a person who compromises Australian generated information. The penalties will reflect the seriousness of the offence. As a result of this bill, the maximum penalty for a person convicted of espionage will be 25 years imprisonment.
In addition to strengthening the offence provisions, the bill includes provisions that further support the process of bringing cases of espionage to trial. The most important measure in this regard is to guarantee that only a judge of a state or territory supreme court will decide the question of bail. In addition, I am advised that the Australian Federal Police Commissioner intends to issue an order to all members of the AFP that, as a general policy, bail should be opposed in espionage cases. This will ensure that, wherever possible, those alleged to have committed espionage will not be able to escape the law. This is a very important part of the bill. 
The government's amendments to the bill that were moved and passed in the other place responded to recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The committee made five recommendations, including that the bill progress subject to the other four recommendations. The government has accepted and given effect to the Senate committee's recommendations. I believe that when Senator Harris addressed this bill he was doing it on the basis that we had not accepted those recommendations from the Senate committee. I would remind Senator Harris that we have indeed accepted those recommendations. I want to make that very clear.
When the Attorney-General introduced the bill into the House of Representatives on 27 September 2001, the bill contained provisions dealing with official secrets. It was not debated and lapsed when parliament dissolved for the November 2001 federal election. When the Attorney-General introduced the bill into the House of Representatives again, on 13 March this year, the official secrets provisions were not included in the current bill. Much has been said about this. The official secrets provisions were designed to replicate existing provisions in the Crimes Act in more modern language consistent with the Criminal Code. These provisions were the focus of considerable media attention and were the subject of a considered misinformation campaign. It is very important that I put the record straight. The media suggested that these provisions were designed to limit the freedom of the press and that they would have prevented the reporting of government activities. The media scare campaign suggested that the government was conspiring to plug leaks. This campaign was alluded to by Senators Faulkner and Greig in the debate on this bill. This bill was never intended to deal with the issue of whistleblowing. Its purpose is to strengthen Australia's espionage laws. The government's view—and it is one which is backed up by legal advice—is that there is in substance no difference between the existing provisions of the Crimes Act and those that were intended to replace them. Despite this, to avoid delay in achieving the primary purpose of the bill—to strengthen Australia's espionage laws—the government decided to excise these provisions from the bill. There was nothing more or less to it than that.
The government did so not out of any concession that there was any substance to these misinformed claims. On the contrary, the government did so because the government did not want to hold up the passage of this important legislation. The government decided that for the time being the Crimes Act provisions should stand in their current form. The government is committed to protecting Australia's national security and punishing those who threaten Australia's interests. Through this bill, the government is not attempting to limit the freedom of the press or to plug leaks. This bill is not aimed at hampering or preventing public discussion. This bill is aimed at providing a safe framework for the exchange of sensitive information and will ensure that we have strong laws to punish those who seek to betray Australia's interests. It will also provide protection for Australia's national security and punishment for those who threaten Australia's interests.
This bill is very important for the national interest. It serves Australia well, and I place on record those other points because there has been a good deal of misinformation about this bill and its intention. The intention of this bill is none other than to protect Australia's national interest, and I have outlined how it will deal with that in relation to people who offend the laws against espionage. I thank the opposition and Democrats for their support of this bill, and I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2002-09-26,"—Labor basically support the ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2002. We are happy to give the bill non-controversial status to expedite its passage. The bill is very important to the automotive industry and Australian manufacturing in general. However, we hope the government will be able to release the Productivity Commission's final report on industry assistance and its own response fairly soon so that there can be a proper debate on the directions in which the government intends to take this industry. This will enable decisions to be made early enough so that the industry can have some security about the decisions that it has to take with respect to future investment in the industry.
Labor have already provided an initial response to the commission's position paper released in June. Labor support ongoing assistance to the industry beyond 2005. We are also interested in revamping ACIS to give greater emphasis to research and development, training and investment in the industry. The Productivity Commission has argued that there is no need to amend ACIS. Their view is that it is basically a subsidy regardless of where it is delivered. We disagree strongly with that view of ACIS. Our view is that the revamping of ACIS to give greater assistance to R&D and greater focus on investment and innovation would send a strong positive signal to the industry and provide greater assistance to those activities which are crucial to Australia building its competitive niche in the global automotive sector. Labor also see some merit in the suggestion to have separate pools for the capped component of ACIS, as well as for car makers and their suppliers.
On the issue of tariffs, Labor have called for another review in 2006-07 to determine post-2010 assistance arrangements. The Productivity Commission's own economic modelling has shown that the national gains of reducing automotive tariffs below 10 per cent would be negligible or even, in respect of this industry, negative. We have also argued that future assistance arrangements for the car industry should not be conditional on supporting the government's industrial relations war. It is our view that it was a cheap political trick for this government to try to link its industrial relations agenda to future support for an industry which is of such critical importance to the Australian economy. To do so brought no merit to the government and created consternation among the leadership of the industry. It could have created some concern among those leaders of the industry who were considering substantial future investment in automotive production in this country. But the leaders of the automotive industry did not fall for that three-card trick and they continued to pursue their argument for support for the industry into the future, separate and distinct from any issues relating to how the industrial relations environment in the industry should be progressed.
Even the Productivity Commission has argued against making a link between industry assistance and the pursuit of the government's workplace relations agenda. Labor's view is that the convening of roundtable discussions involving the auto industry and unions to achieve cooperative solutions to future workplace relations issues, including the forthcoming series of enterprise bargaining, would be the most effective and constructive way of dealing with the industrial relations issues that this industry has to comply with. One should also understand that this is an industry that has complex and fragile supply chains. There is an interrelationship not just with the plant producers but also with the auto component suppliers, who manage production in this industry on a just-in-time basis. If the industry had fallen for the clumsy attempt by the government to use future support for the industry to create an industrial relations environment that would have been confrontationist then the potential damage to this industry and to its markets could have been substantial. As I said, the Labor Party basically support the bill and we are happy to give it non-controversial status.",SENATE,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2002-09-26,"—I thank Senator George Campbell for his contribution to the debate. However, I should point out in answer to his comments that the issues of post-2005 assistance arrangements for the automotive industry and the state of industrial relations in that industry have no relevance to this bill. The bill gives full effect to the government's original stated intention to continue the former duty-free allowance. It allows motor vehicle producers to claim uncapped incentives for the production of utilities, panel vans and pick-ups from the commencement of the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, and as a consequence it relieves unintended pressure on the modulated element of this program. I am glad that we have agreement on this bill and I commend the bill to the Senate.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-09-26,"—The Dairy Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 amends the Dairy Produce Act 1986 to give the Australian Dairy Corporation a key role in the planning and facilitation of reform to the delivery of statutory services to the Australian dairy industry. Additionally, the bill provides dairy farmers in receipt of assistance under the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program or the Supplementary Dairy Assistance scheme with access to Farm Help re-establishment grants—access that has been denied since the end of the Dairy Exit Program on 30 June this year.
Senators will be aware of major changes in the Australian dairy industry over the past few years. Full domestic deregulation in July 2000 saw state dairy authorities disappear and forced significant change on the industry. Deregulation was supported by a majority of dairy farmers but it has nevertheless caused much pain, particularly at the farm level, in quota states such as New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. This pain has been ameliorated to some extent by the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program. Nonetheless, dairy farmers have had their fair share of battles in recent times.
Deregulation forced change at farm and company level. Now the industry itself seeks change in the way that dairy industry services—particularly promotion, research and development—are delivered. For over 12 months, the dairy industry has been working on a proposal for a new industry structure. Following extensive consultation, the industry has determined that it is desirable to merge the service activities of the Australian Dairy Corporation and the Dairy Research and Development Corporation into a single industry services body, preferably in the form of a Corporations Law company. The industry has identified the following benefits in its plan: firstly, greater accountability to stakeholders through industry ownership and control; secondly, better coordination of research with trade, promotion and marketing activities; and, thirdly, more efficient service delivery. A dairy industry newsletter, dated September 2001, says of this new levy-funded company:
The increased flexibility will allow the company to easily adapt its roles and structure to changing industry requirements and the commercial and social environment.
The dairy industry's desire for a new industry services structure is the very basis of the bill before the Senate. The bill does not provide for the implementation of the structure but rather gives the Australian Dairy Corporation the capacity to begin the task of investigating options for reform. By providing the Australian Dairy Corporation with this capacity, the bill allows the process of reform to begin in earnest.
It is out of character for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to respond to industry requests for assistance and leadership in anything approaching a timely fashion. We all know that the minister, Mr Warren Truss, has had a few other things on his mind over the past few months. It takes no small amount of talent—and, I am sure, energy—to simultaneously bungle exceptional circumstances reform, administration of the US beef quota and assistance to the sugar industry, but Mr Truss has given it his absolute best shot. Fortunately, the minister has not bungled the dairy industry—at least, not yet. The industry wants a new structure in place by July 2003. Upon passage of this bill, I urge the minister and his department to give the ADC, and the industry, all the assistance it needs to develop a properly considered reform model. There are many complexities involved in transferring functions and funding from statutory bodies to Corporations Law companies, and providing the ADC with the capacity to facilitate investigation of this matter is a prudent action. But the government must not use this action to delay active assistance to the industry to investigate and formulate a final reform model. 
The dairy industry is one of Australia's most important rural industries. That is why it is so important for the government to pay serious attention to its responsibilities to assist this industry to prosper. The industry comprises 12,000 dairy farms across all six states. It is a sign of the impact of deregulation that the number of farms declined by almost 1,000 in the period 2000-01. The Australian dairy industry is a major generator of economic wealth, a significant exporter and a key employer—particularly in the primary production, manufacturing and distribution areas. Most dairy jobs are found in regional Australia.
During the winter recess I had the pleasure of visiting King Island, in my electorate. I met with some of the managers and employees of the King Island Dairy company. I do not think it will upset too many other dairy companies in Tasmania if I say that King Island Dairy has a justifiable reputation for producing some of Australia's finest dairy products. King Island Dairy's specialty cheese products are truly world class. That is no surprise to anyone who visits the island and experiences its superb natural conditions and environment. But we all know a good environment is, of itself, not sufficient to produce quality primary produce. The farmers and processors at King Island Dairy share one key characteristic with other members of the Australian dairy industry: a commitment to securing and building the industry for the future. That is why the industry presented a plan to the government, and that is why it is so important that the government—in particular, Minister Truss—gives the industry the assistance it needs to finalise its reform plan. The opposition will support this legislation because it represents an important step towards the realisation of a better industry framework.
The second aspect of this bill is the provision of access to exit assistance under the Farm Help re-establishment grant scheme. Access is provided to holders of Dairy Structural Adjustment Program and Supplementary Dairy Assistance scheme entitlements on the same basis as that provided under the Dairy Exit Program. This is a sensible move and the opposition supports it. However, we need to ask why it is that the government failed to introduce this measure before the cessation of the Dairy Exit Program on 30 June this year. I fear it is yet another sign of Mr Truss's unwillingness or inability to give his portfolio the attention it deserves. The opposition agrees to the passage of this legislation and will monitor very closely the support the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry provides for the industry once the Australian Dairy Corporation commences its reform work. Dairy farmers, processors and distributors deserve assistance from a minister and a government that have a track record of taking Australia's primary industries for granted. Labor will ensure that the future of the dairy industry remains firmly positioned in the mind of Mr Truss as the reform process proceeds.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY INDUSTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2002-09-26,"— The purpose of the Dairy Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 is to provide the Australian Dairy Corporation with the additional function of planning, facilitating and participating in the reform of that corporation and the Dairy Research and Development Corporation. While the government has yet to consider a detailed reform proposal, it is essential that such a proposal is rigorously and thoroughly examined. For this reason, extending the Australian Dairy Corporation's functions to provide for this is critical to any progress on this issue. I must say that the dairy industry remains progressive and successful and is to be commended for its continuing conscientious examination of its future and the structures that will assist it in maintaining its relevance in domestic and world markets. 
The bill also provides for farmers with entitlements under the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program or the Supplementary Dairy Assistance scheme to access exit assistance through the Farm Help re-establishment grant scheme following the cessation of the Dairy Exit Program on 30 June this year. This means that eligible dairy farmers will continue to have access to a grant of up to $45,000 payable when they leave the industry and will also have access to the $3,500 retraining grant under Farm Help. Currently only those farmers who are not holders of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program or the Supplementary Dairy Assistance entitlements are able to apply for exit grants under the Farm Help scheme. This inequitable situation will be corrected by removing impediments to the holders of these entitlements to access the Farm Help scheme.
The cost of these changes will be funded out of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program, from which the Commonwealth dairy industry restructure measures are funded. These amendments will have little or no impact on the term of the dairy adjustment levy as they provide for future DSAP and SDA entitlements to be cancelled as part of receiving a dairy type grant under the Farm Help scheme. The grants under the Farm Help scheme are to be net of any entitlements previously mentioned already received by the applicant. These measures will ensure that those in the dairy industry who make the decision to exit agriculture will be able to do so with dignity and real choices for their futures. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-09-26,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Ellison) to questions without notice asked by Senator Faulkner today relating to people smuggling.
I have been asking questions for months about Australia's involvement in disrupting and dismantling people-smuggling syndicates in Indonesia. I am still not satisfied by the answers I have received. The disruption policy is undertaken by the Australian government and funded by the Australian taxpayer, yet the Howard government has so far avoided parliamentary scrutiny of this policy.
The government claims that its policy of disruption has had a significant influence on the decline in the numbers of people trying to get to Australia illegally. In March this year the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, cited the government's policy of physically disrupting the work of people smugglers as one of the main reasons for the decline in asylum seeker boats coming to Australia. We know disruption includes physically disrupting the people-smuggling syndicates and the asylum seekers who seek assistance. We know from the Sunday program and from evidence given by the AFP that an Australian by the name of Kevin Enniss was involved in the people-smuggling disruption program. We know that Enniss worked for the AFP and that he was paid over $25,000 by the AFP. We know Kevin Enniss admitted to reporter Ross Coulthart from the Sunday program that he had paid Indonesian locals on four or five occasions to scuttle people-smuggling boats with passengers aboard.
When these claims were made on the Sunday program, I called at the time for a full, independent judicial inquiry into those serious matters. The government have dismissed the calls. They still are ignoring the calls for a proper inquiry. But the denials of the government on these issues are not sufficient. It is not enough to say, as Senator Ellison and Mr Downer have said publicly today, that it has never been the policy of the Australian government to sabotage people-smuggling vessels. It is not enough to say that the Australian government has never sabotaged vessels or directed that they be sabotaged. There was the usual huff and puff—they denounced the opposition and criticised us for daring to ask what they described as `outrageous questions'.
I say that asking these sorts of questions and demanding answers is the responsibility of the opposition. It is the responsibility of the government to answer those questions. I want to know, and I intend to keep asking until I find out, about a number of things. How far does disruption go? What are the limits, if any? I want to ask, and I want an answer to, precisely what disruption activities are undertaken at the behest of, with the knowledge of or broadly authorised by the Australian government. I want to know, and I think the parliament and the Australian public are entitled to know, what directions or authorisations ministers have issued in relation to disruption. I want to know how the policy of disruption is funded. We would like to know who funds the policy of disruption. How much does it cost to fund the policy of disruption? Who actually receives those taxpayers' moneys for the disruption program? Who tasks the Indonesian officials or others to disrupt people smugglers or the clients of people smugglers? 
We also want to know whether Australians are involved in disruption activities in Indonesia. And it is perfectly reasonable for us to ask about the accountability mechanisms that are in place in relation to these activities, particularly when the MOU governing these particular matters collapses: the commissioner for the AFP and the minister cannot say why; the commissioner cannot even say he asked why that occurred. We want to know whether Kevin Enniss was actually involved in the sabotage of vessels, as Kevin Enniss has claimed. We want to know if others were involved in the sabotage of vessels and we want to know why the government is avoiding an independent inquiry into these very important issues. Nothing else will suffice in these circumstances.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Immigration: Border Protection</title>,Questions Without Notice,26,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2002-09-26,"—This is another desperate attempt at catch-up politics. The Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident has been a disaster for the Labor Party. There has been inquiry upon inquiry and Senate estimates hearings as well, all examining these same issues, and the Labor Party has failed to gain any political purchase or traction at all. I will get to that in a minute. Senator Faulkner's questions rely on the SIEVX incident, but he has had an opportunity, as have all the opposition members, during the inquiry to ask questions about this. These questions could have been asked of the Australian Federal Police, Coastwatch, the Royal Australian Navy and others, but now that the inquiry has finished it seems just too opportune for Senator Faulkner to raise further issues regarding the inquiry. We have been doing this for month upon month. We have heard from Mr Kevin. He gave evidence and believes there is some big conspiracy about SIEVX, and we are still searching for the smoking gun or perhaps the grassy knoll. It is becoming more and more pathetic and more and more desperate.
—Mr Kevin is now a Labor Party staffer, of course.
—Is that right? Well, perhaps even that.
—We heard evidence at length from the Royal Australian Navy, Coastwatch and the AFP. The AFP evidence is pretty simple with respect to SIEVX. They say:
The AFP did not know the identity of SIEV X, nor its time and place of departure, until after it had sunk, and it had no involvement in its sinking.
That is the evidence from Commissioner Keelty. I note that recently he has also said:
The AFP are doing an outstanding job in working with the Indonesian National Police to combat the very serious crime of people-smuggling. Their joint efforts have prevented well over 3,000 people coming into Australia since February 2000.
I accept there may be an argument from Senator Faulkner and Labor that perhaps the intelligence should have been passed on more quickly or more should have been made from the intelligence among the agencies I mentioned. That is an argument that I accept. But to say there is some conspiracy about this evidence or about the conduct of Mr Enniss is ridiculous, particularly at this stage, when we have had Senate estimates hearings, the select committee inquiry, a Privileges Committee meeting and also a senior council examining the evidence. There have been about four inquiries into this same matter and still Senator Faulkner is not satisfied. I will tell you why. It is because Labor are embarrassed by the whole process. They started this off many months ago, saying that the Prime Minister knew about `children overboard' and that he failed to correct his statements to the public. Now, of course, the Labor Party say the Prime Minister should have been told and he was not. They have moved from saying, `He was told,' to saying, `He should have been told.' The Labor Party has gained virtually nothing in this whole inquiry and it has become an entire embarrassment.
Also, having failed to skewer the Prime Minister's credibility on this entire inquiry, now the Labor Party are focusing on certain middle-level public servants. Again, it is pathetic, because of their failure to muster any political traction. What is behind all this from Senator Faulkner today is the Labor Party's embarrassment about their failure to gain any political advantage from the `children overboard' inquiry. What this inquiry has established is that people smugglers bring people into this country if they pay thousands of US dollars to get here. What we also know is that people smugglers have been engaged in a pattern of conduct which involves bringing people into Australian territorial waters, scuttling boats, sabotaging navigational equipment and, if necessary, threatening Royal Australian Navy staff. That is the pattern of conduct that has been established over the course of this inquiry. This is political catch-up of the most pathetic sort, because the Labor Party thought they were on a winner. And what happened? They went down very badly on this entire issue. Four or five inquiries later they are still playing catch-up, and it is absolutely pathetic. For Senator Faulkner to raise these allegations now after the inquiry has wound down is pathetic and bordering on dishonesty.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-09-26,"—I do not know whether the last speaker is proud of the fact that the public were misled over the `children overboard' affair or whether he is proud of the way the government handled the photos of the kids in the water. If he is, let him get up and say so. What we heard today from Senator Ellison— quite properly in one sense—was an attack on people smugglers. I agree with that. Why in heaven's name are the AFP employing them at $25,000 a pop if they are so loathsome? That is exactly what the situation is.
Earlier Senator Hill was asked a question about the role of ASIS. These are matters we cannot probe too far—we understand that. He said he would have to go away and check. We are entitled to know whether ASIS has been tasked in the generality of these matters. This parliament laid down the legislative basis for ASIS and put in an extra clause that furthers ASIS's scope, because we cannot anticipate everything, and we should be told if it is used. But we should only be told about the generality of its application, not the specifics. In other words, if ASIS is tasked to involve itself in the disruption of people-smuggling, we should know. If one individual or several individuals involved in people-smuggling are targeted by that directive, we should not be told. That is simply the role of this parliament and the way the legislation is, but we should have an answer to the general question, not the specific question.
Senator Ellison tried to give the impression today that the Ombudsman's report clears the Federal Police. It goes to process matters; it does not go to the third Sunday program, where the key allegation is made. So the Ombudsman has not cleared the Federal Police. Today I read the tirade from the commissioner of police, who cannot understand the subtlety of what Senator Faulkner said in the last three speeches; he just completely misinterpreted it for his own purposes. If ever I have seen an evasive witness, it was him at the estimates hearings and at the certain maritime incident inquiry. Why doesn't he front up and give straightforward evidence? Why have all these officials got such selective memories or a lack of intellectual rigour that would force them to probe certain issues that they should be pursuing if they hold responsible jobs? I cannot understand that.
The nub of this issue is that we know that the government admits to disruption in Indonesia. We do not have a problem with that in the generality. Of course that is part of deterring people smugglers and illegal asylum seekers from coming to this country. We have stressed all along the importance of our bilateral relationship with Indonesia, because the more it prospers the more chance we have of deterring people smugglers operating out of that area. It is only because this government allowed that bilateral relationship to so badly deteriorate that problems have arisen.
The nub of the problem is: where do you stop in terms of deterrents? Can you be sure that the agents that you have employed to do (a) and (b)—that is the T-shirts and the information campaigns and the rumours—have not gone the extra step? We do not get an answer to that. We hear Mr Enniss, as he would claim, being verballed on Channel 9 but Mr Coulthard would say that he is telling the truth. He has told Mr Coulthard that he has been involved in sabotaging four or five ships. Do not get carried away about the sabotage; it is not meant to sink the ships— no-one alleges that. To sabotage the ships means that they go out to sea, something breaks down, they come back and that is the end of the journey. But the big what if is that, if you have sabotaged a boat and it does get 60 or 70 miles out into rough seas, it may well go to the bottom with major loss of life. 
Mr Enniss claims, and this is what we want checked, that on four or five occasions he used part of the money supplied to him— and he may not have reported up the line, I do not know—to help sabotage boats. Now if he was doing it 1,300 miles away from where SIEVX left—we want to know whether anyone else was doing it. This is what we want to know. We are not saying that the government are involved in a policy that says go out and sink boats, but if you have been funding some lousy stinking people smuggler to the tune of 25 grand I would want to know what he was doing. This government should want to know but they do not want to know. They do not want to investigate this. They simply want to abuse the Leader of the Opposition in this place, who has got the ticker to raise these issues.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2002-09-26,"—For the last three nights, Senator Faulkner has tried to set up a diversion by delivering a series of speeches—a trilogy of trivia—in which he has sought to cast doubts upon the integrity, the professionalism and the honour of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian security services and their role in SIEVX. This morning he scored the hit that he was looking for because he scored page 1 in the Australian. Notwithstanding what we have just heard from Senator Ray, we know precisely what Senator Faulkner has been up to when you see the page 1 story in this morning's Australian under the headline `Labor asks: was SIEV X sabotaged?' By innuendo—
—Senator Collins interjects, good question. Senator Collins, do you adopt the allegation by innuendo that SIEVX was sabotaged and that the Australian government was responsible for it? Do you make that allegation, Senator Collins— do you or don't you? 
—That's out of order.
—Order! Senator Brandis, your remarks should be directed to the chair.
—One of the most dishonest things a person can do is to cast innuendos and say, `I am not really making allegations; I am merely asking questions.' I remember very well when Mr Tony Kevin, who was the source originally of the allegations about SIEVX, said that. He is now, I might say, a Labor Party staffer, as I understand it.
—You know that is not true.
—I believe that it is true. He was a consultant with Mr Rudd, the shadow minister for foreign affairs. When Mr Tony Kevin, the disgraced former ambassador to Cambodia, first raised these allegations at the `children overboard' inquiry, I said, `Mr Kevin, what allegation do you make?' He said, `I am not making any allegations; I am merely asking questions.' This is precisely the same—raising doubt, casting innuendo and besmirching the good name of the Australian Federal Police and Australian security organisations in the process. In his cowardly way, Mr Kevin said to me, `I am not making any allegations; I am merely asking questions.' It reminded me of that remark by William Shakespeare—the definition of a coward is someone who is willing to wound but afraid to strike. That is the cowardly behaviour that we saw from the disgraced former ambassador who was recalled from the embassy in Cambodia under circumstances of great discredit. That is the same behaviour that we have seen today and over the last three evenings from Senator Faulkner. 
Let us get the record straight. As Senator Mason has pointed out, these issues were trawled over ad nauseam by Senator Faulkner in his examination of Commissioner Keelty in the `children overboard' inquiry. I do not want to anticipate the findings of that inquiry—it would not be proper to do so— and I will not. The transcript will reveal that Senator Faulkner got precisely nowhere with Commissioner Keelty. Today, Commissioner Keelty issued a press statement, which was ridiculed in a disappointing way by Senator Ray, who is usually, I might say, very responsible on these matters. The points that Commissioner Keelty makes in his press release are these: firstly, that Mr Kevin Enniss was operating from a location, Kupang, 1,300 kilometres from the departure point of SIEVX at the relevant time and had absolutely nothing to do with it or its passengers; and, secondly, that Mr Enniss ceased his operations with the Indonesian National Police two to three weeks prior to the departure of SIEVX. But the most important point of the lot is that Mr Enniss has been interviewed by the Australian Federal Police and he has categorically denied making the statement to the journalist Ross Coulthard which is the entire basis of the innuendo and the slander that Senator Faulkner and the Labor Party are now seeking to raise.
People who put their lives in harm's way like the officers of the Australian Federal Police deserve to be treated better and they certainly deserve to be treated better by two senior senators, both of whom have held defence portfolios in the previous Labor government. The behaviour of Senator Faulkner and, I am sorry to say, Senator Ray today in giving fresh life to this innuendo is a disgrace.
—Mr Deputy President, it was an adverse reflection and I ask him to withdraw it.
—My advice from the Clerk is that that is unparliamentary. I seek that you withdraw that, Senator Brandis.
—What?
—I am not going to repeat it, Senator Brandis. Please withdraw the remark.
—I am not sure what I am being asked to withdraw, Mr Deputy President. Which comment?
—It related to the conduct of the senators that you referred to.
—If it is unparliamentary to describe that conduct as a disgrace, I withdraw the unparliamentary remark.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Immigration: Border Protection</title>,Questions Without Notice,26,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-09-26,"—I must say I am extremely disappointed this afternoon to hear Senator Mason and Senator Brandis. I am extremely disappointed because it was Senator Mason who moved in this chamber to expand the terms of reference of the certain maritime incident inquiry to be able to investigate what happened in the case of safety of life at sea in incidents other than SIEV4. The inquiry was to look at SIEV4. Senator Mason, with the enthusiastic support of Senator Brandis and others, asked to look at all such incidents. Some cynics may think that was because they wanted to trawl through every one in order to try to find in some case an allegation that children were thrown overboard. If those cynics were right, that was a dry well; they never found any such thing at all.
What did come forward was SIEVX. SIEVX was a boat in which 353 people drowned—142 of whom were women and 146 of whom were children. That is a major catastrophe in human terms and a major maritime tragedy in the international waters bordering on our littorals. It is something that ought to be properly investigated. These two senators were instrumental in ensuring our terms of reference enabled us as a committee to investigate those things. Now that the investigation is coming down to some very hard questions that require frank answers which so far we have not got, they are defending the position and attacking those who are asking the questions. Not only that, but the last contribution was one that sullied the reputation and attacked the standing of an individual who of course cannot defend himself in this place. The louder the shouting down of reputation, the louder the attack on individuals and the louder the ad hominem attack to try to divert the issues that these individuals are asking questions about, the more curious we become about the questions and the answers to those questions. So I want to say now—and I want to make it very clear—that the more this behaviour goes on, the more these questions will be asked and the more determined we will become to pursue the answers to them. 
There is a lot of information in the public domain that the Australian government has devoted very considerable resources to its program to disrupt people-smuggling in Indonesia. What do we know about the nature and deployment of these resources? We know that the program is based in the Australian Embassy in Jakarta. We know, for example, that there are three DIMIA compliance officers working out of the Jakarta embassy. Two of these positions were created in the last two years. Their major priority is to work on people-smuggling matters. Two Australian Federal Police agents also work from the embassy in Jakarta. These agents work closely with the Indonesian National Police, Indonesian Immigration and Indonesian navy, army and marines. They report directly to the Director of International Operations, Mr Dick Moses, and the General Manager of International Operations, Mr Shane Castles, both of the AFP. Both Mr Moses and Mr Castles were regular attendees at the Prime Minister's People Smuggling Task Force last year. They would inform the task force of criminal aspects of people-smuggling and involvement with the people-smuggling teams and, importantly, with the disruption activities that have been the subject of this debate.
At the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, an interagency coordination group on people-smuggling has also been established. The portfolios represented at these meetings are DFAT, DIMIA, AFP and Defence. The purpose is to share information and assessments and to represent the agencies' view in relation to the people-smuggling matters. Dr Geoff Raby from DFAT has indicated in evidence that disruption activities are a key focus of this group. On 13 June last year, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, travelled to Jakarta. He had meetings with the Australian ambassador, Ric Smith, and the interagency people-smuggling group. He also met with the Indonesian Minister of Justice and Human Rights and the Indonesian Minister of Foreign Affairs.
We would like to know from Mr Ruddock if he raised certain disruption activities during meetings at the embassy either in June last year or during his visit in September. We know that Australian disruption activities in Indonesia were conducted under a specific protocol under the MOU to target people-smuggling syndicates operating out of Indonesia which was agreed by the AFP and their counterparts, the Indonesian National Police, on 15 September. Commissioner Keelty revealed that the protocol under the MOU was set aside by the Indonesian government in September last year due to concerns the Indonesian foreign affairs department had in relation to disruption. We still do not know what those concerns were. We have asked the AFP for a copy of the protocol and MOU but so far it has not been released. Despite the concerns the Indonesian foreign affairs department had about the protocol, the AFP says it continued to cooperate with the Indonesian National Police until June this year.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2002-09-26,"—At the outset of the certain maritime incident inquiry and the formation of the select committee, I remember saying that it was only going to be a political witch-hunt. I was howled down by members of the opposition for stating the obvious—that it was going to be a political witch-hunt—and in fact that is what it has proved to be as we have gone week after week after week hearing evidence. We got to the stage where Tony Kevin, who has been spoken about already today, came in and delivered his first version of his fairy story to our committee. Tony Kevin was the first to raise the issue, and, as the inquiry at that time did not seem to be gaining very much publicity, it was immediately latched onto by journalists who were trying very hard to make something out of nothing. In relation to Tony Kevin, whom I must say could hardly be called an independent witness, immediately he had given evidence to our committee, he started work for the opposition. I understand that he is no longer working for the opposition—or that was the information that was supplied by way of interjection from Senator Collins. I think the fact that he did not last very long contracted to the shadow minister for foreign affairs can only reinforce how unreliable he really is. 
It was only at that stage that the journalists involved in following the progress of this certain maritime incident inquiry started to give his fairy story some legs and it got to the stage where, certainly in the Canberra Times and in some other newspapers, it was the main play of the day. Only the week before last, I was listening to the radio in my home state of South Australia and I heard Moira Rayner, who could hardly be described as someone with conservative viewpoints, saying that the certain maritime incident inquiry had concluded without any doubt that the Australian government was responsible for the loss of over 340 lives. So here is somebody in Perth who, having read what the journalists have put into the papers, has now made it a fact: there was `no doubt' that the Australian government was responsible for the loss of life on the so-called SIEVX.
For month after month, this inquiry has taken as much evidence as I think any committee in recent times has taken over such an issue, and then Senator Cook today accuses Senator Brandis of trawling through some of the things that have happened. I would say Senator Cook is the last person who should be talking about trawling through evidence and, indeed, that could equally be applied to Senator Faulkner. They trawled for days, repeating questions. The same questions were asked time and time again of the same witnesses while trying to get different answers, something that they could hang their hat on in relation to this inquiry. Much of the so-called evidence that Senator Faulkner has brought before the Senate in adjournment speeches over the past three nights has come from selectively looking at quotations from within that inquiry, selectively using information that was provided by the Australian Federal Police and selectively presenting that to this Senate to try to suit another story that he wishes to put to the Australian public.
I say to those members opposite that it does not matter how often they go over the same stuff or how often they present it to the Australian Senate or how often they get journalists to try to prolong the fairy stories that they have tried to invent, to try to somehow or other provide some excuse as to why they lost the last election. That is the key to it all. `We were robbed'—that is the cry of the Labor Party. They say: `We were robbed because the way that you portrayed yourselves in the pre-election period meant that the Australian public did not know what they were doing.' The Australian public did know what they were doing, and there was no more sure evidence of that than the way they voted at the last election to put this government back in, to make sure that we would continue to do the job that we promised to do. We have continued to do that, and no end of inquiries, political witch-hunts or defaming the names of people within the Public Service when they are unfairly treated where you say they have no right of reply—think of all the people whose reputations have been damaged in the course of this inquiry and you might see that, from the time of the very beginning, from the outset— (Time expired)

SENATE LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENCES COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO THE ANTI-GENOCIDE BILL 1999: 
HUMANITY DIMINISHED: THE CRIME OF GENOCIDE
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE
Recommendation 1
The Committee recommends that the Parliament formally recognise the need for anti-genocide laws
Response
Noted. On 27 June 2002 the Parliament passed and assent was given to the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002. This Act inserts Division 268 into the Criminal Code. Subdivision B of Division 268 (sections 268.3 to 268.7) creates five offences of genocide, which effectively criminalise in Australian law the acts characterised as genocide in the Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (`the Genocide Convention').
Recommendation 2
The Committee recommends that the Bill be referred to the Attorney-General for consideration of the matters identified by the Committee in respect of its contents, and that the Attorney-General report his findings to the Parliament by 5 October 2000
Response
Noted. The Government has considered the matters identified in the Committee's report, and makes comments on the following specific matters. 
The Government notes that the Anti-Genocide Bill 1999 (`the Bill') would depart from the definition of genocide in the Genocide Convention. The Government believes that the definition in Australian legislation should accord with that contained in the Genocide Convention. The definition of genocide from the Genocide Convention has been included in Subdivision B of Division 268 of the Criminal Code. Accordingly, the Government does not support the varied definition of genocide contained in the Bill. 
It is also questionable whether the enactment of the varied definition would be a lawful exercise of the external affairs power under section 51 (xxix) of the Constitution.
The Government notes that, although some variations in the manner of implementation of the Genocide Convention in the domestic laws of other countries are evident, the Committee received no evidence of the adoption by any country of the varied definition of genocide proposed in the Bill.
The Bill does not provide for its retrospective operation. However, the Government notes that the Committee was required by its terms of reference to consider the appropriateness of the retrospective application of the Bill. The Government also notes that, in his additional comments in the Committee's report, Senator Greig states that the Australian Democrats support the retrospective application of anti-genocide legislation.
Legislation creating criminal offences does not normally apply retrospectively. It is well established that criminal liability should not be imposed on a person for an act or omission that was committed at a time when such conduct did not constitute a criminal offence.
There is no justification for departing from normal principles in this case.
Practical difficulties can also be encountered in applying legislation retrospectively. For example, it can be difficult to adduce evidence in prosecutions for offences which occurred many years ago.
Accordingly, the Government does not support the retrospective operation of an offence of genocide in Australian law. Subdivision B of Division 268 of the Criminal Code has no retrospective application.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,29,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-09-26,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I acknowledge and welcome the report tabled today by the government, although I express some disappointment in it. As it happens, the inquiry which led to Humanity diminished: the crime of genocide—inquiry into the Anti-Genocide Bill 1999 was based on a private member's bill which I tabled in that year and which went through a long and exhaustive process in the Senate's Legal and Constitutional References Committee. The committee held hearings in a number of cities around the country. I would like to pay tribute to now retired Senators McKiernan and Cooney, who also played a key role in the investigation and reporting of this.
In recent weeks we have seen the government acknowledge and sign on to the International Criminal Court. I welcome that. I spoke on it yesterday, as did other senators, in a different context. I think it is fair to say that part of the momentum towards that and towards the Australian government being comfortable with it came about through early discussions we had, as a chamber and as a parliament, on the Anti-Genocide Bill 1999 [2002]. The time of its introduction, although this was not intended, coincided with the incidents involving Mr Konrad Kalejs. Those events showed how we as a country were— or, more importantly, were not—dealing with that.
As it happened there was considerable community and international discussion and debate around the question of Mr Kalejs, who was alleged to have been involved in war crimes in Eastern Europe during the Second World War but who was then living in Melbourne. It came to light through the Simon Wiesenthal Foundation, amongst others, that there was the allegation that some 70 Nazi war criminals may have been continuing to live in the country. My concern and the concern of the Australian Democrats was: how do we respond to that in terms of appropriate natural justice and the investigation and potential prosecution of those people who are alleged to have been involved in war crimes?
What we learnt in part was that the existing War Crimes Act was ineffective in dealing with, and responding to, those allegations because it was quarantined not just to the years 1939-1945 but also to European theatres of war. It also came to light during the investigation into this issue that, as we now understand, potentially there are war criminals or—to use better phraseology—people allegedly involved in crimes against humanity from different theatres of war or, indeed, places that were not theatres of war but places of conflict. We are talking about Rwanda, Cambodia and the former Yugoslavia. In one instance we saw evidence of a Cambodian woman now living in Melbourne, I think, who came face to face with a former member of the military from her country who, she believes, slaughtered her family. Yet we as a country until very recently had absolutely no mechanism to deal with that because of the narrowness of scope of the War Crimes Act. 
In framing and presenting my private member's bill, I explored the option, amongst other things, of expanding the definitions of those categories of people who might be subject to genocide simply in recognition of the fact that the definitions contained within the 1949 convention were framed at a time when not all factors were taken into account. We know subsequently that through war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide there have been other sectors of the community that have been subject to these kinds of atrocities. They include women, they include people with disabilities, they include gay and lesbian people and they include people on the basis of their political or union affiliation in some cases. So I was very keen to explore that in the scope of the bill.
I note from the government's response tabled today that it does not agree with that and argues against it, saying that the original definitions ought to be adhered to. I argued through the committee process, as I do again today, that the expanded definitions are appropriate. We heard evidence from legal bodies and legal individuals who argued that, given the evolutionary nature of the process of international law, under current circumstances the expanded definitions would indeed fit within the appropriate models that would be needed to address these issues. Of course since then we have seen the government sign on to the International Criminal Court, which in many ways has superseded what I was trying to achieve in 1999 with the anti-genocide legislation. I would express again, though, my concern about the possibility of the government entering into an article 98 agreement to ensure that under American insistence—so it seems—American citizens would be exempt from investigation and prosecution under that process.
I would again express my disappointment, as I did in my minority report, at the way in which the Attorney-General's Department engaged with this committee or, more importantly, did not engage. We sought input repeatedly from the Attorney-General's Department, and on the only occasion that it did engage with the committee it sent the wrong officers to the hearing in Melbourne. That was very disappointing. One of the majority recommendations, which I did not agree with, in the report was that a period of some three months be offered to the Attorney-General's Department for its input. Here it is today, two years later!
I would like to thank the many people and organisations who came before the references committee and who presented both written and oral evidence. There was extraordinary community debate generated around Australia, particularly on the issue of retrospectivity. The bill, as I drafted it, was not retrospective; it would only be prospective and its jurisdiction would only be progressive. There was fear from some individuals and some sections of the community that it might be retrospective, although we made it very clear that it was not. I note in the tabling of the government's report today that it agrees that it ought not be retrospective. Part of the fear of retrospectivity came from people who felt that if the bill had been implemented it may have been accessed by Indigenous people to make claims of genocide against the government or previous governments for issues such as the stolen generations. That clearly was not the case or the intention but it generated some necessary and, I think in some cases, cathartic debate around that issue. 
Two years after the introduction of the private member's bill, after thorough committee discussion and debate around it, and after the bill has been superseded by the International Criminal Court—which I welcome—we now have today the government's response. It continues to argue against the expanded definitions, which I do not agree with. It continues to endorse the notion of non-retrospectivity, which I do agree with. If nothing else, what I take some pride in is the discussion and debate we had around this— not here in the chamber, because we did not have that debate in the chamber, but through the committee process—in the community. The discussion teased out some terrific issues, some wonderful debate, particularly exposing the inadequacies of the War Crimes Act. We also heard about the aspirations of the community in terms of what they wanted to see in better legislation. In many ways that has now been brought about through our adherence to the International Criminal Court.  
I acknowledge the government's report today. I express again my disappointment of its opposition to expanded definitions. I think we can fairly say that the bill, as it stands and as it was originally intended, was a catalyst for what has been ultimately international law reform in this area. I acknowledge and compliment Minister Downer and the government for bringing the International Criminal Court to fruition and final ratification.

As it happened there was considerable community and international discussion and debate around the question of Mr Kalejs, who was alleged to have been involved in war crimes in Eastern Europe during the Second World War but who was then living in Melbourne. It came to light through the Simon Wiesenthal Foundation, amongst others, that there was the allegation that some 70 Nazi war criminals may have been continuing to live in the country. My concern and the concern of the Australian Democrats was: how do we respond to that in terms of appropriate natural justice and the investigation and potential prosecution of those people who are alleged to have been involved in war crimes?
What we learnt in part was that the existing War Crimes Act was ineffective in dealing with, and responding to, those allegations because it was quarantined not just to the years 1939-1945 but also to European theatres of war. It also came to light during the investigation into this issue that, as we now understand, potentially there are war criminals or—to use better phraseology—people allegedly involved in crimes against humanity from different theatres of war or, indeed, places that were not theatres of war but places of conflict. We are talking about Rwanda, Cambodia and the former Yugoslavia. In one instance we saw evidence of a Cambodian woman now living in Melbourne, I think, who came face to face with a former member of the military from her country who, she believes, slaughtered her family. Yet we as a country until very recently had absolutely no mechanism to deal with that because of the narrowness of scope of the War Crimes Act. 
In framing and presenting my private member's bill, I explored the option, amongst other things, of expanding the definitions of those categories of people who might be subject to genocide simply in recognition of the fact that the definitions contained within the 1949 convention were framed at a time when not all factors were taken into account. We know subsequently that through war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide there have been other sectors of the community that have been subject to these kinds of atrocities. They include women, they include people with disabilities, they include gay and lesbian people and they include people on the basis of their political or union affiliation in some cases. So I was very keen to explore that in the scope of the bill.
I note from the government's response tabled today that it does not agree with that and argues against it, saying that the original definitions ought to be adhered to. I argued through the committee process, as I do again today, that the expanded definitions are appropriate. We heard evidence from legal bodies and legal individuals who argued that, given the evolutionary nature of the process of international law, under current circumstances the expanded definitions would indeed fit within the appropriate models that would be needed to address these issues. Of course since then we have seen the government sign on to the International Criminal Court, which in many ways has superseded what I was trying to achieve in 1999 with the anti-genocide legislation. I would express again, though, my concern about the possibility of the government entering into an article 98 agreement to ensure that under American insistence—so it seems—American citizens would be exempt from investigation and prosecution under that process.
I would again express my disappointment, as I did in my minority report, at the way in which the Attorney-General's Department engaged with this committee or, more importantly, did not engage. We sought input repeatedly from the Attorney-General's Department, and on the only occasion that it did engage with the committee it sent the wrong officers to the hearing in Melbourne. That was very disappointing. One of the majority recommendations, which I did not agree with, in the report was that a period of some three months be offered to the Attorney-General's Department for its input. Here it is today, two years later!
I would like to thank the many people and organisations who came before the references committee and who presented both written and oral evidence. There was extraordinary community debate generated around Australia, particularly on the issue of retrospectivity. The bill, as I drafted it, was not retrospective; it would only be prospective and its jurisdiction would only be progressive. There was fear from some individuals and some sections of the community that it might be retrospective, although we made it very clear that it was not. I note in the tabling of the government's report today that it agrees that it ought not be retrospective. Part of the fear of retrospectivity came from people who felt that if the bill had been implemented it may have been accessed by Indigenous people to make claims of genocide against the government or previous governments for issues such as the stolen generations. That clearly was not the case or the intention but it generated some necessary and, I think in some cases, cathartic debate around that issue. 
Two years after the introduction of the private member's bill, after thorough committee discussion and debate around it, and after the bill has been superseded by the International Criminal Court—which I welcome—we now have today the government's response. It continues to argue against the expanded definitions, which I do not agree with. It continues to endorse the notion of non-retrospectivity, which I do agree with. If nothing else, what I take some pride in is the discussion and debate we had around this— not here in the chamber, because we did not have that debate in the chamber, but through the committee process—in the community. The discussion teased out some terrific issues, some wonderful debate, particularly exposing the inadequacies of the War Crimes Act. We also heard about the aspirations of the community in terms of what they wanted to see in better legislation. In many ways that has now been brought about through our adherence to the International Criminal Court.  
I acknowledge the government's report today. I express again my disappointment of its opposition to expanded definitions. I think we can fairly say that the bill, as it stands and as it was originally intended, was a catalyst for what has been ultimately international law reform in this area. I acknowledge and compliment Minister Downer and the government for bringing the International Criminal Court to fruition and final ratification.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2002-09-26,"—I rise this evening to speak to the report for 2000 and 2001 on agreement making in Australia under the Workplace Relations Act. This report is prepared by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and the Office of the Employment Advocate. In particular, I want to draw the Senate's attention to two specific areas in this document. Comprehensive as it may seem, a number of questions still need to be asked not only about this government's policies on industrial relations but about how those policies are then translated into reality in the workplace and what that means for families in this country, particularly in relation to the casualisation of the work force in this country and the lack of family friendly work practices within enterprise agreements and Australian workplace agreements.
This report reveals that the proportion of enterprise agreements which provide for the use of casual labour has increased from 33 per cent to 71 per cent in the past two years. The figures in this document strongly suggest that the newly casualised workers enjoy fewer protections. The proportion of agreements that protect workers by regulating hours, wages and the numbers of casual employees has dropped from 16 per cent to six per cent. The proportion of agreements that provide for a casual loading—that is, the extra hourly pay to compensate casual employees for having no leave entitlements and no guarantee of work—has barely risen, from 25 per cent to only 29 per cent.
We have here a government that talks a lot about how it intends to help families in this country, but these figures show that families are under even more pressure with the new laws, as these laws prevent the award safety net restricting the use of casual labour. Casual workers have no access to paid leave or holidays to look after their families and, with no guarantee of continuing work, many find it impossible to secure a loan in order to buy a car or a family home. These figures show that under this federal government a secure, full-time, permanent job is becoming a distant memory for many families.
Under this government there is not an increase but a significant decrease in family friendly measures within the workplace and within workplace agreement entitlements. There is a decrease in the percentage of workplace agreements, according to this document, that contain flexible starting and finishing times for ordinary hours of work. In fact, that number has gone from four per cent in 1998-99 down to three per cent in 2000-01. There has been a decrease in the percentage of agreements providing for family and carers leave from 28 per cent in 1998-99 down to 27 per cent. There has been a decrease in the percentage of agreements that provide paid maternity leave or primary carers leave from 10 per cent down to seven per cent. There has been no growth in the percentage of agreements containing flexible annual leave. That has remained static at six per cent. Paid family leave remains at three per cent. Regular part-time work has not increased or decreased; it remains at seven per cent. Provisions for family responsibilities remain at three per cent, and child-care provisions remain at one per cent.
What we see here is a federal government that, when the figures are presented in a report like this and are tabled in federal parliament, really does not have any family friendly policies—they are not being translated into reality for families in Australia and they certainly are not the reality for workers and employees. (Time expired) I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2002-09-26,"—I rise tonight to comment upon and commend the work of an important Australian non-government organisation, the Fred Hollows Foundation, as this month it celebrates its 10-year anniversary in operation. I am sure many senators know of the work of the foundation in assisting Indigenous communities in Australia and in its program of work around the world in restoring sight to the blind and the sight impaired.
This is an appropriate time to draw attention to the work of the foundation. This week we saw the tabling of the 11th annual statement on Australia's development cooperation program on Australian aid entitled Investing in growth, stability and prosperity. That document referred to tackling health problems, such as problems with sight, as one of five key areas. There has been a focus on good governance and environmental management, which I strongly support, but it is important that we also maintain a strong commitment to the basics, such as tackling substantial health problems. 
In terms of this week's statement, I cannot agree with some of Senator Nettle's comments against the increasing support being given to NGOs. I think many NGOs have proven to be highly successful in the work they do. Bodies such as the Fred Hollows Foundation and CARE Australia, for example, enhance the image of Australia throughout the world and justify their funding by meeting very high standards. They deliver very important services to highly marginalised communities.
As a fully accredited agency participating in the aid program, the Fred Hollows Foundation receives a three to one subsidy to the funds that it can raise from the community through the AusAID NGO Cooperation Program, known as the ANCP. In the 2001-02 financial year, the foundation received almost half a million dollars under the scheme, and in 2002-03 it will receive over half a million dollars. In addition, the foundation can bid for funding through bilateral programs, and in the last financial year it received in excess of $180,000 for a cataract blindness prevention program in Cambodia. These are vital services provided to communities where Australia's support can make a real difference, and I think it is very important for the Senate to bear that in mind. The foundation is an NGO that makes a very strong impact, and I endorse moves—to use Mr Downer's words—to strengthen relationships with the Australian NGO community and with individuals and firms that deliver aid so that our assistance yields better outcomes. The end goal of this, of course, is to allow recipient states to stand on their own two feet.
For over a decade the foundation have tackled avoidable blindness. They have helped to train and equip, to some degree, around 750 local surgeons in over 26 developing countries, who in turn have helped to restore sight to nearly one million people in Asia and Africa and treated many disadvantaged people for potentially blinding conditions. Locally run intraocular laboratories were established in Eritrea and Nepal to produce high-quality, low-cost perspex intraocular lenses to replace the cloudy, natural lenses of individuals. They have special equipment, such as portable microscopes, which they have developed to allow treatment to be conducted in the most extraordinary remote areas where eye care services are otherwise absolutely nonexistent.
Before his death, I saw operations being conducted in Vietnam by Fred Hollows himself as part of the foundation's work. I had the privilege to see at first-hand the work that the foundation does in Nepal when I was there on a study visit last year. I observed Dr Ruit, who was trained by Professor Hollows, treating patients and undertaking work at the Tilganga eye hospital and lens production facility. I saw the technology; I met the staff and the teams but, more importantly, I met the individual Nepalese who were benefiting from this foundation's work. It is hard to describe how moving an experience like this can be. It is hard to describe the sophistication of the technology that I saw in Kathmandu last year, which is helping so many people suffering such great disadvantage regain their sight.
The Hollows legacy is working its magic not only in Kathmandu but also in more remote parts of Nepal. Dr Ruit and Australia's current Ambassador to Nepal, His Excellency Crispin Conroy, have spent some time trying to visit some of the more remote areas with these services to ensure that they are delivering the most important magic of all— the return of vision to so many of these people. I am very grateful to the Tilganga Eye Centre for the opportunity to see those operations. The foundation owes much of its success, of course, to Dr Hollows himself. But on this 10-year anniversary I think it is important to acknowledge the work of people internationally in places such as Nepal, where people like Dr Ruit and Rabindra Shrestha maintain their very efficient and effective operations. They deserve enormous credit for the strength of the organisation. 
The foundation has had the same CEO for nine years—Mike Lynskey. He has rightly identified the need for the foundation not to become too reliant on government funding to operate. Under his leadership, the foundation has forged a good working relationship with the federal government and has contributed to policy, most notably in terms of Indigenous eye care in Australia. The new chairman, Nigel Milan, will, I am sure, work with the CEO and the other important players in the foundation to ensure that those relationships continue.
The work in the area of Indigenous eye care is strongly supported by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, through the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Eye Health Program, which began in 1998. That is underpinned by the 1997 review Eye health in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities by Professor Hugh Taylor, which was commissioned by the former Minister for Health and Aged Care, Michael Wooldridge, in 1996. It is a program which seeks to address the main eye care priorities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in a holistic way. Its major components focus on improving access to eye health in the primary health eye care context. Its emphasis is on a regional approach to eye health, and it is embedded in a philosophy of community control. Its major component includes the establishment of 29 eye health coordinator positions nationally, within Aboriginal primary health care settings. The Department of Health and Ageing has also ensured that the ATSI eye health program has been implemented through effective partnerships with stakeholders at regional, state and national levels.
I also want to talk briefly about Vision 2020—another example of where the foundation and the federal government engagement pays dividends domestically. It is a very important partnership. Vision 2020: The Right to Sight—Australia was established in 2000 as the Australian arm of Vision 2020. I recall launching that in Sydney on behalf of the health minister at the time. Its partnership comprises the majority of Australian organisations involved in eye care service delivery, eye research, education and development. The foundation is a principal partner in Vision 2020 Australia. It is a global initiative from the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, which runs in conjunction with the World Health Organisation to eliminate avoidable blindness by the year 2020. The program is designed to enable all parties and individuals involved to work in a much more focused and coordinated way to achieve a common goal—for example, to increase awareness of blindness as a major public health issue, to control the major causes of blindness, to train ophthalmologists and other personnel to provide eye care, to create an infrastructure to manage the problem, and to develop appropriate technology.
In our region, in Africa and more broadly internationally, the awareness of preventable blindness as a key health issue sometimes slides off the radar. It is not always something to which we pay attention at the same time as we talk about, for example, in our region the HIV-AIDS pandemic. There are other important health issues in which our aid contribution makes an important advance, and the prevention of blindness and sight impairment is one of those. It does not happen without the involvement of individuals. It does not happen without the involvement of people like Mike Lynskey, the ongoing work of Gabbi Hollows in the Fred Hollows Foundation and the hundreds of administrators and medical professionals who make such a difference in the lives of so many people. Blindness and vision impairment are a huge global problem. In developing countries world wide there are 45 million people affected by blindness and 135 million more people with low vision. As we think about the fact that about seven million people go blind every year—one every five seconds and a child every minute—the work and the policy input of the foundation will be indispensable in decades to come.
I well remember one year ago this month standing in the rain outside the Tilganga Eye Centre in Kathmandu, watching the queue of Nepalese people waiting to take advantage of the very simple but very important technology that the work of the Fred Hollows Foundation was taking to their community. To meet with individuals who have received the intraocular lens and to see the extraordinary change that it has brought to their lives and to their wellbeing is the best testament that you could possibly have to the effective work of the foundation.
