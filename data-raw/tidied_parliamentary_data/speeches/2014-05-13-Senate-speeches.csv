Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (12:32):  I rise with pleasure to support the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013. This bill honours a commitment which the coalition took to the September 2013 election—and I quote from the coalition's policy document—for 'better transparency and accountability of registered organisations'. The Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, said at the time of the election: 'The coalition will take strong action to ensure registered organisations are more transparent and accountable. We will act on this in the first week of the new parliament'—and indeed he did. He went on to say that Australians who join trade unions or employer associations deserve to have confidence in the conduct and administration of these organisations, that registered organisations are a central part of the fair work regime and they must operate to the high standards. In government we have honoured that commitment, and we stand here today in support of the bill.


I will go to the four premises of the bill—and they were spelt out in the Senate Education and Employment References Committee report to this place in 2014. The bill proposes to: firstly, establish an independent registered organisations commission to monitor and regulate registered organisations, with enhanced investigation and information gathering powers; secondly, amend the requirements on officers' disclosure of material personal interests and change grounds for disqualification and ineligibility for office; thirdly, strengthen existing financial accounting disclosure and transparency obligations under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, making them enforceable as civil remedy provisions; and, fourthly, increase civil penalties and introduce criminal offences for serious breaches of officers' duties as well as new offences in relation to the conduct of investigations under the Fair Work Registered Organisations Act 2009.


It is interesting to reflect on the background and the reasons for the need for these amendments to come into place—and I intend to speak to them in some detail—but it is equally interesting that in December 2013 the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee reported to the Senate on the outcome of that legislation committee report. Immediately the legislation committee report was in, we then had the opposition—the Labor and the Greens—joining forces to call for an Education and Employment References Committee inquiry into exactly the same issue. It is disappointing that, with all of the hard work that befalls us in the Senate, we had to have the chiefly political exercise of effectively going through exactly the same matters again. At that time, the coalition senators noted that the Senate committee was charged with looking at Labor's amendments to the registered organisations regime in 2012. And at that time—and I think this is very important from the viewpoint of accountability—as a result of a direction by the then Minister Bill Shorten, the committee had only five days in which to examine what was then the 'Shorten bill'. I contrast that with the four weeks this committee was given by our coalition government.


So all of this goes back to the laziness and incompetence of the then Minister Shorten. He saw what the coalition was bringing as a policy to the 2013 election, he panicked and he directed his department to try and short-circuit the whole process. As would be expected from a person of this limited capacity, he obviously got it wrong. To make sure that it was not given adequate opportunity for scrutiny, this place had only five days to examine the bill. It is interesting that the now opposition, then in government, failed to consult, failed their opportunity to speak to their own constituency and actually get that legislation right in the first place.


For example, in support of what I am saying, the coalition senators firmly agreed with the then Australian Workers Union National Secretary Mr Paul Howes who said at the time in relation to union corruption, 'If we ignore any pocket of dishonesty—it will grow like a cancer.' He spoke further about the need for developing corruption resistance at every level. So in fact this legislation and these amendments from the government have the strong support of those members of the union movement who share the same discouragement, the same disappointment. Indeed, in some instances, the same shame was actually visited upon the Australian community, particularly upon well-meaning and honourable members of the union movement. What we require in this legislation and these amendments is a circumstance in which those responsible for moneys of members' registered organisations, be they employer, trade union or whatever form, should be the subject of the same rigors and the same civil or criminal penalties for very serious offences. It would bring it into line and in the minds of the Australian community it would create a sense of fairness, a sense of transparency and a return to a sense of honour. Surely, that is a matter which is of tremendous interest and concern to the Australian people.


There were five recommendations that came forward from the legislation committee to the Senate. I am very pleased to be able to record the recommendations and those that are now found in these amendments which we are debating today. One would only hope that the Labor Party and the Greens senators will see the sense of them. One hopes that they will see that the ill-considered and improperly constructed legislation then presented by Mr Shorten will be redressed and will return to a level of comparability between the registered organisations representing employer groups as well as trade unions. For example, the first recommendation was: 


The Committee recommends that, consistent with the Corporations Act 2001, material personal interest disclosures should only be required to be made to those officers whose duties relate to the financial management of the organisation. 


As it is now, this is potentially required by everybody. Only those with responsibility for the purse strings, those with some level of financial accountability, should be the people who have who are called to account under the new legislation. The first amendment, then, reads:


Limit the obligation to disclose material personal interests to officers whose duties include duties that relate to financial management of the organisation or branch.


So in your capacity as the acting chair of the committee, Senator McKenzie, isn't it tremendous to see that these recommendations, as moved and as presented to this place, have indeed found their way into the actual amendments that are before us today?



Senator McKenzie interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  The second recommendation was that a list of exclusions from the obligations to disclose material personal interests based on section 191(2) of the Corporations Act be inserted into the bill, thus narrowing the obligation to disclose material personal interest of officers' relatives. The legislation at the moment encompasses the possibility of somebody's spouse, children or whoever. Indeed, we see the amendments coming through before us today removing the express obligation on officers and organisations to disclose details of any material personal interest an officers' relatives has or acquires in a matter that relates to the affairs of an organisation. So once again, we see common sense prevailing from this side. We see a recommendation that has come before this chamber finding its way into the amendments, which are the subject of our debate.


The third recommendation was that, with certain exclusions, the obligation placed on officers to disclose every payment should be reduced, including limiting disclosures to payments made above a certain threshold. Following that recommendation we see the provision of a civil penalty for an organisation's or branch's failure to provide minutes of meetings of the committee of management to members. Any member of a registered organisation should have the right to examine the minutes of meetings of the committee of management. This is a circumstance that should have been dealt with in the original legislation, if it had not been pushed through in such a panicked fashion by the then minister, now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten. 


Another of those amendments that we will consider in this place is aligning the obligation on officers to disclose material personal interests with section 191(2). This will be done by inserting into the bill similar exclusions to the obligations to disclose material as is applicable to directors of companies. In the evidence that came before us in the Senate inquiry process, these points were raised by witnesses—by employer representatives and by union representatives. It is interesting to see that they have been picked up, that the coalition in government has listened to both sides and has acted. 


We are also considering the expansion of exclusions that apply to the disclosure of payments made by an organisation or branch to related parties, including the exclusion of payments that are less than a prescribed amount. Once again the commissioner will have the authority to be able to set a figure below which these sorts of disclosures are not necessary to be made. To bring all this together, the amendments before us enable the Registered Organisations Commissioner to grant exemptions from the training requirements if an organisation can demonstrate that an officer has a proper understanding of their financial duties within the organisation or the branch. This naturally again goes to a level of common sense. It goes to submissions that were placed before the committee. It goes to representations by witnesses. There are training requirements and skills required of people involved in financial management of registered organisations. If, indeed, there are people who already have those financial skills and can demonstrate to the commissioner that they have them, then what is the purpose or the reason for the cost associated with having to go through and undertake those activities once again?


In the time that is left available to me it gives me no pleasure to reflect on the background and some of the reasons that we find ourselves in these circumstances. Naturally enough, although not exclusive to the amendments, we had the circumstances associated with Mr Craig Thomson—once a member of parliament in this place—and the former ALP national president, Mr Michael Williamson, both acting in their capacities as officers of the Health Services Union. We spent far too much time in this parliament over the last three to four years distracted by the actions and activities of both those men, both of whom have now been dealt with by the courts and, of course, found guilty of the activities with which they were associated. In the case of Mr Thomson they were activities which he emphatically denied even on the floor of the other house in this place. These are people who were found guilty of misusing Health Services Union members' funds—in the case of Mr Williamson, almost $1 million. At the time all of this was taking place my mother was a high-care patient in a nursing home in Perth, and I remember reflecting on the excellence of the care that was given to her and to the other elderly patients, including those with Alzheimer's and other conditions. The people who were providing that care had paid their union fees for many years only to see those funds going to the purposes for which it has now been established both Mr Thomson and Mr Williamson have either admitted or been found guilty. I recall an interview with an elderly Eastern European lady who had worked her entire life. Somebody had done the figures and had said to her, 'With those funds you could have had a trip back to Europe to visit your family.' She said, 'No, I would have used those funds towards the education of my grandchildren.' How those people can reflect on their behaviour, one can only imagine.


The important thing is that if we had had this legislation and amendments in place prior to the time those people carried on with those behaviours, one would hope that we would not have seen that abhorrent behaviour which was the subject of so much scrutiny, discord and disappointment to the Australian community. Yet we see it playing out again with respect to the ex-secretary of that same union, Ms Kathy Jackson, who was very much involved in the processes associated with those other gentlemen. In the last couple of days we have seen in the Federal Court an allegation that Ms Jackson siphoned off almost $250,000 of members' funds into a bank account of which she was the beneficiary. That is the allegation that was presented by lawyers for the Health Services Union in only the last two or three days, so no doubt we are going to see that play out as well. Surely members of unions, particularly those who do not have the opportunity to be represented at meetings, have the right to see the minutes of meetings and to understand the activities of their unions. One can only speculate on what they must think when they hear about behaviour like that and when they see where their funds have gone. I urge strong support from the other side in this place to ensure that these amendments go through in the way in which they are intended. 


In different circumstances, but relating particularly to my own home state of Western Australia, we see being played out in the royal commission the activities of the Australian Workers Union and their former leadership, Mr Wilson and Mr Blewitt assisted by their former lawyer, Ms Gillard. When I was in Kalgoorlie late last year discussing this question with some members of the AWU, one of them told me in a very distressed fashion of an incident which occurred—



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  I know Senator Cameron will be interested in this story, which was told by this gentleman who was an official of the union. He said that they had a million dollars on account in the goldfields. It was a big sum of money at the time, in the 1990s. There was huge pressure on them to release those funds and make them available to the management of the organisation in the city, and they opposed it vehemently. But a very smart young female lawyer turned up from Melbourne and they reluctantly made the decision and the million dollars disappeared. The gentleman said, 'I'll always remember the next day when a fellow that I never knew, but I knew of, came to the Kalgoorlie office, grabbed all the files pertaining to that matter, took them out to the Kalgoorlie tip and burnt them.' I think that is what stuck in their craw more than anything else. It was not the fact that the funds all disappeared—although that really worried them. It was not so much the fact that $1 million, which they no doubt had imminent use for given the nature of the industry that we see in the goldfields of WA, but it was the fact that any possible trail of accountability or audit literally went up in smoke. I have no doubt that we are going to see that game played out even more.


The last matter which I will draw senators' attention to is very current in Western Australia, and it is associated with the MUA. I have in front of me the declaration of results from the Australian Electoral Commission, and 41 members of the union have voted to put themselves in a circumstance where they can strike under a protected action ballot for 24 hours. That was question 1 that was asked of those who were eligible. All 45 out of 45 voted for a 24-hour strike to be undertaken. The next question related to whether there could be an unlimited number of stoppages for a period of 48 hours. We are talking about $100 million a day. Out of 45 members, 44 supported that one; one did not. The third question was whether or not they would have unlimited stoppages for seven days. That is $700 million to $1 billion of direct costs in that period of time without considering the workers at the mines, on the trains, in the trucks and, of course, the rest of the industry which is so vital to this country. That is where we are being held, and I come back to the point which is simply this. There should be unanimous support right around this chamber for the amendments contained in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-05-13,"




Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:52):  It is always good to follow Senator Back. He is always interesting, if nothing else, and I do not think there was much else in that speech this afternoon. I rise on behalf of the Labor Party to oppose the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013. This bill is unnecessary. It imposes massive regulatory burdens on voluntary organisations based on the coalition's ideological opposition to collective organisations acting in the interests of their members. That is fundamentally what this is about. The bill is not about accountability; it is about the coalition's obsession with destroying collective bargaining in this country. The bill is about the government introducing over-the-top regulation and red tape on the trade union movement while at the same time railing against regulation and red tape in every other area of the economy. This is hypocrisy on a grand scale, but it is something we have to get used to with the Abbott government.


After failing to reduce workers' rights with Work Choices, the coalition have now embarked on an attack on the organisations that support employers and workers. The ideology and strategy is clear: destroy effective unions and you destroy workers' capacity to protect their wages and conditions. The bill is designed to make it extremely difficult for unions and employer organisations to operate as they have over the last 150 years—that is, with volunteer rank and file membership on their governing bodies. Rank and file members would be faced with huge obligations and penalties far outweighing and inconsistent with the role they play on their unions' governing bodies.


The bill is an attempt to treat all employer organisations and unions as if the default driver is criminality and personal greed. When criminality and greed is exposed in the business sector, the usual argument from business and the coalition is that laws should not be enacted based on the behaviour of individuals which is inconsistent with the general behaviour in business and industry. I have heard this argument several times from the opposite side. For ideological reasons, this approach is not applicable when it comes to the trade union movement. Labor is appalled by the behaviour of a small number of individuals who deceitfully and criminally stole the funds of the union and its members for their own personal gain. Those individuals have faced proper processes, and one is in jail and another one looks like going to jail. 


Labor moved decisively with this issue and, after consultation with employer organisations and unions, we effected the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Act 2012 and the Fair Work Amendment Act 2013. These laws are rigorous, balanced and appropriate. Labor's laws strengthened the legislative provisions concerning disclosure and transparency of decision making. This was done while understanding and recognising the difference between voluntary organisations and for-profit businesses.


The government claims that this bill will place the regulation of registered organisations on the same footing as the regulation of corporations under the Corporations Act. There is absolutely no logic to this approach. Voluntary organisations are significantly different from corporations, are subject to significant regulatory overview and have regulatory requirements that ensure compliance with appropriate standards for voluntary organisations. The coalition bill, by design, will establish a more onerous regulatory regime on volunteers who make up the committees of management of registered organisations than that which applies to highly paid executives on company boards. So you have an ordinary worker who says: 'I will help with my union. I want to engage with my union.' They go on the board and they are subject to more scrutiny and harder laws than those affecting other business people earning $150,000 a year to sit on a board. And these workers get not a cent. These volunteers get not a cent to do the work that they do.


The legislation has more to do with an ideological attack on the trade union movement than it has with any genuine desire to ensure standards for voluntary organisations. A range of submissions was provided to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee during its inquiry into the bill. It is clear that the coalition have managed to do one thing. They have managed to do something that is unheard of in the industrial history of Australia. They have united employer organisations and the trade union movement against this overt attack on collective organisation in this country. I would have thought, given the explosive revelations in New South Wales in ICAC, that the coalition would be more concerned about cleaning up their own act than attacking, for purely ideological reasons, unions of employers and employees. 


Senator Back used some highly provocative language in his submission, something that is the stock and trade of the coalition in this country. He spoke about shame. He spoke about honour. He spoke about transparency. And he spoke about the need for rigorous penalties. Let me tell you, I agree that those principles should apply to the New South Wales Liberal Party and the federal Liberal Party in their operations, with all their slush funds and all their trusts that are hiding money from the proper organisations in this country—and I will come to that in some detail.


I would have thought that the coalition would have been keen to do some internal analysis of the promises that they made to the Australian public prior to the election, prior to the reality that the public will have to face tonight with an austerity budget that will hand money back to big business—hundreds of millions of dollars will go back to Twiggy Forrest, Gina Rinehart, BHP and Rio Tinto—while people will have to wait longer to get a pension, while the value of the pension will decline, while people will have to pay more for petrol every time they get in a car and while people will have to hand over more money every time they go to the doctor. I would have thought that these would be the issues that the Liberal Party would be discussing. I know that some like Senator Macdonald are discussing these not only within the party but in the public arena. So the hypocrisy of the coalition knows no bounds—taking money out of the pockets of ordinary Australians and putting money back into the pockets of the billionaire mining companies and billionaire miners.


No amount of dissembling as to what is a tax and what is not a tax and no amount of rhetorical ballet dancing in relation to lowering the overall tax burden will hide the reality of the broken promises of the coalition. Remember your leader Tony Abbott's statement: 'No new taxes, no surprises, no broken promises, no cuts to health and no cuts to education.' Remember those words tonight when he puts his hand in the pocket of every ordinary Australian on the basis of some unreal fiscal crisis, some unreal budgetary crisis, some unreal budgetary emergency. It is all a nonsense. 


The issues of lies, deceit and broken promises should be addressed internally in the coalition. Workers and employer organisations should be allowed to operate under the various international conventions that we are legally obliged to uphold. Attacking the trade union movement and working people in this country with penal provisions and trumped-up royal commissions should stop, and the coalition should set about cleaning up their own act by announcing a royal commission into Liberal and National party slush funds. That is what they should be doing. The public in New South Wales and across Australia have been watching in horror as the rogues' gallery of Liberal Party members and politicians parade at ICAC, exposing the unfair and illegal approach that is taken by the Liberal Party to undermine democracy in this country. That is something that I think they should be looking at, instead of attacking employer organisations and the trade union movement in this country. 


The public are watching in fascination as Liberal politician after Liberal politician is exposed for corrupt and illegal practices—practices designed to corrupt democracy and corrupt the democratic processes in New South Wales, practices designed to illegally avoid the exposure of cash for influence in the coalition. That should be the focus of a royal commission, not the trumped-up, biased royal commission into the trade union movement. 


Ray Carter, an adviser to Chris Hartcher, one of the leading Liberals in New South Wales, said that they all knowingly and deliberately were running donations from prohibited donors and they were running those donations through the Free Enterprise Foundation, which is a foundation associated with the federal Liberal Party. So we have Senator Back coming in here trying to smear the whole trade union movement because of the illegal activities of a few people, activities that are reprehensible, and force legislation on the whole trade union movement because of the illegal activities of a few people but not being prepared to do anything about the illegal activities of the Liberal Party. Trying to undermine democracy in Australia, in my view, is one of the most reprehensible things you can do. 


The Liberal Party in New South Wales, and it looks like they have been aided and abetted by the Liberal Party in Canberra, have been laundering slush funds from illegal donors in New South Wales into Canberra and back into New South Wales. That is being exposed day in and day out. Yet what is the priority for the Liberal Party? It is to attack the trade union movement and turn a blind eye to the corruption and illegality in the Liberal Party. They attack the trade union movement because they do not want workers to collectively bargain. I just think it is outrageous. For Senator Back, and for any of the Liberals, to come in here and fail to mention this issue is pure hypocrisy. Senator Back comes in here and tells these stories about being out in the bush talking to a union member and the union member says this and the union member says that. If Senator Back has got any evidence of corruption or illegal activity, he should take that to the police. He should take that to the authorities. I challenge Senator Back to come back in here and explain to the parliament what he did with that allegation, whether he advised the appropriate authorities that, as a senator, he has been advised of illegal activity in Western Australia. What did he do about it? My bet is he did nothing. My bet is that it is probably a made-up story anyway to embellish his pretty boring speech in here on this issue. I challenge Senator Back: 'Come back in here, tell us when you went to the police, tell us what you have told the police and let's get the thing dealt with by the authorities. Don't come in here trying to smear the trade union movement with unsubstantiated allegations.' That is stock-in-trade for the coalition in this country.


The issues relating to compliance under the Workplace Relations Act are confined to isolated criminality by a small number of corrupt individuals. The issues of coalition corruption, influenced heavily by greed and stupidity, are now the hallmark of this coalition and seem to be a systemic part of the culture of the Liberal Party. The isolated problems of the trade union movement have been addressed by the Labor Party, the ACTU and the police. No attempt has been made by the coalition, and especially the Liberal Party, to deal with corruption of the democratic processes in New South Wales.


We now see these links back to Canberra, with the corrupt money flow from New South Wales laundered in Canberra and used by Liberal Party politicians in New South Wales. Never in the history of Australian politics have we seen the systemic undermining of the democratic processes and the laws of the land as we are watching in New South Wales. Never in the history of Australian politics have we seen a Liberal premier having to stand down because he misled the corruption watchdog. Never in the history of Australian politics have we witnessed a senator—Senator Sinodinos—a frontbencher, recently sitting across this chamber, attempting to justify a payment of $200,000 for 40 hours work and to justify a $4,000-an-hour payment to drive from the CBD of Sydney to Castle Hill. $4,000 an hour! Never in the history of Australian politics have we seen Liberal politician after Liberal politician appear before a corruption inquiry and, one after the other, fall on their swords. Never in the history of Australian politics has the web of influence peddling for cash been exposed as it has with the Liberal Party.


And never in the history of politics has a political party with so many internal corrupt activities tried to divert attention from their own illegal activities by attacking the trade union movement in such a systematic way. Why is the coalition attacking the trade union movement when the real issue for democracy in this country is the operation of Liberal Party slush funds? Let us have a royal commission into Eightbyfive, the Millennium Forum, the Forward Brisbane Leadership Fund, the Cormack Foundation, the Free Enterprise Foundation, the Greenfields Foundation, Bunori Pty Ltd—an organisation that Senator Sinodinos failed to disclose that he had an interest in when he became a senator—Vapold Pty Ltd, the North Sydney Forum and Vaughan Constructions—a company that went bust, but which weeks before it went bust, leaving workers with no pay and subcontractors with no payments, gave $400,000 to the Liberal Party.


Those of the type of people we have sitting over there; trying to lecture Labor and the trade union movement about honesty, about shame and about honour. I welcome these debates in this place, and I call on the Liberal Party to actually form a royal commission into the dishonest operation of the Liberal Party both at the federal level and in New South Wales. And while we are at it, let's spread it up to Brisbane and let's get it over in Perth because I am sure the same peddling of influence for money is underway in the Liberal Party right around this country. There will be Nick Di Girolamo's equivalents everywhere in the Liberal Party.


So instead of attacking the trade union movement, which is out there battling to get workers a fair go, they should be investigating their own internals. They should be setting up a royal commission to look at the corruption and the deceit and the dishonesty in the Liberal Party. Leave the trade union movement alone, leave the employer organisations alone; start looking at your own backyard, that is where the corruption is. (Time expired)

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-05-13,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (13:12):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013, and I say, on behalf of the Australian Greens, that the Senate should reject this bill.


The Abbott government's hypocrisy is evident in this bill: on one hand pledging to remove red tape while on the other doubling the layer of regulation on employer associations and unions is utterly shameless. If we needed any further evidence of hypocrisy it is here in this bill as well in that the government states that it is committed to protecting so-called 'traditional' rights, yet this bill would see overreaching intrusions into the lives of those people who are involved with unions and other registered organisations. These are rights which I think anyone would agree are traditional rights, like freedom of association, the presumption of innocence and the right to privacy and reputation. It is hard to think about how much more traditional you could get than those rights.


The bill's compliance burden alone is enough to make this bill unworthy. It will inflate organisations' training costs and it will submit them to a regulatory burden which is so unrealistic that it just makes no sense. This is what the Senate Education and Employment References Committee found in recommending that the bill be rejected, and I call on the Senate today to heed those recommendations.


Just so we can be very clear about what the government is proposing to do here, let us look at what the bill does. Registered organisations are unions and employer associations that are registered under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. That act was already amended in 2012 to enhance registered organisations' financial accountability as well as that of their office holders. Those amendments included rules for disclosure of remuneration and pecuniary and financial interests, increased civil penalties, strengthened investigative powers for Fair Work Australia and requirements for education and training to be provided to the officials of registered organisations about their governance and accounting obligations. Many of those amendments only took effect from 1 January this year—less than six months ago and after this current bill was introduced. So the government did not even wait to see the efficacy of those previous amendments. 


This bill proposes to go even further. It will establish a new stand-alone agency called the Registered Organisations Commission, which will have powers to monitor and regulate registered organisations, enforced by extensive investigative and information-gathering powers. So here we are today, standing on the brink of a budget which, all the indications suggest, will see the abolition of many long-standing and respected cultural and environmental agencies—just to mention one sector—in the name of so-called efficiency, deregulation and removal of red tape, yet if this bill is to be passed we will see the creation of a new government agency to oversee, essentially, unions. That shows the real ideological agenda that is at play here.


What will this commission—and this bill—do? It will increase reporting obligations, including by amending requirements about material personal interests. I will come back to that. As well, the bill proposes to increase civil penalties, create offences relating to investigations, and introduce criminal offences for breaches of officers' duties. 


The Australian Greens say that this bill should be rejected. It has significant unintended consequences, which were revealed in the course of the Senate Education and Employment References Committee inquiry, and it imposes major training and financial burdens on organisations. In this, it contrasts with the government's posturing about reducing red tape and protecting traditional rights. It will establish an onerous regulatory regime, on top of regulation already present under the Corporations Act.


A good case study can be taken from the submission and the evidence that came before the Senate Education and Employment References Commission from an organisation in my own home state of South Australia—the South Australian Wine Industry Association. In their submission that association said that this bill will impose 'excessive compliance and disproportionate monetary penalties on all registered organisations'. They make the point that they are a not-for-profit incorporated association. They have board members who provide a great deal of unpaid time each year, which is a fundamental aspect of the effective work of that association. They attend meetings across regional South Australia, which involves not only the meeting time but the travelling time. They read board papers, meet with the government and consult with their members. All this is fundamental to conducting the meaningful activities of SAWIA, the South Australian Wine Industry Association. The association points out that the role of these board members cannot be directly compared to listed public companies, which are commercial operations with well remunerated directors. Yet, in many cases, the proposed amendments under this bill will result in far greater penalties and requirements being imposed. It makes no sense. 


The hypocrisy of this government in pledging to remove red tape, while doubling the layer of regulation on registered organisations, is not lost on the Australian Greens, and it was not lost on the stakeholders who made submissions against it in the two Senate inquiries since its introduction. Stakeholders who made submissions to the Senate committee inquiry supported the need for good governance, but not in the form proposed by this bill. The Australian Council of Trade Unions noted it supported the passage of the 2012 legislation because it supports a legislative regime promoting the operation of accountable, democratic and effective trade unions which are member governed. However, it described the provisions of this bill as 'poorly conceived, badly motivated, and entirely unnecessary'. That was the tenor of most of the submissions before the inquiry.


Other submitters said that this bill would interfere with and impede registered organisations' abilities to carry out duties on behalf of their members. Maybe that is where we get to the essence of this legislation. Maybe that is the government's intended purpose—to make it more difficult for trade unions to service the needs of their members in a pluralist society. 


The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation said the bill was 'unnecessary, poorly structured and excessive'. The Australian Air Traffic Control Association suggested that the establishment of a commission effectively disregards all of the processes that organisations had implemented to comply with legislation changes in 2012. This goes to the heart of this legislation: it is not based on necessity; it is based on ideology. The Senate Education and Employment References Committee concluded that these 2012 legislative changes need to be implemented fully, before further interference with registered organisations' governance is considered.


Fair Work Australia gave evidence that its updated approach to regulation since 2012 has delivered a marked increase in registered organisations' compliance levels. And that is what we are looking for here. For example, it stated that there was a lodgement rate for annual returns of 96.2 per cent in the 2012-13 financial year, which by May of 2013 had increased to 99.5 per cent. Fair Work Australia also stated that a proactive election audit that it conducted with respect to all registered organisations required to lodge election information with the Fair Work Commission has, for the first time, shown a comprehensive compliance picture across 503 election entities. All this has occurred before the legislation has been enacted. 


The Australian Privacy Foundation criticised the proposed disclosure regime in this bill, saying that it is unnecessary, it erodes privacy protection and it is out of step with the government's stated commitment to traditional freedoms. So they were calling the government on their hypocrisy. 


Submitters also said that the compliance burden proposed by the bill would impose significant training costs. The committee agreed that the regulatory burden proposed by the bill is excessive and inappropriate. It also agreed that the proposed disclosure regime for material personal interests is not only inappropriate; it is wholly unworkable. It is impractical. The committee concluded that the bill poses a great threat to the ability of registered organisations to provide services for the advancement of their membership if it means they will be occupied with the degree of extra regulation and red tape it proposes. It does lead one to wonder if this is the government's intention when it comes to the important work of unions in defending and promoting the rights of their members.


There is a broader picture here, though. The Australian Greens are not only concerned about the impractical compliance burden associated with this bill, in contradiction to the purported intention of this government. We are also seriously concerned about its encroachment on traditional rights and liberties and the fact that it is totally inconsistent with the government's purported commitment to these. Do not judge a government by what it says; judge it by what it does.


In relation to the new criminal offences that this bill would establish, the committee concluded that these duplicate existing crime legislation. The committee also shared the concerns of submitters regarding the fact that the proposed structure and powers of the commissioner are inappropriate. The commission's proposed investigative powers are too extreme and go far beyond what is appropriate to ensure adequate regulation of registered organisations. It is clear that the regulatory framework which was enacted by the 2012 legislative changes is sufficient to empower the current regulator to do its duties.


The Australian Greens are very clear that the proposed powers of the Registered Organisations Commission are excessive, draconian and completely unnecessary. The Australian Greens condemn the government for introducing this legislation before the amendments under the 2012 act have had a chance to operate effectively. It discloses an ideological agenda operating here. This is bad legislation because it increases registered organisations' compliance burden far out of proportion to any necessity and it undermines the very traditional rights and freedoms which the government claims to be committed to.


This legislation was not introduced in good faith but rather to undermine unions, their members and their ability to achieve outcomes. Let's be clear about that. The Australian Greens are committed to free, independent and democratic unions as an essential pillar of civil society. We believe that the present legislation for registered organisations is appropriately rigorous, without denying unions the ability to achieve important outcomes for their members.


This would be the creation of a new commission when we are standing on the brink of the government abolishing many other longstanding and respected organisations, commissions and agencies, such as the National Library, the National Gallery and the National Museum. They are all in the crosshairs of the budget. We will wait to see whether that occurs, but there will certainly be some that will be dismantled or merged on the basis of efficiency and reducing red tape, regulation and duplication. Despite that, we have this bill proposing to create a brand new commission to make sure that the government can sufficiently intrude into the unions and the way they operate on behalf of their members to reduce their effectiveness. That is what will happen if the government has its way. So I call on the Senate to reject this bill and affirm the rights of registered organisations to get on with the job.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2014-05-13,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (13:26):  I would like to begin today by actually agreeing with Senator Doug Cameron on one point. He said that trying to undermine democracy is one of the most reprehensible things you can do. I absolutely agree with him on that point. Our point with this legislation is to improve and enhance democracy by improving transparency and accountability. There was no argument about whether there needed to be reform in this area because, in fact, the initial bills to reform the area were put through by Mr Shorten when he was in government last year. The only problem, of course, was that they followed the usual pattern of Labor legislation, which is that the bills were ineptly drafted, hastily developed and, mostly, completely incompetently implemented. So most of the changes we are talking about this morning relate to trying to fix some of the problems that were so evident in the legislation that Mr Shorten put through.


It is probably worth just making a point about what we are looking at in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013 today. It limits the obligation of officers in registered organisations to disclose material personal interests when they do not relate in any way to their duties. It removes the express obligation on officers and organisations to disclose details of any material personal interests in a matter that relates to the affairs of an organisation that an officer's relative has or acquires. It requires officers to make disclosures of material personal interests to the committee of management and for such disclosures to be recorded in the minutes of the meeting and be available upon request to members. It provides for a civil penalty for organisations or branches that fail to provide minutes of the committee of management meetings to their members. It aligns the obligations on officers to disclose material personal interests with the Corporations Act by putting in exclusions about what obligations and material personal interests are applicable and which are not. It provides that an officer is not restricted from taking part in a decision where they have a material interest if that interest is not such that it needs to be disclosed. It expands the exclusions that apply to the disclosure of payments made where they are less than the prescribed amount or where member approval for that transaction is not necessary under the current Corporations Act.


It enables the Registered Organisations Commissioner to grant exemptions from training requirements if an organisation can demonstrate that an officer has a proper understanding of their financial duties within the organisation or branch. It is a bit bizarre when you consider that the legislation as the former Minister Shorten had it drafted, given the way it read, would have required qualified accountants to go and do a one-day financial training course so that they knew how to behave when they were on the board. These are common-sense amendments to give better transparency and better accountability for registered organisations.


Certainly the coalition welcomed in principle the fact that then Minister Shorten did recognise that there was something very, very wrong within the union movement when he put his initial legislation up, but of course we had the situation where a former union boss was relying on the goodwill of other unionists for that legislation to go through. I am somewhat bemused by some of the arguments around how poor little unions run by volunteers should have the same sorts of requirements put on them as you might put on a kindergarten committee or such and that they should not face the same requirements as a corporation. I am afraid that that is not a view that works on this side of the House, and it was not a view that worked with the Australian people. We made it very clear at the last election that it was our intention that people who ran unions should have the same qualifications and the same responsibilities as people who ran corporations because, after all, it is not their money that they are playing with. It is someone else's. It is their members' money. You only have to go back to the major problems that caused then Minister Shorten to put his flawed legislation through last year—that is, the Health Services Union's problems and the resulting court cases out of that—to see one aspect of the problems that need to be so significantly addressed in this area.


One of the key components of that legislation and what happened with the Health Services Union was the inordinate delay—in fact, it was later described as such by PricewaterhouseCoopers when they reviewed it—in the hearing of that case by Fair Work Australia. It is not impossible—and certainly many people have suggested it—that the fact that the government required the vote of the alleged 'Independent' Labor member, Mr Thomson, could explain part of the reason for why that delay happened, although many other apparently cogent reasons were put up by Fair Work Australia as to why it took them years and years to go through material, which of course has since led to both civil and criminal charges. If we were looking at the Health Services Union as a one-off issue, there would not be the same need for legislation as has been required. But it is clear that there has grown up in some elements of the union movement a systemic corruption, a systemic sense of being entitled to do what they damn well like with members' fees. Certainly in some areas there was a view that the political support of the then Labor government was so much more important than meeting the needs of members.


I would like to add there that the vast majority of executives of unions are people trying to do their best for their membership and working hard at that. But to suggest that they are poor little volunteers akin to someone on a kinder committee is nonsense; it has always been nonsense. As we will now discover, many of these union executives are paid the sorts of money that would, in other circumstances, lead Labor members to talk about 'rich fat cats'. They receive the sorts of payments that senior executives receive; they receive larger pay packets in fact than members of parliament receive.




Senator Bilyk:
  No! Do you know how much a union official earns? What are you talking about? You're atrocious!




Senator BOYCE:
  I think we will just continue on, Senator Bilyk. I do not—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Order! Senator Boyce, please direct your comments through the chair.




Senator BOYCE:
  I think we all know that there are extremely highly paid union officials around, and to try to suggest that somehow we would compare unions—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator Cameron:
  Not as well paid as Arthur Sinodinos!




Senator BOYCE:
  to kindergarten committees is a complete nonsense.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Boyce, please direct your address through the chair.




Senator BOYCE:
  I was addressing my remarks to the chair. I did not in any way refer to members opposite by their names or anything, Mr Acting Deputy President, so I would have thought it was perhaps more the interjectors who may have been causing the issues here, rather than my speech.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator BOYCE:
  I think Senator Cameron was listened to in silence more because people were bored by hearing the same message over and over.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Interjections are disorderly!




Senator BOYCE:
  The complete denial from the other side that corruption happens in any way within the union movement is just very sad. As I said earlier, I support Senator Cameron's view that democracy requires transparency, but it also requires accountability and members of many unions have not had that. We have had it in minute detail as to how that has not happened for the Health Services Union. And of course there are other unions involved, and I have just run through a small list that, coincidentally, was published in TheWest Australian today. We have the Ai Group urging the Heydon royal commission to investigate claims that unions are receiving generous and undisclosed kickbacks from income protection insurers to sign up members. We have the Master Builders wanting all payments made by employers for training by unions to be investigated. We have the fact that there are training groups set up by the CFMEU, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, and that they lent some money to a training organisation—in fact training has been a nice little earner for unions. That is fine if what is happening is genuine training for genuine reasons. But that is not what has been happening. It is being used as a way to milk employers yet again in an apparently honest way. But of course it is not honest; it is the usual overkill and attempts at bribery.


We go on to look at the AWU slush fund scandal, which is the whole reason that the royal commission was established. We even have reports of one union official saying that many of the members of the AWU had secret TAB accounts where they could hide $1,000 or so from the missus. Now of course they were not just hiding the money from the missus; they were hiding the money from their members, from the tax office, and from any efforts that could be made to try to bring criminal charges for fraud against them.


I have mentioned already, of course, Mr Thomson and the HSU. Even more serious, and certainly a matter of great concern in my home state of Queensland, have been the apparent links between the CFMEU and organised crime. On the east coast of Australia we have recorded conversations, bank records and police files that demonstrate that major crime, bikie gangs and the CFMEU have all been working together very nicely within the construction industry. I would hope that the members opposite would agree with me that these matters need to be exposed. They have no place in Australia and they have no place within a union movement that is trying very hard to—




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator is making allegations that have got no basis in fact. The Crime Commission appeared before the Senate inquiry. The Crime Commission, the Federal Police and the Victoria Police have indicated that there was no basis to allege this type of activity.




Senator Back:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: the senator is debating the issue. He has had his opportunity. He squandered it and now he has got to sit and listen.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. 




Senator BOYCE:
  It is somewhat sad that Senator Cameron, who I think is a great proponent of democracy in Australia and would be a proponent of democracy within the union movement, is making what appear to be excuses for behaviour that I would have thought he would condemn. I would have thought that he would be one of the people foremost in saying, 'I want an organisation that I can be proud of,' and I very much hope that that is where we will end up with some of the inquiries that go on. But I would contend that there has been in some unions and at some levels systemic corruption, a systemic lack of interest in the rights of members, systemic indifference to the needs of members and systemic featherbedding going on. Wherever that happens, this Senate has a duty to attempt its very best to ensure that it is exposed.


I would like to look at articles out of today's paper that demonstrate that in other areas there is action taken and there is the availability of criminal and civil penalties against those who behave wrongly. We have a headline about fears that a $7 million insider trading deal involving the ABS and others is in fact simply the tip of the iceberg. That is terrible. That should not happen. But ASIC and others have the responsibility under the legislation to ensure that it does not happen. Here we have a case where it has actually come out, where the alleged offenders will be taken through the courts and forced to come up with a solution. This involved the ABS and it was found out through the auditing that went on between the ABS and other areas. 


We have ASIC, the ANAO and numerous other bodies oversighting the way government departments and agencies and corporations function. But the minute you suggest that there be a similar body to oversight the way unions behave we have the most bizarre and ridiculous nonsense coming out of the opposition about the fact that these are tiny little groups involving volunteers with scarcely a cent to their name. It is just nonsense. The opposition know it is nonsense and they know that work has to be done to improve the transparency of unions.


If Fair Work Australia had demonstrated the ability to deal with these matters when they had the chance with Craig Thomson and the HSU, if we could have said, 'My goodness, that was shocking, but it is a one-off issue; it has got nothing to do with any other unions or the way any other unions function,' then that would be fine. We could say, 'Okay. Fair Work Australia should just get its act together and do better next time.' 


But that is not what happened and that is not where the problems lie. I would love to be able to stand here in a few years time and say we probably do not need a Registered Organisations Commissioner anymore; the job is done. But certainly the job has not even begun yet. I would hope that the majority of members of the Labor Party, the majority of union members and the majority of members of this place would want to see the union movement cleaned up. They would want to see the same amount of accountability and transparency in the way these organisations are run as you would expect to see in any other organisation of the size.




Senator Cameron:
  Like the Liberal Party and Arthur Sinodinos!




Senator BOYCE:
  I would suggest that we are not talking simply about whether anyone ever committed some sort of corrupt act; we are talking about the ability for the public to know and perceive that this has occurred. I think we have had some rather good examples from both sides of parliament in New South Wales of what happens when you get transparency. But I think we also need to take into account that the Independent Commission Against Corruption is not a court; it is simply an investigative body, and out of that investigation one imagines some charges may well be laid against numerous people. But simply appearing as a witness in a court, tribunal or commission is not a suggestion that one has committed a crime.




Senator Bilyk:
  Neither is belonging to a union.




Senator Cameron:
  It's a crime to take 40 grand an hour!




Senator BOYCE:
  I think that, when we look at some of the other matters that have gone on—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator BOYCE:
  Thank you. I recommend these amendments to the house. I am saddened by the fact that people who allegedly care about democracy on the other side of this chamber do not think that putting through the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013 will assist the people that I understood they are here to represent. I think they need to take some advice from the people at the bottom who put them here and who support their policies. They need to genuinely behave like representatives of workers. (Time expired)

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:47):  I rise to speak in the debate on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013. In March last year I spoke against the private senator's bill from Senator Abetz. It was almost a mirror proposal of the one before us today. In March last year I stressed that officers of registered organisations or anyone in a position of trust misusing the funds of members or acting inappropriately, taking benefits where they are not entitled, must never be condoned. In the HSU case that sparked this debate and reactionary bill, the Fair Work Commission collected evidence and the courts have made their verdict. These trials show that there is no need for this new commissioner, that the current system is working. This legislation will not stop people committing fraud, as Senator Back alleged earlier today. The current system has found these people guilty. This legislation is simply a witch hunt, simply another way to smear working people and their unions.


It is one thing for the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, as Senator Abetz was at the time, to propose a private senator's bill that no-one supports. He wanted to make a point. He wanted to propose an idea. But there is so little support for the idea and so little policy merit one has to wonder why it is being brought back here. On the whole, employer groups and trade unions do not support these reforms. It is an idealistic approach that actually defies their own deregulation ideals.


I am a former state secretary of a trade union: the Tasmanian branch of the AMWU. I am pleased to stand up here in this place and put on record my background as a union member, as an organiser and as secretary. I do so with a strong sense of purpose; I know where I came from and I know who I represented. I know the clear intent of this bill that we debate today is not to strengthen union governance. It is not to make unions more appealing to the community in an effective way to grow membership. No, the sole purpose of this bill is to strike at the heart of registered organisations and sever the ability of honest volunteers to play their part in the governance of their union or organisation. This bill wants to make volunteering on the decision-making body of a union or employer organisation so unappealing that no-one will do it. This bill wants to destroy one of the most basic principles of volunteer organisations. The bill wants to use the improper and fraudulent actions of a handful of officials to materially weaken trade unions into the future.


On this side we want to talk about fairness in employment and industrial relations. We want to spend time promoting positive reforms, not tarring over two million Australians and their families with a brush because they want to collectively organise and negotiate for decent conditions at work.


When I spoke on the bill last year I highlighted a story of the importance of a union and the importance of acceptance of unions for a group of female workers at a factory in George Town, Tasmania a number of years ago. It was such an important story that I felt I needed to share it again. It was a small fishery and processing facility. I as an organiser was approached by some of the staff to come along and speak to the whole team. When we in the old Food Preservers' Union approached the management to come along, they were very helpful. They invited us in, they got the workers together in the lunchroom and they made us feel welcome.


The workers at the processing facility were predominantly women, all of them employed on a casual basis. The few men around were all permanent. With permanency came security but also a sense of superiority. We spoke to the staff about joining the union, and people seemed positive. We left them some information and told them we would come back the next week to talk again to those who wanted to join.


We thought that we had had a good hearing and that we would be able to offer these people the support that they needed. Unfortunately, when we left, the boss got everyone in the lunchroom and said that, if they joined the union, they would lose their jobs. Plain and simple: they would lose their job. Two women who were silent members of the union called and told us what had happened. They were worried about their jobs. A week later we went back to the factory and talked to the people again. This time, publicly no-one was interested; however, the silent members called again and arranged for us to meet with a group of the workers, and we met with the women at one of their homes. They told us of the shenanigans that went on in their workplace—one-way shenanigans towards the female workers by the men and actions that many people might not think of as wrong but as larrikinism, but there were a lot of acts that any reasonable person would frame as assault and dangerous.


The workers would be hosing down at the end of the day. One day, one of the men was cleaning down in his underwear—I do not know why. He repeatedly turned the hose on the women, who were just going about their job, and sprayed them with a high-powered hose. It was harassment. It could be viewed as assault, but it was definitely dangerous. At the factory there were only shared toilets—that is, a number of cubicles in a room. On more than one occasion some of the men would force themselves into the bathroom cubicle while one of the women was in there. It was a sick and twisted game to intimidate the female workers.


One day, it got out of hand. One of the men forced his way into the cubicle, and the woman was able to fight him off but was injured with visible bruising on her arms. She told me that she spoke to her husband when she got home that night. His first reaction was: 'Who is this bloke? I'm going to go and rip his head off.' This was a desperate reaction from someone without the means to resolve disputes through negotiation. The second reaction was: 'But you have to go to work tomorrow because we need the money.' This woman, this family and all of their workers felt they had no choice but to put up with this behaviour. We asked them, 'Why didn't you raise these matters with the supervisor?' Their simple replies were, 'We couldn't; he was one of the men involved.'


They had no recourse on their own, but they wanted to join the union. They wanted to join the union so that together they could make a change at their workplace. So we set up a picket outside the factory. We went to the Industrial Relations Commission, where we were able to run an argument for these women and lay down the facts. The commissioner found that there was clear evidence that the workers wanted to join a union, that they had been discriminated against and that they should be protected. The commissioner enforced a code of conduct for the factory management and gave the female workers in particular comfort that there were avenues for recourse if they needed to go down that path in the future.


Clearly, power structures exist across a range of situations, across a range of worksites and across a range of organisations. It was untrue in this situation in George Town that there was a mentality or a value set whereby anyone could walk into their boss's office, raise issues of concern and be treated fairly. And it is untrue for many millions of Australians today.


Unions are the staff; they are the workers joining together to give themselves some bargaining power to give themselves some cover. If there had been a union at this factory providing a mechanism for the workers to raise issues and to be listened to fairly, some of the incidents might not have happened the second, third or 10th time. In fact, they might not have happened at all.


So what will this bill do for these people? It will do nothing. It is not designed to help them. It is designed to demonise working Australians. It is designed to put doubt into the minds of non-union workers about joining a union. It is designed to continue the campaign of fear and misinformation. When workers like these women need a union and are faced with a power imbalance at work they should feel comfortable in approaching their respective union for assistance.


As coalition senators speak in favour of this bill they ignore these stories. They continue to carry the torch of yesteryear in their battle of employers versus unions. In seeking to stoke the fires of the past, the Liberal government does not seek a conciliatory outcome. The Liberal government does not seek a middle ground or their so-called sensible centre. The Liberal government does not even care about the collateral damage to their own side—that is, the potential fall in membership of employer groups—in their blind pursuit to rid the country of organised labour and to throw the corporate veil across every aspect of our lives.


There have always been different regulations and legislation for registered organisations and corporations to reflect the differences in purpose and motivation of unions, employer groups and corporations. The facts are that under Labor the financial accountability standards applied to registered organisations, trade unions and employer groups had never been higher. The powers of the Fair Work Commission had never been stronger, and penalties had never been tougher.


There are already requirements in the legislation governing registered organisations for officers to act with care and diligence, to act in good faith, not to improperly use their position and not to improperly use information they have obtained through acting as a member of an organisation. As I have mentioned, as the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Shorten introduced significant reforms to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act in 2012. These reforms tripled penalties for breaches of the legislation; required that the rules of all registered organisations deal with disclosure of remuneration and pecuniary and financial interests; required that education and training be provided to officials of registered organisations about their governance and accounting obligations; and enhanced the investigative powers available to Fair Work Australia.


Without allowing time to test their effectiveness, those opposite simply seek to create fear in the community. Instead of allowing time for these changes to be bedded down, those opposite have mounted a weak argument for further change. In reality, this bill is a cruel backhanded attack on Australia's workers' rights to organise and to collectively bargain. Importantly, many of the changes introduced by Labor's reforms in our last term of government only came into effect at the start of this year. So this Liberal government, who dedicated so much energy in opposition to attacking sensible regulations, who promised repeatedly to cut the waste and who, upon coming to government, dedicated a whole day in the House of Representatives to ridding the country of regulations from before any of us were born, actually want to significantly increase the regulatory burden, leading to alleged increased costs and poorer services to members of employer groups and trade unions.


I participated in the Senate Education and Employment References Committee inquiry into this bill. The references committee really scrutinised the bill after significant flaws were highlighted during the legislation committee's inquiry. Of course, the Liberal government opposed the inquiry, and I note with interest the final three sentences of their dissenting report. The first states:


Coalition Senators are not surprised that union and employer organisation bosses aren't emphatically in support of this legislation.


This sentence highlights and concedes that the majority of submissions from trade unions and employer groups do not support the bill. However, the second and third sentences highlight the true intent of the bill and the collateral damage to the coalition's own base—employer groups. The sentences state:


That said, it is very clear that this reform is in the national interest and in the interests of honest union members who want to ensure that their money is being spent properly.


The only people that have anything to fear from this legislation are dodgy union bosses who do the wrong thing.


It is quite remarkable really. It reads as though there are many, many unions acting improperly with members' funds, but not one employer group.


Debate interrupted.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-05-13,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (12:32):  I rise with pleasure to support the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013. This bill honours a commitment which the coalition took to the September 2013 election—and I quote from the coalition's policy document—for 'better transparency and accountability of registered organisations'. The Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, said at the time of the election: 'The coalition will take strong action to ensure registered organisations are more transparent and accountable. We will act on this in the first week of the new parliament'—and indeed he did. He went on to say that Australians who join trade unions or employer associations deserve to have confidence in the conduct and administration of these organisations, that registered organisations are a central part of the fair work regime and they must operate to the high standards. In government we have honoured that commitment, and we stand here today in support of the bill.


I will go to the four premises of the bill—and they were spelt out in the Senate Education and Employment References Committee report to this place in 2014. The bill proposes to: firstly, establish an independent registered organisations commission to monitor and regulate registered organisations, with enhanced investigation and information gathering powers; secondly, amend the requirements on officers' disclosure of material personal interests and change grounds for disqualification and ineligibility for office; thirdly, strengthen existing financial accounting disclosure and transparency obligations under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, making them enforceable as civil remedy provisions; and, fourthly, increase civil penalties and introduce criminal offences for serious breaches of officers' duties as well as new offences in relation to the conduct of investigations under the Fair Work Registered Organisations Act 2009.


It is interesting to reflect on the background and the reasons for the need for these amendments to come into place—and I intend to speak to them in some detail—but it is equally interesting that in December 2013 the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee reported to the Senate on the outcome of that legislation committee report. Immediately the legislation committee report was in, we then had the opposition—the Labor and the Greens—joining forces to call for an Education and Employment References Committee inquiry into exactly the same issue. It is disappointing that, with all of the hard work that befalls us in the Senate, we had to have the chiefly political exercise of effectively going through exactly the same matters again. At that time, the coalition senators noted that the Senate committee was charged with looking at Labor's amendments to the registered organisations regime in 2012. And at that time—and I think this is very important from the viewpoint of accountability—as a result of a direction by the then Minister Bill Shorten, the committee had only five days in which to examine what was then the 'Shorten bill'. I contrast that with the four weeks this committee was given by our coalition government.


So all of this goes back to the laziness and incompetence of the then Minister Shorten. He saw what the coalition was bringing as a policy to the 2013 election, he panicked and he directed his department to try and short-circuit the whole process. As would be expected from a person of this limited capacity, he obviously got it wrong. To make sure that it was not given adequate opportunity for scrutiny, this place had only five days to examine the bill. It is interesting that the now opposition, then in government, failed to consult, failed their opportunity to speak to their own constituency and actually get that legislation right in the first place.


For example, in support of what I am saying, the coalition senators firmly agreed with the then Australian Workers Union National Secretary Mr Paul Howes who said at the time in relation to union corruption, 'If we ignore any pocket of dishonesty—it will grow like a cancer.' He spoke further about the need for developing corruption resistance at every level. So in fact this legislation and these amendments from the government have the strong support of those members of the union movement who share the same discouragement, the same disappointment. Indeed, in some instances, the same shame was actually visited upon the Australian community, particularly upon well-meaning and honourable members of the union movement. What we require in this legislation and these amendments is a circumstance in which those responsible for moneys of members' registered organisations, be they employer, trade union or whatever form, should be the subject of the same rigors and the same civil or criminal penalties for very serious offences. It would bring it into line and in the minds of the Australian community it would create a sense of fairness, a sense of transparency and a return to a sense of honour. Surely, that is a matter which is of tremendous interest and concern to the Australian people.


There were five recommendations that came forward from the legislation committee to the Senate. I am very pleased to be able to record the recommendations and those that are now found in these amendments which we are debating today. One would only hope that the Labor Party and the Greens senators will see the sense of them. One hopes that they will see that the ill-considered and improperly constructed legislation then presented by Mr Shorten will be redressed and will return to a level of comparability between the registered organisations representing employer groups as well as trade unions. For example, the first recommendation was: 


The Committee recommends that, consistent with the Corporations Act 2001, material personal interest disclosures should only be required to be made to those officers whose duties relate to the financial management of the organisation. 


As it is now, this is potentially required by everybody. Only those with responsibility for the purse strings, those with some level of financial accountability, should be the people who have who are called to account under the new legislation. The first amendment, then, reads:


Limit the obligation to disclose material personal interests to officers whose duties include duties that relate to financial management of the organisation or branch.


So in your capacity as the acting chair of the committee, Senator McKenzie, isn't it tremendous to see that these recommendations, as moved and as presented to this place, have indeed found their way into the actual amendments that are before us today?



Senator McKenzie interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  The second recommendation was that a list of exclusions from the obligations to disclose material personal interests based on section 191(2) of the Corporations Act be inserted into the bill, thus narrowing the obligation to disclose material personal interest of officers' relatives. The legislation at the moment encompasses the possibility of somebody's spouse, children or whoever. Indeed, we see the amendments coming through before us today removing the express obligation on officers and organisations to disclose details of any material personal interest an officers' relatives has or acquires in a matter that relates to the affairs of an organisation. So once again, we see common sense prevailing from this side. We see a recommendation that has come before this chamber finding its way into the amendments, which are the subject of our debate.


The third recommendation was that, with certain exclusions, the obligation placed on officers to disclose every payment should be reduced, including limiting disclosures to payments made above a certain threshold. Following that recommendation we see the provision of a civil penalty for an organisation's or branch's failure to provide minutes of meetings of the committee of management to members. Any member of a registered organisation should have the right to examine the minutes of meetings of the committee of management. This is a circumstance that should have been dealt with in the original legislation, if it had not been pushed through in such a panicked fashion by the then minister, now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten. 


Another of those amendments that we will consider in this place is aligning the obligation on officers to disclose material personal interests with section 191(2). This will be done by inserting into the bill similar exclusions to the obligations to disclose material as is applicable to directors of companies. In the evidence that came before us in the Senate inquiry process, these points were raised by witnesses—by employer representatives and by union representatives. It is interesting to see that they have been picked up, that the coalition in government has listened to both sides and has acted. 


We are also considering the expansion of exclusions that apply to the disclosure of payments made by an organisation or branch to related parties, including the exclusion of payments that are less than a prescribed amount. Once again the commissioner will have the authority to be able to set a figure below which these sorts of disclosures are not necessary to be made. To bring all this together, the amendments before us enable the Registered Organisations Commissioner to grant exemptions from the training requirements if an organisation can demonstrate that an officer has a proper understanding of their financial duties within the organisation or the branch. This naturally again goes to a level of common sense. It goes to submissions that were placed before the committee. It goes to representations by witnesses. There are training requirements and skills required of people involved in financial management of registered organisations. If, indeed, there are people who already have those financial skills and can demonstrate to the commissioner that they have them, then what is the purpose or the reason for the cost associated with having to go through and undertake those activities once again?


In the time that is left available to me it gives me no pleasure to reflect on the background and some of the reasons that we find ourselves in these circumstances. Naturally enough, although not exclusive to the amendments, we had the circumstances associated with Mr Craig Thomson—once a member of parliament in this place—and the former ALP national president, Mr Michael Williamson, both acting in their capacities as officers of the Health Services Union. We spent far too much time in this parliament over the last three to four years distracted by the actions and activities of both those men, both of whom have now been dealt with by the courts and, of course, found guilty of the activities with which they were associated. In the case of Mr Thomson they were activities which he emphatically denied even on the floor of the other house in this place. These are people who were found guilty of misusing Health Services Union members' funds—in the case of Mr Williamson, almost $1 million. At the time all of this was taking place my mother was a high-care patient in a nursing home in Perth, and I remember reflecting on the excellence of the care that was given to her and to the other elderly patients, including those with Alzheimer's and other conditions. The people who were providing that care had paid their union fees for many years only to see those funds going to the purposes for which it has now been established both Mr Thomson and Mr Williamson have either admitted or been found guilty. I recall an interview with an elderly Eastern European lady who had worked her entire life. Somebody had done the figures and had said to her, 'With those funds you could have had a trip back to Europe to visit your family.' She said, 'No, I would have used those funds towards the education of my grandchildren.' How those people can reflect on their behaviour, one can only imagine.


The important thing is that if we had had this legislation and amendments in place prior to the time those people carried on with those behaviours, one would hope that we would not have seen that abhorrent behaviour which was the subject of so much scrutiny, discord and disappointment to the Australian community. Yet we see it playing out again with respect to the ex-secretary of that same union, Ms Kathy Jackson, who was very much involved in the processes associated with those other gentlemen. In the last couple of days we have seen in the Federal Court an allegation that Ms Jackson siphoned off almost $250,000 of members' funds into a bank account of which she was the beneficiary. That is the allegation that was presented by lawyers for the Health Services Union in only the last two or three days, so no doubt we are going to see that play out as well. Surely members of unions, particularly those who do not have the opportunity to be represented at meetings, have the right to see the minutes of meetings and to understand the activities of their unions. One can only speculate on what they must think when they hear about behaviour like that and when they see where their funds have gone. I urge strong support from the other side in this place to ensure that these amendments go through in the way in which they are intended. 


In different circumstances, but relating particularly to my own home state of Western Australia, we see being played out in the royal commission the activities of the Australian Workers Union and their former leadership, Mr Wilson and Mr Blewitt assisted by their former lawyer, Ms Gillard. When I was in Kalgoorlie late last year discussing this question with some members of the AWU, one of them told me in a very distressed fashion of an incident which occurred—



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  I know Senator Cameron will be interested in this story, which was told by this gentleman who was an official of the union. He said that they had a million dollars on account in the goldfields. It was a big sum of money at the time, in the 1990s. There was huge pressure on them to release those funds and make them available to the management of the organisation in the city, and they opposed it vehemently. But a very smart young female lawyer turned up from Melbourne and they reluctantly made the decision and the million dollars disappeared. The gentleman said, 'I'll always remember the next day when a fellow that I never knew, but I knew of, came to the Kalgoorlie office, grabbed all the files pertaining to that matter, took them out to the Kalgoorlie tip and burnt them.' I think that is what stuck in their craw more than anything else. It was not the fact that the funds all disappeared—although that really worried them. It was not so much the fact that $1 million, which they no doubt had imminent use for given the nature of the industry that we see in the goldfields of WA, but it was the fact that any possible trail of accountability or audit literally went up in smoke. I have no doubt that we are going to see that game played out even more.


The last matter which I will draw senators' attention to is very current in Western Australia, and it is associated with the MUA. I have in front of me the declaration of results from the Australian Electoral Commission, and 41 members of the union have voted to put themselves in a circumstance where they can strike under a protected action ballot for 24 hours. That was question 1 that was asked of those who were eligible. All 45 out of 45 voted for a 24-hour strike to be undertaken. The next question related to whether there could be an unlimited number of stoppages for a period of 48 hours. We are talking about $100 million a day. Out of 45 members, 44 supported that one; one did not. The third question was whether or not they would have unlimited stoppages for seven days. That is $700 million to $1 billion of direct costs in that period of time without considering the workers at the mines, on the trains, in the trucks and, of course, the rest of the industry which is so vital to this country. That is where we are being held, and I come back to the point which is simply this. There should be unanimous support right around this chamber for the amendments contained in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-05-13,"




Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:52):  It is always good to follow Senator Back. He is always interesting, if nothing else, and I do not think there was much else in that speech this afternoon. I rise on behalf of the Labor Party to oppose the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013. This bill is unnecessary. It imposes massive regulatory burdens on voluntary organisations based on the coalition's ideological opposition to collective organisations acting in the interests of their members. That is fundamentally what this is about. The bill is not about accountability; it is about the coalition's obsession with destroying collective bargaining in this country. The bill is about the government introducing over-the-top regulation and red tape on the trade union movement while at the same time railing against regulation and red tape in every other area of the economy. This is hypocrisy on a grand scale, but it is something we have to get used to with the Abbott government.


After failing to reduce workers' rights with Work Choices, the coalition have now embarked on an attack on the organisations that support employers and workers. The ideology and strategy is clear: destroy effective unions and you destroy workers' capacity to protect their wages and conditions. The bill is designed to make it extremely difficult for unions and employer organisations to operate as they have over the last 150 years—that is, with volunteer rank and file membership on their governing bodies. Rank and file members would be faced with huge obligations and penalties far outweighing and inconsistent with the role they play on their unions' governing bodies.


The bill is an attempt to treat all employer organisations and unions as if the default driver is criminality and personal greed. When criminality and greed is exposed in the business sector, the usual argument from business and the coalition is that laws should not be enacted based on the behaviour of individuals which is inconsistent with the general behaviour in business and industry. I have heard this argument several times from the opposite side. For ideological reasons, this approach is not applicable when it comes to the trade union movement. Labor is appalled by the behaviour of a small number of individuals who deceitfully and criminally stole the funds of the union and its members for their own personal gain. Those individuals have faced proper processes, and one is in jail and another one looks like going to jail. 


Labor moved decisively with this issue and, after consultation with employer organisations and unions, we effected the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Act 2012 and the Fair Work Amendment Act 2013. These laws are rigorous, balanced and appropriate. Labor's laws strengthened the legislative provisions concerning disclosure and transparency of decision making. This was done while understanding and recognising the difference between voluntary organisations and for-profit businesses.


The government claims that this bill will place the regulation of registered organisations on the same footing as the regulation of corporations under the Corporations Act. There is absolutely no logic to this approach. Voluntary organisations are significantly different from corporations, are subject to significant regulatory overview and have regulatory requirements that ensure compliance with appropriate standards for voluntary organisations. The coalition bill, by design, will establish a more onerous regulatory regime on volunteers who make up the committees of management of registered organisations than that which applies to highly paid executives on company boards. So you have an ordinary worker who says: 'I will help with my union. I want to engage with my union.' They go on the board and they are subject to more scrutiny and harder laws than those affecting other business people earning $150,000 a year to sit on a board. And these workers get not a cent. These volunteers get not a cent to do the work that they do.


The legislation has more to do with an ideological attack on the trade union movement than it has with any genuine desire to ensure standards for voluntary organisations. A range of submissions was provided to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee during its inquiry into the bill. It is clear that the coalition have managed to do one thing. They have managed to do something that is unheard of in the industrial history of Australia. They have united employer organisations and the trade union movement against this overt attack on collective organisation in this country. I would have thought, given the explosive revelations in New South Wales in ICAC, that the coalition would be more concerned about cleaning up their own act than attacking, for purely ideological reasons, unions of employers and employees. 


Senator Back used some highly provocative language in his submission, something that is the stock and trade of the coalition in this country. He spoke about shame. He spoke about honour. He spoke about transparency. And he spoke about the need for rigorous penalties. Let me tell you, I agree that those principles should apply to the New South Wales Liberal Party and the federal Liberal Party in their operations, with all their slush funds and all their trusts that are hiding money from the proper organisations in this country—and I will come to that in some detail.


I would have thought that the coalition would have been keen to do some internal analysis of the promises that they made to the Australian public prior to the election, prior to the reality that the public will have to face tonight with an austerity budget that will hand money back to big business—hundreds of millions of dollars will go back to Twiggy Forrest, Gina Rinehart, BHP and Rio Tinto—while people will have to wait longer to get a pension, while the value of the pension will decline, while people will have to pay more for petrol every time they get in a car and while people will have to hand over more money every time they go to the doctor. I would have thought that these would be the issues that the Liberal Party would be discussing. I know that some like Senator Macdonald are discussing these not only within the party but in the public arena. So the hypocrisy of the coalition knows no bounds—taking money out of the pockets of ordinary Australians and putting money back into the pockets of the billionaire mining companies and billionaire miners.


No amount of dissembling as to what is a tax and what is not a tax and no amount of rhetorical ballet dancing in relation to lowering the overall tax burden will hide the reality of the broken promises of the coalition. Remember your leader Tony Abbott's statement: 'No new taxes, no surprises, no broken promises, no cuts to health and no cuts to education.' Remember those words tonight when he puts his hand in the pocket of every ordinary Australian on the basis of some unreal fiscal crisis, some unreal budgetary crisis, some unreal budgetary emergency. It is all a nonsense. 


The issues of lies, deceit and broken promises should be addressed internally in the coalition. Workers and employer organisations should be allowed to operate under the various international conventions that we are legally obliged to uphold. Attacking the trade union movement and working people in this country with penal provisions and trumped-up royal commissions should stop, and the coalition should set about cleaning up their own act by announcing a royal commission into Liberal and National party slush funds. That is what they should be doing. The public in New South Wales and across Australia have been watching in horror as the rogues' gallery of Liberal Party members and politicians parade at ICAC, exposing the unfair and illegal approach that is taken by the Liberal Party to undermine democracy in this country. That is something that I think they should be looking at, instead of attacking employer organisations and the trade union movement in this country. 


The public are watching in fascination as Liberal politician after Liberal politician is exposed for corrupt and illegal practices—practices designed to corrupt democracy and corrupt the democratic processes in New South Wales, practices designed to illegally avoid the exposure of cash for influence in the coalition. That should be the focus of a royal commission, not the trumped-up, biased royal commission into the trade union movement. 


Ray Carter, an adviser to Chris Hartcher, one of the leading Liberals in New South Wales, said that they all knowingly and deliberately were running donations from prohibited donors and they were running those donations through the Free Enterprise Foundation, which is a foundation associated with the federal Liberal Party. So we have Senator Back coming in here trying to smear the whole trade union movement because of the illegal activities of a few people, activities that are reprehensible, and force legislation on the whole trade union movement because of the illegal activities of a few people but not being prepared to do anything about the illegal activities of the Liberal Party. Trying to undermine democracy in Australia, in my view, is one of the most reprehensible things you can do. 


The Liberal Party in New South Wales, and it looks like they have been aided and abetted by the Liberal Party in Canberra, have been laundering slush funds from illegal donors in New South Wales into Canberra and back into New South Wales. That is being exposed day in and day out. Yet what is the priority for the Liberal Party? It is to attack the trade union movement and turn a blind eye to the corruption and illegality in the Liberal Party. They attack the trade union movement because they do not want workers to collectively bargain. I just think it is outrageous. For Senator Back, and for any of the Liberals, to come in here and fail to mention this issue is pure hypocrisy. Senator Back comes in here and tells these stories about being out in the bush talking to a union member and the union member says this and the union member says that. If Senator Back has got any evidence of corruption or illegal activity, he should take that to the police. He should take that to the authorities. I challenge Senator Back to come back in here and explain to the parliament what he did with that allegation, whether he advised the appropriate authorities that, as a senator, he has been advised of illegal activity in Western Australia. What did he do about it? My bet is he did nothing. My bet is that it is probably a made-up story anyway to embellish his pretty boring speech in here on this issue. I challenge Senator Back: 'Come back in here, tell us when you went to the police, tell us what you have told the police and let's get the thing dealt with by the authorities. Don't come in here trying to smear the trade union movement with unsubstantiated allegations.' That is stock-in-trade for the coalition in this country.


The issues relating to compliance under the Workplace Relations Act are confined to isolated criminality by a small number of corrupt individuals. The issues of coalition corruption, influenced heavily by greed and stupidity, are now the hallmark of this coalition and seem to be a systemic part of the culture of the Liberal Party. The isolated problems of the trade union movement have been addressed by the Labor Party, the ACTU and the police. No attempt has been made by the coalition, and especially the Liberal Party, to deal with corruption of the democratic processes in New South Wales.


We now see these links back to Canberra, with the corrupt money flow from New South Wales laundered in Canberra and used by Liberal Party politicians in New South Wales. Never in the history of Australian politics have we seen the systemic undermining of the democratic processes and the laws of the land as we are watching in New South Wales. Never in the history of Australian politics have we seen a Liberal premier having to stand down because he misled the corruption watchdog. Never in the history of Australian politics have we witnessed a senator—Senator Sinodinos—a frontbencher, recently sitting across this chamber, attempting to justify a payment of $200,000 for 40 hours work and to justify a $4,000-an-hour payment to drive from the CBD of Sydney to Castle Hill. $4,000 an hour! Never in the history of Australian politics have we seen Liberal politician after Liberal politician appear before a corruption inquiry and, one after the other, fall on their swords. Never in the history of Australian politics has the web of influence peddling for cash been exposed as it has with the Liberal Party.


And never in the history of politics has a political party with so many internal corrupt activities tried to divert attention from their own illegal activities by attacking the trade union movement in such a systematic way. Why is the coalition attacking the trade union movement when the real issue for democracy in this country is the operation of Liberal Party slush funds? Let us have a royal commission into Eightbyfive, the Millennium Forum, the Forward Brisbane Leadership Fund, the Cormack Foundation, the Free Enterprise Foundation, the Greenfields Foundation, Bunori Pty Ltd—an organisation that Senator Sinodinos failed to disclose that he had an interest in when he became a senator—Vapold Pty Ltd, the North Sydney Forum and Vaughan Constructions—a company that went bust, but which weeks before it went bust, leaving workers with no pay and subcontractors with no payments, gave $400,000 to the Liberal Party.


Those of the type of people we have sitting over there; trying to lecture Labor and the trade union movement about honesty, about shame and about honour. I welcome these debates in this place, and I call on the Liberal Party to actually form a royal commission into the dishonest operation of the Liberal Party both at the federal level and in New South Wales. And while we are at it, let's spread it up to Brisbane and let's get it over in Perth because I am sure the same peddling of influence for money is underway in the Liberal Party right around this country. There will be Nick Di Girolamo's equivalents everywhere in the Liberal Party.


So instead of attacking the trade union movement, which is out there battling to get workers a fair go, they should be investigating their own internals. They should be setting up a royal commission to look at the corruption and the deceit and the dishonesty in the Liberal Party. Leave the trade union movement alone, leave the employer organisations alone; start looking at your own backyard, that is where the corruption is. (Time expired)

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-05-13,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (13:12):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013, and I say, on behalf of the Australian Greens, that the Senate should reject this bill.


The Abbott government's hypocrisy is evident in this bill: on one hand pledging to remove red tape while on the other doubling the layer of regulation on employer associations and unions is utterly shameless. If we needed any further evidence of hypocrisy it is here in this bill as well in that the government states that it is committed to protecting so-called 'traditional' rights, yet this bill would see overreaching intrusions into the lives of those people who are involved with unions and other registered organisations. These are rights which I think anyone would agree are traditional rights, like freedom of association, the presumption of innocence and the right to privacy and reputation. It is hard to think about how much more traditional you could get than those rights.


The bill's compliance burden alone is enough to make this bill unworthy. It will inflate organisations' training costs and it will submit them to a regulatory burden which is so unrealistic that it just makes no sense. This is what the Senate Education and Employment References Committee found in recommending that the bill be rejected, and I call on the Senate today to heed those recommendations.


Just so we can be very clear about what the government is proposing to do here, let us look at what the bill does. Registered organisations are unions and employer associations that are registered under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. That act was already amended in 2012 to enhance registered organisations' financial accountability as well as that of their office holders. Those amendments included rules for disclosure of remuneration and pecuniary and financial interests, increased civil penalties, strengthened investigative powers for Fair Work Australia and requirements for education and training to be provided to the officials of registered organisations about their governance and accounting obligations. Many of those amendments only took effect from 1 January this year—less than six months ago and after this current bill was introduced. So the government did not even wait to see the efficacy of those previous amendments. 


This bill proposes to go even further. It will establish a new stand-alone agency called the Registered Organisations Commission, which will have powers to monitor and regulate registered organisations, enforced by extensive investigative and information-gathering powers. So here we are today, standing on the brink of a budget which, all the indications suggest, will see the abolition of many long-standing and respected cultural and environmental agencies—just to mention one sector—in the name of so-called efficiency, deregulation and removal of red tape, yet if this bill is to be passed we will see the creation of a new government agency to oversee, essentially, unions. That shows the real ideological agenda that is at play here.


What will this commission—and this bill—do? It will increase reporting obligations, including by amending requirements about material personal interests. I will come back to that. As well, the bill proposes to increase civil penalties, create offences relating to investigations, and introduce criminal offences for breaches of officers' duties. 


The Australian Greens say that this bill should be rejected. It has significant unintended consequences, which were revealed in the course of the Senate Education and Employment References Committee inquiry, and it imposes major training and financial burdens on organisations. In this, it contrasts with the government's posturing about reducing red tape and protecting traditional rights. It will establish an onerous regulatory regime, on top of regulation already present under the Corporations Act.


A good case study can be taken from the submission and the evidence that came before the Senate Education and Employment References Commission from an organisation in my own home state of South Australia—the South Australian Wine Industry Association. In their submission that association said that this bill will impose 'excessive compliance and disproportionate monetary penalties on all registered organisations'. They make the point that they are a not-for-profit incorporated association. They have board members who provide a great deal of unpaid time each year, which is a fundamental aspect of the effective work of that association. They attend meetings across regional South Australia, which involves not only the meeting time but the travelling time. They read board papers, meet with the government and consult with their members. All this is fundamental to conducting the meaningful activities of SAWIA, the South Australian Wine Industry Association. The association points out that the role of these board members cannot be directly compared to listed public companies, which are commercial operations with well remunerated directors. Yet, in many cases, the proposed amendments under this bill will result in far greater penalties and requirements being imposed. It makes no sense. 


The hypocrisy of this government in pledging to remove red tape, while doubling the layer of regulation on registered organisations, is not lost on the Australian Greens, and it was not lost on the stakeholders who made submissions against it in the two Senate inquiries since its introduction. Stakeholders who made submissions to the Senate committee inquiry supported the need for good governance, but not in the form proposed by this bill. The Australian Council of Trade Unions noted it supported the passage of the 2012 legislation because it supports a legislative regime promoting the operation of accountable, democratic and effective trade unions which are member governed. However, it described the provisions of this bill as 'poorly conceived, badly motivated, and entirely unnecessary'. That was the tenor of most of the submissions before the inquiry.


Other submitters said that this bill would interfere with and impede registered organisations' abilities to carry out duties on behalf of their members. Maybe that is where we get to the essence of this legislation. Maybe that is the government's intended purpose—to make it more difficult for trade unions to service the needs of their members in a pluralist society. 


The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation said the bill was 'unnecessary, poorly structured and excessive'. The Australian Air Traffic Control Association suggested that the establishment of a commission effectively disregards all of the processes that organisations had implemented to comply with legislation changes in 2012. This goes to the heart of this legislation: it is not based on necessity; it is based on ideology. The Senate Education and Employment References Committee concluded that these 2012 legislative changes need to be implemented fully, before further interference with registered organisations' governance is considered.


Fair Work Australia gave evidence that its updated approach to regulation since 2012 has delivered a marked increase in registered organisations' compliance levels. And that is what we are looking for here. For example, it stated that there was a lodgement rate for annual returns of 96.2 per cent in the 2012-13 financial year, which by May of 2013 had increased to 99.5 per cent. Fair Work Australia also stated that a proactive election audit that it conducted with respect to all registered organisations required to lodge election information with the Fair Work Commission has, for the first time, shown a comprehensive compliance picture across 503 election entities. All this has occurred before the legislation has been enacted. 


The Australian Privacy Foundation criticised the proposed disclosure regime in this bill, saying that it is unnecessary, it erodes privacy protection and it is out of step with the government's stated commitment to traditional freedoms. So they were calling the government on their hypocrisy. 


Submitters also said that the compliance burden proposed by the bill would impose significant training costs. The committee agreed that the regulatory burden proposed by the bill is excessive and inappropriate. It also agreed that the proposed disclosure regime for material personal interests is not only inappropriate; it is wholly unworkable. It is impractical. The committee concluded that the bill poses a great threat to the ability of registered organisations to provide services for the advancement of their membership if it means they will be occupied with the degree of extra regulation and red tape it proposes. It does lead one to wonder if this is the government's intention when it comes to the important work of unions in defending and promoting the rights of their members.


There is a broader picture here, though. The Australian Greens are not only concerned about the impractical compliance burden associated with this bill, in contradiction to the purported intention of this government. We are also seriously concerned about its encroachment on traditional rights and liberties and the fact that it is totally inconsistent with the government's purported commitment to these. Do not judge a government by what it says; judge it by what it does.


In relation to the new criminal offences that this bill would establish, the committee concluded that these duplicate existing crime legislation. The committee also shared the concerns of submitters regarding the fact that the proposed structure and powers of the commissioner are inappropriate. The commission's proposed investigative powers are too extreme and go far beyond what is appropriate to ensure adequate regulation of registered organisations. It is clear that the regulatory framework which was enacted by the 2012 legislative changes is sufficient to empower the current regulator to do its duties.


The Australian Greens are very clear that the proposed powers of the Registered Organisations Commission are excessive, draconian and completely unnecessary. The Australian Greens condemn the government for introducing this legislation before the amendments under the 2012 act have had a chance to operate effectively. It discloses an ideological agenda operating here. This is bad legislation because it increases registered organisations' compliance burden far out of proportion to any necessity and it undermines the very traditional rights and freedoms which the government claims to be committed to.


This legislation was not introduced in good faith but rather to undermine unions, their members and their ability to achieve outcomes. Let's be clear about that. The Australian Greens are committed to free, independent and democratic unions as an essential pillar of civil society. We believe that the present legislation for registered organisations is appropriately rigorous, without denying unions the ability to achieve important outcomes for their members.


This would be the creation of a new commission when we are standing on the brink of the government abolishing many other longstanding and respected organisations, commissions and agencies, such as the National Library, the National Gallery and the National Museum. They are all in the crosshairs of the budget. We will wait to see whether that occurs, but there will certainly be some that will be dismantled or merged on the basis of efficiency and reducing red tape, regulation and duplication. Despite that, we have this bill proposing to create a brand new commission to make sure that the government can sufficiently intrude into the unions and the way they operate on behalf of their members to reduce their effectiveness. That is what will happen if the government has its way. So I call on the Senate to reject this bill and affirm the rights of registered organisations to get on with the job.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2014-05-13,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (13:26):  I would like to begin today by actually agreeing with Senator Doug Cameron on one point. He said that trying to undermine democracy is one of the most reprehensible things you can do. I absolutely agree with him on that point. Our point with this legislation is to improve and enhance democracy by improving transparency and accountability. There was no argument about whether there needed to be reform in this area because, in fact, the initial bills to reform the area were put through by Mr Shorten when he was in government last year. The only problem, of course, was that they followed the usual pattern of Labor legislation, which is that the bills were ineptly drafted, hastily developed and, mostly, completely incompetently implemented. So most of the changes we are talking about this morning relate to trying to fix some of the problems that were so evident in the legislation that Mr Shorten put through.


It is probably worth just making a point about what we are looking at in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013 today. It limits the obligation of officers in registered organisations to disclose material personal interests when they do not relate in any way to their duties. It removes the express obligation on officers and organisations to disclose details of any material personal interests in a matter that relates to the affairs of an organisation that an officer's relative has or acquires. It requires officers to make disclosures of material personal interests to the committee of management and for such disclosures to be recorded in the minutes of the meeting and be available upon request to members. It provides for a civil penalty for organisations or branches that fail to provide minutes of the committee of management meetings to their members. It aligns the obligations on officers to disclose material personal interests with the Corporations Act by putting in exclusions about what obligations and material personal interests are applicable and which are not. It provides that an officer is not restricted from taking part in a decision where they have a material interest if that interest is not such that it needs to be disclosed. It expands the exclusions that apply to the disclosure of payments made where they are less than the prescribed amount or where member approval for that transaction is not necessary under the current Corporations Act.


It enables the Registered Organisations Commissioner to grant exemptions from training requirements if an organisation can demonstrate that an officer has a proper understanding of their financial duties within the organisation or branch. It is a bit bizarre when you consider that the legislation as the former Minister Shorten had it drafted, given the way it read, would have required qualified accountants to go and do a one-day financial training course so that they knew how to behave when they were on the board. These are common-sense amendments to give better transparency and better accountability for registered organisations.


Certainly the coalition welcomed in principle the fact that then Minister Shorten did recognise that there was something very, very wrong within the union movement when he put his initial legislation up, but of course we had the situation where a former union boss was relying on the goodwill of other unionists for that legislation to go through. I am somewhat bemused by some of the arguments around how poor little unions run by volunteers should have the same sorts of requirements put on them as you might put on a kindergarten committee or such and that they should not face the same requirements as a corporation. I am afraid that that is not a view that works on this side of the House, and it was not a view that worked with the Australian people. We made it very clear at the last election that it was our intention that people who ran unions should have the same qualifications and the same responsibilities as people who ran corporations because, after all, it is not their money that they are playing with. It is someone else's. It is their members' money. You only have to go back to the major problems that caused then Minister Shorten to put his flawed legislation through last year—that is, the Health Services Union's problems and the resulting court cases out of that—to see one aspect of the problems that need to be so significantly addressed in this area.


One of the key components of that legislation and what happened with the Health Services Union was the inordinate delay—in fact, it was later described as such by PricewaterhouseCoopers when they reviewed it—in the hearing of that case by Fair Work Australia. It is not impossible—and certainly many people have suggested it—that the fact that the government required the vote of the alleged 'Independent' Labor member, Mr Thomson, could explain part of the reason for why that delay happened, although many other apparently cogent reasons were put up by Fair Work Australia as to why it took them years and years to go through material, which of course has since led to both civil and criminal charges. If we were looking at the Health Services Union as a one-off issue, there would not be the same need for legislation as has been required. But it is clear that there has grown up in some elements of the union movement a systemic corruption, a systemic sense of being entitled to do what they damn well like with members' fees. Certainly in some areas there was a view that the political support of the then Labor government was so much more important than meeting the needs of members.


I would like to add there that the vast majority of executives of unions are people trying to do their best for their membership and working hard at that. But to suggest that they are poor little volunteers akin to someone on a kinder committee is nonsense; it has always been nonsense. As we will now discover, many of these union executives are paid the sorts of money that would, in other circumstances, lead Labor members to talk about 'rich fat cats'. They receive the sorts of payments that senior executives receive; they receive larger pay packets in fact than members of parliament receive.




Senator Bilyk:
  No! Do you know how much a union official earns? What are you talking about? You're atrocious!




Senator BOYCE:
  I think we will just continue on, Senator Bilyk. I do not—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(

Senator BOYCE:
  I think we all know that there are extremely highly paid union officials around, and to try to suggest that somehow we would compare unions—

Senator Cameron:
  Not as well paid as Arthur Sinodinos!




Senator BOYCE:

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Boyce, please direct your address through the chair.




Senator BOYCE:
  I was addressing my remarks to the chair. I did not in any way refer to members opposite by their names or anything, Mr Acting Deputy President, so I would have thought it was perhaps more the interjectors who may have been causing the issues here, rather than my speech.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator BOYCE:
  I think Senator Cameron was listened to in silence more because people were bored by hearing the same message over and over.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Interjections are disorderly!




Senator BOYCE:
  The complete denial from the other side that corruption happens in any way within the union movement is just very sad. As I said earlier, I support Senator Cameron's view that democracy requires transparency, but it also requires accountability and members of many unions have not had that. We have had it in minute detail as to how that has not happened for the Health Services Union. And of course there are other unions involved, and I have just run through a small list that, coincidentally, was published in TheWest Australian today. We have the Ai Group urging the Heydon royal commission to investigate claims that unions are receiving generous and undisclosed kickbacks from income protection insurers to sign up members. We have the Master Builders wanting all payments made by employers for training by unions to be investigated. We have the fact that there are training groups set up by the CFMEU, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, and that they lent some money to a training organisation—in fact training has been a nice little earner for unions. That is fine if what is happening is genuine training for genuine reasons. But that is not what has been happening. It is being used as a way to milk employers yet again in an apparently honest way. But of course it is not honest; it is the usual overkill and attempts at bribery.


We go on to look at the AWU slush fund scandal, which is the whole reason that the royal commission was established. We even have reports of one union official saying that many of the members of the AWU had secret TAB accounts where they could hide $1,000 or so from the missus. Now of course they were not just hiding the money from the missus; they were hiding the money from their members, from the tax office, and from any efforts that could be made to try to bring criminal charges for fraud against them.


I have mentioned already, of course, Mr Thomson and the HSU. Even more serious, and certainly a matter of great concern in my home state of Queensland, have been the apparent links between the CFMEU and organised crime. On the east coast of Australia we have recorded conversations, bank records and police files that demonstrate that major crime, bikie gangs and the CFMEU have all been working together very nicely within the construction industry. I would hope that the members opposite would agree with me that these matters need to be exposed. They have no place in Australia and they have no place within a union movement that is trying very hard to—




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator is making allegations that have got no basis in fact. The Crime Commission appeared before the Senate inquiry. The Crime Commission, the Federal Police and the Victoria Police have indicated that there was no basis to allege this type of activity.




Senator Back:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: the senator is debating the issue. He has had his opportunity. He squandered it and now he has got to sit and listen.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. 




Senator BOYCE:
  It is somewhat sad that Senator Cameron, who I think is a great proponent of democracy in Australia and would be a proponent of democracy within the union movement, is making what appear to be excuses for behaviour that I would have thought he would condemn. I would have thought that he would be one of the people foremost in saying, 'I want an organisation that I can be proud of,' and I very much hope that that is where we will end up with some of the inquiries that go on. But I would contend that there has been in some unions and at some levels systemic corruption, a systemic lack of interest in the rights of members, systemic indifference to the needs of members and systemic featherbedding going on. Wherever that happens, this Senate has a duty to attempt its very best to ensure that it is exposed.


I would like to look at articles out of today's paper that demonstrate that in other areas there is action taken and there is the availability of criminal and civil penalties against those who behave wrongly. We have a headline about fears that a $7 million insider trading deal involving the ABS and others is in fact simply the tip of the iceberg. That is terrible. That should not happen. But ASIC and others have the responsibility under the legislation to ensure that it does not happen. Here we have a case where it has actually come out, where the alleged offenders will be taken through the courts and forced to come up with a solution. This involved the ABS and it was found out through the auditing that went on between the ABS and other areas. 


We have ASIC, the ANAO and numerous other bodies oversighting the way government departments and agencies and corporations function. But the minute you suggest that there be a similar body to oversight the way unions behave we have the most bizarre and ridiculous nonsense coming out of the opposition about the fact that these are tiny little groups involving volunteers with scarcely a cent to their name. It is just nonsense. The opposition know it is nonsense and they know that work has to be done to improve the transparency of unions.


If Fair Work Australia had demonstrated the ability to deal with these matters when they had the chance with Craig Thomson and the HSU, if we could have said, 'My goodness, that was shocking, but it is a one-off issue; it has got nothing to do with any other unions or the way any other unions function,' then that would be fine. We could say, 'Okay. Fair Work Australia should just get its act together and do better next time.' 


But that is not what happened and that is not where the problems lie. I would love to be able to stand here in a few years time and say we probably do not need a Registered Organisations Commissioner anymore; the job is done. But certainly the job has not even begun yet. I would hope that the majority of members of the Labor Party, the majority of union members and the majority of members of this place would want to see the union movement cleaned up. They would want to see the same amount of accountability and transparency in the way these organisations are run as you would expect to see in any other organisation of the size.




Senator Cameron:
  Like the Liberal Party and Arthur Sinodinos!




Senator BOYCE:
  I would suggest that we are not talking simply about whether anyone ever committed some sort of corrupt act; we are talking about the ability for the public to know and perceive that this has occurred. I think we have had some rather good examples from both sides of parliament in New South Wales of what happens when you get transparency. But I think we also need to take into account that the Independent Commission Against Corruption is not a court; it is simply an investigative body, and out of that investigation one imagines some charges may well be laid against numerous people. But simply appearing as a witness in a court, tribunal or commission is not a suggestion that one has committed a crime.




Senator Bilyk:
  Neither is belonging to a union.




Senator Cameron:
  It's a crime to take 40 grand an hour!




Senator BOYCE:
  I think that, when we look at some of the other matters that have gone on—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator BOYCE:
  Thank you. I recommend these amendments to the house. I am saddened by the fact that people who allegedly care about democracy on the other side of this chamber do not think that putting through the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013 will assist the people that I understood they are here to represent. I think they need to take some advice from the people at the bottom who put them here and who support their policies. They need to genuinely behave like representatives of workers. (Time expired)

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:47):  I rise to speak in the debate on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013. In March last year I spoke against the private senator's bill from Senator Abetz. It was almost a mirror proposal of the one before us today. In March last year I stressed that officers of registered organisations or anyone in a position of trust misusing the funds of members or acting inappropriately, taking benefits where they are not entitled, must never be condoned. In the HSU case that sparked this debate and reactionary bill, the Fair Work Commission collected evidence and the courts have made their verdict. These trials show that there is no need for this new commissioner, that the current system is working. This legislation will not stop people committing fraud, as Senator Back alleged earlier today. The current system has found these people guilty. This legislation is simply a witch hunt, simply another way to smear working people and their unions.


It is one thing for the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, as Senator Abetz was at the time, to propose a private senator's bill that no-one supports. He wanted to make a point. He wanted to propose an idea. But there is so little support for the idea and so little policy merit one has to wonder why it is being brought back here. On the whole, employer groups and trade unions do not support these reforms. It is an idealistic approach that actually defies their own deregulation ideals.


I am a former state secretary of a trade union: the Tasmanian branch of the AMWU. I am pleased to stand up here in this place and put on record my background as a union member, as an organiser and as secretary. I do so with a strong sense of purpose; I know where I came from and I know who I represented. I know the clear intent of this bill that we debate today is not to strengthen union governance. It is not to make unions more appealing to the community in an effective way to grow membership. No, the sole purpose of this bill is to strike at the heart of registered organisations and sever the ability of honest volunteers to play their part in the governance of their union or organisation. This bill wants to make volunteering on the decision-making body of a union or employer organisation so unappealing that no-one will do it. This bill wants to destroy one of the most basic principles of volunteer organisations. The bill wants to use the improper and fraudulent actions of a handful of officials to materially weaken trade unions into the future.


On this side we want to talk about fairness in employment and industrial relations. We want to spend time promoting positive reforms, not tarring over two million Australians and their families with a brush because they want to collectively organise and negotiate for decent conditions at work.


When I spoke on the bill last year I highlighted a story of the importance of a union and the importance of acceptance of unions for a group of female workers at a factory in George Town, Tasmania a number of years ago. It was such an important story that I felt I needed to share it again. It was a small fishery and processing facility. I as an organiser was approached by some of the staff to come along and speak to the whole team. When we in the old Food Preservers' Union approached the management to come along, they were very helpful. They invited us in, they got the workers together in the lunchroom and they made us feel welcome.


The workers at the processing facility were predominantly women, all of them employed on a casual basis. The few men around were all permanent. With permanency came security but also a sense of superiority. We spoke to the staff about joining the union, and people seemed positive. We left them some information and told them we would come back the next week to talk again to those who wanted to join.


We thought that we had had a good hearing and that we would be able to offer these people the support that they needed. Unfortunately, when we left, the boss got everyone in the lunchroom and said that, if they joined the union, they would lose their jobs. Plain and simple: they would lose their job. Two women who were silent members of the union called and told us what had happened. They were worried about their jobs. A week later we went back to the factory and talked to the people again. This time, publicly no-one was interested; however, the silent members called again and arranged for us to meet with a group of the workers, and we met with the women at one of their homes. They told us of the shenanigans that went on in their workplace—one-way shenanigans towards the female workers by the men and actions that many people might not think of as wrong but as larrikinism, but there were a lot of acts that any reasonable person would frame as assault and dangerous.


The workers would be hosing down at the end of the day. One day, one of the men was cleaning down in his underwear—I do not know why. He repeatedly turned the hose on the women, who were just going about their job, and sprayed them with a high-powered hose. It was harassment. It could be viewed as assault, but it was definitely dangerous. At the factory there were only shared toilets—that is, a number of cubicles in a room. On more than one occasion some of the men would force themselves into the bathroom cubicle while one of the women was in there. It was a sick and twisted game to intimidate the female workers.


One day, it got out of hand. One of the men forced his way into the cubicle, and the woman was able to fight him off but was injured with visible bruising on her arms. She told me that she spoke to her husband when she got home that night. His first reaction was: 'Who is this bloke? I'm going to go and rip his head off.' This was a desperate reaction from someone without the means to resolve disputes through negotiation. The second reaction was: 'But you have to go to work tomorrow because we need the money.' This woman, this family and all of their workers felt they had no choice but to put up with this behaviour. We asked them, 'Why didn't you raise these matters with the supervisor?' Their simple replies were, 'We couldn't; he was one of the men involved.'


They had no recourse on their own, but they wanted to join the union. They wanted to join the union so that together they could make a change at their workplace. So we set up a picket outside the factory. We went to the Industrial Relations Commission, where we were able to run an argument for these women and lay down the facts. The commissioner found that there was clear evidence that the workers wanted to join a union, that they had been discriminated against and that they should be protected. The commissioner enforced a code of conduct for the factory management and gave the female workers in particular comfort that there were avenues for recourse if they needed to go down that path in the future.


Clearly, power structures exist across a range of situations, across a range of worksites and across a range of organisations. It was untrue in this situation in George Town that there was a mentality or a value set whereby anyone could walk into their boss's office, raise issues of concern and be treated fairly. And it is untrue for many millions of Australians today.


Unions are the staff; they are the workers joining together to give themselves some bargaining power to give themselves some cover. If there had been a union at this factory providing a mechanism for the workers to raise issues and to be listened to fairly, some of the incidents might not have happened the second, third or 10th time. In fact, they might not have happened at all.


So what will this bill do for these people? It will do nothing. It is not designed to help them. It is designed to demonise working Australians. It is designed to put doubt into the minds of non-union workers about joining a union. It is designed to continue the campaign of fear and misinformation. When workers like these women need a union and are faced with a power imbalance at work they should feel comfortable in approaching their respective union for assistance.


As coalition senators speak in favour of this bill they ignore these stories. They continue to carry the torch of yesteryear in their battle of employers versus unions. In seeking to stoke the fires of the past, the Liberal government does not seek a conciliatory outcome. The Liberal government does not seek a middle ground or their so-called sensible centre. The Liberal government does not even care about the collateral damage to their own side—that is, the potential fall in membership of employer groups—in their blind pursuit to rid the country of organised labour and to throw the corporate veil across every aspect of our lives.


There have always been different regulations and legislation for registered organisations and corporations to reflect the differences in purpose and motivation of unions, employer groups and corporations. The facts are that under Labor the financial accountability standards applied to registered organisations, trade unions and employer groups had never been higher. The powers of the Fair Work Commission had never been stronger, and penalties had never been tougher.


There are already requirements in the legislation governing registered organisations for officers to act with care and diligence, to act in good faith, not to improperly use their position and not to improperly use information they have obtained through acting as a member of an organisation. As I have mentioned, as the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Shorten introduced significant reforms to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act in 2012. These reforms tripled penalties for breaches of the legislation; required that the rules of all registered organisations deal with disclosure of remuneration and pecuniary and financial interests; required that education and training be provided to officials of registered organisations about their governance and accounting obligations; and enhanced the investigative powers available to Fair Work Australia.


Without allowing time to test their effectiveness, those opposite simply seek to create fear in the community. Instead of allowing time for these changes to be bedded down, those opposite have mounted a weak argument for further change. In reality, this bill is a cruel backhanded attack on Australia's workers' rights to organise and to collectively bargain. Importantly, many of the changes introduced by Labor's reforms in our last term of government only came into effect at the start of this year. So this Liberal government, who dedicated so much energy in opposition to attacking sensible regulations, who promised repeatedly to cut the waste and who, upon coming to government, dedicated a whole day in the House of Representatives to ridding the country of regulations from before any of us were born, actually want to significantly increase the regulatory burden, leading to alleged increased costs and poorer services to members of employer groups and trade unions.


I participated in the Senate Education and Employment References Committee inquiry into this bill. The references committee really scrutinised the bill after significant flaws were highlighted during the legislation committee's inquiry. Of course, the Liberal government opposed the inquiry, and I note with interest the final three sentences of their dissenting report. The first states:


Coalition Senators are not surprised that union and employer organisation bosses aren't emphatically in support of this legislation.


This sentence highlights and concedes that the majority of submissions from trade unions and employer groups do not support the bill. However, the second and third sentences highlight the true intent of the bill and the collateral damage to the coalition's own base—employer groups. The sentences state:


That said, it is very clear that this reform is in the national interest and in the interests of honest union members who want to ensure that their money is being spent properly.


The only people that have anything to fear from this legislation are dodgy union bosses who do the wrong thing.


It is quite remarkable really. It reads as though there are many, many unions acting improperly with members' funds, but not one employer group.


Debate interrupted.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Assistant Minister for Health (Senator Nash) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to health funding.


The questions that were directed to Senator Nash today gave her the opportunity to restate the commitments made during the election campaign by the then opposition leader, now Prime Minister. I asked Senator Nash to restate Prime Minister Abbott's commitment that there would be 'no cuts to health' and that there would be no new taxes. Those are words that the now Prime Minister said over and over during the election campaign. 


Australians will be concerned that Minister Nash did not take the opportunity given her to reconfirm those election commitments. She did not say that there will be no cuts to health in tonight's budget. She did not say that there would be no new taxes. That opportunity was given to her and Australians can read that for what it actually is. Repeated requests from our Manager of Opposition Business for her to answer the question were not heeded. She did not say there would be no cuts to health. She did not say that there would be no new taxes. So it is reasonable for people to expect that tonight's budget will see a co-payment to attend the GP and also, potentially, a co-payment to attend the emergency department. That is policy designed because they know that as soon as you charge people on low incomes to go to the GP, with a co-payment, there will be an increased attendance rate at our emergency departments. This will be an absolute broken promise from Mr Abbott, who said there would be no cuts to health.


During the election campaign Mr Abbott also said that there would be no surprises and no excuses from this government. I suggest that in tonight's budget we will see a lot of surprises and a lot of excuses. Mr Abbott also said, 'This government will do what we have said we will do.' Mr Abbott said there would be no cuts to health. Well, we will see. He said there will be no new taxes. The truth is that a co-payment is a new tax. It is a new tax on attending the GP. Any cuts to Medicare Locals in the budget tonight will be a broken promise. Mr Abbott said absolutely clearly that there would be no change, no cuts, to Medicare Locals.


We know, from the research internationally, that if you put a co-payment on attendance at a GP the result will be lower attendances for preventative health scans. The people who should be most encouraged to go to the doctor will not be going to the doctor. We know there will be more attendances at emergency departments. So essentially it is just shifting the cost on to the states and territories. We know that there will be increases in chronic illness, with more cost to the health budget in the long term. Frankly, there will be lesser health outcomes for Australians.


Neither did Senator Nash take the opportunity to back up the bizarre reasoning of Mr Abbott's hand-picked adviser, the Chair of the Commission of Audit, Mr Tony Shepherd, when he said that Australians visit the GP 11 times a year. He also said he did not think we were that crook. I am not surprised, frankly, that Senator Nash did not back that up. Mr Shepherd exposed himself, when he made those comments, as a person who is certainly not a health economist. It also shows that in devising the audit report the group, under his chairpersonship, took no advice from those who do know: the health economists of our nation. It is of great concern that the government in the design of their budget has taken advice from someone who can do a division sum, who can divide the number of GP visits in the year by the population of the community. That is not the way you devise good health policy. That is not the way that you make good health policy for the future of our country.


Mr Abbott was wrong when he said, when he was the health minister, that the government of the day was the best friend that Medicare had. Tonight's budget will show once again Mr Abbott's ideological opposition to universal health care—health care that provides health equally to those who need it, irrespective of the size of their chequebook, so that anyone can attend the doctor when they need to. Tonight's budget will be a test of this government's ability to hold to their election commitments. (Time expired)

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2014-05-13,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (15:11):  Following on from what I can only describe as the hypocrisy of those opposite after the mess that Labor left us in health after six years in government, I would like to go to some of the more stark examples of what Labor's health mess was. I would remind those opposite of the words of Kevin Rudd back in August 2007:


When it comes to improving Australia's health and hospital system, as Prime Minister if elected, the buck will stop with me.


He said that the Rudd Labor government would seek to take financial control of Australia's 750 public hospitals if state and territory governments had failed to agree to a national health reform plan. He said that the blame game would end under him. But what did we see in these six years under Labor? We saw this so-called health reform. All that was really about was 'Dr' Rudd and 'Nurse' Roxon madly rushing from hospital to hospital around this countryside, dressed in white gowns, taking photo opportunity after photo opportunity, so it could all be posted on the MyHospitals website. One only has to listen to Ms Roxon's description of some of those visits to know just how stage-managed they all were. That is the legacy of those opposite.


We had the 10 new agencies—the new bodies under Labor, which diverted resources away from the front end, away from benefiting patients—and a whole lot of new bureaucracy so that the health portfolio ballooned by 27 per cent. And of course there were those famous GP superclinics. This is yet another example of Labor's waste and mismanagement, part of the mess they left us in health. Labor pumped $650 million into this ill-conceived program and at the same time pulled money from other areas of health, including subacute beds in public hospitals. Seven years after these so-called superclinics were promised, some are still not opened or even operational. The superclinic idea was all about helping Labor's candidates in marginal seats. It certainly was not about the patients. For many communities, the so-called 'superclinics'—and I put 'super' in inverted commas—remain nothing more than a dream in the distance. So our objective is to clean up Labor's mess. We will methodically assess Labor's programs and failures and make appropriate decisions about them.


Can I for the record correct Senator McLucas's incorrect comments in relation to Medicare Locals. Former Chief Medical Officer Professor John Horvath has carried out a review of Medicare Locals for the government and his report has been presented to the Minister for Health. The findings of that review are currently confidential and any release of that report will be a decision of the government. Of course, like many issues in the health portfolio, the review may be considered in the context of the budget and announcements may be made at an appropriate time. This is Labor's record on health, so it is sheer hypocrisy for Senator McLucas to come into this place and give us a lesson about health given the abysmal and appalling record that they left us in health.


I will make some general comments in relation to the Rudd-Gillard government's six years of chaos, waste and mismanagement, where they delivered higher taxes, record boat arrivals and debt and deficit as far as the eye can see. Labor inherited $20 billion in surplus. They have forgotten how to spell surplus, it has been so long since they last had a surplus. I think 1989 was the last time that Labor delivered a surplus to the Australian public, and they then left a projected $50 billion deficit—$50 billion in the bank projected into debt, well over $200 billion. This is the legacy of the mess that Labor left us. (Time expired)

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:16):  I rise on the motion to take note of the answers given by the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash, from questions asked by Senator McLucas in relation to the cuts and increased taxes slated for the health portfolio in tonight's budget. It is clear from the answers from all coalition government ministers today that tonight's budget will be full of broken promises, increased taxes and overblown rhetoric around a budget emergency that is their own creation, and it will be full of cuts to health, education and community services that will hurt the most disadvantaged Australians.


If tonight's budget includes a GP tax, this of course will clearly be a broken promise. A GP tax could cost Tasmanians around $150 million extra a year and a co-payment for PBS medicines could mean an extra $40 million from Tasmanians being spent on medicines. Tasmanians are already some of the lowest bulk-billed patients in the country and we are already paying more for health care. Yet, if you break down these costs on an average per person basis, as those opposite so love to do, it is around $400 per Tasmanian per year. Of course, those on fixed and low incomes, age pensioners, disability pensioners, single parents and veterans may have to visit the doctor more than the average and may rely on prescription medications for pain relief, for blood pressure or for chronic illness. It is these people who have the lowest capacity to pay. It is these people who will be unfairly targeted in tonight's cruel budget. 


It will be a budget full of broken promises, as Prime Minister Abbott seeks to find a way to pay for his overblown, unfair Paid Parental Leave scheme—a Paid Parental Leave scheme that will give $50,000 to very well-paid women to have a baby, a Paid Parental Leave scheme that will be paid for by cutting health services, by introducing a GP tax and increasing the co-payments for PBS medicines. This Paid Parental Leave scheme will overwhelmingly benefit very well-paid women while slugging those who happen to be sick with a tax while visiting the doctor and, on the way out, with an increase in the price of their medicine. It is a proposition that will hurt low-income Australians. It is a proposition that is so warped that it will actually discourage low-income Australians, as Senator McLucas said, from visiting the doctor and filling their prescriptions. It is a proposition from a Prime Minister and Treasurer whose priorities are so twisted that they have in fact doubled the deficit in just eight months. In just eight months, Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey have managed to add $68 billion to the budget deficit, create a so-called budget emergency by fiddling with assumptions and provide unnecessary grants to the Reserve Bank. They have not created a better Australia but provided a means to make severe cuts to health services and impose new costs on those least able to pay.


Last week, I met with senior staff from Tasmania Medicare Local to discuss their potential concerns with this budget. Senator Nash would do well to actually come to Tasmania and visit our Medicare Local before resorting to the talking points about duplication and waste. What I saw was an organisation that is extremely efficient at delivering primary health care across the state, keeping people out of hospital and providing e-health, after-hours general practice, population health research, mental health services and specific assistance for Aboriginal Tasmanians. The facts are that Tasmania's population is older than those of all the other states. Our population is ageing at a faster rate than other states. We have higher rates of chronic disease and the most dispersed population in the Commonwealth. Yet this Abbott government will tonight show no regard for Tasmania's health system difficulties. Tonight's budget will hurt Tasmanians in the hip pocket every time they get sick or every time their family gets sick. The budget will be full of the twisted priorities of Prime Minister Abbott and will not be about setting up the country for the future, as government senators said over and over during this question time.


This budget will take the Australian health system back to the pre-war era—that is, pre-war World War II—which was defined solely on your ability to pay, not if you were sick. The Australian community will not forgive this government for its broken promises on health and across the budget. Last week, I was contacted by a doctor in my home town of Ulverstone who said that she has previously worked in the US and seeing patients who had to pay was a dismal failure. She ended up diagnosing many advanced cancers— (Time expired)

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2014-05-13,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (15:21):  This is only my second speech in the Senate and I approach it with some trepidation. But I would like to thank the opposition for choosing the topic of broken promises, in particular broken promises in the area of health, because it has made my job just that much easier. Under Labor, we saw the health bureaucracy balloon while public hospitals, private health insurance, dental and other areas were cut. We saw $4 billion cut from private health insurance and $1 billion cut from dental health.


It should have come as no surprise to us, because in the area of promises we had a promise from the Labor government to indicate that they would be fiscal conservatives. They took a cash surplus legacy left to them in 2006-07 and took it to a $192 billion debt. One can only imagine what could have been done in the area of health services had that money being dedicated into that area, which it was not—it competed with reductions. Or, indeed, there are the $1 billion in debt payments that are made here on a monthly basis. That borrowing was an increase of 400 per cent in the first two years, and the borrowing in that area increased by 100 per cent each year. So in less than three years Labor borrowed $147,000 million which could have been put into health and we would not have any challenges to our spending program at the moment. Labor have shown me that they know more about tonight's budget than I do. It will be an interesting discussion tomorrow morning if some of the statements they have made in this place and outside this place do not come to fruition.


One of the things that is necessary for any government to be able to maintain the services they want to in meeting their duty of care to their constituency is to ensure that they have a strong economy. I am happy to have a discussion with the opposition, or anybody, in relation to the economic performance of a conservative government. The previous government under Howard and Costello inherited a debt of $96 billion and were able to dispose of that over the term of their government, leaving us at the time with a cash surplus, if my memory serves me correctly, in the order of $45 billion when Labor took over.


To keep health services well funded, one must be able to operate surpluses. If Labor want to talk about promises, let us talk about the promises of the surplus indicated for 2008-09—where we ended up with a $27 billion deficit. In 2009-10 we were promised that saving decisions would set us up on the path to surplus for 2015-16. Of course, we all know what the deficit is for 2015-16.


They talked about a strategy that would see the budget returned to surplus in three years' time. That statement was made in 2010-11. Well, in the three years' time the deficit was $47 billion. So it is appropriate to have a conversation about promises—promises on any level. The measures that might have to be taken in the budget today will be as the direct result of failed financial management over a long period of time. This was from a government that was headed by someone who I remember from one night when I had to rewind on my television—I heard Kevin Rudd indicate to Australians that he was a 'fiscal conservative'. I watched him with great interest from that period of time.


I think that there is quite a deal of hypocrisy for the opposition to start pre-empting an attack on our government, on the coalition, in terms of the management repairs that they have to do into the future. Might I end by saying that there was a wonderful saying by Walter Kirn in relation to hypocrisy:


Everyone loves a witch hunt as long as it's someone else's witch being hunted.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (15:26):  I too rise to take note of the answers to the questions asked of Senator Nash today and, particularly, the questions that I asked Senator Nash about the future of Medicare Locals.


There has been a bit of argy-bargy across the chamber this afternoon about the issue of broken promises. We are all very conscious of the campaign that the government ran during the election campaign and straight after, where the Prime Minister looked straight down the barrel of the camera and promised that there would be no broken promises, and that his was going to be a government for all Australians.


I suppose that the question that was asked today of Minister Nash really goes to the touchstone issue of health care in Australia. It is the concern that we, as parliamentarians, hear most when we are travelling around our states as senators or in our electorates as m members of parliament. That is, the fear and concern that our constituents have about having access to appropriate and timely health services—particularly if you are regional senator, like all of the members of the National Party sitting here today. They know the challenges there are in combining thin health markets, distance, access to services and particular populations that have particular health needs. I asked Minister Nash today about whether or not she actually supported the Murrumbidgee Medicare Local, which covers a population of almost 200,000 people across south-western New South Wales and across a geographic area of more than 100,000 square kilometres.


She was reluctant actually to commit her confidence to the work of the Medicare Local in Murrumbidgee, and that is a shame because they do an extraordinary job while challenged by some very important and difficult demographics. There is the fact of the density of 4.1 per cent of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations of Australia living in that region, as opposed to the national average of about 2½ per cent. So there are really important health challenges that the Murrumbidgee Medicare Local has very strategically and very cleverly made out to address by decreasing the rates of chronic disease and treatable and preventable mortality by expanding the current preventative health and chronic disease services and programs. These are really innovative and locally developed programs to address the specific needs of those communities. They have fantastic prenatal and antenatal services, outreach services that challenge the issues of distance across those regions.


When the government came in, the Australian Medicare Local Alliance issued a release which said the Australian Medicare Local Alliance welcomed the decision by Prime Minister-elect Tony Abbott to appoint Peter Dutton to the position of Minister for Health and welcomed Senator Fiona Nash as Assistant Minister for Health because she understands the issues affecting people in rural and remote communities and will be an asset in the health portfolio. She has an interest in equity of access to health services that taps right into what Medicare Locals are working to deliver across Australia. The Australian Medicare Local Alliance was also pleased that the federal government has continued to recognise the importance of mental health.


Medicare Locals have been systematically, across the country, addressing these issues and are now waiting with bated breath for the announcement of this budget. So trying to actually reassure the patients and participants in Medicare Local programs across the country that Medicare Locals are not for the chop is absolutely okay—they will survive the review and they will survive the budget. We fear greatly for Medicare Locals and we fear that the dislocation and the disruption to quality health care in the regions will suffer immensely from what we know are the Prime Minister's cuts to health.


Question agreed to.

The PRESIDENT

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (15:37):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 14 April 2014, of Brian Harradine, former senator for Tasmania, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Mr President, the Australian Senate was graced for 30 years by the presence of Senator Brian Harradine, a man of conviction, a man of principle, a man of integrity, a man of humility, dedication and self-giving love, a man of immense talent who committed his life to the service of others through his faith, through his family, through his many elected positions as a union man and a parliamentary representative for the state of Tasmania. He was rightly described by His Grace Archbishop Julian Porteous at the state funeral as a just man as described in chapter 4 of the Book of Wisdom.


Richard William Brian Harradine was born in Quorn, South Australia, in 1935, into what might be described as a typical Catholic Labor family with strong union links. Brian initially embarked on a religious career before working with the Commonwealth Railways and then the Postmaster-General's Department in Adelaide. Then, like his father, uncles and brothers, Brian became a union official. He joined the Federated Clerks Union and became a protege of John Maynes, who, during the 1950s played a leading role in the Australian Labor Party's industrial group known as Groupers, who took on the Left and especially the communists in a battle that resulted in a split in the ALP in Hobart in 1955 and which led to the formation of the Democratic Labor Party.


In 1959 Brian came to our home state of Tasmania as a union secretary. He first lived with the Noonan family, with Mick Noonan becoming a close friend and later Brian's campaign manager for each of his Senate election campaigns and, might I add, a very good and successful record. It was a period of struggle, suspicion and bitterness between the Left and Right factions of the ALP. In the 1950s Cold War atmosphere there were strong fears that communists were securing a significant foothold in the trade union movement to the detriment of Australia's national interest—a fear that history has shown was very well founded. Brian set up the shoppies union in Tasmania and was its president for many years even while a senator. They supported him and I noted that Joe de Bruyn, the national secretary of the shoppies, amongst many other luminaries from that union attended his funeral.


In 1964 Brian Harradine, who was regarded as a very capable right-wing union organiser, was elected secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council and to the ACTU executive, positions he held up until his election to the Senate in 1975. Brian Harradine served on the ACTU executive for 12 years, representing the Australian trade union movement overseas on many occasions. His election to these bodies was achieved against strong communist and left-wing opposition and came at a time when those forces were stepping up their campaign to capture control of vulnerable state branches of the ACTU. The political attacks made against him from those within the ALP were vicious, sustained and disingenuous and need to be seen within the Cold War context. 


When he topped a poll in 1968 to represent the Tasmanian ALP on the federal executive there was an immediate negative and nasty reaction amongst communist and left-wing forces. Brian's views and beliefs inevitably conflicted with those on the Left. So between 1968 and 1975 he was prevented from taking his seat on the federal executive of the ALP, whose factional composition was becoming more and more critical to Gough Whitlam's internal reform agenda. He stated at the time that he was prevented from taking his seat by that now very famous quote 'friends of the communists'. Brian Harradine sent a long statement to the then state president of the ALP, the late former Tasmanian Premier Bill Nielsen, alleging that, amongst other things: 'Friends of the communists intend to try and silence me. They know that on the federal executive I will support Gough Whitlam if he seeks an inquiry into the Victorian ALP executive.' When this statement was published it became the subject of debate on the ALP federal executive, leading to a showdown for the ALP parliamentary leadership between Gough Whitlam and Jim Cairns. Can I just say, as an aside, that if that was the choice facing me I too would have supported Gough Whitlam.


But despite strong campaigns against him between 1968 and 1975 by left-wing forces, Brian Harradine and his supporters consolidated their hold on the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council. Brian was even spied on from a cupboard by private investigators engaged by Ray Gietzelt and subsequently accused of attending a National Civic Council meeting in Sydney, a claim subsequently proven to be false. It was in fact an official ACTU subcommittee meeting and the official minutes proved Harradine right and his accusers wrong. Nevertheless, and in the face of the undisputed contradictory evidence, on 2 August 1975, on a motion moved by Bill Hartley, Brian Harradine was expelled from the ALP by a 9-8 vote, a decision described by the New South Wales delegate and a predecessor of yours, Mr President, Labor Senate President Kerry Sibraa, as a kangaroo court. His expulsion was reconfirmed at a subsequent federal ALP executive special meeting on 22 September 1975. The Prime Minister at the time, Gough Whitlam, stated that 'Harradine is a victim of perjured evidence'. The former Liberal Prime Minister, John Howard, described it in these terms: 'Brian Harradine did not leave the ALP; the ALP left him.'


The federal executive decided that Harradine's appeal against expulsion would be heard at the ALP federal conference in July 1977, but Harradine wanted to avoid any further damage to the state ALP, the party which he had been a member of since 1961. He decided that, in order to effectively continue his work on behalf of the people of Tasmania, he would stand for the Senate at the December 1975 election. Running as an Independent for the Brian Harradine Group he won 12.8 per cent of the primary vote and went on to be re-elected at the 1980, 1983, 1987, 1993 and 1998 elections—an unsurpassed record; the highest vote ever for a truly Independent candidate; and the longest stay of an Independent in this place. In his maiden speech in 1976, the now Senator Brian Harradine said:


Never have I had a desire to enter this place. But I am a trade unionist. I have been a full-time union official for over 17 years. That is my love; that was my life. I was committed to uplifting the poor, to championing the cause of the underprivileged … 


…   …   …


Why, then, am I here? I am here because, after years of constant, unremitting, relentless pressure being directed at me by the extreme Left coalition forces—


and I stress for Hansard here: small 'l' coalition—


It required a detour to be taken and it may be—I hope I am right—that I have found the highway upon which I can advance the objectives of the people that I represent; namely, the people of Tasmania.


And, as they say, the rest is history. His hopes were, without doubt, fully realised.


Brian holds the dual titles of being the longest-serving senator and longest-serving Independent senator in the Australian Senate. He was a senator for about 30 years, holding the balance of power on a number of occasions. He never abused this power and, in its exercise, was always guided by deeply held principles. Perhaps the greatest testament to Brian's integrity and achievement is that his exercise of this responsibility enhanced the respect in which he was held. Brian was the joint Father of the Senate from 1993 to 1999 and then singularly held that title from 1999 until his retirement in June 2005. Brian Harradine became identified with this title of Father of the Senate not just because of his fatherly demeanour but also, I am sure, because of the paternal role he personified in relation to the affairs of the nation.


He never compromised on his principles when dealing with legislation. His labour roots and his loyalty to the working class guided his decisions on industrial relations. He maintained a principled stand on issues such as the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death and same-sex marriage because of his commitment to the welfare of children. He strongly opposed stem cell research, pornography, the use of foreign aid for so-called family planning, as well as the Northern Territory's euthanasia legislation.


He demonstrated his political and negotiating skill during the 1998 Wik native title debate in the Senate, maintaining as best he could in that poisonous political atmosphere his strong commitment to Aboriginal rights and his care for Australia's Indigenous community. He wanted to avoid a race-based election in 1998 and his political judgement was demonstrated in arriving at an agreement with the Howard government which history will show was the best that could have been secured at that time.


Brian Harradine was intensely loyal to Tasmanians and he used his position in the Senate when the opportunity arose to benefit Tasmania. The partial sale of Telstra presented such an opportunity, and on two occasions—in 1996 and 1999—he was able to negotiate financial benefits for his home state without compromising his firmly held principle of majority public ownership. 


To the introduction of a GST in 1999, despite a mandate from the people at the 1998 election, he famously said that two-word sentence 'I cannot' to the Howard government, based on the loyalty he felt to working people. I confess I may or may not have entertained uncharitable thoughts about the good senator at that time but yet recognised his sincerity and that there was no hint of populism or cynicism in his decision; it was just pure sincerity. It helped imprint on me that men and women of good faith can come to differing conclusions on the issues of the day. Indeed, after he uttered those words 'I cannot', he said in the next paragraph in Hansard: 


I know my name will be mud, whichever way it goes, but it has been mud before today, and it will be mud again later on.


Today I can assure his family that his name is most definitely not mud; in fact, it is held in very high regard.


He was a great friend and champion of the Baltic states and the people from those countries. He supported their rights and independence—a role acknowledged by the Baltic community on his passing. Gough Whitlam's disastrous de jure recognition of the incorporation of the Baltic states into that evil empire of the USSR—as he did, might I add, with East Timor and Indonesia—left Brian Harradine very cold and a champion for the Baltic communities, especially in Tasmania.


Brian Harradine has been variously described as humble, intelligent, just, canny, wily, principled, complex, honourable, anticommunist, politically savvy, a fine orator and debater, the silver fox and one of the most capable and effective politicians of our time. I would not demur from any of those descriptions. In 2004 he was awarded the Papal distinction of Knight Commander of the Order of St Gregory the Great for his contribution to public life and public debate over many years.


The humility of the man was shown by the fact that he left instructions with his family that he was not to be eulogised at his funeral. I think his son Bede would make an exceptionally good black-letter lawyer because, in the order of service that we were given at the funeral service, there were some words of remembrance published, and his son Bede, with whom I contested student political elections at the University of Tasmania more years ago than both of us would care to remember, said this: 'He most certainly had no desire to be eulogised.' But then he went on to say: 'To my knowledge, however, the words ""Do not print any words of remembrance"" never passed Dad's lips.' And, therefore, he thought he could have a written eulogy without offending his father's wishes. But this is what he wrote about his father:


Brian Harradine, my father, was a humble man.  Throughout his life he never sought the praise of others. In death, he most certainly had no desire to be eulogised. As a family we are honouring his wish that the focus of the Mass of Christian Burial to be not on his life and legacy but, in the ancient Christian tradition, on prayer for his soul as it passes into eternity.


On the back of the Order of Service was a wonderful contemplative photo of Brian Harradine on one of his beloved bushwalks—a man who understood that you can actually support forestry, wilderness and bushwalking all at the same time. The verse that was under that contemplative picture was: 'What return can we make to the Lord for all His goodness to us?' And I have no doubt that that was one of the driving factors in Senator Brian Harradine's life.


But, above all, his commitment to his family was legendary. In 1962, Brian married Barbara Ward with whom he had six children: Bede, Gemma, Mary, Richard, David and Ann. He had only been a senator for five years when Barbara tragically passed away in 1980. In 1982, he married Marian, a widow and mother of seven children: Anthony, Paul, Fiona, Phillip, Nicola, Cushla and Benjamin—which of course made a great campaign team of 13 children.


So Brian Harradine leaves his wife Marian, 13 children and 38 grandchildren. Our condolences go to all of them. They are his legacy and a true reflection of all that he worked so hard for during his long and productive life. Allow me to again quote his son Bede: 'For family, he was far more than a man with a three-song piano repertoire who loved a game of cards and who once had a fifth share in a sixth-rate racehorse. He was a practical witness to self-giving love.' If anyone deserves eternal rest after this life of unrelenting principled battle, it is in fact Brian Harradine. So the card we were all handed at the state funeral was most apt when it said, under a picture of a smiling Brian Harradine: 'Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord,' and to that the coalition says, 'Amen.'

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:56):  On behalf of the opposition, I support the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and extend our condolences to Brian Harradine's widow, Marian, and to their children and extended family—and I understand that one of his daughters is present in the gallery today.


Brian Harradine retired from the Senate on 30 June 2005, having given three decades of service to this place as a senator for Tasmania. He was the longest serving Independent senator since Federation. Although Brian was a passionate Tasmanian, he was in fact born in South Australia. He began his lifelong love affair with Tasmania when he moved there in 1959. It is fair to say that that love was reciprocated—reflected not just in his election to the Senate in 1975, 1980, 1983, 1987, 1993 and 1998, but in the reaction by Tasmanians to his passing last month.


Before entering the Senate, Brian was a committed trade unionist. He was the secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council, and a member of the ACTU executive. Brian was a member of the Australian Labor Party until he and Labor had, shall we say—and described well by Senator Abetz—a parting of the ways in 1975.


In his inaugural speech on 25 February 1976 Brian said:


… I am a trade unionist. I have been a full time union official for over 17 years. That is my love; that was my life.


Brian may have left his life as a full-time union official behind in coming to this place, but he never lost his passion for the underprivileged or the disadvantaged. From the crossbenches, he was a powerful advocate for Tasmania and a champion for the causes in which he believed. He played critical roles in important debates and decisions in this place on such issues as native title and the privatisation of Telstra.


We also remember his opposition to the introduction of the goods and services tax. During the debate on the GST bills, Brian Harradine said this:


Decisions we make now on this issue are not for the next three years; we are making decisions here that will affect generations.


What Brian enunciated there during the GST debate was his approach to all legislation that came before this place. In the statement he issued announcing he would not be recontesting his seat, Brian reflected on his role as a senator in these terms:


I am particularly proud of the role I have played in promoting and defending the Senate not as a rubber stamp for the government of the day, but as a true house of review scrutinising and refining the laws under which we all live.


Brian Harradine did just that during the three decades in which he represented the people of Tasmania in this place.


I think some of the tributes described by Senator Abetz are very apt. 'The silver fox' is probably my favourite. He demonstrated that time and time again in negotiations with all parties. He always negotiated in good faith. I would say—from one of my previous roles—that I have always admired his decision to gain for Tasmania what was called 'fibring up the isle of Tasmania'. He negotiated to get government funding many years before the debate about fibre ever started, and he insisted on getting many benefits for Tasmania. But that far-sighted vision that he gained from the government demonstrated that not only did he mean what he said about getting policies over time; he delivered on getting policies over time. That fibre serves Tasmania well today and it will continue to serve Tasmania.


I say to all of us who served with him: it was a delight to deal with him. I was not as lucky as Senator Abetz to deal with him as regularly, but it was a great pleasure to discuss many, many matters with him—and, as always, some entertaining matters about the ALP's past.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:01):  I rise to support the motion, and I also rise to speak as a fellow senator reflecting on the enormous contribution made in this place by Brian Richard William Harradine, who was born in 1936 and who sadly passed away on 14 April 2014. I am sure that all of us here concur with the sentiment that a truly bright light was extinguished from private and public life on his passing. I offer my sincere condolences on behalf of the National Party and the government to his spouse and the rich legacy he leaves behind in his children, stepchildren and grandchildren.


I want to start off by noting that, as many have said, Mr Harradine was a humble man. His battles were never about seeking to draw attention to himself, even if political attention was never far from him. His battles were always about others, in keeping with his deep Christian beliefs and convictions. Whilst his views were not considered to have been fashionable by some, he has been universally respected on all sides of politics and beyond. This is because he followed his internal moral road map without wavering.


If I can draw on the words of our former Prime Minister, John Howard, who spoke at Brian Harradine's funeral. He said:


It's an indication that when you make a contribution to public life that's based on integrity, it crosses the political divide …


In an entry in The Companion to Tasmanian History, Wendy Rimon describes Mr Harradine as starting off as a 'union official and politician', even if this is not how most people remember him. This was prior to his parting with the Labor Party in 1975 because of his fierce anticommunist views and his association with social conservatives. After his departure from the Labor Party, the Father of the Senate, as he came to be called, served as an Independent—and there was no-one who was more fiercely independent in thought and conscience, as well as conduct, than Brian Harradine, serving in that capacity for 30 years, the longest-serving Independent senator since Federation.


While it is true that it is difficult to fully appreciate the profundity of his vision, and whilst I may not be able to do justice to the breadth of that vision, the common theme that informed all his battles in this place was a sense of community service. This was reflected in his commitment to the state of Tasmania as the patron of Tasmanian jobs and families, despite his having hailed originally from South Australia. It was no mean feat that he managed to secure a $350 million cash deal for Tasmania, which he negotiated in return for his vote on the partial sale of Telstra.


Of particular interest to me was his role in brokering the Wik native title agreement. He was pivotal in the Wik native title legislation because he feared an election based on race, something he could not countenance. And it should be remembered that it was not Mr Harradine who gave ground in those difficult and protracted negotiations; it was in fact the then government. Mr Harradine was not one to give ground when he firmly believed in something.


Mr Harradine was also a great negotiator, whether it was on the parliamentary stage or indeed in dealing with Indigenous people, for whom he had a deep respect and care. He was always motivated by securing their interests. He was not only the Father of the Senate but a father figure for the most vulnerable and marginalised in our society.


In this place he served on many committees, bringing to bear his indomitable style founded on conviction and hard work. As I noted earlier, it would be difficult to go through all his achievements in public life. In terms of his personal life, his devotion to his family and those closest to him was immeasurable. His authenticity is sadly missed. Frugal with himself, he was generous with everyone else. It should not, however, be forgotten that, for all his seriousness and dedication to his work, Mr Harradine did have a sense of humour, and this dry humour was invariably aimed at himself. It was a truly beguiling trait that a man with so much talent and power refused to take himself seriously.


Brian Harradine, may you rest in peace—a peace you justly deserve. Vale, gentle soul.

Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (16:05):  I rise today to support the motion and, as others have, to pay my respects to former senator Brian Harradine. Senator Harradine was a great man, a just man and a great Australian. Senator Harradine was one of my political role models. He represented his constituents, he fought for his state, and he stood up for what he believed in. He did so with compassion, grace and humility.


Senator Harradine's political career lasted three decades, and he sat in both this chamber and the old chamber. He successfully contested five elections. He was known as 'the Father of the Senate', which is an apt description for a great man. The people of Tasmania trusted the senator to represent them and deliver for them. He delivered time and time again. Senator Harradine's achievements are too numerous to list.


Senator Harradine believed in the sanctity of life. Through his negotiating, he ensured that Australian aid money was not spent running abortion clinics in Third World countries. He successfully blocked the abortion pill RU486 from being sold in Australia for many years. He also saved the lives of Chinese women and children who fled their country under the nation's one child policy. He stood up for the rights of workers. His background as a trade unionist served the people of Australia well, especially when it was his vote stopping the Howard government from passing draconian industrial relations laws. Senator Harradine was particularly proud of his role in brokering the Wik native title agreement, and rightfully so.


The few minutes I have here in this place cannot begin to do justice to the man Senator Harradine was. I would like to quote from the homily delivered at Senator Harradine's funeral by His Grace Archbishop Julian Porteous of Hobart. He said:


Brian worked tirelessly for the common good seeking to promote the conditions necessary for the advancement of individuals; he sought to protect the dignity of human life from conception to natural death. Brian Harradine recognised that politics ultimately should not be viewed in terms of parties but instead should recognise its role of service to the community. Brian provided a clear example of the role of someone in political service. His Catholic faith was the inspiration of what he did. It motivated and informed his actions. He did not seek to impose his beliefs but allowed his faith to provide the inspiration to his decisions and actions.


Senator Harradine was an inspiration. He truly was a public servant, not a public master. He put the common good back into the Commonwealth. Well done, good and faithful servant. You will be missed.

I suppose I knew him as well as anyone in this parliament knew him. Brian was elected as an Independent senator in 1975 and served in this parliament until his retirement. He had a passionate understanding not only for the blue-collar worker but for the underprivileged and the unborn. He was a person who really got a grip straightaway on how the system works.


I was young enough to remember that after the 1975 election there was a lot of ill-will against the sacking of the Labor Party. At that time the Labor Party in protest moved out of the parliament and left the opposition benches vacant. Senator Harradine went up and sat in the Leader of the Opposition's chair. He said to the people, 'If you walk out of the battleground and leave it uncontested, then I will represent the opposition.' He moved up and sat in that chair up there. I knew then that he was a skilled performer.


He was an Independent. He put in 30 years of service. I can remember the day he was standing there giving his address on native title and he fumbled. I could see that something was going wrong. He got through that speech with tenacity, and I believe that was the time that he realised that he had a minor problem.


Thirty years is a long time in politics. That is what his tour of duty was all about. He stood up as an Independent for Tasmania. I do not think anyone will ever again see an Independent or, in fact, another senator that used his leverage and pivot in the Senate with such great effect. He was an old-school politician who fought to get the best deal for his home state of Tasmania and, by gee, didn't he deliver. He was a devout catholic who opposed gay marriage. He campaigned against abortion, stem cell research, pornography, the Northern Territory euthanasia legislation and the use of foreign aid for family-planning purposes. I am proud to say that on all those occasions I stood with him. His abhorrence to China's forced adoption program was emphasised when he boycotted President Hu Jintao's address in parliament in 2003.


He remained loyal to his faith throughout his political career. He was a member of the Labor Party and he always had the Labor Party brand on him. You could always tell that is where his roots were: for the working man and woman. I recall one time when we were debating section 121C of the taxation act, which said that cooperatives could get a double tax break. I went to Brian and said, 'Brian, you've always believed in cooperatives. I want you to stand up and vote against our government,' and he did. We won 121C due to Brian Harradine. It is the only thing that keeps cooperatives viable at the moment. Rural Australia owes him a strong debt of thanks.


He was expelled from the Labor Party because he nominated some people as friends of communists. The Labor Party expelled him—what a terrible mistake that was. The Labor Party lost a man of conviction and courage; a truly decent man who championed the cause of the underprivileged, the vulnerable and the blue-collar worker. What a loss that the Labor Party could ill-afford. What a loss not to have him standing over there with the Labor Party. What a tragedy for the Labor Party. If he had been with them, I am sure that his wise counsel would have prevented them from going down some of the courses they took that were against the blue-collar worker.


Brian was beholden to no political party, and held firm to his values and beliefs. He applied those values to the issues that confronted him in the Senate. He was guided by three principles: the protection of human life; delivering for Tasmania; and minimising the impact on his beloved battlers. Harradine held the balance of power in the Senate during the Fraser government in the eighties and in the Howard government from 1996 to 1999. I know that wore heavily on him—he just wanted to be a feather duster again—and he was relieved when the balance of power was taken from his shoulders. He took responsibility for important legislation, and he did it very seriously. He had enormous pressure on his shoulders when he was the one vote that could swing the parliament. He was a wily negotiator. He was able to secure $353 million for Tasmania as part of the Telstra sale. Tasmania got $183 million as a result of Harradine's vote for T1 and $170 million for T2. I can remember standing here saying, 'Brian, if they put another telephone on that island, it will sink!' And we had a good laugh together. But he certainly delivered for Tasmania. He extracted so much for Tasmania during the Telstra debate.


I have a cartoon in which Brian was debating the Wik legislation and defending the Aborigines, and I was taking forward the voice of the graziers of Australia. The cartoon shows Harradine and me, stripped down to boxing shorts—he was a very thin man; I was pretty rotund at the time, and still am—and boxing gloves. I have still got that cartoon on the wall of my office. It shows us fighting for the people who we thought deserved a voice.


Brian was recognised by his beloved Catholic Church with the papal distinction of Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Gregory the Great. That was conferred in October 2004. He suffered a stroke in March 2005. I am not sure whether it was at that exact time that I saw him fumble his speech when he was debating on native title. He continued on, kept pressing forward, to reach out to the people of Tasmania. In his valedictory speech on 21 June 2005, he stated:


I have maintained that the true measure of our society and our civilisation is not how rich, powerful or technologically advanced we are. Simply, it is how we treat the weakest and most vulnerable among us. It underpins my unwavering defence of pro-life, pro-human values against the despondency of abortion and euthanasia.


Brian was one of the most formidable politicians I have ever worked with. He was a true Australian patriot guided by a deep love of country, its blue-collar workers, its Indigenous people and its natural heritage. I was sad to hear of his death on 14 April this year. On my annual pilgrimage to Tasmania I always called into his house. To Brian's wife, Marian, I say thank you for the hospitality, the cups of tea and the beautiful apricots—they have the most wonderful apricot tree in Tasmania. To Marian, to their children—Bede, Anthony, Gemma, Paul, Mary, Fiona, Richard, Phillip, Nicola, Ann, Cushla, David and Benjamin—and to their children, I express my deep sympathy on the loss of your beloved husband, father and grandfather. I doubt that we will ever see the likes of Brian Harradine in the Australian Senate again. He will be missed.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (16:20):  I join in relatively few condolence discussions, but this is one I think I should make a brief contribution to. I shared the last 10 years of Senator Brian Harradine's period in the Senate and I recall him with enormous fondness. We shared many things over that time. I would like to thank Senator Abetz for his contribution to this discussion; I think he covered the history and contribution of Senator Harradine to Australian public life with enormous respect. I would like to add some of my fondness and personal anecdotes to this discussion. The one principle that I saw Brian Harradine representing, and that I too was inspired by, was that of the common good across a very broad range of public policy issues. I too remember the day when Brian Harradine said, 'I cannot.' He supported progressive taxation; he saw the GST as regressive. In that role he had, with the balance of power in the Senate, he tried to see if there were ways to ameliorate its potential effects, but at the end of the day he said, 'I cannot.'


Brian dealt with an enormous range of issues over that time. For most of that 10 years, as the Labor Party spokesperson on workplace relations matters, I worked with him across a range of those issues in the Senate. And I share Senator Scullion's recollections of Senator Harradine's humour and dry wit.


Brian Harradine and I shared offices nearby. We shared babies; my own, and his staff's. We shared the atmosphere here in the parliament that can often seem to all of us a bit like boarding school. His humour and his wit were those things that help lighten some of the stresses of life here. His passion and commitment to public life, his level of astuteness, his tenacity both to his political adversaries and with respect to his health are all important things to note. But Brian Harradine balanced that passion with his skills, his tenacity and his judgement. 


I can recall one day—I cannot recall the debate—standing pretty much in this position as the shadow minister at the time, and he walked past me. He had obviously been listening to the debate up in his office as he came down to the chamber. As he walked past me he gestured—I was being passionate but maybe a bit too much—that I might want to tone it down just that little bit. I think that reflection highlights that whilst Senator Brian Harradine was an Independent, he was indeed father of the Senate. He could proffer support, advice and guidance not only to the crossbenchers but also to those of us within the major parties participating in debates and discussions here. I recall Senator Harradine with great fondness and I note this place has been quite different since his absence. He struggled with his health for a number of years. I would like to thank Marianand his family for the support that they have provided to him over many, many years and share with them their loss. Thank you.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia) (16:24):  I rise to express my condolences on the passing of former Senator Harradine and especially to pass on my condolences to his wife Marian, their 13 children, and their grandchildren. I had the privilege of attending Brian's funeral a couple of weeks ago at the cathedral in Hobart. It was an absolutely terrific send-off for a very great Australian. 


He is best known as a Tasmanian, but of course, he was not in fact a Tasmanian; he was a South Australian. He grew up in the mid-north of South Australia, one of the most austere parts of the country. He left that part of the world, that dry and arid region in the mid-north of South Australia, to go down to Tasmania, a very verdant and lush environment. So it was quite a different world. As Senator McEwen would recall, he went down there as an official of the Federated Clerks Union. From that position, he eventually became the Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council down in Tasmania. As a number of people have referred to, he was expelled from the Labor Party in 1975, but then ran as an Independent and won successive elections for the next 30 years. 


He did hold the balance of power at a number of crucial times. We have heard about the role that he played in rejecting the GST. He understood the regressive nature of that tax. He was under enormous pressure from the Howard government to back the introduction of the tax, and of course, he very correctly and courageously rejected that tax. We subsequently saw the consequences for the Australian Democrats when they did support that tax. We saw what happened to them. There is no doubt in my mind that Senator Harradine made the correct decision. 


But there was one other issue that he played a crucial role in. Although he started out as an official of the Federated Clerks Union, he ended up as the President of the Tasmanian branch of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association—that great union. Not only did he serve as president, but he was also on the national council of that organisation for many decades. In 1975, that union was under great challenge by the New South Wales branch of the union. A fellow called Barry Egan had amalgamated the shop assistants' union in that state with the Building Workers Industrial Union, and was in the process of devouring each of the branches of the union. Brian used his position in the balance of power in the Fraser government to ensure that the New South Wales branch could not achieve that takeover of that union. One can imagine how different the Labor movement would be had Brian not stepped in and intervened at that time. 


It was very sad occasion to see Brian pass away. I was at the funeral as were his sister Joan and her daughterChrista. It was a sad occasion, but I think Brian would have absolutely loved the celebration afterwards at the Glenorchy racetrack. It was terrific to be there with all of his friends, including Paul Griffin, the current Secretary of the Tasmanian branch of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employee's Union, and with all of his family. I want to pass on my deepest condolences to his wife Marian and all of his children.

The PRESIDENT
 (16:29):  Before putting the condolence motion, I rise briefly to offer my deepest sympathies to Marian and the family on behalf of my wife Sue and myself. I express our disappointment at missing his funeral because of a personal commitment. As is obvious, I knew Brian over a long period of time and, of course, had formed a friendship independent of this place but based on my involvement with the SDA and his involvement with the SDA. Whilst we did not come together very often, I did respect the man and what he stood for. He will be sadly missed in life by his family.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (16:38):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table the explanatory memorandum and have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Greens have long opposed calls for the reintroduction of cattle into Victoria's Alpine National Park. The last attempt was in January 2011. In that trial, the Victorian Government allowed 400 cattle into the park across several sites. In that case, the Federal government intervened to put an end to the program.


We are now having the same debate again. The reintroduction of cattle to the park has been done once more under the guise of a trial into the fire reduction effects, but this time with Federal Government approval. This is disingenuous at best. There is no scientific uncertainty around the issue. There is no evidence to support this move as a fire abatement program. The scientific consensus is clear, that the damage the cattle are doing to a fragile ecosystem puts the lie to any discussion of the trial being for the benefit of the national park.


The real debate is about the extent to which we should protect our natural environment. The Greens give Australia's wonderful natural environment the benefit of the doubt. We ascribe a very high value to biodiversity, the preservation of wilderness, and preserving areas of natural beauty for all to enjoy. This is not an attitude shared by the current Victorian or Federal governments. Rather, they see Australia's environment as a resource to be exploited. Rather than ask, ""Why should we risk damage to this unique part of Victoria?"" they ask, ""Why should this resource be locked away? How can we extract economic value from it?"" To them, ""biodiversity"" is just a word, a piece of jargon used by environmentalists in their attempts to impede progress. It can all be lumped under the banner of ""green tape"" and dismissed.


This trial, and the damage it will cause to Alpine National Park, is an example of this philosophy. It is symbolic of this Government's attitude to the environment as a whole. 


This Bill is required to prevent that damage and do what the Minister himself should have done—protect the national park. Unfortunately legal protection for national parks cannot be taken for granted. The EBPC Act is the best tool we have at present to bring about this protection.


I encourage Senators to turn their minds to what exactly the EPBC Act does. It does not protect the whole of the natural environment. It singles out matters of national environmental significance. That is, it identifies those parts of our common natural inheritance which are so precious, or so fragile, that the Federal Government must protect them. It chooses the best of the best. The species and ecological communities protected by this Bill are some of those very matters. 


From among the best of the best, the EPBC says ""only where there is a significant impact"" on one of these matters will the Federal Government step in. This is an example of just such a significant impact. 


Our national environmental laws are woefully weak, but here is an example of where they can and should swing into action. 


This Bill amends the EPBC Act and deems a referral regarding alpine grazing to have been made by the Victorian government and rejected by the Minister. It is a last resort—a legislative backstop—but it is necessary if the Minister will not act of his own accord.


We still have time to limit the damage caused by this act of contempt for Victoria's environment. 


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:39):  What we will see this evening is a budget of broken promises—broken promises on tax, broken promises on health, broken promises on education and broken promises on pensions. During the election campaign, the now Prime Minister could hardly make a public comment without mentioning taxes. At a doorstop on 6 August 2013 he said:


Taxes will always be lower under a Coalition government.


At another event, on 9 August 2013, he said, and I am quoting directly:


The only party which is going to increase taxes after the election is the Labor Party.


Two days later, when he was asked specifically what taxes he proposed to raise, he said:


The only party that will raise taxes after the election is the Labor Party.


Wrong. All wrong. Running through tonight's budget will be increases in taxes. Running through tonight's budget will be new taxes and new charges.


What do we know so far? We know that income taxes are going up. We know that petrol prices will go up, with the government set to do a deal with the Greens to increase fuel excise. Where are all the cries from Senator Abetz today? Every time an Australian goes to the petrol station, they are going to be slugged thanks to the Prime Minister. We know that every time someone sees a doctor they will be slugged with a GP tax. We know that when someone goes to a hospital they will be slugged with a hospital tax. We know that every time Australians get their wallets out Prime Minister Abbott's hand will be in there, too, taking his cut. So much for Mr Abbott's pre-election promise to run a no-surprises, no-excuses government.


Let us have a look at some more pre-election quotes from the Prime Minister.


A coalition government will keep the current income tax thresholds …


Wrong. Here is a quote:


… no one's personal tax will go up …


Wrong. Here is another one:


What you'll get under us are tax cuts without new taxes.


Wrong again. None of these quotes is ambiguous. There are no weasel words here. No, the weasel words are coming now. We have heard a lot of weasel words in recent weeks—weasel words like those of the Prime Minister in his appearance on the Neil Mitchell radio show, and weasel words like those telling Neil Mitchell that hitting Australians with higher taxes would not be a broken promise. This is what the Prime Minister said:


I think if there was a permanent increase in taxation that would certainly be inconsistent with the sort of things that were said before the election.


How about the Treasurer on Channel 9 on Sunday?


We never said we were going to never change a tax or alter a tax.


Perhaps Mr Hockey and Mr Abbott did not talk to each other during that election campaign, or he did not see Mr Abbott on any of the TVs every single night. Weasel words are what we have before us today and we will be hearing lots more of them in the coming days, as the coalition scrambles to explain all of the Prime Minister's broken promises.


How about another quote from the Prime Minister, this time from the day before the election. Here it is: 'No cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.' The only promise in there so far that is not going to be broken tonight is 'no change to the GST'. But let's not take Mr Abbott at his word on that one; let's take them one by one. 


Education is set to be cut. The pre-election unity ticket, as Mr Abbott described it, on Gonski has been ripped up post election. Young Australians will be paying more for their higher education and they will have to repay their HECS sooner. As I have already outlined, if you want to go to the doctor, under the Abbott government you will have to pay a GP tax. The universality of Medicare, one of the great Australian institutions, is being trashed by the Prime Minister and the coalition. Only a couple of months ago in February, the Prime Minister claimed he was not going to bring in a GP tax. Just in February he told the parliament, 'There is no such tax planned.' Tonight he will deliver it. Medicare Locals are said to be axed, despite the Prime Minister's pre-election promise that they would not be touched. I have it here in black and white: 'We are not shutting any Medicare Locals.' There will be cuts and closures for Medicare Locals tonight.


On pensions, we know that the pension age will be increased to 70. Mr Abbott really is in favour of working till you drop. It has never been truer than tonight—we will see that Australians will have to work till they drop. We are seeing reports of changes to the indexation of pensions. Before the election, it was 'no changes to pensions'. After the election, it is less money for pensioners and work till you drop. Yet again, another broken promise. It is not over the top to suggest that the cigar-chomping Treasurer and the Minister for Finance do not have a clue about what it is like for a brickie, a nurse or a cleaner to work until they are 70. For the brickie, for the nurse and for the cleaner this budget is all pain and no purpose. 


We know that the government's attacks on the ABC and SBS will continue with both organisations set to face the budget knife. I wonder how the coalition partners, the Nationals, the doormats, are going to feel about regional radio services being in the firing line thanks to their Liberal Party colleagues. The Nationals are continuing their tradition of rolling over and not standing up for their constituents. 


This will be a budget of broken promises. This is a government that made so many promises that it is just becoming one big rolling broken promise. They are a government of new and increasing taxes. They are a government of cuts. They are a government that have deceived Australians. They are a government that will hurt hardworking Australian families. This is not the government that they promised they would be. This is not the 'no surprises government'. This is not the 'no tax increases government'. When all of those opposite, possibly even including yourself, Acting Deputy President Fawcett, get your speaking notes tonight, you will not be quoting any of those statements from the now Prime Minister before the election. You will not have them on your sheets. You will be standing here trying to pretend it is all somebody else's fault. You dodgied-up the numbers for the deficit and this is your excuse for these cuts.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (16:49):  I congratulate Senator Conroy and the Labor Party on their crystal ball. I congratulate him on his capacity to know what is in tonight's budget and to so roundly condemn it before he has even seen it. But I condemn rather than congratulate Senator Conroy and the Australian Labor Party for the mess they have left, for their management over the last six years and for the reality that the circumstances we seek to address in tonight's budget are largely of the Labor Party's making as a result of their own neglect, their own mismanagement, their own waste and their own failure to deal with the challenges Australia faces not just in the next couple of years but in the next 10, 20, 30 and 40 years, well into the future. Australians voted at the last election, having heard the now Prime Minister say on no fewer than 30 occasions that, as a government, we would end the waste, we would stop the boats, we would build the roads of the 21st century and we would get the budget back on track.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You missed a few, Simon.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Exactly those four commitments were given in exactly that way, Senator Collins, time and time again on no fewer than 30 occasions during the election campaign by the now Prime Minister. That is exactly what our government are seeking to do and that is exactly what tonight's budget will continue to do. We have already been working to end the waste and tonight's budget will provide further demonstration of a government committed to having a public service and a level of government expenditure that deliver what is required but does so as efficiently and effectively as possible.


We have implemented policies to stop the boats, and stop they have. We are building the roads of the 21st century, and we will see tonight more detail on those infrastructure promises, our delivery of those roads. In particular, in my home state—and our home state, Mr Acting Deputy President Fawcett—I warmly welcome the indication that we will proceed with two stages of upgrades over the next four years to the north-south connector to the South Road. And we will see delivery of the Darlington Upgrade Project and the Torrens to Torrens upgrade; vital infrastructure that will improve both the productivity and the lifestyle of so many people in South Australia.


Most significantly on this budget day, tonight Australians will see that we are honouring that commitment given to get the budget back on track. They will see that we are taking hard decisions; decisions that we take no pleasure in making but that we make because they are the right decisions for Australia's future and that we make because they honour our commitment to get the budget back on track. It will stand as a stark contrast to the six years of hollow rhetoric that we heard during the six Labor budgets are preceded this one.


Let us go back over that rhetoric and the associated outcome. In 2008-09 Treasurer Swan stood up and said in his budget speech:


… it is a surplus built on disciplined spending, …


The outcome was not a surplus but a $27 billion deficit.


The next year, in 2009-10, he said about their savings that:


They will put us on the path to surplus by 2015-16.


That year, he handed down a budget deficit of $54.5 billion.


The next year, in 2010, and again in his budget speech, Treasurer Swan said:


… a strategy that will see the budget return to surplus in three years time, …


That year, he delivered a $47.5 billion deficit.


The next year—the fourth of the Swan budgets—in 2011-12, he said:


We will be back in the black by 2012-13, on time, as promised.


That year he delivered a $43.4 billion deficit.


In the fifth of the Swan budgets, in 2012-13, he said:


This budget delivers a surplus this coming year, on time, as promised, and surpluses each year after that, …


It resulted in an $18.8 billion deficit for 2012-13, the year, of course, that he first promised that we would be back in surplus by.


And then, for the 2013-14 financial year, when Treasurer Swan handed down that budget—his last budget—he said:


This budget sets a sensible pathway to surplus, …


The projected outcome according to the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook statement is a $47 billion deficit.


In every single one of Wayne Swan's budget speeches he spoke about delivering a surplus or returning to surplus. And on every single occasion it was nothing more than hollow rhetoric. On every single occasion it resulted in more deficits, and deficits as far as the eye can see. The previous government delivered five record budget deficits. They turned a $20 billion surplus into $191 billion worth of cumulative deficits and, indeed, the projections under MYEFO are for a further $123 billion in deficits over the next four years. And without change to policy settings, Australia will see gross debt grow out to $667 billion. Of course, this is unacceptable; of course, things have to change and, of course, we have to take action to deliver on our commitment to get the budget back under control.


Tonight's budget will include a range of policy measures. There will be short-term measures that have an immediate impact to try to bring down the projected deficits over the next few years. There will be medium-term measures and there will be long-term structural measures that deal with the great challenges Australia faces in tackling an ageing population and a declining proportion of the population in the workforce—challenges that, if left untackled as they were by the previous government, will create significant problems for the next generation of taxpayers. They will find that there are around 30 per cent fewer taxpayers to support a greater number of non-working Australians.


We could, like the previous government, be driven by polls and driven by focus groups. We could do that, and not take the hard decisions, but we will not shirk those hard decisions. We will make sure that we take them so that future taxpayers do not have to take even harder decisions. Because that is what we have seen overseas: when you ignore tough decisions, let deficits blow out and continue to balloon into greater debt and even greater debt, eventually you do not get to take decisions that just change the way entitlements or policies work in a very graduated and careful way. You suddenly find you have to take hard, rash decisions—like cutting the actual level of pension entitlements instantly. That is not the circumstance that we want to see any future Australian government put in, and that is why we will take the difficult decisions now for the long-term future of Australia.


It is why we will get on with delivering a budget that is fair and that gets the budget back under control. I want to make this important point, because Senator Conroy spent some time on it: a budget that does reduce the tax burden for Australians. This budget will do that. This budget will ensure that there is less tax take than would otherwise have been the case. The reason for that is because we are fulfilling our commitments to get rid of bad taxes, like the carbon tax and the mining tax. The average Australian household will be better off as a result of the suite of budget measures that we are introducing. They will be better off to the tune of some $550 per annum as a result of the abolition of the carbon tax. These are meaningful changes that will make the cost of living better for Australians.


People will not always welcome every other measure that is in the budget, but taken in its totality—as people will be able to do after tonight, rather than act like Senator Conroy did on a whole lot of speculation—people will be able to see a plan for a stronger Australia; an Australia that delivers a fair outcome from this budget and sets it up for a prosperous economic future.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2014-05-13,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (16:59):  Paul Keating once said that when you change the government, you change the country. On the eve of the first budget, those words have never been more relevant. The Abbott government has already—to use the Prime Minister's words—stamped its authority on nearly every aspect of Australian life, whether it be winding back action on climate change, demonising refugees, challenging the independence of the ABC or dismantling laws that protect Australians from racial vilification. In a few short months, this government has changed the very fabric of Australian society. In recent months there has been a lot of talk about debt and deficit, and about the ongoing budget emergency. No claim has been too outrageous. If you were to believe the rhetoric from the Treasurer, we are on track for a disaster to compare with the Great Depression or with modern-day Greece; we are a country that is on track to default with our debt; and we are an international pariah with a Third World economy.


Last year the Treasurer went as far as to say, 'The cupboard is bare; there is no money left in the till.' He effectively declared the Australian nation bankrupt. I understand that in politics perception is everything—I get that. In this piece of theatre, the nation's finances are effectively being used as a political bludgeon. While it might serve the government's purposes, it is a piece of political theatre that does not serve the country well. Federal budgets have an enormous impact on people's lives: whether you can go to the doctor, whether you can afford a decent education for your kids; what happens to someone if they become unemployed; and whether people are going to have enough for their retirement are all issues that are dealt with in the nation's budget. The government believes it is necessary to outsource those tasks to big business, that these are questions for the market, not the government, and that lower taxes and lower spending are the only pathway to prosperity. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, these are articles of faith for the coalition.


We have a very different view. It is a bit more nuanced and it does not fit into a three-word slogan but it is a vision that says everybody, regardless of the size of their wallet, regardless of whether or not they were born with a genetic disease deserves access to decent health care. It is a vision that says every kid in this country should get a decent education. It is a vision that says we need to protect our natural environment and we need to get on with the challenge of tackling climate change.


We understand that sometimes markets work well and are the best way to achieve these tasks. We also understand that there is often a role for government. Far from being inherently evil, taxation is the price we pay for a civilised society. Taxes are health care, taxes are education, and taxes are trains and roads. How much we tax matters much less than the quality of our tax spend. The difficulty for the coalition is that when you get beyond these simple slogans and sound bites and you put these competing visions to the Australian community, what you discover is the current government's agenda is deeply unpopular. It is unpopular because it benefits those with wealth and privilege ahead of ordinary people who rely on those services. And that is why those opposite have had to tell this misleading story about the nation's economy. It is why they created the piece of political theatre that was the National Commission of Audit. To get the answers they wanted, they hand-picked the actors—effectively a Who's Who of corporate Australia—and they wrote the script. The script goes something like this: 'We've got a structural deficit. The only way we can fix it is by drastically cutting government expenditure. We've got huge debt. We've got to reduce it urgently and we've got to make deep cuts.' The best place to start, of course, is on those services that Australians rely on—health care, education, supports for people with disabilities.


The Greens established an inquiry into the Commission of Audit, because we would not buy the lie. We heard evidence through that inquiry from academics, from unions, from economists and from business groups across the country, and they told a very different story: that Australia's debt crisis is a fabrication; that Australia's level of public debt is amongst the lowest in the OECD; and that, far from being a crisis, we have an economy that is the envy of the world. Those experts challenged the falsehood of Australia's high taxation levels. Far from being an economy that is shackled with high taxes, our tax take as a percentage of GDP is low by world standards and well below the OECD average.


What we heard was a simple proposition: it is not how much you tax; it is what you do with those taxes that matters. That brings us to those public services that we deliver in the form of universal health care, in the form of education, in the form of supports for people who are down and out and in the form of supports for people who have disabilities. We have learnt that we deliver those services very efficiently. When it comes to health care, we have one of the most efficient healthcare systems in the world as a proportion of GDP. We spend about nine per cent of our GDP on health care. Compare that to the US, which spends double what we spend and gets much worse health outcomes. Yet, in this budget, on the back of the recommendations from the Commission of Audit, we have a prescription for a US style health system. If ever there was a triumph of ideology over evidence, this is it. When you look at our Public Service, what we see is that, following years of public sector cuts, there is no more low-hanging fruit. Cuts to the Public Service mean cuts to services, pure and simple.


That is not to say we do not have long-term challenges; we do. Over the next 50 years, we will have challenges that we need to start addressing. But the Senate Select Committee into the Abbott Government's Commission of Audit inquiry heard very clearly that if we do have a structural problem within the budget, the problem is on the revenue side of the equation, that we have had inadequate investment in infrastructure, in training and in education, which are the real long-term threats to our global competitiveness. If we simply cut services we are doing nothing about the underlying structural problems within the Australian economy. Just recently the Secretary of the Treasury, Martin Parkinson, expressed a similar view, that if we are going to meet our commitments to provide these critical services we cannot ignore the issue of government revenue. And what better place to start, if we are serious about the end of the 'age of entitlement', the end of corporate welfare, than by abolishing the huge handouts that go to rent-seeking industries in the economy? What about the cheap fuel that Gina Rinehart and the mining industry get in the form of the diesel fuel rebate? Rather than investing billions into the private health insurance sector, why not invest that directly into public health? Let us have a big debate about the issue of tax concessions in this country like the huge concessions that go to superannuation and other sectors of the economy. It might not appear on the annual budget figures, but we do know that these enormous tax expenditures cost us billions and strip money away from the services that Australians want. If we are serious about addressing these long-term challenges, we cannot afford to ignore the huge handouts that go to big business and other areas of the economy that do nothing except widen the huge gap in this country between the haves and the have-nots.


In the end the budget is about this simple proposition: what is the measure of a decent, caring society? What is it that defines the Australia that we want to live in? In the view of the Greens it is straightforward. We want a quality healthcare system that everyone can afford, not just those people on high incomes. We want every child in this country to be able to access a decent education and to further their prospects through universities. We do not want to see a huge gap between the rich and the poor and we want to see our natural environment protected. We do not subscribe to this dog-eat-dog agenda of this government. We do not want a world where it is everyone for themselves and where if you are lucky enough to be born into wealth and privilege, good luck to you, you deserve more of it and, if not, tough luck. That is why we will be here fighting every minute of every day to make sure that these changes in the budget that affect ordinary Australians do not see the light of day.

"Tillem, Sen Mehmet",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Senator TILLEM
 (Victoria) (17:09):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. There can be no more important issue than tonight's budget. I am not quite sure what the budget lock-up is all about today, because the government have already told us they are going to break their election promises. Using the Commission of Audit as cover, they will break their promises on health, they will break their promises on education and they will break their promises on no new taxes. They also promised that when it came to education funding both sides of politics were, to quote the member for Sturt, 'on a unity ticket'. 


This government has taken all of eight months to break its word to the Australian people. Quite simply put, it will betray the Australian people. Government is about priorities and we will see tonight that this government's priorities are about ripping the heart out of families, universal health care and education. Those who will be hit hardest are working families, the socially disadvantaged and the elderly. These are the people who need to have trust in their government to put them first. Working families are set to be slugged with an increase in their fuel bills while having family tax benefits stripped away. This comes from a government that before the election said it was committed to easing cost-of-living pressures. Its promises to the Australian people were hollow.


They have now shown their true colours, at the expense of ordinary Australians. Increases in the cost of petrol will affect ordinary Australians more than any other group. Taking the kids to school, doing the shopping, going to the footy on the weekends—these will cost more under the government, and at the same time tax concessions in the form of family tax benefits will be stripped away. These initiatives were designed specifically to ease the pressure on working families' budgets. Families will be betrayed in this budget. How can deliberately hitting the hip pocket of families help? How does that show any level of understanding for the pressures they face every day? It is becoming clearer and clearer every day that the rhetoric of those opposite before the election was just empty words. Those opposite believe that they owe people nothing and that they can get away with breaking their promises to minimise cost-of-living pressures. Those opposite promised they would ease the squeeze on family budgets. This will be a broken promise tonight.


In the budget tonight, in the firing line is the health system. Bulk-billing is good public health policy. It encourages people to seek out primary care through their GPs when in need of medical consultation rather than burden hospitals. The values which underpin the arrangements of bulk-billing through Medicare are that health care should never be determined by how much money you have in your wallet. We live in a community where quality health care is made available to all citizens. It is a vital part of our social wage that has created a fairer, healthier, more productive and more cohesive community. Yet this government is determined to wind back bulk-billing of GPs. This budget will see the introduction of a fee-for-service component when ordinary Australians visit their local doctor, and we know that once this government sets in train a system of co-payments for GPs this will be the beginning of the end for Medicare. The government believes that access to health care for all Australians is a privilege and not an entitlement. The co-payment system set to be introduced will only funnel more Australians into hospital emergency rooms. This policy will increase the strain on our hospitals, making them more expensive and less efficient to run. Those doing it toughest in our society will be hit harder than most. Wealth should never dictate the right to access quality health care.


But nothing can expose this government's class war on ordinary Australians more clearly than the axe to education that will most likely be brought down in tonight's budget. What we can expect tonight are cuts to skills and hikes on student loans. We have a skills shortage in Australia, yet this government has decided that support for vocational learning is no longer a priority. Instead, it has become a target for the ruthless commitment to cutbacks and twisted priorities. Australian families whose children wish to embark on a trade will no longer receive the support they did under Labor. Indeed, it has been reported in Fairfax papers today that this government intends to abolish Commonwealth incentive payments to apprentices, worth $5½ thousand each. These payments were designed to assist apprentices as they begin their journey of gaining accreditation in a given trade. But, under this government, apprentices and their families are on their own. Governments should be here to assist and help the aspirations of ordinary citizens, not place roadblocks in front of them and discourage them.


Another nasty floated in the lead-up to the budget has been an increase on interest payments made on student loans. The success of our loans system is that debts accrued by students are financed at low levels of interest. Raising these interest payments will once again affect those less able to afford them. Students have to study for longer than ever as youth unemployment squeezes school and university leavers. Now not only will students have to study for longer than ever but, under this government, they will also have to pay more than ever.


Australians will be forced to work longer than ever and will have their access to pensions restricted. Australians who pay their taxes year after year will no longer be afforded the social wage that should be the hallmark of a prosperous society. After being knocked from pillar to post year after year by the actions of this government, Australians will wind up being tossed onto the social scrapheap. This government does not care about ordinary Australians. It is a government that will be judged as a government that broke promise after promise after promise—'No new taxes, no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no changes to the pension.' The silence in this chamber is astonishing, with no-one here to defend the government and its broken promises.


The Liberal and National parties have pontificated for too long in this chamber about the virtues of trust and honesty—and today we will see that the cupboard is bare. They embarked on a strategy of slogans and mistruths at the time of the election in order to get elected and in less than eight months what we have seen is a complete reversal. They will talk about budget bottom lines. They will talk about a crisis—which they have imagined. They will talk about the need to get the bottom line back to where it should be. The reality is that this government will be judged and should be judged on its broken promises. These broken promises will be remembered by pensioners, those who go to their doctor and those who go to university. They will be remembered by every single Australian who was given a commitment by this government and who have now been let down. 


Today the government have been exposed to the Australian people for what they are. Tonight they will be shown as an untrustworthy government whose broken promises are endemic of their ideological opposition to fairness for all Australians.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2014-05-13,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:19):  Like my colleague, Senator Birmingham, I do find it curious that those on the other side seem to have an in-depth knowledge of what we are going to hear about tonight.




Senator Tillem:
  We read about it.




Senator BUSHBY:
  You've read about it? Well, you have done very well. I have a copy here of the Treasurer's budget speech and I am going to read some excerpts from it. I am sure you will find this very interesting. I will just read a few bits and pieces. I quote:


Our predecessors had Australia on a path of deficit and debt to the next century.


Make no mistake, this path would only make future choices harder, future possibilities bleaker and rob Australians of the future opportunities they deserve.


Our Government could not stand back and ignore the problem. Although we did not create it, we will take the responsibility to fix it.


The measures I announce tonight will reduce the underlying deficit by around $4 billion this year and $7.2 billion over two years. These measures will balance the budget over the term of this Parliament. These are the net effect on the budget bottom line after the introduction of new policy to meet the Coalition's election commitments. These measures represent a historic turnaround in Commonwealth finances.


The speech goes on to say:


Mr Speaker—


and that is a hint there, 'Mr Speaker'—


you don't turn around a nation's finances, a nation's future without making some hard decisions. But if we avoid the hard decisions now they are only going to get harder in the future.


The tightening measures have to be fairly shared. We cannot expect those who rely on pensions and allowances—low income earners—to bear the cost. So we are asking high income earners to make a contribution and business to make its contribution too.


The measures are balanced, strong and fair.


Of course, that Treasurer speech is not the speech that will be delivered tonight. It was speech that was delivered by the member for Higgins in respect of the 1996-97 budget year. But it is a speech that could be delivered tonight, because the words of that speech very accurately reflect the challenge that we face now—that being that, if we do not address the challenges that we currently face in our fiscal position, the consequences down the track will be far more severe, as Senator Birmingham mentioned in his comments.


During the 2007 election campaign I was travelling around campaigning with my colleagues in the Senate team. We went to a restaurant and we met a waiter, and the waiter said to us, in the context of the then election, that he saw the two major parties in this way: 'When things are good and you feel like you've got a bit of money and it's all very comfortable, you throw a party and you invite everybody around and you drink and you eat and you trash the house and you make a huge mess, and you wake up the next morning and you've got a massive hangover and the house is horribly trashed and it's a real mess, and you look around and you say, ""Well, the Labor Party threw a good party, but we need to get the Liberals in to clean it up.""' I think that is what we saw in 1996. We had to get John Howard and Peter Costello in to address the mess that was the legacy of the Hawke-Keating years—particularly the Keating years. And it is what we see now, with the budget that we are facing tonight. We have got a horrible fiscal mess following the party that the Labor Party threw with reckless abandon, spending money on things that just do not deliver any outcomes for the people of Australia, and leaving a huge fiscal hole that needs to be plugged. And tonight that is what we will try to do. We will actually deal with the mess that Labor left us.


This is not something that we want to do. The decisions that will be in the budget tonight—and, unlike the Labor Party, I am not completely au fait with what we will hear tonight, and I look forward to hearing it—represent the bitter medicine that is needed to avoid further consequences of the disease that Labor left us. They are not something that we necessarily want to do. But this is something that we were elected to do. We were elected to fix this problem.


We would much rather have inherited a situation like the Labor Party did in 2007 where we were in surplus on an annual basis, we had money in the bank, and things were very comfortable. That is one of the main reasons why we compare so well with other countries now: we started so far ahead of them. There are other reasons, but that is one of the main reasons. Unfortunately, we did not inherit that situation. We inherited a situation very similar to that which the Howard-Costello government inherited in 1996, and we again face the challenge of having to address that problem—to clean up after the party that the Labor Party threw.


Senator Di Natale also mentioned that he thought that the Commission of Audit was a piece of theatre. Well, the committee that he referred to was set up, stacked with opposition and Green members. Because it had the numbers, it decided who the witnesses were. It decided when the hearing dates were. It set the findings in the reports. It was even quorate without any government senators being there, so it could hold meetings when and where it wanted to and if coalition senators could not make it then it did not matter—they could just proceed anyway. I suggest that the only reason that that committee was set up was as a piece of theatre.


The National Commission of Audit was a serious attempt to actually examine all lines of spending of the government, with a view to seeing where savings could be made. It made recommendations to the government—and I guess we will find out tonight which of those recommendations, if any, have been accepted. But, in terms of a piece of theatre, I have never seen anything more theatrical than the select committee that was set up to look at that. It spent months examining the Commission of Audit that had been set up, when no findings had been released. It was purely there to run a scare campaign: highlighting all sorts of things that it might find needed to be cut and then scaring the people who might be affected. Talk about theatre! That was it.


Senator Di Natale also mentioned how we compare with other comparable nations. This is very interesting to me. They look at our percentage of debt to GDP, and they say, 'Look—we are so much better off than other nations.' Ignoring the fact that when Labor came into government in 2007 we had no debt, the fact is that, yes, we might compare well with other nations—if we have 13 per cent of debt to GDP and they have 30 per cent, then we compare better to them—but if they were at 60 per cent, would it be okay to have a debt-to-GDP ratio of 30 per cent? If they were at 90 per cent, would it be okay for us to have a debt-to-GDP ratio of 60 per cent?


It is not about the relativities; it is about the absolutes. And the absolutes show that if we have the debt that we currently have, we are going to be paying $12 billion worth of interest every year. That is $1 billion of interest a month, and that comes at a huge opportunity cost. That is hundreds of billions of dollars we are going, largely, overseas to borrow, and $12 billion that we are sending overseas to pay the interest on that debt. That is $12 billion that we are not spending on the types of things that Senator Di Natale outlined: the very worthwhile projects that all Australians think that government should deliver. But we are still taking that $12 billion. We are taxing people to pay interest on debt.


Twelve billion dollars is a massive amount of money. It is equivalent to around half of Australia's defence budget. It is around the same amount that the government spends on aged care. So the same amount that we are spending on aged care annually we are, because of decisions that the Labor Party and the Greens made when they were in government, currently paying in interest and sending overseas, largely to people who we had borrowed money from—the same amount of money that we spend on aged care annually. It is also more than the government spends on universities. I heard Senator Tillem talking about what may or may not be in the budget tonight affecting education. Well, I will tell you what: we could fund education a lot better if we were not sending $12 billion a year in interest to people who we had borrowed money from during the Labor-Green years, every year.


Also, the concerning thing about our relative position is the trajectory of the rate of growth of debt. The International Monetary Fund recently found that Australia's spending is projected to grow faster than any of the 17 advanced economies profiled. So if you are looking at comparing Australia to any of those other 17 advanced economies, and you say, 'Our debt-to-GDP ratio is nowhere near as bad as theirs,' we are growing faster than they are and we are catching them. A lot of those countries have actually decreased their debt in recent years at the same time as we are rapidly increasing it. In the absence of any decisions such as those that we are likely to make tonight, that debt will continue to grow rapidly at a rate that puts us in a position where, within 10 years or so, we will owe three-quarters of a trillion dollars in debt, and that $12 billion of interest that we are paying is likely to be three or four times that amount—up to $50-odd billion that we will be paying in interest. So that is money that we take off Australian taxpayers and we send off somewhere else before we can spend one dollar on delivering services to Australians. To me, that is not the best use of taxpayers' money. I would rather be spending taxpayers' money delivering the services that Australians want and need.


And if we do not make the tough decisions early, we are going to have to make far tougher, far more draconian, far deeper cuts in order to be able to deliver those services. As I said before, we need to take the medicine now to deal with the problems that we are likely to have. Even if that medicine tastes a bit bitter tonight, it is going to taste a lot better than the consequences of the disease that will result if we allow our debt position to continue to get larger and larger, along the trajectory that we are currently facing. Just bear in mind that in the 1980s Greece had roughly the debt-to-GDP ratio that we have now.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (17:29):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. In just under two hours, we are going to finally see unveiled the Abbott government's budget of broken promises. Throughout the election campaign, voters were given promise after promise by the then opposition leader, Tony Abbott, who went so far as to say, hours out from the last federal election:


No cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions … no cuts to the ABC or SBS.


Voters put their trust in Mr Abbott and in his words when they elected him as the Prime Minister of Australia. But the Prime Minister today will reveal that he has abused the trust of the Australian people.


Voters who took Mr Abbott at his words have been duped. They have been misled. Mr Abbott made promises during the election campaign that will not be kept this evening. The public will be the victims of this deceit, and if the leaks about the budget are accurate, if what has been strategically dropped by the government in media stories over the past week is true, then, frankly, the Prime Minister has not kept his word and the Prime Minister in those cases has lied to the Australian public.


The rules of debate in this chamber do not permit me to use offensive words against either house or member, but I suspect there will be many people who took Mr Abbott at his word, who gave him their trust, who gave him their vote, who have every right to be offended by him today. I suspect some of the offensive words will be used by those voters tonight as the Abbott government breaks promise after promise in its budget. Tonight we are going to hear Mr Abbott break his promise to our elderly pensioners, to young families sending their kids to our schools and hospitals and to the people who rely on our public broadcasters.


Voters may have been jaded by the choices facing them at the ballot last September, but they have every right to be outraged by the duplicity of Tony Abbott—




Senator Williams:
  Mr Abbott!




Senator DASTYARI:
  Mr Abbott—and his deception, his dishonesty and his fraudulence if the claims that have been strategically dropped to the media are true. With all due respect to our Prime Minister, even the News Corp press have stood up this week to call him out for what is a litany of broken promises. Even his friends and the Prime Minister's supporters are shocked by the lies that have been used to coax voters to cast their ballots—the promises that, it now appears, are not going to be kept. We have heard repeatedly in the media of members of both the coalition's backbench and cabinet who are disgusted by the duplicity, the deception and the dishonesty of what has been said. We have heard that members are calling coalition MPs to remind them that this is not what they signed up for.


This is not governing the country with integrity. The very idea of fairness that is a foundation of Australian culture and society is something that Mr Abbott used again and again during his campaign. He told us he was going to be the most fair dinkum Prime Minister we have had. But the Prime Minister has not been fair to his party colleagues. He has not been fair to his organisation. And, more importantly, he has not been fair to Australian voters. He has violated the trust that he was instilled with, and he does not deserve their confidence.


Australians are about to receive a budget that no-one thought they would be getting and that they were told would not be the case. Not even in the most cynical corners of the Liberal Party were they expecting what is going to be unveiled tonight. Tonight we will receive the Abbott government's first budget of broken promises, a budget that is built on duplicity, on deception, on dishonesty and on lies. When our kids stop going to the doctor for check-ups, Australian voters will remember that that was not something they voted for. When our grandparents, our parents and people of my generation are working until 70, they will remember that that was not something that Tony Abbott promised. (Time expired)

Senator WILLIAMS:
  Yes, you would wonder how they get in. Imagine if she spoke in her sleep, Senator Smith. It would be never-ending. We could put some microphones there and just broadcast to everyone in Canberra. What an exciting night it would be! They would dream about budget surpluses. The Labor Party in their wildest dreams: 'We will deliver a surplus.' Remember the former Treasurer, Mr Wayne Swan: 'We will deliver a budget surplus.' You do not know what the word means. Look up 'surplus'. It does not mean red ink; it means black ink. You do not understand what it means.


We went to the election saying we would stop the boats. We have not had a boat in 20 weeks. In fact, the billions of dollars that the previous government cost our taxpayers, along with the more than 1,100 people who lost their lives from a crazy policy, were an absolute disgrace. We said we would do away with the mining tax and the carbon tax. Senator Tillem said, 'This is a cost on families.' You lot over there are costing every family in Australia $550 a year because you will not support the abolition of the carbon tax and respect the mandate that the coalition were elected on last September. We said we would get the books in order.


I make no apology that it is going to be a tough budget tonight. I am quite prepared to pay some more, as I should. There is the contribution to Medicare. Perhaps Senator Lines disagrees with me. Three weeks ago I had my glaucoma pressure tested. I am one of the roughly 300,000 in Australia who has glaucoma. I walked in to the optometrist and had a quick test of the pressure—the new drug is working very well; 15 drops in each eye; very good—and I walked out. I did not pay a red cent. Isn't it amazing! I am on a salary of $200,000 a year and do not pay a red cent. Shouldn't I pay $15? Shouldn't I pay $20? Shouldn't I make some contribution to the government's budget of Medicare and the cost of health in this country? I walked out scot-free, and that is wrong. If we continue down this road of your financial destruction, there will be no Medicare, there will be no hospitals and you will send us broke.


I had to laugh when Senator Di Natale said, 'Compared to other OECD countries, we're in pretty good shape.' It is like living in a street: I owe $300,000 on my house, but things are pretty good because the person next door owes $400,000 and the other person next door owes $500,000. What they owe does not help me pay my debt of $300,000. The sum of $12,000 million a year goes to interest alone. You inherited a government debt free. Remember former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Treasurer Wayne Swan's first budget. There was a $22 billion surplus. It ended up being a massive deficit. You built $191 billion of government debt in the time you were there. All my life I have seen it, whether it is state governments or the federal government: put Labor in power and they empty the cheque account and we wallow in debt. Who is going to make the hard decisions? We did not make the mess. You made the mess and we will clean it up for the benefit of future Australians instead of mortgaging our children and grandchildren's futures away, because you are financial messes. You have done it all my life when I have followed how you manage money. You could not manage a circus. Your fiscal management is an absolute disgrace. Tonight will be the turning point where Australia will start heading in the right direction because of a courageous budget. (Time expired)

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (20:02):  I rise tonight to talk about Youth Connections. Last Friday, I had the pleasure of meeting 17-year-old Tanika, who lives south of Hobart. I met with Tanika to talk about her experience of the vital Youth Connections program which has been provided by Colony 47 in Tasmania since 2010. Tanika was referred to the Youth Connections program by Centrelink. She was in year 11 and was not attending school because of the challenges for her within the school environment. Tanika met Anita, from Colony 47, and her life was transformed. Anita was able to talk to Tanika one-on-one about her future. Tanika said she wanted to work in aged care, and Anita was able to point her in the right direction and explain how she could study and work too. Tanika is now enrolled in a Certificate III in Aged Care and has been successful in obtaining voluntary work in that field. Tanika told me that the Youth Connections program had helped her achieve more than she ever could have achieved on her own. She said:


I'm finally getting a chance at the education I've always wanted. Before that, it was too hard. It's made a big impact on my life, in lots of ways. Everything is starting to fall into place now. I'm really glad Centrelink referred me to Youth Connections. I've been able to think about what I'm good at and what I really want to do. I'm going to do my training in aged care and all my family are really proud of me.


Tanika is a wonderful young woman who came across some challenges that made her very vulnerable to dropping out of education and training. This Youth Connections program has managed to help and support her in a way she never thought possible. But Tanika is not alone. Over 400 vulnerable or at-risk young Tasmanians like Tanika have accessed support through Youth Connections. Youth Connections was set up by Labor in 2010 to make sure young people do not drop out of school and end up unemployed or dependent on welfare.


Since 2010, Labor has funded Youth Connections, partnership brokers and career development services—investing more than $700 million over five years. Up to the end of last year, Youth Connections had given almost 75,000 young people the hand-up they needed. Labor designed these youth services to stop young people who have not completed year 12 from falling between the cracks. If someone drops out of school because of family problems, or any other reason, it is vital to make sure they get a second chance. We know how important it is to finish year 12; it reduces the risk of unemployment and leads to getting more highly paid jobs.


If young people drop out of school it can affect their lives forever. Youth Connections has had a great success rate, with 80 per cent of people who access these services being still in education or employment after two years. Colony 47 CEO Therese Taylor told me that Youth Connections has already supported over 400 young people in Tasmania to improve and expand their connection to education. Colony 47 has also provided support for students moving from primary to high school and newly arrived refugees.


But now we have to ensure that this service is not cut by the budget that we have heard tonight. This budget, unfortunately, will go down in history as an assault on young Australians, particularly those who are disadvantaged and at risk. Youth Connections is an incredibly successful program. It will cost Australia more in unemployment benefits, justice and social services if this program is cut. At a time of rising youth unemployment, cutting this— (Time expired)
