"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-03-15,"—I rise to speak in this debate on the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999 and to indicate my support to the already indicated support of the opposition for the bill. I am speaking on this debate partly prompted by the speech made by Senator Tambling the day before yesterday in this place. I happened to be the duty shadow minister for the opposition in the chamber while Senator Tambling made his speech, and I felt that there were so many offensive things about his speech that, at the very least, some of the issues he raised and the way he raised them should be responded to. But broader than that, this is a very important bill on a very important principle which I think senators on all sides should express their view on.
In 1991 I had the honour to be the founding chairperson of the Australian Parliamentary Human Rights Committee. I was invited to address the National Press Club on our first report, which was made public. I remember getting a question from a journalist, after I had spoken to the report, asking whether I believed the mandatory law passed in Western Australia at that time was in contravention of our international human rights obligations. I simply said yes—a very short answer but the correct answer. I have not changed my view about the law in Western Australia and I certainly believe the law in the Northern Territory is even more stark in the way it not only contravenes our international human rights obligations but also offends any notion of fairness in the way we should conduct our affairs in a First World democracy that has a long and proud tradition of democratic rights for individuals and the rule of law.
First of all, I do not accept the arguments put by Senator Tambling and other apologists for the Northern Territory government that we can ignore our international obligations. It is clear from the very succinctly written Senate report on this bill—and I congratulate the senators who prepared the report—that this law in the Northern Territory most certainly contravenes our international obligations. And, of course, they point out that the federal parliament is the body that has the right to make declarations, to carry resolutions and to pass legislation to accept our obligations internationally and to accept United Nations covenants and conventions. The report makes it clear that the Northern Territory legislation contravenes this absolutely.
It is also clear from the report that there is now a well established precedent in Australia that the federal parliament can overrule the laws of the Northern Territory. That principle was clearly established by the Prime Minister's action barely three years ago when he allowed legislation to be introduced to overrule the Northern Territory's legislation on euthanasia, which was not in any way contravening—as I am aware of it—any of our international obligations. He just did not like the legislation, so he approved some of his own backbenchers introducing legislation. He said it could be a conscience vote but knew that, because of the balance of numbers at that time after the very successful 1996 election result, he had the numbers on a conscience vote to force it through the parliament, which—unfortunately from my point of view—he did. I accepted at the time and have never argued that constitutionally the federal parliament has the power to intervene in Northern Territory legislation. That is in our Constitution. I just disagreed with the way it was cynically used by the Prime Minister when it suited him on that occasion.
He established the precedent. Now he has no argument and the Liberal Party has no argument that we are not able to intervene and that this is an interference in state or territory rights. They established the precedent, and now we have a piece of legislation before us that, even more importantly than the euthanasia bill in this parliament of nearly three years ago, is in accordance with our international obligations and which the federal parliament should express a view about. So I find it in one sense a delicious irony that the Prime Minister is now confronted with a revolt in his own party about this Northern Territory legislation and is now going to have to deal with it. I hope there are—as indicated in press reports today—at least seven members of the Liberal Party in the lower house who have the courage, and I would admire their courage, to cross the floor and vote with the opposition when the bill reaches the lower house, so that the bill can be carried. 
But I now want to return to the speech of Senator Tambling, the senator representing the Country Liberal Party from the Northern Territory. Senator Tambling in all of his remarks in defending the Northern Territory mandatory sentencing legislation not once referred to the very tragic circumstances of the Wurramarrba boy who committed suicide after being sentenced to, I think, a year's jail for an extremely minor property offence. I think at the time he was charged with stealing a small amount of property that would have been worth no more than a couple of dollars. It might not have even been worth that. A year apparently was his sentence.
At the same time, we have had corporate crooks in Australia either getting suspended sentences, not going to jail or paying some fine—getting away with robbing shareholders of literally hundreds of millions of dollars. Only last week, Mr Bond was released from jail following a ruling by the High Court, on a legal technicality, to reduce his sentence to three years. He was convicted of stealing over $1 billion from Australian shareholders, the biggest property offence in Australia's history. He gets three years and is released on a technicality, and all the accounts in the press say they believe that he and his family have squirreled away many tens of millions of dollars of the money he stole from his shareholders, which he will now have access to in one way or the other, and the people who lost their money will not have any chance to get any of that money back. If it is three years for $1 billion but one year for a couple of dollars worth of property, it just shows why a lot of Australian people find the imbalance in these offences so troubling. Of course, we do not find in the Northern Territory that there is any mandatory sentence for white-collar crime, for company directors.
—You can strangle journalists and you don't go to jail.
—Thank you, Senator Conroy. We noticed that a former minister tried to strangle a journalist because he disagreed with the question. He had to resign from the party in the end, I understand.
—But not over that.
—No, it was probably some other thing he fell out with his party over. But he got away with making an assault on a journalist, physically attacking him, and did not go to jail—no mandatory sentence for that in the Northern Territory. No mandatory sentence in the Northern Territory for corporate—
—What about Gareth Evans threatening to garrotte someone in the chamber?
—Senator Campbell, I have to say that you only have to say the words `Bronwyn Bishop' and that is an outstanding defence. Even you would agree with it.
 (Senator Crowley)—Senator Schacht, give Mrs Bishop her proper title.
—Mrs Bishop. I called her Bronwyn Bishop; the honourable member in the House of Representatives. However, I want to return to Senator Tambling's speech. There was no mention whatsoever in his speech about the imbalance between a teenage Aboriginal boy going to jail for absolutely minor property offences and what other people can get away with and not go to jail—for physical assault, which can result in a suspended sentence; for white-collar crime. If there was any consistency in the Northern Territory government they would be having mandatory sentences on those crimes. But we know they will not do that. The mandatory sentencing legislation in the Northern Territory in particular is designed to appeal to the most base motives: political purposes and to whip up hysteria to divert attention away from the shortcomings of the Northern Territory government. 
As I listened to Senator Tambling's speech I was, first of all, disgusted that he made no mention of the tragic circumstances of the Wurramarrba boy committing suicide—no mention; not even a suggestion of an apology to the relatives, to the family; this was just completely ignored. That is why this issue is before us—because, unfortunately, a teenage boy committed suicide in jail. Senator Tambling, in defending the Northern Territory, said, `We don't want meddlesome people from the southern states telling us what to do.' On issues such as human rights—and this is a human rights issue—this parliament and this chamber have again and again passed motions in respect of which a number of countries around the world that do not have democratic governments immediately have said, `Don't meddle in our internal affairs.'
As I said at the beginning of my speech, I was the first chairman of the Human Rights Committee of the Australian Parliament. We made representations again and again on human rights issues all around the world. Again, some people said we were a bunch of do-gooders, but those representations were in accordance with the principles of democratic government, of individual political human rights, and this parliament has expressed those concerns strongly. For example, I do not know how many times this chamber has carried resolutions supporting human rights and political rights for the Tibetan people. We have carried resolutions in this chamber. When I raised this matter on behalf of this parliament when leading a human rights delegation to China and Tibet in 1991, guess what the answer was? `Don't interfere in the internal affairs of China or Tibet. It is an internal issue. The rest of the world has no right to express an opinion.' And that is exactly what Senator Tambling is claiming—that no-one else outside the Northern Territory has got the right to express a view about what is fundamentally a human rights issue.
—He didn't say that at all.
—You read the speech, Senator Campbell.
—He didn't say you can't express an opinion, you dope.
—Read the speech. He bags the Labor Party. He even bags members of your party. This is what Senator Tambling said—
—Where does it say you can't express an opinion? You liar.
—Order! Senator Schacht.
—He said:
It amazes me, and I am sad to say disgusts me, that interfering, humbugging, busybodies from southern states cannot understand—
—Order, Senator Schacht! Senator Campbell, you will withdraw your remarks, please.
—Which ones in particular, Madam Acting Deputy President?
—You know full well which remarks. I let the first one go, but you will certainly withdraw them please. They are unparliamentary.
—Senator Schacht was misrepresenting Senator Tambling. At no stage did he say that people from the southern states can't express an opinion.
—You have no capacity to debate it, Senator.
—I think Senator Schacht should apologise to Senator Tambling. Of course, because you have ruled so, I will unconditionally withdraw any remark which offends against the standing orders. 
—Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I certainly stand by my comments about the thrust of what Senator Tambling was saying. Again and again, Senator Tambling has complained that this is interference. I have to say that that is bad luck for Senator Tambling and for the Northern Territory government. A number of us are going to interfere when we see a human rights abuse taking place, and this is clearly a human rights abuse. We cannot be hypocritical in this place and carry resolutions condemning human rights abuses all around the world and then, when it is identified that we have one in the Northern Territory, not carry resolutions or make our view known. We weaken our position to defend human rights elsewhere in the world when we run dead, run scared or give way to this narrow view of state rights.
I have to say that Senator Tambling and the other apologists for the Northern Territory government have proved to me that they are the heirs or the successors to those people over the last few hundred years in the British parliament and elsewhere. The same sort of speech that he made was made by those people who defended the retention of slavery 150 years ago and the retention of child labour 100 years ago. They were the people who 80 years ago said that women should not have the vote. This is the argument that he puts up to say that there is no right to interfere or express a view when, clearly, a human right has been breached. That is why I was disgusted by the tenor of the remarks of Senator Tambling and other apologists. It is time for this parliament, and it is quite appropriate for this chamber, to carry the legislation moved by Senator Brown. I hope there are at least seven courageous people in the Liberal Party in the lower house who will enable the bill to be put through there.
Until mandatory sentencing legislation is removed, our position to be able to go around the world to argue, quite rightly, about whether there are human rights abuses in other countries will be weakened. No country has a perfect record; we always have our problems. I have to say that this country is, by and large, bipartisan on many of these issues of human rights. We have raised them consistently. But I have to say that I find it demeaning that we now have to take action in this place to defend Australia's reputation against what is happening, particularly in the Northern Territory. Senator Tambling's last great defence was that it is democratic—there was a democratic vote in the Northern Territory and we should ignore any other issue and just accept that there was a duly elected government. As I just pointed out, there were duly elected majorities in the English parliament 300 or 400 years ago that actually supported the retention of serfdom; 250 years ago a majority of the English parliament was in favour of retaining the slave trade; 150 years ago a parliamentary majority was elected that favoured child labour being used in Great Britain; and 100 years ago a majority of the English parliament was against giving women the vote.
—Fifty years ago the Schacht family were part of the Nazi regime.
—But there were some individual members of parliament who said that, despite the majority of what the—
 (Senator Crowley)—Order! Senator Campbell, you will withdraw that remark.
—You will have to advise me very clearly what remark is unparliamentary in anything I have said by way of interjection, when you have this poor apology of a senator trying to link Senator Tambling to the slave trade of 300 years ago.
—Senator, I asked you to withdraw the reference to Senator Schacht's family being part of the Nazi regime. Please withdraw that remark.
—It is a historical fact; he knows that. He was the treasurer in the Third Reich.
—Senator, will you withdraw? 
—No. Does Senator Schacht take offence at that? Is it unparliamentary?
—Senator Campbell, I have asked you to withdraw that remark. If you don't, we will have to proceed. Would you please withdraw that remark.
 (Senator George Campbell)—Does Senator Schacht take offence at it or is it unparliamentary? Is he going to apologise to Senator Tambling for saying that he supports the slave trade?
—It is unparliamentary, Senator—it is as simple as that. Please withdraw that remark.
—If you rule that that is unparliamentary, of course I will withdraw. Do you rule that it is unparliamentary for Senator Schacht to say that Senator Tambling supports the slave trade, as he has clearly inferred on two occasions?
—Senator, this is not the time for you to debate the points raised or any conclusions that you draw from Senator Schacht's remarks.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I have never really objected to anyone calling me what they like in this place. I have to just point out to Senator Campbell that both my mother and father served in the Australian Defence Force in the Second World War. My father served 4½ years in Egypt and Italy fighting the Nazis, so I think that more than indicates where my family stands on the view of Nazi Germany, et cetera.
What I was saying, and I say it again, is that the import of Senator Tambling's remarks and the view that he philosophically put is, `You leave us alone in the Northern Territory because this is popular.' I was pointing out that, historically, others have claimed that of all the other great social issues of the British parliament, the predecessor to this parliament—others have claimed that same view for the slave trade, child labour, refusing women votes and any other social reforms. But, fortunately, there were one or two members of the British parliament at that time who stood up and argued the case to say that this had to change because it was an abuse of human rights. We are saying that the Northern Territory legislation is an abuse of human rights and that this parliament has a constitutional right to knock that legislation over. I hope the parliament of Australia shows the courage to do that—to get rid of this obnoxious piece of legislation that should be knocked over and removed from the statute books of the Northern Territory. I also think the Western Australian legislation should go as well, even though it is not quite as obnoxious in its practice, as the committee reported. But it is true that when you make speeches in this place—appealing to redneck populism as the basis of what Senator Tambling said—then some of us are going to stand up and knock it on the head. If you want to go back philosophically and read your Edmund Burke, you will find that members of parliament are here as representatives to have a wider range of views than just to automatically reflect what is the most populist view at the last second they spoke to somebody. That is what true liberalism was supposed to be about, Senator Campbell, but you gave up on that a long time ago. 
This is a very important piece of legislation. If this legislation is not carried by the Australian parliament, we will have a stain on our reputation of promoting human rights not only in Australia but around the world. I commend the bill to the Senate. I express my absolute support for it and hope that by the end of this week at least the Senate will have shown that Australia has got a decent reputation on human rights.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2000-03-15,"—I rise to support this bill today. In doing so, I am not going to traverse the arguments that have been canvassed at length in this debate so far, but there are a couple of issues that I want to put on the record in this debate. I see the mandatory sentencing law as an unfortunate consequence of the society in which we live today. It is unfortunately the only response that our society can come up with to the problems that confront it. It impinges upon the dignity of the individual who finds themselves incarcerated as a result of mandatory sentencing. As one of my other colleagues has pointed out, some of this occurs because of the inactivity of the people in the judiciary, but that is not the issue that I am going to pursue today. 
The fact of life is that there have been many cases cited here of young people who have been the subject of mandatory sentencing who will not find their dignity in any way enhanced by the fact that they have been jailed. The thing that is overlooked in this argument on many occasions is the fact that that is the response given to the crimes committed by some of these young people, yet the real response needs to be to look at what is causing these people to turn to crime in the first place. There are undoubtedly social causes, ethnic and racial causes, economic causes and education causes. Where these people have been denied aspects of their social, economic or educational development, one finds that they have been in a disadvantaged position. The answer to their problems is not to jail them. Jailing them mandatorily is not the answer. The answer is to try to redress their problems by addressing the causes of their problems. We need to remedy the causes.
There is no guarantee that mandatorily throwing people into prison will even start to address the causes of their problems. That is the fundamental problem in this. Mandatory sentencing in no way addresses the causes of the problems that many of these people face. Incarceration invariably reinforces and builds upon the negative behaviour that these people have developed over a period of time. There will be some, though, in our community and our society who will be uncontrollable repeat offenders, and I make no apology for those people. The courts have to deal with them appropriately. Their unfortunate antisocial behaviour must be addressed. Unfortunately for those people and fortunately for society, in many instances the only response to their behaviour is to incarcerate them in jail. However, not addressing the causes, particularly in the case of young people, is purely and simply going to prolong or exacerbate the problem. The `three strikes and you're out' concept is a complete abrogation of our responsibility as a society to our fellow human beings. We must give them a reasonable economic and social environment in which to realise their aspirations and in which they can grow as individuals and grow with dignity. I cannot reconcile myself in any way whatsoever to purely and simply condemning them because the circumstances have not been there for them to advantage themselves. Hence, the mandatory sentencing concept completely in isolation is an anathema to our society. It should not operate under any circumstances.
Incarceration is invariably a quick and somewhat costly response by society to crime. At the end of the day, it really proves nothing. It fails to show true compassion and understanding and to recognise that some of the people who are caught up in the mandatory sentencing laws are obviously crying out for help, crying out for assistance and crying out for the causes of the problems that affect them to be addressed. The dilemma that is faced by our society is really as much a moral issue as it is a law and order issue. This is the unfortunate aspect of the whole argument. Mandatory sentencing in the end becomes a law and order issue invariably around the time of elections. One is not advocating that there should not be law and order, but there should not be mandatory sentencing as a knee-jerk reaction when the causes that drive many people down the path of crime are not being addressed. My plea in this debate is simple. One should not simply look at mandatory sentencing as being a response to a set of circumstances in society. We also need to address actively the causes of crime, the things that drive people to crime out there in our society.
I am not denying that some people are habitual criminals. They have to be dealt with appropriately by the system. But I believe we are all entitled to our dignity. To not address the reasons why some cannot achieve that dignity is no way at all to conduct a civilised society. Justice not only has to be seen to be done but also has to be done. It will not be done so long as the only response that we have to crime is `three strikes and you're out'. Mandatory sentencing does not achieve that at all, in my opinion. Good conscience has a real part and a real role to play.  
The second reading speech gets to some of the emotion that surrounds this issue. I am looking at point 4.7 of the second reading speech, which cites an article from the University of New South Wales Law Journal. The article is called `Mandatory sentencing laws and the symbolic politics of law and order' and is by Russell Hogg, and I draw the attention of the chamber to the fact that the author is not related to me. It is interesting to read in the second reading speech comments made by Mr Hogg in that article. The second reading speech states:
Like many commentators, Mr Hogg was disturbed at the way public discourse on these issues has been driven largely by political rhetoric.
Then there is a quote from Mr Hogg's article:
In Australia ... the stridency of the political rhetoric, the vagueness of proposals for sentencing reform and their proximity to elections are the clearest indications of what is really at stake. They usually represent the latest attempt to lift the bar in the law and order high jump. The rationale for such measures is less an instrumental one of reducing crime than it is the symbolic one of tapping and harnessing punitive public opinion behind a new program of draconian penal measures.
That sums up this debate. It is about political rhetoric, it is about reacting at a time when elections are invariably on the horizon and it is about a perception in the public at large—which I believe is a mistaken perception—that raising the bar, as Mr Hogg describes it in his article, will resolve all the problems of society. In effect, the one thing that mandatory sentencing laws do not address is what is causing people to commit crimes in the first place. So long as we treat the symptom, we will never get to the cause of the problem. As Mr Hogg rightly says in his article, all this does is bring out `a new program of draconian penal measures'. Incarcerating people, particularly young people, is in no way redressing the problems that are out there in the larger society.
I believe the bill currently before the chamber is the appropriate way to deal with the mandatory sentencing laws that exist in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. I do not believe the issue needs to be glibly addressed as it has been in those jurisdictions. One has to look at the causes of the problems that are out there in our society. If one is serious in addressing the issue of the dignity of people in our community in good conscience, one has to look at the social, ethnic, racial, economic and educational considerations in our society. If those are overlooked, we will only continue to build more jails and incarcerate more people in a failed response by our society to address the issues which put those people in that position in the first place. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS (MANDATORY SENTENCING OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2000-03-15,"—For me, the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999 is not about mandatory sentencing; it is about the ability of the Western Australian government and the Northern Territory government—democratically elected governments—to have self-government and to be able to pass laws which affect the citizens within their own state or territory. I intend to speak only briefly. Throughout the length of this debate, we have heard people arguing the case against mandatory sentencing. But we have heard on only very few occasions—and my colleague Senator Knowles was one of the people who raised this—that the bill is really about whether you believe the states have the right to govern their own state or, in the case of the Northern Territory, whether the territories have the right to govern their own territory. The bill is really about whether you believe the states and territories have the right to implement laws which have been passed by a duly democratically elected government.
We have heard ad nauseam from senators on the other side of the chamber the fact that people have been sent into juvenile detention for stealing textas or a packet of biscuits. No-one has been placed in detention simply for stealing a packet of biscuits or textas. They have been put in detention because they are repeat offenders. Under the mandatory sentencing laws that apply in that state and that territory, only repeat offenders are sent to any form of juvenile detention or detention. We ought to delineate between someone who, for the first time in their life, commits a petty crime and someone who is a repeat offender. 
In the unfortunate situation of the youth suicide in jail in the Northern Territory some month or two ago, the media beat-up and the media publicity was that this person was in detention because they had stolen textas. We all know that this person had 28 previous convictions, some of them quite major crimes, and most of them involving home invasions—which is not a term that I like. The real term is burglary. They are burglars who are breaking into people's homes. 
For a start, people who live in Sydney or in the leafy suburbs of Melbourne, Adelaide or anywhere else—many of whom are supporters of Senator Brown's bill—probably have very few indigenous people living within their electorate, so they do not really understand some of the problems that exist once you get into areas like the Territory and some of the far reaches of Western Australia where the issue of law and order is constantly on the minds of the residents. There is fear among many people, particularly in some remote areas, of home invasions, of burglary—of homes being broken into—or of personal harm. No-one who supports this bill ever seems to give a thought to the victim of the crime, particularly the nasty crime of burglary or home invasion.
What I really wanted to say is that I wonder—I am sorry that Senator Brown is not here at present; I know he was here earlier—what changes have taken place in the minds of the proponents of this bill, Senator Bolkus and Senator Brown, because some three years ago when we were debating a euthanasia bill the same issues arose. May I preface my remarks by saying that I was a supporter of the bill to overturn the Northern Territory's legislation on euthanasia—not because they did not have a right to make laws for Territorians but because I believe they did not have a right to make laws for every citizen of Australia, which is what they were doing in that landmark legislation in relation to euthanasia. If anyone cares to read my speech during that debate, which I am sure not many would want to—Senator Quirke may wish to in his spare time—they will see that I said:
If the Territory law that had been passed on euthanasia said that their law applied to citizens of the Northern Territory or those that had been resident there for a certain period of time, I would have never voted to overturn that law, but they had made a law that applied to the rest of Australia. 
In the case of mandatory sentencing, I do not know of many people who live outside the Northern Territory that would rush up there to commit a crime so they could avail themselves of mandatory sentencing in the same way that they would have used the euthanasia legislation.
I will get back to the proponents of this bill. When Senator Bolkus was opposing the then Andrews bill that was before the chamber to overturn that legislation he used the words `precisely what this insidious bill will do'. That is how he referred to the euthanasia bill. He said:
It seeks to prevent the people of the Northern Territory and the ACT—
in this case—
through their elected representatives ... from making their own judgments about the meaning and value of life. 
This is Senator Bolkus in 1997 saying that the people of the Northern Territory and the ACT, through their elected representatives, should be able to make their own judgment. I agree with Senator Bolkus. I do not know that he has ever come in here and said why he has changed his mind and feels now that the people of the Northern Territory should not be able to exercise their own judgment. Further on in his speech he says:
It treats the hundreds of thousands of Australians who live in the territories as if they were second-class citizens ... 
This was Senator Bolkus's opinion three years ago in relation to a bill that was brought into this place: he opposed the overturning of a law that was made in the Northern Territory. I wonder why it is that he has now changed his view in relation to the people of the Northern Territory and, certainly in the case of this bill, the people of Western Australia who, under the Constitution, have a right to make these laws. 
I am pleased that Senator Brown has come back into the chamber, because Senator Brown was a great opponent of the Andrews bill to overturn a piece of Northern Territory legislation. In one of the speeches that he made on that bill—he made numerous speeches in the committee stage, and it took me ages to get them all out, but this speech was during the second reading stage—he said:
In this great debate we are challenged to back the people of the Northern Territory. 
Senator Brown, we continue to back the people of the Northern Territory because they have a right to make this legislation. He went on to say:
We are challenged to back the breakthrough for the whole world which their courage in this legislation, brought forward by Marshall Perron, has given to the world. We are inveighed to back the vote that was carried three times in the Northern Territory Assembly, and which has shown clearly that assembly's commitment to this legislation, backed by the majority of Northern Territorians.
I say to Senator Brown that the very same Territorians have backed this law. People who live in Darwin and elsewhere in the Northern Territory have realised that they have a considerable problem with law and order which cannot always be dealt with in conventional ways so they, as the people responsible for providing the laws within their own territory, passed the mandatory sentencing legislation. We supported self-government and, to the best of my knowledge, there are not too many people in this chamber who opposed the position of the Northern Territory in their attempt to get statehood. The people of the Territory have been given self-government and the laws they have passed which affect Territorians only—this law applies only to Territorians—should be allowed to continue without interference from the federal parliament.
It is all very well for speakers who support this bill brought forward by Senators Brown, Bolkus and Greig to talk about the issue of mandatory sentencing as though that was the major issue that we are dealing with today, but the major issue we are dealing with is whether or not we believe that the states have a right to govern. They have a constitutional right to be able to provide for law enforcement within their own states. What you are asking us to do is to invoke external affairs powers to overturn a state's right to make legislation for its own citizens. In the case of the Northern Territory, yes, this government does have the ability to be able to overturn those laws, and I concede that we have that right to overturn those laws. But if we support self-government then it is something that we should not be doing. Senator Brown, I think you should return to the views that you held back in 1997. When the Territory government has clearly shown a commitment to a piece of legislation that has been backed by a majority of Northern Territorians, you should allow that bill to stay in place. For that reason, we should not be supporting your proposed piece of legislation.
Many of the supporters of this legislation have little or no knowledge of what it is like to live in the Territory or in some of the far-flung parts of Western Australia. Senator Brown, from your retreat on the River Liffey, where I do not imagine there are an enormous number of young offenders, it is very easy for you to be able to put this piece of legislation in place which will affect the lives of people thousands of miles away from you. These people have had tremendous difficulty in trying to provide law and order within their communities. These people have voted for this legislation because they simply know no other way to overcome the problem that has arisen which is not just specific to the Territory but, in fact, in many cases Australia wide. I understand that no more than 12 juveniles are in detention because of this particular mandatory sentencing law. In states like New South Wales there are some 200 juveniles in detention and there is much more discretion able to be applied by the judiciary in determining what sentences should be placed on young and juvenile offenders.  
I oppose this bill. I oppose it because of the number of friends I have in the Northern Territory who still bear lingering resentment of this federal government for the position it took on overturning the euthanasia legislation that they had passed. I think in this situation they see no justification for overturning a piece of legislation which their democratically elected government has put in place for Territorians and no other people. Their legislation applies only to people who live in the Territory. There is absolutely no reason they should not have jurisdiction over those people. If the people in the Territory do not like what their current government is doing then the alternative is to change it when they get the opportunity. That has not been the case over the last 25 years. It would appear that the decisions that have been made by the CLP government in the Northern Territory have the approval of a majority of Territorians because at no stage have they ever not had a majority in the Territory assembly. 
I conclude with those remarks and point out that I really would like to know from Senator Bolkus and Senator Brown why they have changed their opinions on the Territorians' law and on the ability of Northern Territorians to legislate for themselves, which they so wholeheartedly supported in 1997 and which they now feel they must take a totally different tack on. I would like to hear from them, and I hope we will in due course, on why the situation is so different in 2000 from what it was in 1997.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS (MANDATORY SENTENCING OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2000-03-15,"—I have been listening to the debate so far on the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999 with quite a lot of interest. I have heard arguments in a few broad categories. Some of the arguments I have heard have concerned states rights and the popularity of mandatory sentencing. On the other hand, some of the arguments have addressed youth suicide, successfully preventing crime and this parliament's duty to uphold human rights in this country. 
There are a few government senators who have stood up in this place and discussed the core issues surrounding this bill. I applaud them for that, but it is mostly the opposition and other parties that are spending time discussing human rights or youth suicide or successfully preventing crime. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that there are a number of government senators who support this bill. There are a number of government members who want these laws repealed. The Prime Minister owes it to Australia and to those MPs and senators to allow a conscience vote on this issue. 
I am honoured to be able to say that I stand up in this place to support this bill because the situation, as it currently exists in the Northern Territory in particular and in Western Australia, is an affront to human rights. I support this bill because we in this place owe it to this country to do everything we can to prevent the human tragedy that is taking place. 
I have heard two basic arguments from the government against this bill: the first has been that for us to interfere would be an affront to states rights; the other is that the law is popular. The coalition senators seem to be missing the point. There is no argument that enacting this bill would impact on states rights. That is not the debate here. But that is not a good enough reason for denying passage of this bill. If it is a case of human rights versus states rights, then surely we have a responsibility to stand up for human rights—and, of course, there is very recent evidence for acting. 
In 1996, the Commonwealth struck out the euthanasia laws in the Northern Territory. Some coalition senators seem to be making a lot of noise about the fact that people on this side of the chamber voted in 1996 to stop the federal government intervening. They seem to be missing the point altogether. The issue at the time was a moral one, not a political one. The question today is the same. The question today is not so much whether we have the right to interfere in the affairs of a state or territory, it is whether we have a moral obligation to do so.  
The answer in this case is most definitely yes. I acknowledge that some opinion polls in Western Australia and the Northern Territory show that mandatory sentencing is popular. But just because it is popular does not mean that it is right. The Prime Minister on this issue, as on so many other issues, seems to have a perpetual blind spot to the concept of true leadership. Either he does not know the meaning of the word or his definition of `leadership' goes something along the lines of `follow the pollster'. We have a Prime Minister who is content to say that the laws are silly but will not let his MPs have a conscience vote on the issue. We have a Prime Minister who will jump hurdles as soon as a few National Party MPs kick up a stink about erotic videos but does not seem to want to change a situation where our kids are dying in jail.
But another major issue here is that these laws do not work. They do not reduce crime and they do not reduce recidivism and, for that reason, they are not good for society. This sort of approach to crime has been tried for hundreds of years in many different countries and it is proven that it does not work. The cost of this practice is too high—too high in monetary terms and in human terms. It is biased against the powerless and the disadvantaged.
Crime is a big issue in our community. It is an important one which governments spend a lot of time and resources addressing. The people of Australia are understandably concerned about finding lasting solutions to the causes of crime. The Northern Territory and Western Australian governments, however, seem to be taking the easy way out. Rather than sitting down and doing the hard work to come up with programs that help young offenders and the people in their community, they are taking the easy option. Rather than saying, `Let's look at allocating more resources to programs that might divert these young people from a life of crime,' they are saying, `No, that's too hard. Let's just lock them in jail so they can learn a few more tricks of the trade.' 
There are more innovative ways of tackling the problem out there. Just a few weeks ago I stood up in this place and reported on a Queensland government program called Youth Justice Services. One of the main goals of the Queensland program is to achieve a balance between encouraging and valuing participation by youth offenders while also recognising that a certain level of responsibility and accountability for their actions must accompany their participation. The youth offenders may be required to attend the service to comply with the conditions of their court orders. That attendance requires participation in a range of activities, including assessment and planning of their program needs, counselling, group work, community service, education, employment and training, skills development, and victim awareness work. This is done to help the youth gain an insight into the causes and impacts of their offending. It helps the young person develop options for meeting their needs without offending. It also helps the young person develop skills, interests and community networks to divert them from future offending.
So the Queensland government is taking the attitude, like most other governments in this country, that the problems of youth crime are not going to be fixed with a wave of a magic wand. The Queensland government knows that these problems are going to require a lot of hard work in a lot of different areas to fix. And, yes, part of that approach will include incarceration of some youth offenders. The difference is a matter of balance. Queensland's approach seems much more realistic to me than the approach taken by Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Unfortunately, Western Australia and the Northern Territory seem to be more interested in waving the wand of mandatory sentencing, as if throwing kids in jail will solve all of their problems. The coalition seems to be just as happy watching these two governments wave away the life of a whole generation of young people. 
But let me turn to the substance of the bill and the findings of the inquiry. I do not think I need to spend time discussing the detail of this bill. I am sure everyone here is aware of its impact. Suffice to say that, if passed, this bill would invalidate any Commonwealth, state or territory law that required courts to impose mandatory detention for offences committed by children.  
Some government senators have suggested that the concerns about these laws are only recent. I would like to remind the government that the opposition co-sponsored this bill when it was introduced last year. I would also like to remind the government that the inquiry formed to examine this bill was started last year. 
Since the bill was introduced into the Senate, there have been a number of incidents that have brought into sharp focus the matters we are considering here today. The most serious was the suicide of a 15-year-old boy just last month who was subject to a mandatory sentence. This young Aboriginal boy was serving his second detention term under mandatory sentencing. He died on a Thursday and was due to be released the following Monday. Just a week later, on 16 February, a 21-year-old man was sentenced to a year in jail under mandatory sentencing for stealing $23 worth of cordial and biscuits from a storeroom in a mine. 
No-one here is arguing that there are circumstances where a prison sentence is not appropriate for a particular crime. Exactly the opposite. We are arguing that the power to decide the matters should properly rest with the magistrate or judge hearing the case. From time to time, there will always be some argument about whether judges are handing down sentences that are too soft or too tough. I do not think that is likely to change any time soon, but mandatory sentencing seems to have thrown out of balance the justice system in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
I would like to spend some time going over the evidence presented to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee inquiry into the bill and its findings. The terms of the inquiry covered the legal, social and other impacts of mandatory sentencing; Australia's international human rights obligations in regard to mandatory sentencing laws in Australia; the implications of mandatory sentencing for particular groups, including Australia's indigenous people and people with disabilities; and the constitutional power of the Commonwealth parliament to legislate with respect to existing laws affecting mandatory sentencing.
The committee received a total of 136 submissions and held public hearings in Alice Springs, Darwin, Perth and Canberra. Their conclusions and recommendations reflect very comprehensively the problems with the mandatory sentencing laws as they currently stand. The committee established that the Commonwealth does have the power to override legislation in the Northern Territory. The report cites the most notable example of this being the overturning of the euthanasia laws in 1996. 
The committee found that the Commonwealth has the ultimate responsibility of ensuring Australia meets its obligations under international law. The committee found that the Northern Territory legislation clearly contravened Australia's international treaty obligations. The committee found that, in Western Australia, the legislation had the potential to contravene the country's international obligations, although in practice the situation was less serious.
The committee found a disparity between the evidence of the social impact of mandatory sentencing supplied by the Western Australian and Northern Territory governments and evidence that the social impact on children was terrible. I found one piece of evidence from the Northern Territory Legal Aid Commission particularly concerning. The commission said that, because of a high level of relatively minor crime in Aboriginal communities, there was a real prospect that the bulk of the male population between 17 and 30 would be in jail for property crimes. Their submission states:
Every time someone hops in the back of a stolen Toyota, smashes a window after an argument, breaks into the canteen to steal food because he is hungry or accepts some of that food, steals petrol from a car to sniff or accepts stolen fuel for sniffing, that person goes to jail and then goes up a rung. Practitioners in the Northern Territory have seen all of the above cases with monotonous regularity. Soon each offender will get one year in prison. 
There was also evidence from Mr Martin Flynn of the Law School of Western Australia that putting young men in prison at a time when they should be participating in ceremonies and assuming responsibility in their own community would cause lasting problems for society. The committee also found that there were several areas in relation to the Convention on the Rights of the Child that needed investigation. The problem areas included the placing of 16- and 17-year-olds in normal prisons in Western Australia and problems with interpreter services in the Northern Territory.
Article 40.4 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that a variety of options, including care, guidance and supervision orders, counselling, probation, foster care, education and training programs and other alternatives to institutional care, should be available as an alternative to putting children in an institution. The committee found that the Northern Territory's `one size fits all' approach to third strike juvenile property offenders did not fit this approach.
Yesterday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, tried to tell us that Australia had been given the all clear by the United Nations. Unfortunately, that was not quite true. The United Nations reference paper confirmed that the Northern Territory and Western Australian mandatory sentencing regimes offended a number of human rights principles. The reference paper was prepared by UNICEF and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. It found significant inconsistencies between mandatory sentencing and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice. The reference paper found:
This matter is a very important one from the human rights perspective and all states should give the principles involved the closest attention in legislation and practice.
The Senate committee found that more work needed to be done on alternatives to mandatory sentencing, including diversionary programs, victim conferencing and the development of judicial sentencing guidelines. There was also evidence that mandatory sentencing legislation increased the physical danger to both law enforcement officers and offenders. The International Commission of Jurists said in its submission:
Legislation of this kind creates additional and foreseeable dangers to the health and well-being of our law-enforcement personnel; as well as additional risk of physical harm to the youth against whom they face off.
Offenders are put in a situation where they have nothing to lose. They are more likely to commit more serious crimes and try to fight their way out when caught, if they know they are going to jail anyway.
The committee did acknowledge that there are differences in the legislation between the jurisdictions. The practice now in Western Australia seems to indicate that some safeguards are present. But, while the legislation remains `on the books' in Western Australia, there is a case for legislative action by the Commonwealth. The committee was convinced by the submissions received and the evidence heard that mandatory sentencing was not appropriate for a democracy like Australia that values human rights. The committee reported that, while it would prefer the respective governments to take action to fix the problems themselves, that was unlikely to happen. The committee's ultimate finding in relation to the bill before the house was that parliament should pass it.
In conclusion, I would like to issue a challenge to the government, particularly the Prime Minister. I challenge the Prime Minister to commit to a time frame and a plan of action for changing these laws. Mr Howard has said they are silly laws.  He says he does not think they work. He actually came out and said that. But he has also said that he would like the Western Australia and Northern Territory governments to take action on their own to make mandatory sentencing laws more acceptable, particularly in relation to how they affect juveniles.
Well, Prime Minister, when will you tell us exactly what you want to see these two governments do? When will you tell us how long we should wait for them to do that? When will you tell us exactly what you plan to do if the two governments refuse to make any changes to mandatory sentencing laws? These are all very important questions, Prime Minister. While we wait for answers, more and more communities and the young people in them are being damaged by these laws. While we wait for an answer, the international reputation of Australia is being damaged by these laws. 
Sadly, I have the impression that, if left in the government's hands, we would be waiting a very long time for answers to those questions. I do not think the people of Western Australia and the Northern Territory can afford to wait, especially the young people there. I do not think we, as the people charged with running this country, can afford to wait either. That is why I urge the Senate to support this bill.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS (MANDATORY SENTENCING OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-03-15,"—I rise to speak on the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999 and indicate that Pauline Hanson's One Nation will not be supporting the bill. The reason we are taking that position is that I think we need to separate the facts from the rhetoric. I believe that people in the other states should not be telling the elected members of the Northern Territory how to carry out their parliamentary responsibilities. 
The issue is not about race; the issue is about the incidence of crime in the Northern Territory. This is reflected in the other states. It is not acceptable when we have elderly people locking themselves up in their homes because of crime that is being committed on the streets. As a society, we believe that with rights come responsibilities. As individuals, to live in a society we have the responsibility of adhering to the laws on which our rights are based. I believe it is fair to say that part of the decreasing interest in the police forces as an occupation in Australia is due to the hamstringing of the police in carrying out their duties. 
If we look at the mandatory minimum sentencing in the Northern Territory and the juvenile portion of that legislation—this information is from the Northern Territory's own documents—in the case of burglary, stealing, car theft and property damage, which cannot in anybody's consideration be classed as minor crimes—they are reasonably substantial offences against society—for the juvenile ages of 15 and 16, for the first offence they receive a caution. On the second charge, in most cases the court counsels young offenders without penalty and they are usually not sentenced. On the third occasion on which they are charged, they are to participate in a diversionary program, if suitable, otherwise 28 days detention. It is not until the fourth offence that the 28 days detention is mandatory and the court can decide more than that minimum. So it is not until the fourth offence for burglary, stealing, car theft and property damage that a 15- to 16-year-old comes under the mandatory sentencing provision. 
For an adult 17 years or older, on the first court appearance the court is required to send the first offender to prison if the offender cannot comprehensively display that there were exceptional circumstances. On the second offence, it is 90 days and, on the third offence, 12 months. Documentation from the Northern Territory reads: 
Let's look at some of the facts and myths being spread about this sentencing regime. Amidst all this hoo-ha, one would be entitled to ask how many juveniles, irrespective of their colour—
and I return to my opening comments that this is not about race, so these figures include both indigenous and non-indigenous—
are being held in Don Dale Detention Centre. The daily average of juveniles on remand and sentenced in 1998-99 was 27. In the six months to 31 December last year, the daily average was 17. Ten years ago it was 34. Yesterday—
on the date of this transmission—
there were 14 juveniles detained in Don Dale, four of whom had been sentenced under the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions. 
So it is clear that there are fewer juveniles being held now than there were 10 years ago. 
Let us look overall at Australia's support or disapproval on a state by state breakdown. In Queensland, 72.6 per cent of the people support the Northern Territory's mandatory sentencing law. In New South Wales, it is 55.7. In South Australia, it is 72 per cent. In Western Australia, it is 70.7 per cent. In Victoria, it is 44 per cent. In Tasmania, it is 58.3 per cent. And in the Northern Territory itself, it is 67 per cent. So the average right across Australia is 58.7 per cent—a very clear indication from the people of Australia that in actuality they support the Northern Territory's mandatory sentencing.  
In concluding, I would also like to question where the Commonwealth is going to get its head of power to carry out the enforcement. I believe that the Commonwealth having to use our obligations under United Nations treaties is a clear indication that in our Australian Constitution there is no head of power for the Commonwealth to override the legal responsibilities of the parliamentarians who are duly elected in any particular state or territory.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS (MANDATORY SENTENCING OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-03-15,"—I rise today also to speak on the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999. I do so mainly to add my name to the list of those supporting the bill and to give support to my colleague Senator Jim McKiernan from Western Australia, who did an excellent job on the committee inquiring into the bill and who has taken a very principled stand. I want to join him in making it known in Western Australia that, despite the political pressures, I share his view that the principles at stake here are fundamental.
In making a short contribution to the debate, I turn to where I started when I entered the parliament, which was in my first speech. I used that opportunity—I know many people would not have read it—to outline the human rights framework which has guided, and hopefully will continue to guide, my thinking about policy and justice issues that come before our parliament. In doing that, on the debate about the mandatory sentencing of juvenile offenders, I have returned always to the five principles I discussed in that speech: firstly, that there exist fundamental inalienable human rights that must be paramount in our considerations, and that those rights must be protected and enhanced by any legislative action we take; secondly, that we must defend those fundamental rights against attempts to subjugate them to propositions designed to protect privilege, property, discrimination or inappropriate power; thirdly, that notions of states rights should not be given pre-eminence over human or people's rights; fourthly, that the federal government should not shirk exercising its full constitutional power to legislate whenever that is required to protect those basic human rights; and, fifthly, that our legislative approach must be guided and give effect to international law and Australian treaty obligations. As I said, that is where I started out in this parliament; it leads me now to how I approach this debate. I feel as comfortable six years on with that approach as I did then. It is nice to see that it has stood the test of time. 
I welcome the report. I think the committee inquiry has made an important contribution to our understanding of the complex issues surrounding juveniles and the justice system. I think it is important that we continue to collect and assess data and have a debate about the evidence about these measures, so that our responses reflect an awareness of the differential impacts of mandatory sentencing laws on particular groups within the community. I think we also need to put more effort into focusing on effective approaches to rehabilitation.
The report's key findings establish that mandatory minimum sentencing of juveniles contravenes international obligations, including those under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. I think that is a very important finding and a finding that this parliament ought to take very seriously. The report further identifies that the effectiveness of mandatory sentencing can be challenged on a number of grounds and has been challenged by respected legal practitioners in the justice system. For example, jail for minor property offences by children increases the chances of recidivism. It helps divert resources from strategies that are long term and is not sensitive to the needs of different individuals and cultures and thus diminishes community safety in the longer term. I think it helps provide a distraction from issues relating to social justice and shifts the focus away from understanding causes to the pursuit of outcomes. 
With respect to my home state of Western Australia, the report has found that WA laws violate principles of proportionality and the requirement under the CROC that in the case of children detention should be a last resort. It is disturbing to note that both WA and the Northern Territory during the period in which mandatory sentencing laws have been operable have recorded increases in juvenile detention rates against the national trend. The report also notes that the practice of the Western Australian legislation is less severe than the case in the Northern Territory due to a number of safeguards, including provisions such as the conditional release order and juvenile justice scheme panels which are involved in diversionary programs. It is important to note, however, that these panels do not meet the needs of indigenous juveniles.
I support my WA colleague Jim McKiernan when he said:
While mandatory sentencing remains on the books in WA, regardless of the safeguards which have developed to ameliorate the harsher effects of these laws, there is a case for legislative action by the Commonwealth.
The report establishes that mandatory sentencing has a discriminatory impact with high incarceration rates for two groups for whom I have particular concern: firstly, indigenous people and, secondly, people with intellectual disabilities. It is disturbing to note that upward of 70 per cent of the three-strike cases going through the WA Children's Court involve Aboriginal children. We need to focus on issues associated with disadvantage experienced by Aboriginal people that is associated with offending behaviour. Mandatory sentencing is not a solution and prevents all factors affecting a particular child from being taken into consideration when sentencing.
The committee also advised that mandatory sentencing discriminates against people with intellectual or some other disabilities, and therefore contravenes both the ICCPR and the UN Declaration on the Rights of the Disabled. As a group of people—those with intellectual disabilities—overrepresented in the criminal justice system, the evidence suggests that mandatory sentencing will exacerbate that impact. We need to shift the focus to support for housing, employment and specialised assistance to those people to allow for an understanding of participation in court processes. Mandatory sentencing and a focus on punishment and retribution is entirely inappropriate for a group that can not understand the wrongfulness of their actions. I urge senators who support mandatory sentencing to have a look at the number of people with intellectual disabilities who find themselves caught up in the justice system without an understanding of what is happening to them and without the ability to have their interests properly protected. It is a very important issue that is often overlooked in these debates.
In conclusion, the issue is not about the Commonwealth riding roughshod over states rights, nor about the Commonwealth being answerable to the international community above its own. It is about the Commonwealth asserting its pre-eminence of human rights and engaging with the states in developing an approach to juvenile justice which emphasises rehabilitation and fulfils our obligations under international treaties to which we are signatories. I agree that the Commonwealth has an important role to play in assisting to develop national standards for juvenile justice that reflect Australia's international obligations and are effective in promoting rehabilitation and just outcomes.
This parliament should never allow fundamental human rights or people's rights to be subjugated to narrow state interests. I know the politics of this issue is hard. I know in Western Australia there is a lot of public support for mandatory sentencing and tough action against offenders, but I do not think we can bow to that pressure if the solutions are not just, are not fair and are essentially discriminatory in whom they impact upon. Simplistic solutions are not the answer. We have an obligation to provide leadership as well as listening to what the public wants. I would like to end by again quoting Hubert Humphrey, and urge those in the Liberal Party to take note, because he once said to his party: 
It is time for the Democratic Party to walk out of the shadow of States' rights and into the bright sunshine of human rights.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS (MANDATORY SENTENCING OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,2000-03-15,"—There are some things in this world that are very difficult to defend. Last week Alan Bond walked out of jail after serving 3½ years, or whatever it was, for defrauding a group of old pensioners, or whoever they were, who invested in Bell Resources. I imagine that a fair amount of it was money from the large institutions, but a lot of it was also money from a number of individuals who lost a very large part of their private savings.
—My dad.
—Senator Evans' father was one of the people who was ripped off by Alan Bond.
—I thought Bond was a Labor mate.
—It is good to see that the minister is awake. We were worried about him snoring before. He was asleep over there, but we know he is awake and that is good. It is very difficult to justify a kid being put in jail for stealing $23 worth of cordial and biscuits for something of the order of a matter of months—or in fact, if it is a third offence, for a year—when Alan Bond has diddled Senator Evans' father and everyone else associated with Bell Resources out of $1 billion. It is a pretty hard ask to get up on any stump and defend that.
I can understand the desire for mandatory sentencing in a number of areas because the problem is that in many instances the magistrates and the judges impose penalties on all sorts of offenders—both juveniles and non-juveniles—which do not appear to even remotely approach the crime. In the eyes of the public in all of the states there appears to be a mismatch between what the judiciary hands down in terms of sentences, and in many instances—not all—the punishment just does not appear to fit the crime. However, it would appear that mandatory sentencing, particularly in the Northern Territory, is a problem rather than a cure. Indeed, the separation of powers makes it quite explicit and clear that the role of parliament in setting laws and the role in the executive in parliament of putting forward the various bits of legislation which carry the penalties, is the correct role of the elected representatives of the people. Then it should be up to the judiciary to take each case on its own merits.
It is going to be impossible for Mr Burke and all those in the Northern Territory to justify one of the more recent cases that has just come to light of a woman with five children who is estranged from her husband and pregnant with her sixth child. She was locked out of what was, as I understand it, originally the matrimonial home. The kids went into the home where they in fact reside with their father and took some food because they were hungry. I understand that the care order was with the father, so he had the responsibility of feeding them. Then the woman took a pram, which I presume was hers originally, although that may now no longer be so. Why did she take the pram? Did she take it down to the local Cash Converters to get a few quid? The answer is, no. She took it because she had a 19-month-old baby who was asleep. I have had four of them. They do have a habit of going to sleep and best place for them is either in their own bed, a pram or whatever. When that case comes to court and the judge has no choice but to slot this woman for a custodial sentence in this instance, it is going to be an impossible act for Mr Burke and his friends to defend.
I do not think there is any doubt that, with all the best of intentions to protect the rest of the community, we find governments embracing the idea of mandatory sentencing. The problem is that it actually takes away the escape valve from the judges and travesties of justice will definitely be committed. That flexibility must be with the judiciary. We get frustrated and I remember a couple of cases in South Australia where I thought the wrong decision was made in terms of sentencing of individuals. I remember one case in particular where a man robbed a bank and, indeed, the judge let him go because he had lost a lot of money on the stock market the year before. I do not know whether the judge had some sympathy with the bloke because he may have lost some on the stock market as well, but at the end of a day I thought that sent a totally inappropriate message. I was somewhat frustrated by what the judge had done and I aired those views in parliament at the time, and so did other people in the community. 
But at the end of the day I have to accept the fact that I am not there listening to the case, I am not listening to the circumstances, and there are mechanisms for dealing with a whole range of these matters: to take them to further appeal, to appeal the sentences under certain conditions—unless they are before a jury, as I understand. The problem with the mandatory sentence is that you are going to catch up in the net a whole range of people you would not want to see put in prison. Senator Harris told us before that there are not that many juveniles in particular in detention in the Northern Territory. I think he gave the figures of 14 yesterday, an average of 17 and a maximum of 35. From my understanding, Northern Territory has a population of about 10 per cent of that of South Australia. On any one day in South Australia there are two juvenile facilities and, at least in the early 1990s, the average was about 35 incarcerations—and that included those who had been refused bail and were being held over for a committal proceeding. The total facilities in South Australia are about 70. I have not looked at this very closely but, if those figures are correct from Senator Harris, I am somewhat disturbed about it, because the population of the Northern Territory is one-tenth of that of South Australia and yet it would appear to have four or five times the occupancy of juvenile facilities.
I do not know where that goes. That is a matter that somebody out there is probably looking at, but I do think that the point of this bill is to say to magistrates, `You have the responsible discretion to deal with these matters.' They have to have that, because not every case is the same. If the community is unhappy with the conduct and procedure of the judiciary on these matters, then indeed it is a matter to be taken up with the judiciary through forums like this but it should not be an automatic cutting out of the accused person's rights before a court to a proper and fair trial.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS (MANDATORY SENTENCING OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-03-15,"—in reply—At the outset I want to thank every senator who has participated in this important debate. It has raised a whole range of issues and approaches on both sides of the argument, from the parochial to the international, from the rights of children to our responsibilities as parliamentarians responding in an elected democracy. It is an informed debate, and shortly every member of the Senate is going to have to vote as to his or her summation of the argument and response to the critical question before this Senate of whether we are going to pass up our obligation to uphold the International Convention on the Rights of the Child as well as other international conventions on civil and human rights, in particular those rights where they relate to the children of the Northern Territory and Western Australia—not least the indigenous children who today are held in detention because of the political override of the discretion of the courts in taking into account their circumstance, the circumstances of the victims of crime and the opportunity for society to have these children put back on the track to becoming fulfilled, happy and constructive members of society.
I also want to thank people outside this place who have been vital to this debate being enjoined. They include, in the Northern Territory, Ilana Eldridge, Caroline Tapp and Andy Gough who, along with indigenous communities and social justice groups in the Territory and Western Australia, brought my attention to the injustice of mandatory sentencing. I thank Louis Schetzer of the National Children's Youth Law Centre, who has been so constructive in informing not just me but many members of parliament about the arguments for this legislation being put through the parliament. John Sheldon and Kirsty Gowans from the North Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service and Cassandra Goldie from the Darwin Community Legal Service have given invaluable advice, information and support all the way through the process. Chris Sidoti, from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, in a multipartisan approach, has helped bring the Senate parties together and indeed to change the nature of the legislation.  
I should point out that at the outset I had entertained and announced in 1998 the bringing in of legislation to do much the same as Senator Harradine's amendment—that is, to override the Northern Territory laws on mandatory sentencing for both children and adults. However, it was with wiser counsel and a taking into account the view of the legal community in particular in Australia that I decided to repitch the legislation so that it acted to fulfil Australia's international treaty obligations, in particular, in regard to children, and to essentially override mandatory sentencing wherever it occurs in Australia—not just the existing mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory and in Western Australia but the potential for other states or territories to bring in mandatory sentencing laws in breach of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child in the future.
In 1999 I therefore proposed that we have this legislation. I am particularly indebted, for the facilitation of this legislation and the co-hosting of this legislation, to the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party, who have been so strong in advocating the legislation both here and outside in the community. I want to also add a word of thanks to the Senate committee, which travelled to the Northern Territory and to Western Australia and held hearings here in Canberra to bring together the response of the community, which is an overwhelming response saying that this law should be passed through the Australian parliament. In particular, I thank the chair of that committee, Senator Jim McKiernan, who did a remarkable job in facilitating the committee so that the report, which I think is one of the best Senate committee reports ever brought before this place, was here to inform all members of parliament about the complicated matter which is mandatory sentencing.
Before I move on to other things, I want to note that we are calling on the federal government to not just join us on this legislation but to act in accordance with its own history in this matter. In past years this government—the Howard government—has moved to override the Western Australian laws on mandatory sentencing insofar as they applied on Christmas Island, an external territory. Twice, ministers of the Howard cabinet have brought regulations to this place to override mandatory sentencing because it is against government policy. That is a fundamental point which must not be forgotten in this debate. The Prime Minister has reiterated that point of view. It is against the Howard government policy to have mandatory sentencing. The question is whether the Howard government is going to follow through on its policy, enact its policy and ensure that that policy is put into place in the community, which is where policies ultimately matter.
The question is: why the controversy? Mandatory sentencing has been controversial from the outset because of its manifest injustice. There has been a process of politicians intervening in matters that affect the bench; overriding the separation between the judiciary and the parliament; and intervening effectively to tie the hands of magistrates and judges in their time-honoured obligation to take into account all the circumstances in a trial when they move to sentencing. In particular, there is repugnance in the community at the outcome, where time after time juveniles, children, in the Northern Territory and Western Australia have been put in detention for anything between a fortnight and a year for obviously petty crimes where no harm has occurred to people in society. We all know that the outcome is a costly exercise in detention to the taxpayers and there is the probability that those children will come out of those universities of crime where they are held having learned better how to escape detection next time around.
In particular, the community has responded to the impact on the indigenous children of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. There was a unanimous finding by the committee—it went across all parties—that when children are locked up in these circumstances they are damaged. Are we, as members of parliament, going to allow a process which damages children in our community? That is what happens if the federal parliament—and that means the federal government—ducks its responsibility to intervene to make sure that those children are not damaged but become productive members of society. I have asked the question of myself all through this: let us stand back here and see why these children offend. The overriding answer to that question—because mostly it is indigenous children who are being ensnared by these mandatory sentencing laws—is because of the destruction of their culture, of their relationship with each other and with their law and their time-honoured relationship with the land. 
I just want to briefly ask is there no other response we can have to that destruction—which we, as the whole of society in Australia, bear responsibility for—but to lock these children up when they resort to petrol sniffing or glue sniffing and are caught stealing a few dollars worth of petrol to harm themselves in that way? Is there no better response than for us simply to say, `Go to jail'? Of course there is. We could take a leaf out of the book of the Canadians, who recently set up the state of Nunavut in the north-west territories, which is to become an indigenous controlled state in Canada. Let us look at this option, which is so far right outside the parameters of this debate, because we have to come to grips with the fundamental problem that is seeing Aboriginal kids locked up in this country. We have to treat that problem—which is of our creation; maybe not deliberately, but our actions cause it—and we have to get to the source of the problem if we are not going to be debating issues like mandatory sentencing in this place for decades to come. I want to quote briefly from an article by Peter Jull in the indigenous law bulletin of May last year which refers to the Nunavut process and project in Canada. Peter Jull had this to say:
Canada had realised long ago that indigenous policy is a political rather than a police matter and should therefore be directed towards creating full indigenous citizenship, rather than controlling a marginalised people.
With the Northern Territory not least in mind, I refer to this passage from his text:
In order to progress, northern and Canadian society had to change. The whole country grew in social and cultural awareness—as Australia has also been doing recently—but northern whites were reluctant to give up their hegemony and dreams of wealth on the back of resource extraction from indigenous lands and seas. This is typical of frontier context, where national governments and institutions—whether Norway's Labor Party, Canada's government, the US Congress or Russian academic institutes—are forced to anchor national policy and rein in self-serving latter-day pioneers.
In this is a message to this nation as a whole. Are we going to simply allow the destruction of Aboriginality in our country in the full face of the last 200 years? Are we going to allow ourselves to simply wash our hands of this tide of destruction which has moved across the country of the first Australians and say, `The best we can do is lock them up,' when they react in some way that we do not like? Of course not. And we have to be able to respond in a better fashion than mandatory sentencing.
Just last week there was comment from a leading Australian on the matter of mandatory sentencing and about the institutions that have replaced the Aboriginal institutions but not done so in a way which is amenable to Aboriginal communities. The Prime Minister said, in speaking to young Australians:
... very much to our credit is that we have an incorruptible judiciary system. We may not always agree with the decisions made by courts and they may often be wrong because they are comprised of men and women who have human frailty. But it is a magnificent thing to feel that fundamentally this is a country where if you have a just cause if you go to court, the fundamental will be a just adjudication which is not the subject of interference by people with a political axe to grind.
That is a magnificent thing, Prime Minister, if you act to ensure that for all Australians. The Prime Minister is now charged with the responsibility of defending this magnificent thing which he extolled to young Australians just last week. He is charged with the responsibility of getting rid of the blight of mandatory sentencing which arbitrarily locks up children, including indigenous children, in this country and does so through political interference with the rights of magistrates and judges to make the sentence fit the crime. We are facing a jailed generation of indigenous people in this country. Mandatory sentencing is but the tip of the iceberg as far as that situation is concerned. If this national parliament, of all parliaments in this country, is charged with the responsibility not just to put things right with the indigenous people of this country but to put indigenous people back in the place of celebration which they deserve as the first Australians, we must begin that process of reconciliation by invoking our obligations to the international community and to our own sense of justice to children and passing this legislation. If the Prime Minister does not defend his own sentiment towards the justice system on this occasion, we will be left with the impression that the Prime Minister is good with words but poor with action. 
There is another Burke that I might cite in this, and that is Edmund Burke—far different from the Denis Burke of the Northern Territory government—who said that weakness in government leads to injustice and oppression. The Prime Minister should heed those words because weakness from the prime ministerial office in the year 2000 in failing to address this problem will lead directly to injustice and oppression in the courts, jails and detention centres in Darwin and in Perth. Insofar as the Prime Minister fails to act, what happens in those detention centres from here on is not just a matter of responsibility for the governments in Perth and Darwin; it is his responsibility—it is on his head as well.
There have been moves within government, according to the press, from Mrs Danna Vale in the House of Representatives and others to at least have government action of some sort in this matter. Let me say that I would encourage that. I do not in any way undervalue what it takes for a member of one of the big parties—not least the government party—to act against a prevailing feeling from the prime ministerial office that this issue should be put on the sideboard and forgotten. I commend those people within government who have the courage to respond to this blight of mandatory sentencing in this country. I hope that the debate in the House of Representatives will be as enlightened as the debate here in the Senate. I remain steadfast in advocating that this legislation should pass both houses of parliament. But I would follow up by saying that it would then leave us with the problem of mandatory sentencing for adults. Mandatory sentencing ensnares the majority of young Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, ensnares them by their hundreds, and is leading to a massive increase in the number of jailed people aged from 17 through to 21. Before mandatory sentencing, Port Keats, for example, a village of 2,500 people in the Northern Territory, was contributing 2.5 per cent of the inmates of detention centres in the Northern Territory. It is now contributing 18 per cent. This is not least because Aboriginal culture has in it an inherent honesty which allows people who commit petty crimes to be so easily detected.
A moment ago Senator Ferguson said, on a personal note to me across the chamber in his deliberations, `From your retreat on the River Liffey, I do not imagine there are many offenders.' In other words, he suggested that I am far away and safe from the impact of being a victim of crime. He picked the wrong example. My house at Liffey has been invaded and burgled on more occasions than I can remember because I am not there often enough. I have had almost every family heirloom I own stolen from the place. On two occasions the police have apprehended people who have had goods—including, most recently, a repeat offender who stole some books. He wanted the books to read about rainforest, matters of natural history, mushrooms and so on, apparently. After he went to jail—
—About mushrooms?
—Yes, mushrooms grow in forests, and they are beautiful. You can make light of this. But the fact is that I learnt that he was still interested in them, so I sent the books to him at Risdon Jail to read because therein lies a prescription for some chance of a character recognising that he is valued, despite his past misdemeanours, and that he has other alternatives to life than coming back out and thieving again. So I have been personally affected. I know there are difficulties for victims of crime, but we cannot allow the indigenous people of this country to remain the victims of this crime, which is mandatory sentencing. (Time expired)
Question put:
That this bill be now read a second time.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS (MANDATORY SENTENCING OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-03-15,"—I wish to make a few points about the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill 1999. I note in passing that the minister is not in the chamber. I have a question to go to the minister in due course. Is Senator Vanstone handling the bill?
 (Senator Sherry)—Senator Vanstone can handle the bill until the appropriate minister arrives, if that is going to be the case. You can proceed, Senator Bishop.
—The second reading speech identifies a bill about minor administrative amendments to the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. Those amendments go only to the facilitation of collection of the national relay service levy and subsequent payment to the national relay service provider. The opposition do not oppose those amendments. We did not oppose them in the House; they went through in one or two minutes. We do not oppose those relatively minor administrative amendments in this bill.
A series of amendments were circulated by the Australian Democrats last Thursday in the chamber. Those amendments go to the issue of phone sex, an issue being whether you have opting in to phone sex provisions or opting out of phone sex provisions. The amendments circulated by the Democrats last week and shortly to be the subject of discussion were very similar but not identical to, as I understand it, amendments put and lost by the opposition in discussion of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act when as a bill it was before the chamber towards the end of June last year. Those amendments then put by the opposition provided for a different form of opting in for those consumers who wish to avail themselves of phone sex services, and the amendments circulated and put by the opposition last year essentially followed a path of public policy requirements, delegating an authority of government to develop appropriate regulations if consumers choose to opt in to phone sex services offered by various providers around Australia.
As I said, there was a both intensive and extensive discussion of that particular issue whilst we were discussing the series of Telstra 2 privatisation bills. The opposition forcefully argued at that stage for its amendments. They were put and were eventually defeated. The amendments were defeated on the voices because, when the vote was called, the Democrats, through their representative at the time, chose not to participate in the decision or did not vote. Consequently, the amendments put by the ALP at that stage were lost. The Democrats, somewhat after the event—the following day, from memory—indicated that they did not think that the call of the chair at that stage had been correct and they sought to reopen that debate through the Senator Margetts, who was a senator in this place at that time. The ALP took the attitude that the requirements of the chamber were that, if you were to reopen a debate which had been resolved, there had to be a substantial reason for reopening the debate. We invited both the Democrats and the Greens at that time to put their reasons publicly on the record as to why the debate should be reopened and the vote recommitted. The representatives of neither party put any reason at all as to why the debate should be reopened—simply saying that they had, as I recall, missed the vote and wanted to have another chance. We were of the view that that was not an adequate reason for reopening the issue, and the vote did not proceed any further. Accordingly, the original vote stood, the bill was passed in both houses as required, became an act of parliament, was proclaimed and is in operation.
Coming now to the amendments that have been circulated by the Democrats, as I said, they were substantially similar to the amendments we put last time, voted for and lost when the vote was called. When the shadow spokesperson for communications, Mr Smith, was contacted by a representative of the minister's office some time in the last week or fortnight, we indicated that the bill then circulated went to minor administrative matters. We were of the view that it was of no great consequence; we were not opposed to the material contained in the bill as tabled by the government. We indicated to government that we were quite prepared to treat the bill as non-controversial legislation. The first we became aware that there were any matters in dispute was when the Democrat amendments were tabled in the chamber late last week or earlier this week. My office was not contacted and advised in any way that the Democrats would be circulating amendments, and Mr Smith's office has advised me that his office or staff were not contacted in any way as to the purpose of the Democrat amendments. So when they were tabled in this place, it came out of the blue to us. Accordingly, it having been scheduled as non-controversial legislation and being the subject of dispute, necessarily the government had to adjourn the bill into government business for consideration.
That is a bit of the background. What I want to ask the minister or the minister's representative is: if the Democrats proceed with their amendments to the bill that are on phone sex, will the government be supporting those amendments? If the government supports those amendments as circulated by the Democrats, the amendments will get up, presumably go down to the other place and get up there. If the government opposes those amendments, that means two things can occur. The opposition can vote with the Democrats, and the amendments would get up. If that is the case, they would then be returned to the upper house in the face of opposition by government, would be overturned or rejected in the House and sent back to the Senate for further consideration. The opposition is of the view that such a course of action would be a waste of time, a waste of public money and achieve no purpose at all. So I ask the minister: will the government be opposing the Democrat amendments? If the government indicates that it consents to the Democrat amendments, the opposition will go along with that. If the government opposes the Democrat amendments, the opposition will maintain the commitment it gave to treating the bill as non-controversial and will also oppose the amendments.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2000-03-15,"—I rise to just very briefly speak to the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill 1999. I note that the bill is in respect of the National Relay Service for those who are deaf or hearing or speech impaired and have problems with access to standard telephone services. The second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum leave a few questions that I need answered. It may well be that the minister in responding in this second reading debate can answer those questions for me. I understand that the changes under this bill are simple changes in terms of the administration of the levy that is raised. The questions are simply: what will be the effect on the current service standards to the consumers of the National Relay Service? Is there any noticeable or discernible change or effect on the current standards? What will be the effect on the provider? What guarantees are there that these arrangements will not have to be altered again? And, have the current accounting payment difficulties had any impact on service delivery? It would be handy if those could be answered by the minister rather than at some later stage in the debate. They are not difficult questions to answer.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-03-15,"—The Australian Democrats support the provisions of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill 1999 to the extent that they adjust the timetable for payment by the Commonwealth to the provider of the National Relay Service and the timetable for carriers to pay the levy to the Australian Communications Authority. 
This bill was to be dealt with as noncontroversial last Thursday. I withdrew my support for the bill being dealt with as noncontroversial because I wanted to take the opportunity to correct a significant problem which has arisen as a result of the existing regime in relation to adult telephone services. Under part 9A of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 a person wishing to use an adult telephone service must enter into a written agreement with the adult telephone service provider and be issued with a personal identification number. This regime is colloquially referred to as an opt-in service, because the service may not be provided to a person unless they opt in by entering a written agreement.
I want to say, yet again, that the Australian Democrats support the classification of material that the community, quite rightly, sees as being in a category that should be restricted. We do not support the untrammelled access of children to adult telephone services, but we do support the freedom of access of adult aged people to non-violent material at their own discretion.
Senators will recall that the last time we debated these matters the political landscape in this country was rather different. Senator Harradine and former Senator Colston held the effective balance of power. The result of the government's attempt to appeal to the views of some in this place has been, in a word, a `mess'. But it has also impacted on the personal privacy and liberty of ordinary Australians. As the Senate will recall, a guillotine was applied in the closing hours of this debate, a guillotine which we attempted to revisit the following morning when it was revealed that the actual intention of the Senate was not reflected in the vote the night before. A small window of opportunity meant that a division was not called. The Australian Democrats asserted then, as we do now, that the true intention of the Senate was not reflected. When former Senator Margetts attempted to move a suspension of standing orders the following morning, Senator Harradine denied leave to have the vote recommitted.
What has happened since these laws were enacted? I am informed that the carriers are having great difficulty implementing the part 9A regime. Cable and Wireless Optus has decided not to provide the 1900 opt-in adult service. Optus announced a few days ago:
Due to the current regulatory environment surrounding the Australian 1900 premium rate industry (regarding restricted access to adult services) the financial viability of the product cannot be maintained. As a result, the InfoAccess 1900 product will be decommissioned as at 1 June 2000.
The consequence is a monopoly for Telstra, which is of great concern to the service providers. This legislation now affects a far broader section of the community and business than was first anticipated. Without the traffic that the adult material provides, the Optus 1900 premium rates service as a whole is no longer viable. Telstra has advised that less than 10 customers have completed the opt-in application. From 1.5 million callers to less than 10 effectively wipes out a complete industry. We have always suspected that this was the intention of the legislation, and I think now we have the proof, despite the assertion of Senator Alston, who at the time of this debate last year said:
The arrangements do not have the purpose of closing down the telephone sex industry or preventing adults from using these services.
Compounding this, only Telstra customers are now able to apply for access to the services. So much for competition, I think we might say. But this was never really about protecting children. Nor was it ever about effective regulation. This was about the appeasement of a senator who was, I think, driven by ideological reasons. If we need any further illustration of these matters, we just need to refer to the private video watching by members of the National Party for the sole purpose of raising hysteria about what adult Australians should have the right to do in private in a democratic society. 
The adult telephone service industry employs in the order of 3,000 people, and I understand they are mostly women. There are sensible options for achieving a balanced outcome in terms of keeping children off adult phone services, protecting jobs and allowing adults to choose whether to use the services. The amendments that I will move today when we reach the committee stage are identical to those that I moved in May last year. These amendments support the freedom of expression of Australian citizens. They allow for the education of telephone account holders so that they can choose what they and their households may access. These amendments protect access choice rights of telecommunications consumers.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2000-03-15,"—Today I would like to talk about the so-called crisis in medical defence insurance as it affects medical practitioners and the reasons for it. Because this will take me some time, in a subsequent speech I intend to propose a solution to this problem. Over the past decade medical practitioners across the country have had to contend with marked increases in their professional indemnity fees, with those providing specialist services, such as obstetrics, being particularly hard hit. This is demonstrated by a comparison of the subscription rates of procedural GPs—that is, those GPs providing services such as obstetrics and plastic surgery—and non-procedural GPs who are members of United Medical Protection, which represents some 70 per cent of all medical practitioners in the country. In 1984, UMP's subscription rates were $300 for both procedural and non-procedural GPs. By 1994—a decade later—in contrast the rates for procedural GPs had increased to $4,050, whereas those for non-procedural GPs were only $1,450. By 1999—the most recent year that figures are available—subscription rates for procedural GPs had risen to $9,796 per annum and the rates for non-procedural GPs were $2,375 per annum.
In the case of specialists in obstetrics and gynaecology there is something of a variation across the states, but the fees paid by these specialists for medical insurance are very high. In Victoria, for instance, the Medical Indemnity Protection Society has increased fees for obstetricians and gynaecologists from $9,900 per annum in 1994-95 to $27,000 per annum in 1999-2000. Furthermore, the MIPS has recently made a call on its members, resulting in the doubling of the fees payable for this year to $54,000 for each obstetrician taking insurance with them—a very high sum indeed. A number of factors are feeding this growth in medical indemnity insurance. Medical negligence litigation is the most commonly perceived reason for the increases. Indeed, burgeoning medical litigation is commonly cited by the medical defence organisations as a major, if not themajor, contributing factor to the increase in their subscription fees. The general perception, fed by the media, is that the profession is experiencing a crisis in litigation. A 1998 survey by the Medical Defence Union indicated that nine in 10 Australian doctors are afraid of being sued by patients. Although, anecdotally, medical negligence litigation is increasing, in fact there is little hard evidence of a crisis.
The 1995 Tito report found no evidence of a claimed `litigation explosion' and noted the lack of publicly available data which would have sustained this conclusion. Similarly, a 1997 report by the Victorian Law Reform Committee concluded that a number of high profile cases, particularly in New South Wales, had led to a widespread belief that there was a crisis in medical negligence litigation when, in fact, there was not. The recent Senate Community Affairs References Committee report, entitled Rocking the cradle, found that the existing publicly available data did not provide enough evidence from which to draw conclusions about the existence or otherwise of a litigation crisis. The committee went on to find that data from the County Court of Victoria, while relatively limited—being from one court in one state only—provided some support for the assertion that, overall, an increasing number of cases are being brought against doctors, though the number of cases remains relatively low. 
A vast number of patients who have at least a potential action against their doctors choose to do nothing at all. Indeed, studies in the United States, which is often cited as a litigious nation, have established that only 10 per cent of the occurrences which might give rise to a claim have led to proposed or actual litigation against doctors. In addition, many threatened actions do not get to the first stage in litigation and many that are issued are abandoned. Of those actions which do make it to court, on most occasions the doctor is the successful party. As for the damages awarded in medical litigation, contrary to the impression given by the media it is only a very small number of cases that attract a massive damages award.
As previously noted, obstetrics and gynaecology are specialities that have borne the brunt of increases in medical indemnity subscription fees. The perception has been that this has been due to a rapidly increasing number of successful claims. However, a more accurate analysis is that the number of claims have remained the same or have increased only slightly but the awards of damages have increased substantially. This is especially the case in a field such as obstetrics, where a doctor's negligence or lack of concern can have lifelong implications for the child, particularly where he or she is neurologically impaired or severely injured, and this is reflected in the quantum of damages awarded in these cases. A major factor in this burgeoning of the quantum of damages is the cost of future care and increases in life expectancy.
United Medical Protection claims that in the area of obstetrics:
Judgements involving severe personal injuries have increased from around the $1.5 - 2 million range early in the decade to a range of $7 to 12 million in the past two years.
This has meant that, while obstetricians comprise only two per cent of the medical defence organisations' membership, 25 per cent of all claim costs can be attributed to this specialty. This situation is exemplified by the tragic case of Lipovac v. Black involving a GP rather than a specialist obstetrician. Due to a doctor's negligence the plaintiff suffered profound brain damage. As a result, he has been left with the intellectual capacity of a 3-year-old, exhibits profoundly disturbed behaviour and has to be fed through a feeding tube. It means, for example, that the morning feed can take from 2½ to three hours. Tom's condition is such that he is incapable of looking after himself and consequently requires 24-hour supervision.
Damages were awarded on the assumption that Tom had a life expectancy of 60 years. He was awarded total damages of $7,364,345, but the future care component of this was $3,896,807. Nearly $4 million was allocated to future care. This represents more than 50 per cent of the total award. In other words, the future care component of the damages which were awarded to this person more than doubled the total cost of the damages awarded. When seen in their proper context, such large awards are perhaps not necessarily excessive in terms of the future care component. Given this person's condition and need of constant care, it is entirely possible that, rather than being excessive, the award might be exhausted some time before this individual dies. The future care component has greatly increased these damages awards.
The second factor in the dramatically increased subscription fees of medical defence organisations is the decline of cross-subsidisation. Previously, all doctors were charged the same subscription fee by their medical defence organisations, regardless of their area of practice. This meant that those doctors in the lower risk areas of medicine were in effect subsidising those in higher risk specialties. The Chairman of the United Medical Protection society, Dr Richard Tijong, has himself said that this has been a relevant factor. He said, `Subscription fees have gone up because we've differentiated them.' Different levels of fees are now being charged for people in different specialties. People in high risk specialties have to pay a higher subscription rate than people in lower risk areas of medicine. 
The third reason medical indemnity subscription fees have risen so dramatically is that there has been a need to fund the long-term liabilities of the medical defence organisations, which have been largely underfunded in the past. Medical defence organisations in Australia offer `claims incurred' cover. Under this form of cover, a doctor is indemnified against `any claim which arises from an incident which occurred' while she or he was a member of the medical defence organisation. That means that, many years after the doctor has ceased to practice or after the incident occurred, an individual can take out a claim against a medical practitioner, and the medical defence organisation which they belonged to at the time is required to meet the damages bill, which may be very high indeed. This means that the medical defence organisations have needed to build up their financial reserves to provide sufficient funds to meet damages, which may be awarded many years after an incident occurs.
As the Senate Community Affairs References Committee stated in its report, `catch-up' in terms of providing funding for reserves has played a big part in the rises in medical defence organisation premiums in the late 1980s to the 1990s. The Senate report stated that, over the preceding 15 years, there has been a gradual increase in the number of negligence claims, which were largely underfunded by medical defence organisations. They added that, while the incidence and cost of claims rose, the contribution rates remained low.
Despite the extremely large increases in medical defence organisation subscriptions, unfortunately the level of reserves in these organisations remains of great concern. Unfortunately, the 1995 professional indemnity review considered that these reserves were quite seriously insufficient to meet likely demands in the future. Given all of these factors, the upward trend of subscription rates for medical defence fees looks likely to continue unabated. This has significant implications for medical practice around this country and is a major factor, for example, in general practitioners withdrawing from the provision of obstetric services in country areas or withdrawing from surgery and other procedures.

Is the minister aware that last year the owners of the Templestowe Private Nursing Home in Victoria closed the facility owing tens of thousands of dollars to staff, including superannuation entitlements?

There was one of a football, one of a house and even one of a Freddo Frog.
—Madam President, I rise on a point of order. Minister Herron has been asked a serious question on nursing homes. Let's not have an answer about hot-air balloons. Let's get to the question. 
—There are still three and a half minutes, Minister, but come to the question.
—There was not one of Senator Faulkner, but I half expected to see a hot-air balloon of Senator Evans floating around. We kept our promises in relation to the last election, and we are clearing up the mess that the Labor Party left. There are 137,000 people in nursing homes and hostels in this country. There are 3,000 nursing homes and hostels. Senator Collins has asked about a specific issue on superannuation provisions in relation to one. I alluded to the generalities the other day. That is a large number of people, but the reality is that represents about 12 per cent of people over the age of 65 in this country. Nearly 90 per cent of the aged in this country are living independently or with relatives. The overwhelming majority of nursing homes and hostels are very well run, and the overwhelming majority of people working within those nursing homes and hostels are very good people. They have a vocation to work in that area, and there is a difficulty in getting people to work within that vocation.
We introduced three major changes. We had to, as a result of the mess that the Labor Party left us when we came into government. We did away with the old care aggregated module, which the Labor Party gave us, which covered the standard of care that was in nursing homes. We introduced accreditation and, to date, over 330 homes and hostels have been accredited. We certified the buildings. The Labor Party did not do anything about the buildings. We have had the building standards of all the nursing homes and hostels in the country checked. They did nothing. We also introduced a complaints mechanism.
—What happens when they complain? What did you do about it?
—Order!
—People died—30 days and nothing happened.
—Even anonymous calls from Senator Evans—
—Senator Herron, I have called you to order. There are far too many people interjecting, and it is difficult to hear the answer. I would ask you to abide by the standing orders.
—Tell us about the complaints system!
—Senator Evans, when I am speaking and drawing your attention to the standing orders, you should refrain from speaking.
—Even Senator Evans can call up anonymously and make complaints. That is how open it all is. So those complaints are being investigated. Those facts need to be put on the table. In relation to the specific nursing home that Senator Collins asked about, I do not have a brief here. I am happy to refer that to the minister so that we can get a reply.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Nursing Homes: Workers' Entitlements</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer
"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-03-15,"—The answer to that is to get Senator Collins to name them. Come out publicly!

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-03-15,"—My question is to the senator representing the Treasurer. Will the government exempt the unjust GST levy on strata title unit holders payable on the transfer of their quarterly body corporate administration and sinking fund units payments? Senator, 75 per cent of the outgoings from those funds are GST exempt. Will the government continue to be a party to this unjust, undemocratic, discriminatory, Sheriff of Nottingham type legislation?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Body Corporate Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,question
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-03-15,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Senator, where is the fairness? In their 1999-2000 budget, there is a $594 GST component on a gross figure of $27,524. When that is broken down into the quarterly payments that are made of $404.77, it is then exposed to another GST payment of $40.48. Will the minister follow the suggestion of the members of those particular units and either remove the GST from the quarterly payments or allow the unit holders to claim a full tax rebate for the entire amount?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Body Corporate Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-03-15,"—The underlying assumption in the question is totally wrong. This is a very fair system that we are bringing in. I have no doubt that, when you talk about the overall tax cuts, which I have mentioned—and we are not sure what the Labor Party policy is on tax cuts; we know that Senator Cook's policy is that the Labor Party is a high tax party—
—That's not true.
—Senator Cook, that is your third most famous quote, that the Labor Party is a high tax party. I am prepared to stand up later on and dig out the exact quote for you, Senator, if you want me to do that.
Let me just discuss the fairness of the system. The point I am making is that, as a result of this overall package, the Australian people are going to be substantially better off. Senator Harris should be mindful of the fact that we are delivering the largest tax cuts in Australian history. We are delivering real rises in pensions and benefits.
Whatever issue you wish to raise, Senator, you have to look at the whole equation. You should be aware that the people in units and flats and people who own their own homes and so forth are going to benefit very substantially from these changes. So it is wrong for you to say it is unfair. This is a fair system and, above all, it will deliver very real benefits to the Australian people.
I have mentioned the tax cuts. I have mentioned in previous answers the very substantial benefits which are flowing to Australian families. I have mentioned the real rise in pensions and benefits, Senator. I would make the point that, when you are speaking to these people, you have to check whether in fact they will register their corporate body or not, because there will be changes if they are registered or not registered. This will deliver very real benefits to the Australian people, and I think that is the message you should give to them.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-03-15,"—I think the senator is faced with what can only be described as overenthusiastic research staff. I take all questions in this chamber seriously, with the sole exception of those from the Labor Party. If you want that sort of detailed reply to a question, it is sometimes of assistance to give us a hint that you may be asking that so we can look very closely at the figures that you have prepared, Senator.

Leave granted. 
The response read as follows—
On Monday 13 March 2000, (Hansard page 12360) Senator Cook asked me:
Can the Minister confirm that the information response service (IRS) is being established from existing resources in the Tax Office?
Will the Minister indicate from which sections of the Australian Taxation Office that the 800 staff required to operate IRS will come?
I have been advised by the Commissioner of Taxation that at the commencement of the replyin5 service in February 2000, approximately 160 existing staff from GST Technical Advice teams were identified as the available resource base to respond to client requests. To supplement these staff, volunteers were drawn from the Individuals and Small Business lines. Approximately 80 staff from other lines are now on loan to support the replyin5 service. Primarily on-loan staff provide response to ABN and PAYG queries as they relate to Individuals and Small Business clients. Without the single client contact point provided by replyin5 these requests would otherwise need to be addressed by the Individuals and Small Business lines respectively.
Current staff numbers operating the replyin5 service stand at a total of 200.
Applicants for new GST Technical positions are selected through assessment centre processes and it is expected that a proportion of successful applicants will include existing ATO staff together with staff from other Government agencies and the private sector. Current and planned staff numbers for replyin5 have been addressed in staffing and funding forecasts for reform implementation.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Taxation Office: Information Response Service</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,speech

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-03-15,"—I rise to speak on the Dairy Industry Adjustment Bill 2000 and associated bills which are finally before the Senate. I say `finally' because today represents the point when we have to consider in this Senate legislation to give effect to the package plan developed by the Dairy Industry Council to take account of the effects of deregulation of the dairy industry from 1 July this year.
This legislation has been some time in the making. However, I have to say at the outset--and I will return to this later in my remarks--that we in the opposition and, I know, people in the industry and in the states are extremely concerned about the approach adopted by the federal government with respect to this most important issue.
The federal government knew, firstly, that from 1 July this year the Domestic Market Support Scheme—the DMS Scheme, as it is known—would cease to operate by virtue of legislation that had been carried some years ago; and, secondly, that the move to deregulation was inevitable. They had known that for some time--for at least the last year or more. But the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry sat on his hands and did virtually nothing to try to draw together all of the various interests in the industry and the states to bring about an orderly process of deregulation of the dairy industry so that those affected right across the board would be able to cope with that situation.
In October last year, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee handed down its extensive report on deregulation of the Australian dairy industry. This report followed the committee's lengthy inquiry into the likely deregulation of the dairy industry and the plans by the Dairy Industry Council to cope with that situation. The committee has been complimented across the political spectrum from all sides and, indeed, it has been acknowledged by the industry itself and by the various parliaments that the report we issued on that occasion was of invaluable assistance in considering the complex problems and complex issues arising out of deregulation.
We highlighted when debating that unanimous report of the committee our concerns about this government's lax attitude to, and its failure to take a leadership role in, this most important question. I do not need to go over all of that again today, and time does not permit. But, since that report was handed down, we have seen a continuing failure by the government to grab the reins of this issue until the very last possible moment and try to bring about an orderly process of deregulation.
At that time, the industry and the parliament were faced with a situation where the previous Victorian government under Mr Kennett had indicated it would deregulate come hell or high water, if I can use that metaphor for the dairy industry. That, of course, would inevitably—as we found—lead to deregulation in other states. The new Labor government in Victoria decided to consult the dairy farmers in that state as to whether or not they wanted to deregulate. The farmers in that state voted overwhelmingly in favour of deregulation, and that occurred just before Christmas last year. Since that time, the other state governments, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland, have recognised that, given that position in Victoria and given the end of the DMS Scheme, deregulation would have to occur. It has really been only in the last couple of months that the government finally understood how urgent it was to get an agreed process in all states across this industry.
It was only a few weeks ago that the federal minister and the state ministers finally reached agreement on some of these important issues. That is why in the last sitting week before this scheme is due to commence operation—from 1 April this year—we are here today dealing with this legislation. This is legislation that should have been on the table months ago. 
Further to that, as we noted in our legislation committee report on the bill itself that was handed down today, we really only had a chance to look at this complex and detailed legislation in the last two weeks. Indeed, we were still sitting as a committee on Monday and we had to sit again last night to get more information in respect of this legislation.
—We still haven't got it all.
—We do not have it all. All we have received in respect of the ministerial orders that will be attached to this legislation where the detail of how this scheme will operate is drafting instructions. We wanted to see those ministerial orders because the devil will be in the detail.
As we also know, it was only yesterday that we were apprised of the very late decision of the government to finally acknowledge one of the concerns that we raised in our report back in October last year of the need for assistance for those regions that would be affected by deregulation. I understand that the minister and the parliamentary secretary will be enlightening us on that, hopefully, shortly. We have pressed that issue about assistance for regions affected time and time again.
So we find ourselves here today having to debate this legislation because we have to get it through this parliament if this scheme is to be introduced from 1 April. It has to be done hurriedly and in such a short space of time. I know that many members of this Senate would like to have had more time to consider the implications of all that is contained in this plan. This is the biggest single adjustment package or compensation package—as I think probably more correctly describes it—that has ever come before this parliament with respect to an industry. This is a package which comprises $1.8 million of assistance to be paid over the next eight years to people affected by deregulation. That is a huge amount of money. As we know, that $1.8 billion is going to be raised by the imposition of a new tax--called a levy but, in effect, a tax—on consumers of milk of 11c per litre, and that will continue to exist for the next eight years to fund this package.
Time does not permit me to go into all of the complex arrangements as to how this package will operate. But so people understand what we are talking about I want to say that as a result of deregulation—such as the abolition of the quota in quota states and the deregulation of the market milk sector of the industry—dairy farmers will no longer receive a guaranteed price for milk. Competition in the market will take the place of the regulated system we have had for some time. That will inevitably mean that the income from milk producers will fall as a result of there no longer being a guaranteed payment in respect of market milk and manufacturing milk. The manufacturing milk sector has for a number of years had the payment through the DMS Scheme. As I said, that will cease to operate from 1 July. 
In order to assist dairy farmers to cope with that adjustment, that significant drop in income, this package has been put together and payments to people who have an entitlement will be made out of that fund, as I said, on a continuing basis over the next eight years. In effect, it is an income supplement or a payment to compensate, using my words, for that reduction in income, but funded by the consumers through that levy. 
Whilst it is said that deregulation will lead to lower milk prices for the consumer, thus offsetting somewhat the 11c per litre levy, we have no guarantee that that will occur. Previous deregulation in the industry has not necessarily led to reduced milk prices. In fact, if you ask any consumer of milk over the last few years, they will tell you that the price has gone only one way and that is up, notwithstanding deregulation in other parts of the industry beyond the farm gate. As I said, the legislation for this scheme is very detailed and very complex. We are not able to go into all of that detail in speeches on the second reading, but it is set out very well in the committee's report of last October and also in the material provided by the Department of the Parliamentary Library.  
There are a number of points I want to make today and I will be moving a second reading amendment, which has been circulated and which, whilst indicating that the opposition does not oppose the passage of this bill, nevertheless condemns the government on a number of counts. The first point I want to make is: it is still not clear just who will be the winners and losers out of this package. What we do know is that a range of situations are likely to arise where, for instance, lessors—owners of dairy farms who lease their property to others to carry on the milking enterprise—could well find themselves severely affected, firstly, through a drop in the value of their property, because the income that can be earned from the dairy enterprise is no longer guaranteed through regulation, and, secondly, because the leaseholder in certain circumstances would qualify for the majority of the entitlement of the package. We have sought to clarify this, but it still has not really been clarified. 
What we do know is that there can be situations where such leaseholders may take the money and leave the industry and continue to receive that payment over the next eight years. We are concerned that that could lead to some serious inequities arising where the owner of the enterprise—the person who has put up a lot of the capital and years of hard work and investment into that property—because they do not technically qualify for the entitlement because they were not the person or the entity receiving the income from the dairy, will nevertheless be seriously affected. This is an issue that has come to light only in more recent times. To be fair to the department, when we questioned them about it they said, `Yes, this can occur. But the scheme is not designed to attach the entitlement to the property or to compensate for changes in capital value; it is directed to the effects of lost income.' 
We also note that one winner out of this package is the federal government. Originally the package was $1.3 billion. It has now been increased to $1.8 billion approximately, and the additional $500 million has been added essentially so that the government can continue to collect tax on the entitlement—in other words, the government is not going to miss out. Those who receive the entitlement will pay tax. That is fair enough, one could say. But this federal government, whichever way it goes—whoever the winners and losers in this industry will be, and I am not too sure that there will be too many winners—is one group that will not miss out through deregulation. It will continue to ensure that it receives its tax revenue.
There are many other points that I could make, and we may get to those in the committee stage. We are also concerned that no real work has been done, as I said, on the impact on regions. We pointed to a study during our inquiry last year that had been conducted in the Bega district. We have called for the government to promote an investigation of the real impact upon regions and on regional communities. It is not just the dairy farmers that will be affected by deregulation; it will be entire communities, whether they be employees on dairy farms or businesses in towns that depend upon the income derived from that industry. I move:
At the end of the motion add “but that the Senate, whilst supportive of Australia's dairy industry, condemns the Government for:
(a) seeking to push this important bill through the Parliament at the latest possible time, given that it has had the industry package in its hands since April 1999 and endorsed it in September 1999;
(b) failing to articulate a clear vision for the future of the dairy industry;
(c) failing to carry out a proper assessment of the likely impact of deregulation on dairying regions;
(d) imposing a new tax on milk;
(e) failing to make any provision to assist workers in the dairy industry who may lose their jobs as a result of deregulation;
(f) failing to assist in the re-training of farmers and others displaced as a result of deregulation; 
(g) failing to include measures specifically aimed at encouraging investment in new plant and equipment, either on farm or beyond;
(h) failing to include measures aimed at opening up and expanding overseas markets;
(i) failing to include a research and development component within the package;
(j) poor targeting of assistance to farmers; 
(k) failing to develop an adequate mechanism to ensure that consumers benefit from any fall in the price farmers receive for milk, in the face of price increases that have accompanied the removal of state-based regulatory arrangements in the past; and
 (l) failing to ensure an equitable distribution of the package among all those involved in the dairy industry, and particularly between lessors and lessees”.
In conclusion, I want to thank all of those people that have made representations to our committee on this issue over many months. It is a complex and difficult issue. I believe that those representations from right across the industry have certainly assisted us in developing our approach to this legislation. Finally, whilst we support the implementation of this package because it has essentially been developed by the industry, we have reservations about many aspects of it. We can only await how it operates in practice over the following months and years, and I feel sure that we will be back in this parliament having to review parts of it.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-03-15,"—One usually begins a speech such as this by saying, `I welcome the opportunity to speak in this particular debate on these bills,' but I do not welcome that opportunity. I really believe that this is a disaster that we are facing. The bills that we are debating now—which I know most members will vote for—will nevertheless be simply like giving someone who is about to be shot the opportunity to take a pill so that they might survive for another eight years, but in the end their demise is certain. I know that is a very negative way to begin a speech, but that is how I feel about it.
The Democrats remain implacably opposed to deregulation. Let me give you the reasons for that. There will be a loss of farmers from rural Australia—according to ABARE, between another 3,000 and 5,000 farmers. I do not know what this chamber thinks about that, but as far as I am concerned there is no way that rural Australia can continue to sustain those kinds of losses. They are the ABARE figures. Some weeks ago in estimates, I asked the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry what their calculation was, and they admitted that there are probably 4,000 farmers who are `vulnerable'—that was their word. `Vulnerable' is a softer word than saying that 4,000 farmers are about to `cop it in the neck', but `vulnerable' was their word. They indicated to me that they do not believe that all of those 4,000 will go, but if we take either ABARE's or DAFF's figures, then we are facing a disaster in rural Australia. That is a disaster which will happen in spite of the package which we are voting into legislation now. If we did not have the package, there may have been more farmers. This is devastating to rural Australia, and it continues policies which guarantee the continuation of a loss of people and services from the bush and a loss of income amongst rural industries.
I am not pointing the finger at anyone, because I believe no political party has yet taken account of this issue. We continue policies which will guarantee the continuation of the loss of people and services, yet we all wring our hands and are good at the rhetoric. But where are the policies which in fact will reverse this trend? They are not in place in any political party. I am doing my best within my party to make sure they take account of this, but even there it is a bit of a battle at times.
The Prime Minister recently did a trip around rural Australia. I commend him for that; I am not going to criticise him. In fact, I believe that was a very genuine attempt to listen to people in rural communities. He made a promise to rural Australia—again, I believe his promise was completely genuine; he meant it—but it is impossible to keep a promise not to take services out of rural Australia if we continue to see this exodus of people from those communities. At the end of the day, how can you deliver services to communities that do not have any people in them? That is why I say to the Prime Minister: I believe that you are concerned, but all of us are going to have to develop policies that will reverse the trend which is going on, or it will simply continue. 
The second reason why I remain implacably opposed to the deregulation of the dairy industry is that deregulation means a loss of income for dairy farmers. I do not know if there are any exceptions. There may be one or two, but all of the indications, all the evidence we received and everything that we have been told indicates that there will be a loss of income for dairy farmers, but not for processors, not for manufacturers and not for supermarkets. In fact, all of the money which will be lost to dairy farmers will be transferred to the pockets of those who are in charge of processing, manufacturing and supermarkets. The evidence we were given was not denied at any point. That is what will happen. I am opposed to that. I do not believe that we can continue to fatten those in the middle while farmers continue to lose income in this country.
Let me give you what the explanatory memorandum says. This is what the government itself has written and it uses the ABARE figures. I know that there is some dispute about those figures, but I can only accept what the government itself puts in its own legislation. The ABARE figures say that the average restructure payment will be $118,192 over eight years. That equals an average payment to each farmer of $14,774 per year. But ABARE also calculates—and it is in the explanatory memorandum—that the average fall in income per year to each farmer will be $28,350. Even with the package and an average payment of some $14,000, to each farmer who receives that package there will be a loss of $28,000-odd. If you would like it in exact figures, it is a loss of $13,576 per year.
Averages are deceptive, but let me give you some real examples. Dairy Farmers, which is one of the large cooperatives in Queensland, in the Courier-Mail on 1 March 2000 announced that the increase in the price of milk at the retail outlets would be another nine cents a litre. This follows an increase of 6c and 8c a litre in a little over 12 months—a total of 23c a litre increase in the retail price of milk since deregulating post-farm gate last year. That was on 1 March 2000. The next day, on 2 March 2000, a letter was sent to farmers in Queensland telling them the price they would be receiving on 1 July 2000 for their milk. Farmers in North Queensland—and that is the letter I have—were advised that the price per litre for market or liquid milk would drop on 1 July 2000 following deregulation to 41.5c per litre, a drop of around 17c a litre for market or liquid milk. So the next day after the processor was announcing there would be a further increase in the retail price, bringing the retail increases in a little over 12 months to 23c a litre, it was telling farmers that they are going to get a drop of 17c a litre in the price they get for their milk. That is outrageous. It is a scandal and there is no way I can endorse that kind of market power being used in a bullying way towards the people at the bottom of the heap.
Let me tell you about a real farmer. This farmer was in favour of deregulation. He is a very efficient farmer with a high-tech farm. He has actually been overseas on a number of occasions to study genetics and farm technology in order to improve his farming. He told me that six months ago he was in favour of deregulation. He has now done the sums for his farm. He got briefings from his bank and a whole lot of different sources. He gave me a written briefing on his situation. The briefing is backed up by a number of pieces of information. He says:
Current farm situation
546 acre dairy farm supporting four families—
and I will not give you the names—
and farm worker. Milking 260 cows in a 50 stand rotary dairy. Supplementing feeding cows maize silage, grain, whole cottonseed and molasses. Pastures are tropical grasses in summer and rye grass clover in winter, which is planted every year. Annual production of 1.8 million litres supplied to Dairy Farmers operation in Malanda on the Atherton Tablelands. Current lifestyle is getting up at 4.00am in the morning, milking cows, seeing the children half an hour before they go to school, working all day, milking cows again at 4.00pm and getting home about 6.30pm. Every second Sunday afternoon is free. Annual holidays are taken sporadically. Time spent with family is extremely limited. 
The farm has been in that family for three generations. He continues:
The farm was gearing up to milk 300 cows in July moving closer to 330 in late December with a target production of 2 million litres. The farming enterprise had the ability to lease land close by and expand its operations further with a potential to milk 400 cows as the infrastructure is already established to milk those numbers.
We are not talking about a struggling farmer with little prospect of expanding. We are talking about someone who is right up there at the very top of the farming enterprise. This is what he has decided to do:
This family enterprise is going to move out of the dairy industry over the next 12 - 18 months. This decision has been arrived at after attending Dairying Beyond 2000 workshops, discussions with our bank manager, financial adviser and accountant. As we see no future in the dairy industry and the ability for us to get a reasonable return on our capital investment and to have a reasonable lifestyle there is no future for this farming family. It would also mean that the farm workers employment would have to cease, therefore bringing to bear a larger workload and pressure on family members.
Then he goes on and talks about some of the issues that brought him to this decision. He says:
It is imperative to this farming family that we get the compensation package so that we can restructure our lives and move on. Although you will see from the guide—
and he has a lot of other papers attached to this letter—
that our income will drop approximately $90,000,00, the compensation will give us roughly $50,000,00, which is a shortfall of $40,000,00 a year in income.
You can understand why he will take the restructure package, but in fact it will only help him to get out of dairying. This is not a struggling farmer, not somebody who would have exited farming anyway because he was becoming very marginal, but somebody who was expecting in fact to take advantage of deregulation until he did the sums for himself. When he did, this was the decision he made about it.
Like Senator Forshaw, there is an awful lot I would like to say. I want to refer briefly to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report which, as Senator Forshaw said, was a unanimous report. There are a number of recommendations in that report, but it is interesting that the only phrase I ever heard used by the UDV, the ADIC and many other groups pushing deregulation was one single phrase: `The committee believes that deregulation is inevitable.' They quoted that ad infinitum, but never once did they quote the recommendations of that inquiry; never once did they say that we absolutely slammed the review done in Victoria by the National Competition Policy Review Group. None of that was ever mentioned. I find that very interesting. 
As a matter of fact, last Friday at the hearing I asked a member of the ADIC, who is also an employee or a representative of Bonlac—not of the farmers—about that. I said, `Well, you've just told us,' as he did, `that you commend the report.' I said, `Do you also agree with all the recommendations?' He said, `Which one?' I said, `The one which talks about investigating the accountability and transparency of cooperatives'—meaning Bonlac and Goulburn. All of a sudden he was in retreat. The report we had made was not so attractive after all when he heard what some of the recommendations really were. I could say a lot of things about what I think about that but I can see my time is running out.
I turn my attention to the package. I agree that the package is very large. It will raise in the vicinity of $1.8 billion and it will go some way to helping those farmers who will receive a drop in income in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia—they will also lose real property rights in the sense of losing their quotas. It will do something for them, so obviously I have to support it. But that package is inadequate. It will be paid for by farmers at the end of the day. It will be paid for by farmers, because the 11c a litre levy will be all taken up by the fact that farmers will lose somewhere between 11c a litre and, in the case I quoted, 17c a litre. So let us not make any mistake: this package is being paid for by the farmers themselves. That is why, in the second reading amendment I am moving, I have actually picked up some of the recommendations from the Senate report and made them into second reading amendments. I know that that does not have a lot of force, but I want to remind the government of what that Senate report said. 
One of the important things the government have picked up at the last moment—and let me give them perhaps half a tick for that—is the issue of regional assistance. We have had overwhelming evidence that the impact on some communities that are heavily dependent on dairying for their income will be seriously affected by deregulation. I want to pay a tribute here—it has not been done before, and I apologise to him for that—to Henry Palaszczuk, the agriculture minister for Queensland in the Labor government. He has done a lot of work on this whole issue of the impact on regional communities. I pay tribute to him that he took to the ARMCANZ meeting a proposal which was not taken up—or I thought it wasn't. I sought to put that into an amendment, but late yesterday afternoon the government came to me and said they agreed that Minister Palaszczuk's idea should be taken up. They have proposed an additional $45 million which will be taken out of the money collected by the levy, because it is not all going to be spent on reimbursing farmers. I pay tribute to Henry Palaszczuk, because he did a lot of work on this because of his concern not only for farmers but for all the other people in these communities who depend upon farming, who give all of the support services. His proposal was worked out in great detail and was a very rational one. I do not know if the government want to recognise the work he did, but I certainly do. I apologise to him that when I was drafting the amendment I had not notified him of that or given him as much credit for it as perhaps I should have. I am glad that the government have agreed themselves to amend the legislation and that that amendment will put another $45 million back into those communities which will be so seriously affected by deregulation.
At the end of the day, I know that the Labor Party and the government will vote for this package. I must say I really felt so angry about this that I was going to vote against the package, but my vote would have been irrelevant and, certainly, I want to support the package in the sense that if there is no other way of helping farmers we would want to at least help them to the extent that the package will. But I register again that both the Democrats and I are opposed to the proposition that we deregulate an industry and transfer millions of dollars from farmers straight to processors, manufacturers and probably supermarkets as well and the fact that consumers will get no benefit from that deregulation. Although I know there are some people sort of saying perhaps they will benefit, the cow might fly over the moon. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>DAIRY ADJUSTMENT LEVY (EXCISE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,2000-03-15,"—I too rise to speak on the Dairy Industry Adjustment Bill 2000 and related bills. I want to say at the very start I do not believe there was anybody on the committee who, if they had had another choice, would have ended up with a situation where the dairy industry was being deregulated. But we, as policy makers, also have to face reality. There is little point in talking about `we are doing this' or `that is happening' or something else because at the end of the day for their own commercial reasons the Victorians decided they were going to deregulate. That is a simple fact. Mr Kennett announced it some time ago. Mr Bracks when he became Premier fiddled around at the edges of it and had a referendum on the issue, knowing full well that the Victorian dairy farmers would vote for the package and vote for deregulation. That is the reality that we have to face.
This parliament, this government, or any party had no say whatsoever in terms of that. Our position, our role, as a government was to look at the issue and determine how we could assist in what was being foisted on the industry because of the action at that time by the Victorians. I do not blame the Victorians for that because, obviously, there is a commercial benefit to them in it. They do produce two-thirds of the total milk produced in Australia, and they were in a totally different situation to the rest of Australia. Once that decision was made by the Victorians it was inevitable, as Senator Woodley has mentioned, that the dairy industry in Australia would be deregulated in a price sense. 
Every other state could have remained regulated if they had so chosen and ran an authority in their own state, but the fact is that as milk moved across the border and around Australia the price would be set by that Victorian milk. While the domestic market price, as I believe it probably always will do, remains above export prices—of course the first and only most attractive market, starting with New South Wales, is Sydney, then probably South Australia or Queensland and then, last of all, Western Australia—the milk would come in. So there is no doubt that we were facing a situation whereby the dairy industry was going to be deregulated regardless of what the other states did, regardless of what the Commonwealth government did.
So we, as a government, really had just one choice. We could decide to stay back, stay away from it, do nothing and wait for the outcome, or we could develop—as was done mainly with Mr Pat Rowley on behalf of the industry—a package to assist the transition from an industry that had been regulated by the states for many years to a situation where the industry was going to be deregulated right across Australia. I think when people debate this they need to recognise that simple fact. If you cannot recognise that, then the comments made in terms of the changes in the Australian dairy industry get totally distorted. And I think that is one of the sad things about politics, because everybody has to put their particular angle to suit their political situation at that time, and I am quite certain if we were actually having this discussion over a beer in one of the bars downtown everybody would agree with what I have just said. I just wish in terms of bringing this debate to the fore that people would recognise this. And I will repeat it: once Victoria made the decision to deregulate, the whole country was going to be deregulated, and the date just happens to be 1 July.
The Commonwealth has responded to requests from the industry with a $1.8 billion package. It is unprecedented in Australian history. We heard mentioned earlier on—I think it was from Senator Forshaw—that it was a tax under the guise of a levy. I think that is what he said, to be quite correct. The dairy industry is quite familiar with levies. It has had them for a whole range of schemes over the years. Of course, under the new circumstances I believe this will be the last levy in this form applied nationally, right across Australia. As has already been said, it is an 11c levy for eight years.
But can I also say that while there are going to be some huge difficulties for a whole range of people in terms of this, I believe that the dairy industry in Australia—and I particularly refer to my state—has a very sound long-term future. I believe the dairy farmers in Australia are so efficient and so good at what they do that they will adjust to the requirements. They will become much more dependent over the years on the development of the export market. They will become much more like our grains industry, our beef industry, our wool industry, and they will bring a lot of wealth to this country. This package is designed to help them get to that situation, to help them get through the tough times.
Not everybody is going to survive. We know that. It is impossible to expect everybody to survive. But let me just say it is my understanding that the Victorian industry was on the edge of major reform and the necessity to expand in terms of the ratio between exports and what is consumed domestically. If we look at the Victorian situation, 93 per cent of that milk—the 66 per cent of the total Australian production that they produce—was export milk anyhow. It was made into product to go overseas. Only seven per cent was consumed locally. That figure may not be precisely right, but it is right fair square in the ballpark. Obviously they made some flavoured milks and other product that did go into some of the other states. But it is my strong belief that over time we will see a very healthy and strong dairy industry. 
Let me say that, going back to the Kerin plan, the aim of that plan was to prepare the Australian industry for the fact that they had to focus more on the export market and the growth of that export market if they were going to expand and continue to grow, and of course that is what happened. Had there not been an Asian crisis, as there was, and the breakdown of many of those economies where our industry had focused their efforts in exporting, the situation today would not be quite as difficult as it is. But I think we can see many of the countries in Asia coming out of some of their particular problems, improving their economies and starting to grow again. Of note is that about a month ago, or maybe three weeks ago, I happened to read in a press statement from one of these companies—I think it was in Victoria, but that does not matter—that it had signed a $6 million milk powder agreement for additional exports to Japan. That is the way of the future, and I think we need to recognise that.
Senator Woodley said many things and we could go over and over them again, but I particularly wish to go over some of the report recommendations—which Senator Woodley mentioned very briefly—from the committee that he chaired. The fact that we had that inquiry at that particular time certainly made my job as chair of the legislation committee and the jobs of the members of that committee, who are substantially the same people as were on Senator Woodley's committee, much easier because a lot of the groundwork had been done. Recommendation 1 stated that:
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry call, as a matter of urgency, a meeting of state Agriculture and Regional Development Ministers to determine a framework, and a timeframe, for the co-ordinated deregulation of the Dairy Industry.
Our minister—and I particularly refer to Minister Truss—responded to that recommendation very positively, but it took until 23 December for all the agricultural ministers to agree to attend that meeting. It is well and truly publicly known that there were other attempts, going back to Minister Vaile, to convene a meeting of state ministers. Some chose not to cooperate—not to come—and I have dealt with that issue before, so I will not repeat it. Recommendation 2 stated:
That should administrative arrangements not be in place in time to make the first payments by 1 July 2000, that appropriate compensatory arrangements are factored into the payment schedules, in order that dairy farmers do not suffer any more financial hardship than is presently envisaged.
I thank the people in this debate—from the Labor Party and the Democrats—for the fact that we are getting on to this legislation today in a very short time in terms of delivering the legislation report so that these arrangements do happen and the first payments are ready to go on 1 July. The first payments, as I understand it, will start on 28 September. Recommendation 3 stated:
That the states of Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia consider the issue of quota entitlements and any form of compensation that may be appropriate for the resumption of quota entitlement, including the possibility of using NCP payments as compensation. 
What has happened there? One state has responded: my state, Western Australia. At this point in time an additional $37 million has been put on the table—$27 million of that will be direct from government resources and the other $10 million, which is held in the statutory authority, the Dairy Industry Authority, has been delivered. No other state, including Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia—I might as well name the lot—has responded at all to add to what the Commonwealth has done. I say to the people involved in this, concerning the pressures they could have applied as federal members to their state governments, that they have let their dairy farmers down. That disappoints me enormously. But we, in Western Australia, engaged with our Premier and the Minister for Agriculture, Monty House—as did, obviously, the dairy industry—and I think we have produced quite a remarkable result in terms of our state responding to the particular situation there. 
On recommendation 4, which Senator Woodley mentioned, concerning the regional adjustment packages, once again the Commonwealth has responded to that. While I note what Senator Woodley said about the agriculture minister for Queensland—and I certainly recognise his efforts—there were a lot of other people who were also in negotiation with the government from our side of the parliament. I do not know what the other side did or what the Democrats did, but certainly our people, who represent dairy farmers, put in a lot of effort in terms of our party room, our minister and the Prime Minister to make sure that, having recognised there were going to be some difficulties as far as regional adjustment was concerned, we got a package up that will be administered through the program that Mr Reith is responsible for. That needs noting.
Recommendation 5 refers to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. While the government has not responded exactly to that recommendation, in this bill we have put in place a mechanism whereby there will be funding to the ACCC to monitor retail prices. Once again, the government has responded to that particular resolution, although not in the precise manner as set out in that recommendation. Recommendation 6 is outside the particular legislation before us, so I will not deal with it at this particular time.
In winding-up my comments, because I know I have other colleagues who wish to speak on this particular legislation, I want to reiterate some of the comments that I made at the beginning—that is, that while I recognise that things will be difficult and I would have preferred not to have had a situation of deregulation, that was not the reality of life. We, as a government, have responded in a way that reflects the reality of life, and that is one of the things that you have to take on in being the elected government of the country. Other people can take a different attitude or a different position, but in our particular case we did not have that choice.
I would also like to raise a couple of other points about lessors and lessees. We were notified at a very late stage of our deliberations that there might be some problems with their particular situation. I have certainly taken note of that and I have listened. I am not sure how the government could have responded differently from the way it has done, but I am quite certain that if anomalies and problems come up in terms of that and if there is unfairness—I am not sure that there is but, equally, I cannot say that I am certain that there is not—we will find a way to deal with it.
In dealing with that particular aspect, I want to make the point here right now that, in terms of lessors and lessees and the exit package, both parties will be eligible for the full $45,000 in terms that they choose if they both choose to exit. If only one chooses to exit, then one will get the $45,000 and the other will continue in the industry or do something else with his money.
—Subject to the means test.
—Yes, we know that. It is all consistent with other relief measures. It has to be. I did not think it was necessary to re-emphasise that particular point because I know the people involved in this chamber and the people listening to this particular debate are aware of that. With the time we have left, the detail of many things that we would like to do cannot be done today. Having said all of that, I am certainly very appreciative of my minister for agreeing almost totally with the recommendations that we put forward as a references committee in a unanimous report. It is not a committee that the government has the majority on, but it nonetheless looked at the issue very carefully. I wish to reiterate what I said earlier: despite the difficulties that will be faced initially by the dairy industry, I think if I were still going to be here in 10 years time—and I will not be—I could make a speech or my successor could make a speech about the success of the dairy industry and how it has become a giant in terms of export capacity in this country. ",SENATE,<title>DAIRY ADJUSTMENT LEVY (EXCISE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-03-15,"—I can agree with a number of things that Senator Crane has said today. I certainly have the view that there are parts of the existing dairy industry which will blossom under the deregulated regime. I do not think, during all of the Senate references committee inquiry, the view was ever taken—certainly not from the committee's point of view nor from the point of view of the majority of witnesses—that deregulation would lead to the total collapse of the industry. Nevertheless, it was accepted by everyone that deregulation without an adjustment package would be a disaster for many sectors of the dairy industry. That is the reason the opposition are supporting this legislation. We are also mindful, given that deregulation takes effect on 1 July this year, that it is important for the timely passage of this legislation. The opposition, however, would not take the view that just any piece of legislation should pass, given that we are talking about something in the vicinity of $1.8 billion being levied against consumer milk over the next eight years to pay for the adjustment package, which is the subject of this legislation. Of course that should be given proper consideration. I think the officers of the department have done a very good job in the time that they have had available to them of putting in place, through legislative measures and sublegislative measures, the policy of the government. Unfortunately, the policy of the government has taken a long time to come together.
Listeners to this debate should be aware that the genesis of the timetable for this deregulation was established in 1995. It was decided in 1995 that the DMS scheme, a financial support scheme that provided compensation for the continuation of regulation of market milk in certain states, would be discontinued on 1 July this year. It was clearly known that the pressures were very strong, certainly in Victoria but also in other places, for the deregulation of the market milk market and of the industry generally. When this government came to power in early 1996, it had before it an agenda for the deregulation of the dairy industry. One would have thought, given the importance of this sector to Australian rural industries and to rural and regional Australia—what this government purports is one of its important constituencies—that this government would take it upon itself to drive the transition to deregulation, to establish policies to consider the impact of deregulation, to look at the impact on regional and rural Australia, to look at the impact on our export performance and to look at measures which might make the implementation of deregulation easier in the parts of Australia which inevitably would be worst affected by the deregulation measures. Did that happen? No. There was no action from this government.
We have the situation where the Australian Dairy Industry Council, representing dairy farmers, processors and manufacturers, has been forced to use its resources to put together what is essentially the package of measures, though obviously with some amendment, that is contained in this piece of legislation. It drove government policy because no-one in the government was driving it. It put to this government in April last year its proposal for an adjustment package. One would have to say that the Australian Dairy Industry Council has done a very good job for the constituencies that it represents. It took into account the issues that face the dairy industry and rural and regional Australia and came up with a measure which it thought would moderate the most severe effects of deregulation and provide an adjustment package which would enable the dairy industry to continue to grow and to remain a significant part of Australian rural industry, a significant exporter and an efficient industry.
The Dairy Industry Council put a package to the government in April last year, and it took the government until September to decide that they could support that package—with some changes, but it was essentially that package. In the context of that, what else was happening? The opposition proposed that there be an inquiry into the dairy industry to look at the issues; to lay them out for the government. Whatever the government knew, it was clear that there was not enough information on the public record to drive a public debate on this issue, given that we are talking about—and have been since at least April last year—a very large adjustment package which involves the implementation of a measure which is essentially a tax on the white milk market, the drinking milk market, which has to flow into the price effect for milk over the next eight years. It is a tax on milk. 
The opposition is supporting it because there is no alternative. The driving of this policy by the industry was met with a response from the government which was essentially to say, `You come up with a package and, if we find it acceptable, we'll support it.' When the government found it acceptable, they said, `Now, you go and sell it to the states.' There is no question who was driving this policy. It was not the government; it was the dairy industry. Alongside that, the actions of the opposition, with the support of the Democrats—and Senator Crane and other government members of the committee—ultimately played an important part in laying out the facts and in taking to the dairy industry and the people of Australia the issues with which they would be faced from 1 July this year and for the ensuing eight years.
The opposition amendment moved by Senator Forshaw, which condemns the government, is supported by the facts. I reject Senator Crane's suggestion that somehow the government was doing its best to process this package. It clearly has not done enough. It has put the department in the invidious position of trying to meet the policy objectives of the government in the processing of this legislation in an extremely short time. It has also put the Senate legislation committee in an invidious position. Let me tell the chamber of the timetable for the legislation—and there are four bills; this is substantial legislation. The legislation was passed by the House of Representatives on 2 March. Under the processes of the parliament, it went to the Selection of Bills Committee in the Senate on 7 March, where it was referred to the Senate legislation committee, which held a hearing on 10 March, three days after the bill was referred.
It was necessary to hold a further hearing last night, at 6 o'clock, to take further evidence about measures which are not contained in the bill but which relate to the package to be implemented and for the committee to report today so that we could debate the bill this afternoon. The opposition and the Democrats have facilitated an early debate of this bill because we understand the need for urgency and we understand the need for the proposed timetable to be met if it is at all possible. We believe that it can be met. But it should be on the record that that is no thanks to the government. There are aspects of the package—and I think Senator Crane touched upon them in part—which are not, in the view of many members of the Senate committee, properly or adequately dealt with in the legislation.
I now want to touch briefly on the question of the package as it relates to lessors and lessees in the dairy industry—that is, the owners of dairy properties and those who have operated them under lease for the past period and certainly at the critical time at the end of September last year. When the committee brought this matter on for inquiry, the only group which did not support the totality of the legislation was a group of people representing lessors in the dairy industry, particularly in the pooled milk states, such as Victoria and to an extent Tasmania. Those states where the bulk of compensation relates to milk which is not used for the white milk market but is used for manufactured products—butter, cheese, powdered milk, et cetera—feel that the package is inequitable, that it leaves them in a situation where they will not be able to hang on to properties in the dairy industry and that the compensation designed as adjustment payments for the dairy industry will, in many cases, go to people who had no long-term commitment to the industry and who are effectively treating the payments that they will receive from this legislation as a lottery or Tattslotto win, something that they did not expect to receive. In particular cases, those people had already determined that they would leave the dairy industry and were then finding, having made that decision, that a payment would be made to them from the adjustment package because they happened to be in the industry at the end of September 1999. I believe in some cases they may have been in the industry for only a very short period of time and may have had no intention of remaining in the industry for any foreseeable period in the future. 
I do not want to be critical of the Dairy Industry Council. They have had a difficult job in preparing a package, negotiating a package with the government and seeking to refine that package, particularly in the light of the comments made by the Senate references committee on the treatment of sharefarmers and lessees. They have done a good job in difficult circumstances, but the fact of the matter is that the legislation committee had drawn to its attention anomalies which, in my view, are not adequately dealt with in the legislation and which do not appear to have been addressed satisfactorily in the drafting instructions for the ministerial orders which, we are told, will be made consequent upon this bill to flesh out the package for the purpose of its implementation.
I will be returning to that matter in the committee stage of this bill to make some inquiries of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who will be handling the debate for the government, and perhaps even to make some suggestions as to how that matter might be resolved. Some may ask: why isn't the opposition moving amendments now to correct that problem? Indeed, this is a matter that I have addressed directly with the Dairy Industry Council. The opposition's view is that this is complex legislation, and the relationship between the various parts of the package referred to in the legislation ought not be tampered with without great care lest there be unintended consequences from an amendment proposed in the short time the opposition had to consider any amendment to this legislation. 
However, we would be proposing that the government accept finally its responsibility for dealing with this issue equitably and properly; that it look at the type of evidence which the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee received; that it discuss with the industry alternative measures which might be put in place to deal with those concerns; that it consider the relevance of the measures in the bill to those circumstances; that it consider the case of the lessor-lessee arrangements, particularly as it relates to the non-premium milk component package; and that it perhaps take into consideration, for the purpose of assessing eligibility, issues such as the timing of the cut-off date, the period during which any lessee might have reasonably expected to have been in the dairy industry, given the lessor-lessee arrangement, and any capital contribution by the lessor as opposed to the capital contribution by the lessee. There were clearly differences in the evidence before the committee which, in some cases, might militate in favour of a change to the distribution of the adjustment package. And, obviously, using the expertise of the department, the government should consider how that might be addressed without making some unintended adjustment to other aspects of the package. 
It may be that the Dairy Industry Council is prompted to say, `If you are going to do these things in one area, you might do them in another.' They are matters that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has to consider, but the minister has to take his government's responsibility for getting this measure right. We have to understand that this package—a measure involving $1.8 billion—is going to be implemented in this legislation and, once implemented, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to change it by the time the first payment is made. The government needs to act and act quickly. If it believes that changes are necessary, it needs to advise the dairy industry and the Australian public that perhaps the bill is going to have to be amended—if that is the case—before people develop an expectation that they are going to receive payments as of 1 July when it might be found that the current proposal ought to be changed in some respects. The government has time to do that. Only the government has the time and the opportunity to do that. Just as the government has had the cooperation of the opposition in relation to the expeditious passage of this legislation, the government can expect that any fair and equitable proposal it might bring before the parliament will be given the same favourable treatment by the opposition—on the basis, of course, that it is fair and equitable. 
I think it is appropriate, given the short amount of time that I have left, to say this: the government should not receive a pat on the back for what it has done with this legislation because, as I said, the government has been allowing this major policy issue to be driven by the industry without giving it much assistance. It has put its own department in the invidious situation of implementing a greatly delayed government initiative in a very short timeframe and in circumstances where delay would have been costly to the Australian dairy industry. The figures we were given were that, for every day of delay, we are talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars being lost to the dairy industry. The government should not be patted on the back. 
The opposition has moved an amendment which condemns the government. I think the list of items in that amendment are all appropriate. The time that I have remaining this afternoon does not allow me to address them all. However, one that should be addressed in the last 60 seconds of my speech goes to this very issue of the impact of the levy on the price of milk for consumers. I think the government should act—and should have acted before today—to develop an adequate mechanism to ensure that consumers, as well as farmers, benefit from any fall in the price farmers receive for their milk in the face of price increases that have accompanied the removal of state based regulatory arrangements in the past. In other words, let us not have a deregulation which leads to all of the benefits going not to the farmers and not to the consumers but to the companies in the middle who take a price or to the supermarkets who may, because of their market position, be able to drive the price to them down but keep the price to consumers up. ",SENATE,<title>DAIRY ADJUSTMENT LEVY (EXCISE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2000-03-15,"—I wish to make some brief comments on the Dairy Industry Adjustment Bill 2000 that is before the Senate. I would have thought those final comments by Senator O'Brien were somewhat of an argument not to have deregulation. The government cannot be criticised for their timing of this legislation. We have done everything right. To say that the government have not consulted with the industry is wrong. The industry has been in constant consultation with the current Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, and with Minister Vaile before him. There have been doors opening and shutting on this issue for the past 12 months. The fact that the legislation will pass through the Senate this evening—that is, in March—and deregulation occurs on 3 July will mean that there is plenty of time to put the package in place and prepare for deregulation. 
What we have before us is the largest package of compensation or restructure—whatever you want to call it—in the history of primary industry. This is the largest deregulation in primary industry history. It would dwarf any of the former deregulations in the tobacco industry, the citrus industry or the pig industry. It is worthy that this package matches the size of the industry. It is perhaps the largest and last. It would probably match the wool industry deregulation when the floor price scheme was abolished. The wool industry, regrettably, received no compensation, no adjustment package, when those opposite were in government. It was a disgraceful effort that the industry is still suffering from. There was no thought given to an adjustment package at that time. This government has in place the largest adjustment package in primary industry history. 
Perhaps we have learnt the lessons of the past. One thing wrong with the winds of deregulation that have run through primary industries over the last 15 to 20 years is that governments present and past and parliaments present and past have not had a sufficient adjustment, safety net package in place for the rural sector to meet those changes. I particularly point out the citrus industry. It did not have the sort of adjustment package it should have had when those opposite were in government. That is something I have always thought about. The pig industry did, because we were in government and increased their package.  
The point is that this package should not be criticised but be praised, Senator Forshaw. It is a package of $1.74 billion. It tips over the $2 billion mark with the recent announcement by the minister that there will be a $45 million Dairy Community Assistance Program on top of the $1.7 billion package. Funding will be delivered through the federal government's Regional Assistance Program and will assist dairy communities with new industry development and adjustment programs. The funds will be raised through the eight-year 11c levy on milk prices. The funding will be available for seeding new industries, supporting counselling services and retaining community infrastructure. It will go to the estimated 15 regional communities most affected by this deregulation. 
It needs to be said that we are dealing not only with one of the largest primary industries in Australia but also with an efficient industry. Over the last 20 years this industry has gone through adjustment and great change. It has had to keep pace with technology, with rising costs and with very static returns. There has already been a reduction in the number of dairy farms. I believe it has declined from some 30,000 in 1974 to 14,000 in the year 2000. Herd sizes have increased from an average of 77 in 1975 to around 150 in 1998. Of significance are improved herd genetics as well as the advances in pastoral management and supplementary feeding regimes which have seen the average annual yield per cow increase. 
This is already a very efficient industry. So it would beg the question, as the infuriated Senator Woodley asked: why are we deregulating? Why would you tamper with such an efficient industry? That was a question I asked also, and I am from the state of Victoria. Why would you tamper with an efficient industry and an industry that epitomises so much the family farm? There is no other primary industry that is made up so much of family farms, which are efficient, economic and social units. It is where my party started from. It was the dairy industry in Victoria which created the Country Party in 1920. 
The answer to that question lies with the industry in Victoria. There is no question about it: this is a Victorian driven issue. I do not think the other states, least of all Queensland, and the dairy farmers in Bega, want deregulation. It has been thrust upon them by the Victorian industry, as pronounced by the industry body, the UDV. They were out there some time ago pushing the virtues of deregulation because they felt the Victorian industry was very much restricted. It was only able to produce seven per cent of the market milk. In a nutshell, they wanted to be able to cross the border into the very lucrative Sydney market. 
With the Commonwealth domestic market support scheme terminating in July 2000, and with obligations with regard to national competition, they felt it was time to act. During Doug Anthony's time, we saw a push by the Victorian industry to cross the border into the lucrative Sydney market. That has been halted. This time it looks like it is really going to happen. The atmosphere and the economy have changed. The UDV, which represents the Victorian dairy farmers, has now decided that deregulation is on the cards. It has now become inevitable. You can argue about the question, but the result of the referendum that went around the Victorian farmers was a unanimous yes for deregulation. 
The two Victorian state governments—the previous Liberal-National Party state government and the existing Labor state government—you would have to say support deregulation. So that is a pretty convincing case for all those who may have been sceptics and for all those who will not accept that deregulation will be beneficial for the industry as a whole, and I would have to say to Senator Woodley that that is a pretty convincing case for why deregulation has become inevitable. 
But there will be a social cost, and that is even recognised in the explanatory memorandum. We know there will be a social cost, no less than across the border in New South Wales in the Bega Valley, where they could lose as many as 30 per cent of their dairy farmers. In Victoria, over a certain time that we are not sure of—perhaps five years—as many as 2,000 farmers could exit the industry. That is exactly why we have this package in place. This package's broad regulatory objective is to facilitate and coordinate a very orderly adjustment in the dairy industry so as to maximise the long-term benefits of deregulation while minimising the very short-term costs that will be brought about, such as through the many farmers exiting the industry and facing income reductions. 
The payments to farmers are to be administered by an independent statutory body known as the Dairy Adjustment Authority. This authority will receive administrative support from the Dairy Corporation but retain full independence in its decision making and accountability. A key feature of the adjustment package is that it will be funded from a Commonwealth levy on sales of liquid milk products over a target period of up to eight years. The levy is to be imposed at retail with collection by milk processors. Full deregulation is expected to initially result in significant reductions in farm incomes, with some consequential level of industry dislocation.
The key stakeholders likely to be affected by deregulation are the farmers. ABARE estimate that the impact of deregulation would be an average annual per farm fall in income of $28,000. So the package is designed to assist farmers to adjust to this fall in income and, in doing so, secure the long-term benefits of deregulation. It is estimated that in my own state of Victoria the package will on average pay $95,000, while in Western Australia it is expected to average $240,000. 
While the farmers are winners and losers in this, the manufacturers and processors are the winners, I would think. That is why they have been very much at the forefront of pushing deregulation, although a little too much. I must say that one of the things that came out of this that I was surprised at—and perhaps I should have known, but I confess my ignorance—was that the federal body that represents the dairy farmers, the farm gate, is actually made up not just of farmer representatives but of processors. I would have thought, particularly on this issue, that there was a conflict of interest. 
At our last committee hearing, when we were discussing the intricacies of this particular package, the nuts and bolts of it, no less than the issue of lessors and lessees, we had before us not a representative of the dairy industry--far from it--but a representative of the cooperatives, Mr Hughes. I would have thought they could have at least found a dairy farmer representative to come before us. I recognise Mr Hughes in the gallery, but I have to make that point. I would have thought the ADIC should have a greater representative of dairy farmers or there should be a separate dairy farmer federal body. 
As explained in the explanatory memorandum, there will be a shift of income towards the manufacturers and the processors. In regard to the wholesalers and retailers, the explanatory memorandum states:
It is anticipated that wholesalers and retailers will benefit from the flow on effects of lower input prices for liquid milk products and, with the abolition of the manufacturing milk levy, lower prices for dairy products.
As for the consumers in all of this, that is going to be a very long-term benefit, but the explanatory memorandum states: 
Accordingly, it is believed deregulation will eventually provide substantive benefits to consumers.
All in all, the legislation before us is timely, it is hugely significant and it is the largest package ever in primary industry. It is to be supported, and I support the legislation.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY ADJUSTMENT LEVY (EXCISE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-03-15,"—The state agriculture ministers agreed in principle on 3 March last to remove milk pricing arrangements from 1 July 2000. That means that the deregulation of dairy farm gate pricing arrangements will now take place. This government has responded to the likelihood of deregulation by proposing an adjustment package which will assist dairy farmers to respond to the sudden and significant changes ahead in an orderly way which will minimise hardship and provide exit opportunities for those farmers wishing to leave agriculture. 
Before I go on to make a few remarks about what we are providing through that package, I would like to briefly comment on some of the remarks made by other senators. Senator O'Brien and Senator Forshaw made some castigating remarks about the intention of the government and how we should have moved much earlier to do this and how we have moved to do this. I would like to remind those two senators that the intention of the government is to give industry control of its own affairs, as we have done with the meat industry and as we have done with the wheat industry. I believe the dairy industry is to be commended in this case for the leadership it has shown, and I would like to recognise those dairy industry leaders who are present with us today.
They have been very instrumental in educating their members of the need for this package, highlighting its advantages and constantly communicating with the government about the way the package is to operate. As I have said, I would like to commend them for the leadership that they have shown. But for Senator O'Brien to say that the government has not shown any leadership is a misinterpretation of leadership. The government's role in determining industry policy has not been to tell industry what to do. Rather, it has been to facilitate the process, to listen to industry, to hear what it had to say and then to put into place a workable operation which would provide industry with what it needs. We believe that that is what has happened.
The dairy industry adjustment package is a total cost of $1.74 billion, and it will provide a dairy structural adjustment payment worth a total of $1.63 billion to help farmers adjust to the new market, paid in 32 instalments over eight years. Those payments, available to eligible persons involved in dairying on 28 September 1999, will provide significant assistance to both individuals and regions that are dependent on dairying. Not only that, we have a Dairy Exit Program worth $30 million which will provide a tax-free grant of up to $45,000 for those eligible producers who wish to exit agriculture and an 11c per litre dairy adjustment levy on drinking milk products to fund the Dairy Industry Adjustment Program.
In the development of this package, a number of issues have been raised both by industry representatives and the broader dairy community. One thing is very clear, however: if deregulation occurs, this adjustment package will be vital to maintaining the continuing growth of the Australian dairy industry overall, but it will also assist individual producers to respond to deregulation. This is an adjustment package. It is not intended to compensate for the removal of regulated arrangements or to provide income support. As I said, it will assist producers to adjust to the changing circumstances with dignity and in an orderly fashion, improve industry performance and, in turn, maintain and increase job opportunities and incomes in regional dairy areas.
In relation to any compensation issues, it is the government's clear view that it is now up to the states to address issues that are the direct consequence of states removing farm gate pricing arrangements, and that includes quota compensation. The package addresses issues which have been brought about largely through the existence of state market milk arrangements, and it is up to the states to provide additional input if they see it is necessary. The government is conscious that the Commonwealth's taxing powers will contribute all the funds towards assisting the industry to adjust to the removal of state arrangements while the states will receive national competition policy payment for their dairy reforms.
However, we are aware of the very real concern about the impact on dairy farming communities. To address this concern, I will later be introducing an amendment on behalf of the government that will establish the Dairy Regional Assistance Program. This program will provide a total of $45 million available as payments of up to $15 million per year for three years beginning on 1 July 2000. It will be a subprogram under the Regional Assistance Program and be administered by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. It will be funded from the dairy industry adjustment package and met from the levy of 11c per litre on liquid milk. Funding under that program will be provided primarily to supplement private sector investment to assist employment generating projects in affected regions. It will focus on supporting initiatives to create long-term employment, retraining, counselling and community infrastructure and services. 
Restructuring will have significant economic and social impacts on regional communities reliant on dairy farming. Reduced returns to dairy farmers and declining employment opportunities impact on the viability of other businesses and services. The Regional Assistance Program will be directed at assisting those dairy dependent communities considered to be at risk following deregulation and assist them to become self-reliant.
It is inevitable that, in any assistance program of this nature, there will be individual producers who are concerned about their eligibility for payments from the package. The eligibility criteria were arrived at after extensive discussions with dairy industry leadership, and they are the result of a careful balancing of the levels of entitlement to the adjustment pressure they will face. The Dairy Adjustment Authority will be charged with making the determinations on eligibility for all applicants, and the vast majority of producer eligibility and entitlement are expected to be determined without dispute by the Dairy Adjustment Authority. However, disputes will arise in some cases and the Dairy Adjustment Authority will need to resolve them on the basis of clear guidelines and principles.
Other producers may not for various reasons be technically eligible for entitlements, even though they are current producers and were delivering milk during the 1998-99 financial year. The Dairy Adjustment Authority may determine eligibility for these producers, taking into account the individual merits of each case. Of course, an appropriate appeals mechanism has been established in the legislation for those producers who are not satisfied with the Dairy Adjustment Authority's determination. I will also later be moving a technical amendment on a matter that has been brought to the government's attention since this bill passed through the House of Representatives. This amendment brings this bill into line with the Australian criminal law policy in relation to dealing with confidential information.
Finally, I would like to congratulate those dairy industry leaders who recognised in advance the commercial forces facing the industry and examined the options to deal with these pressures. The coherent strategy that they developed was presented to the government and demonstrated to our satisfaction that that strategy had the support of the majority of industry.
I would now like to consider the two second reading amendments that have been presented by the opposition and Senator Woodley respectively. Taking firstly the second reading amendment that was moved by Senator Forshaw: there is no substance to this amendment and this provides no constructive input. The one true remark Senator Forshaw or Senator O'Brien did make was that this is a very complex industry and that it was the states' choice to deregulate, and that is why the government has moved in the way it has. 
In response to (a), in the end, there was a limited time frame for the development of this legislation because the decision to deregulate in Victoria was delayed until late December because of the state election. That is why we were anxious to know the opinion of industry rather than depend on what we were being told. So it was very necessary for that plebiscite to happen. Following that development, state ministers, who are, after all, responsible for deregulation, have only recently agreed to deregulate at the ARMCANZ meeting last Friday. 
In response to (b), this package is designed specifically to assist producers adjust to the needs of the future and take the opportunities which exist in export markets. The package is proactive. It anticipates the need for change to improve efficiency and it is in the interests of all who rely on it for income. Far from not being visionary, we see the package as a positive and constructive move by industry and government.  
In response to (c), the task force will make proper and professional assessment of the impact of deregulation on regions and respond accordingly, and there are many programs available now which can be drawn on. 
In response to (d)—imposing a new tax on milk—we are removing a tax on milk because the Domestic Market Support Scheme and the levy will be removed. Artificial pricing through state legislation will be removed. Both of those tax consumers. The levy is also not a wholesale sales tax. Rather, it is a levy targeted specifically at those most likely to benefit in the long term from deregulation, who are, after all, customers. It is well known that the Commonwealth provides for a range of levies to assist industries to adjust to changing demands. 
In response to (e), we have made provision to assist workers by assisting dairy enterprises and maintaining the viability of downstream manufacturing. So employees will benefit through maintaining jobs. In response to (f), we already have a range of government programs to assist with training needs, such as FarmBis, and, in response to (g), a significant proportion of the $1.63 billion will be used for investment purposes. 
In response to (h)—failing to include measures aimed at opening up and expanding overseas markets—this is exactly what this legislation is doing because it is the export oriented processors as well who are in favour of deregulation. That is because they want to be expanding into export markets and they can only do that if their major input, which is, after all, milk, is competitively priced. 
In response to (i)—failing to include a research and development component within the package—the Commonwealth government already provides around $10 million each year for research and development in the dairy industry. In response to (j)—poor targeting of assistance to farmers—come on! The package is specifically targeted at those who are most directly affected, who are, after all, dairy farmers. 
In response to (k)—failing to develop an adequate mechanism, et cetera—if current arrangements are continued for eight years, consumers would pay twice the amount they already pay through the levy. The imposition of the levy should not have any adverse impact on consumer demand for milk as the reduction in the farm price is expected to be greater than the levy. If anything, the impact of the levy on demand will be positive, given the fall in farm prices and the potential for other subsidiary products, such as flavoured milks, to be more competitive in a deregulated environment. 
In response to (l)—failing to ensure an equitable distribution of the package, et cetera—the package is based on fundamental principles designed to provide assistance to those producers who will be most affected. Lessors will receive entitlements. However, they will not have to bear the same adverse impact as lessees, who actually conduct the dairying business. There is a right, as I mentioned, to appeal a decision by the Dairy Adjustment Authority—first, by the authority itself and then, if still unsatisfactory, an appeal can be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. 
I think one of the opposition senators also mentioned the tax windfall that the government would be getting as a result of this package. Any argument that the difference between the original industry proposal and the package that was finally agreed to represents a tax windfall is totally false. The original proposal from industry was for a package of $1.25 billion net of tax. We were not prepared to set a precedent under tax law and provide tax-free payments. Recognising the large tax impost which would be associated with a lump sum payment and against the background that a single up-front payment would be illegal under World Trade Organisation arrangements, the government agreed to payments being over eight years to ease the tax burden on recipients. The agreement to $1.74 billion is an approximation in present value terms of the original $1.25 billion single payment proposal.  
Turning now to Senator Woodley's second reading amendment, in response to (a), which urges the governments of Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia, all I can say, Senator Woodley, is that it is not the responsibility of the Commonwealth government to urge state governments to do anything. It is totally the responsibility of the states as to how they move in regard to the issues that you have mentioned. In response to (b), we have already developed a regional adjustment package, which I have just mentioned, so we are fulfilling that part of your amendment. 
In response to (c), I believe that we have done that. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been tasked by the Treasurer to monitor retail milk prices to ensure any changes in prices are in accordance with acceptable competitive practice. The ACCC will commence monitoring prior to and for a period of six months following the introduction of the levy. Concerning farm gate prices, again that is a matter for commercial negotiation in a competitive market. This monitoring will be funded from levy receipts. We do not have a role in monitoring those sorts of movements at the farm gate level.
This is one of the most important debates and important results, I believe, ever to occur in Australian agricultural history. I thank all senators for the contribution that they have made to the debate.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Forshaw's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY ADJUSTMENT LEVY (EXCISE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-03-15,"—I move: 
That the Senate take note of the documents. 
I think each of these documents deserves comment separately. Perhaps that is what we might do. I will take the first of the documents which deals with a complaint by an Australian citizen to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. It deals with an application that was not successful. It is an indication of a person's right that, if he feels that the tribunals within this country have not given him a fair go, he can go to a body like the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, not that that body is going to be able to make a judgment that binds this country. Nevertheless, it enables the person concerned to have the views of a body outside Australia that administers treaties which Australia signs up to.
All of these documents deal with the particular situation where a person has exhausted his or her rights within Australia and then seeks by the consent of the nation to go elsewhere. So it is not as if we are dealing with some body that overrides the Australian situation. It does not do that, but with the allowance of Australia, a person goes off to another tribunal. In this case, the person who went off—the alleged victim, as this document reads—did so because he said that he had been discriminated against in his work in Australia. 
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination listened to him and listened to the submissions put by Australia and said that Australia had acted fairly. When I say `Australia', I mean that the various tribunals and courts in Australia had acted fairly and given him a fair result and fair decision. It is perhaps worth while reading the comment by the committee at 9.3. It says: 
The committee considers that as a general rule it is for the domestic courts of state parties to the convention to review and evaluate the facts and evidence in a particular case and after reviewing the case before it the committee concludes there is no obvious defect in the judgment of the Equal Opportunity Tribunal in New South Wales.
The point I want to make is that there is this overriding international law, if you like, that guides countries in what is fair and reasonable. Those countries are not bound by the judgments of a committee like the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, but nevertheless it is a process whereby the countries around the world have the benefit of the opinion of a committee that interprets international treaties, and so was the case in this situation.
Mr Acting Deputy President, in the series of documents that you have called out, Australia has done very well indeed. It does show that Australia has a very good regime within it that enables people who are in Australia to get justice. On my reading of the documents, there was only one matter where it was suggested a person had been unfairly treated, and that is a matter that is still ongoing. (Extension of time granted) 
These documents are all similar. The next one sets out the decision of the Human Rights Commission established under article 28 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Although this is a different committee—the last committee I was talking about was the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination—it is of the same order. It is an international body that, again, enables the residents of a country to go to an international forum, with the consent of the country in which he or she lives, and to have the opinion of that committee about the situation that he or she feels was not fair in terms of himself or herself. 
In this case, the person had considerable concern about a matter in terms of Pine Gap near Alice Springs. He wanted to indicate his objection to it being there and trespassed on Pine Gap. He said that the system here had not treated him fairly. Again, the committee found that Australia had acted well, that its justice was of a good standard and that the author, as they call him in the document, had not made out the case that he wanted to make out and therefore he failed. Again, it is an indication of this rule of law, this body of law, this body of rights, that is seen as covering all countries and that all good countries should live up to, and in this case Australia did live up to it. I think this is a tendency, if you like, or a practice that will grow more and more.
In the end, we will have a rule of law operating throughout the world. For example, in Europe now we have the trial of people who are accused of genocide and other war crimes, and I think everybody approves of that. What we have to do—and you are very conscious of this, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson; I have heard you speak about it— is be very conscious that our sovereignty as a nation is preserved, that the courts in this country are given their proper respect and that they are our primary refuge when we feel that as citizens we are not properly dealt with. But, if we are going to have an international system, which we have—we have an international system more and more in trade, in tax and, in effect, at every level, brought around mainly because of the growth in technology—we have to feel our way in terms of an international system whereby the law that is recognised around the world is one that is proper and fair. This is another example of it. This is one that arises out of a particular convention, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2000-03-15,"—I acknowledge the fact that Senator Ferris has allowed me to get up on my feet first and your own indulgence, Mr Acting Deputy President, in staying in the chair to enable me to briefly address this evening ANAO report No. 26 of this year, Army Individual Readiness Notice. I am doing this in the adjournment debate for the simple reason that the unfortunate part about ANAO reports is that they are not kept on the Notice Paper once they have been presented in this chamber. They just mysteriously, so it seems, slip off the Notice Paper and, unless one addresses one of these reports at times such as these, the time passes by.
I find this report of such importance purely and simply because it is really quite critical of the Army in their attempts to have an Army individual readiness notice. The ANAO made a number of recommendations, two of which Army agreed with, four of which Army agreed with in principle and two of which Army did not agree with at all. I will not proceed to address individually those recommendations this evening, but I will simply look at some of the report and the significance for the defence forces in particular. When questions were raised on this at a recent estimates hearing, it became evident from the evidence of the Defence representatives that the principle was going to be adopted by the defence forces. If one looks at the criticism that is made of the actual Army individual readiness notice program already operating, one has some legitimate concerns for what might be happening with the expansion of this program to the whole of the defence forces. At page 10 in the overall conclusion, the ANAO drew attention to this fact: 
The objective of AIRN is to ensure that members can be deployed on operations, potentially in a combat environment, to perform their specific skills within a notice period of 30 days.
That is the objective of AIRN, but they came to this conclusion:
... the ANAO could find no relationship between the minimum standards set for AIRN components and the achievement of a deployable standard in 30 days.
Further, they went on to say:
... at September 1999, only 74 per cent of full time members and 34 per cent of part time members to whom AIRN applies met the minimum standards required by AIRN.
This, of course, is a major concern. In fairness to the Army, the ANAO then went on to qualify this by saying that the figures were not a reliable indicator because there was some difficulty with the reliability of the statistics. But, even if there is a reasonable degree of error in those figures, one still must have real concern for what is expressed in the report, given that this is at a time when we are looking to our preparedness and our involvement in East Timor, a major involvement at that.
The report went on to then look at the ANAO's experience with some of our major allies. The report says that our `major allies do not use a system like AIRN to manage soldiers' individual readiness', and it went on to say that the representatives of the armies contacted by the ANAO indicated that `they did not consider a system like AIRN would be affordable in their context, primarily because of the administrative burden it would impose'. That is my major concern with the indication from the defence forces that they were likely to extend this right throughout the whole of the defence forces--that it would impose an unnecessary administrative burden upon various units within our Army, Navy and Air Force. The overseas armies—our major allies, as the report says, if that can be taken as any guide—saw the program that was being operated by our Army as posing administrative burdens that they could not see themselves being able to carry. The report went on to say:
Regardless of the model chosen, there needs to be a clear linkage between individual readiness component standards and the individual readiness objectives to be achieved. 
That seems to me to be all paramount if the defence forces are going to extend this concept across the whole of the defence forces. The key findings at page 12 elucidate why there was the development of the AIRN in the first place. The report says:
Army developed AIRN to address two emerging risks. These were the increasing likelihood of short warning conflicts ... and the increasing hollowness of regular army units ... 
That was the rationale on which the AIRN was developed in the first place. But it is interesting to look at the implementation of AIRN. The ANAO report goes on:
The slow pace of implementation adversely affected Army's ability to keep to the implementation timetable. For example, delays by units in implementing AIRN meant that costing information collected during this period did not provide a true indication of the cost of AIRN. It is apparent that, three years after the implementation of AIRN, Army is still not able to assess the annual cost of AIRN. 
This is a real concern. Here we have a proposal for something that may well be spread into the other aspects of our defence forces and, after three years of its implementation, Army is not in a position to in any way outline the annual cost of AIRN. That is a fairly telling criticism of Army, and one would hope—and that is why I am flagging this now—that the defence forces, if they are going to maintain AIRN and/or spread it to the other parts of the defence forces, will closely monitor this to enable the taxpayer, at the end of the day, to get value for money out of our defence forces and to ensure that the readiness capability that is required is, in effect, there. On the recording and reporting of AIRN information, the report states:
The ANAO found that the system placed a significant administrative burden upon units, lacked timeliness in some areas, produced information of questionable validity and did not encourage members to maintain a continuous state of individual readiness.  
So that of itself is a fairly scathing criticism of something that Army had persisted with over a period of three years. In their final comment on page 18, before they came to their recommendations, they said:
... it is questionable as to whether a review after five years for such basic processes is consistent with promoting the most efficient and effective use of Commonwealth resources. 
So, in raising this this evening, I hope the defence forces are wise, if they do pursue this, in having the costings available and ensuring that AIRN and/or its equivalent across the defence forces does deliver what it is supposed to deliver, because we do need an efficient and effective Defence Force that is truly accountable in this day and age. In conclusion, I once again express my thanks to Senator Ferris.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian National Audit Office: Report No. 26</title>,Adjournment,32,1,speech

"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-03-15,"—The Minister for Health and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1) The Department of Health and Aged Care has:
Set up a project team within Portfolio Strategies Division with specific responsibility for internal GST issues to ensure implementation proceeds as smoothly as possible;
Engaged consultants to assist in the formulation of a detailed GST implementation strategy, and a list of GST issues affecting the Department;
Begun reviewing contracts spanning 1 July 2000 to determine GST impact;
Commissioned a review of the Department's financial management system to ensure it has the capacity to handle the new tax framework; and
Begun compiling information on Departmental activities/outputs to estimate savings from indirect tax reform using Econtech computer model.
(2) (a) Estimated cost to date (up to 1/9/99) is $124,332
(b) estimated cost breakdown is:
(i) consultancies, $1 200
(ii) staff training, $4 440
(iii) computer software, $0
(iv) extra staff, $0
(v) stationery, $0
(vi) other (please specify)
Existing staff, $117 492
Legal advice, 
Publications, $1 200
(3) Costs were not specifically included in the portfolio's 1999-2000 Budget appropriation; work to date has been funded out of existing resources.
(4) Future preparations will include:
Identification and classification of departmental inputs;
Production of a detailed GST implementation strategy, and a comprehensive list of GST issues affecting the Department;
Completion of the review of contracts spanning 1 July 2000 to determine GST treatment;
Maintenance and updating of a comprehensive risk management plan for GST implementation in the Department;
Delivery of an in-house training program for program staff with implementation responsibilities;
Review the financial management system to ensure it has the capacity to handle the new tax framework ; and
Compiling information to Departmental activites/outputs to estimate saving from indirect tax reform using the computer model produced by Econtech.
(5) Much of the detailed work required to implement the GST needs to take account of regulations to be determined by the Minister for Finance and Administration, and Australian Taxation Office rulings which may not be finalised for some time. The Department and Portfolio agencies will be seeking specialist assistance to provide guidance and expertise in the detailed planning for implementation of the GST.  It is therefore too early to estimate accurately the total or particular costs of planned actions.  The following estimates, however, reflect the information available at this time.
(a) the estimated cost of actions planned is $755 150
(b) estimated cost breakdown is:
(i) consultancies, $69 950
(ii) staff training	, $138 200
(iii) computer software, $156 500
(iv) extra staff, $0
(v) stationery ,$7 500
other (please specify)
Existing staff, $383 000
(NB. “Existing staff” figure represents salaries and on-costs of a small team of existing Departmental staff set up to handle internal aspects of the transition.  Other staff will be involved, but it is not possible at this stage to estimate accurately how many and for what periods.)
(6) Costs were not specifically included in the Portfolio's 1999-2000 Budget appropriation; work to date has been funded out of the existing resources.
(7) There will be a change in ongoing running costs due to the effects of the GST.  It will not be possible to estimate the extent of savings from indirect tax reform.
(8) There are no other known GST-related costs that the Portfolio agencies will incur prior to the commencement of the GST.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Department of Health and Aged Care</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,34,1,answer
