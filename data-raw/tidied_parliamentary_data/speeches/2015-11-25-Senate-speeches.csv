Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (09:34):  What we are looking at in the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 5) Bill 2015 is a series of minor taxation amendments that are really designed to raise $1.4 billion over the forward estimates. This is an approach—and I think it shows a reasonable approach—between the government and the opposition who have been able to come together and work together on these tax measures and where there has been agreement and consensus. I think it is worth acknowledging the work of the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Andrew Leigh, in this space. I note that both the federal Treasurer and the federal Assistant Treasurer have played a very positive role in this space in allowing us to have this sensible debate.


Labor will always support sensible savings measures which improve the budget bottom line without harming vulnerable Australians. This is consistent with our sound, fiscal plan to bring the budget back into balance by delivering more savings spending over the coming decade. I do note, however, that, while there has been agreement in this space and while this is legislation that we will be supporting, it is disappointing that the government have failed to acknowledge Australia's revenue challenge. Since taking over the job, Treasurer 2.0, Scott Morrison, has continued to parrot his predecessor's line that Australia has a spending problem and not a revenue problem. Talking up spending is simply the government's way of preparing the ground for more cuts. The government believe that, if they keep talking about a spending problem, Australia might eventually get away with things like $100,000 degrees, cuts to the pension and cuts to family payments. The fact is that those on this side of the chamber believe that we have both a spending and a revenue problem, that both of these matters need to be tackled and that they need to be tackled sensibly if we are to address the revenue challenges facing this country.


Between 2014 and 2015 Australia's revenue projections were written down by $52 billion. That flows through every corner of the budget. Today, spending is at 26 per cent of GDP, but revenue has fallen to 23.5 per cent. As former Treasury secretary, Ken Henry, said:


… a bit more than half of it is explained by a deterioration in revenue performance; by the tax system not delivering in the way that the tax system has delivered in the past.


The International Monetary Fund agrees. In its most recent report on the Australian economy it noted, 'While expenditure reduction can and should play a role in reducing the fiscal deficit, there may be a limited scope for this avenue since expenditure is already relatively low compared to other advanced economies.'


This bill has four schedules. Schedule 1 simplifies the methods of calculating work related car expense deductions to ensure the tax act becomes more closely aligned with actual expenses incurred. Schedule 2 improves the integrity of the zone tax offsets by restricting access to individuals genuinely living in the designated regional and remote zones. Schedule 3 introduces a $5,000 cap on fringe benefits tax concessions on entertainment expenses for not-for-profit workers. Schedule 4 implements a technical integrity measure first proposed by the previous Labor government. Schedules 1 to 3 are essential savings measures and Labor has previously indicated its support for schedule 2. Schedule 3 is consistent with the recommendations from the Productivity Commission's Henry tax review and the final report of the Not-For-Profit Sector Tax Concession Working Group. Among those affected are employees of public benevolent institutions, hospitals and ambulance services. The proposed value of the cap is opposed by, among others, the Australian Medical Association, the Australian Salaried Medical Officer Federation, the Victorian ambulance union and the Community Council for Australia. ABS data shows that the average spending on meals out and fast food is less than $5,000 for all but the top fifth of taxpayers.


This is a sensible bill that includes sensible savings measures. It is a bill that is worthy of passing through this chamber and is worthy of the support this chamber, but it does highlight a fundamental flaw in the thinking and the arguments that are put forward by this government. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:39):  Seasons greetings to you, Mr Deputy President, and to all here in the Senate. With the parliamentary year wrapping up somewhat early, on 3 December, and with Christmas fast approaching, it is time to pause and look back on 2015.


What a year it has been. The government has been hitting home runs on tax reform all year. There have been five—count them: five—tax and superannuation laws amendment bills. I have loved every one of them—well, a kind of love. So in the spirit of Christmas, let me recite a little ditty about the five tax bills of Christmas. Given my warm feeling for all of the senators in this chamber, I was tempted not to sing it. It is true that I am not an undiscovered Pavarotti. But given its nature, I really I have no choice. So here it is:


In the first bill of Christmas my Treasurer sent to me


A tax on the elderly


In the second bill of Christmas my Treasurer sent to me


Slower deductions and a tax on the elderly


In the third bill of Christmas my Treasurer sent to me


Seafarer's tax, slower deductions and a tax on the elderly


In the fourth bill of Christmas my Treasurer sent to me


More CGT, seafarers' tax, slower deductions and a tax on the elderly


In the fifth bill of Christmas my Treasurer sent to me


More FBT, more CGT, seafarers' tax, slower deductions and a tax on the elderly


Merry Christmas, everyone.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Leyonhjelm. You are not the first person to sing in the chamber, but I think that was very eloquent. I do remember the Rock Lobster dance, though. I do not think you have surpassed that.




Senator Fifield:
  It was The Time Warp!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  We have started Christmas early! I think I should call the minister now, to put some stability back into the chamber.




Senator Fifield:
  I think Senator Leyonhjelm has guaranteed himself a run in the electronic media. I really was going to just make that as a point of order, but I am not actually closing the debate.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:42):  I thank those senators who have contributed to this debate. This bill makes an important contribution to the government's commitment to simplify and modernise the Australian tax system, while improving fairness and integrity.


The first three schedules of the bill are 2015-16 budget measures, so this continues the important task of the government to get the budget back into balance as soon as possible. It amends the work-related car expense rules by modernising the rules and revising the set-rate-per-kilometre method. It removes access to the zone tax offset for fly-in, fly-out and drive-in, drive-out workers whose usual residence is not within a specified zone. It introduces a separate $5,000 cap for salary sacrifice entertainment benefits for certain employees of not-for-profit organisations. These benefits will also become reportable. The bill also creates a new data matching and compliance program requiring third parties to report to the ATO on a range of transactions.


This bill demonstrates the government's commitment to a fairer and simpler tax system that reflects a modern Australia. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-11-25,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (12:44):  I thank the Senate for the opportunity to speak on the Esperance fires, which will be the subject of a motion this afternoon by all of Western Australia's senators. I seek the indulgence of the chamber to wear what was part of my uniform as chief executive of the Bush Fires Board of Western Australia simply to recognise the contribution of firefighters throughout Australia, particularly volunteers, and those who support them.


This horrific fire, the worst for 50 years in Western Australia, began on 15 November as a result of lightning strike in crown land around the area of Cascade and Scaddan to the north of Esperance. Over the last few days there have been three major fires: the Cascade-Scaddan fire of some 137,000 hectares, the Merivale fire to the east of Esperance of some 18,000 hectares and, further to the east, the Cape Arid National Park, which was the subject again of lightning strike and fire of some 160,000 hectares—totalling in excess of 300,000 hectares burnt. To put that into context, it exceeds the entire area of the ACT, but it is only about six per cent of the entire area of the Esperance shire.


I want to record my condolence on the death of four people in the Cascade-Scaddan fire. Firstly, Mr Kym Curnow, better known in his local community as Freddie. I offer my condolences to his widow, Roseanne, and to his children, Tom, Riley and Emma. Curnow died rushing around in his local community from farm to farm trying to warn people of the fire that was approaching and trying to stop people in vehicles and turn them around. That was the mark of the man. He was a leader in his community, much loved, the life of parties and, of course, he will be sorely missed. He was, needless to say, a volunteer Bush Fire Brigade officer.


The others who lost their lives were three Europeans working on a neighbouring farm: Julia Kohrs-Lichte from Germany, Anna Winther from Norway and Tom Butcher from the UK. They died in their efforts to get away from the fire—in fact, with a horse on board in a float. Tragically, they turned into the face of the fire rather than away from it. They also lost their lives, and I offer my condolences.


In addition to the area of land burnt, some 75,000 hectares of cropland was destroyed. I flew over the fire myself last Friday. Perversely, it was probably one of the best cropping years in the Esperance region for many years, so there would be significant losses not only from the fires but from the effect of wind afterwards.


Let me give you some understanding of the fire front itself and the speed with which it was moving. Other fires around Perth on the weekend were moving at 1,500 metres an hour—1.5 kilometres an hour. The Esperance fires at one stage were estimated to be moving at 23 kilometres an hour, so you can understand the devastation. 


Lack of capacity for mobile phone communications, unfortunately, was a very significant factor. It is perverse and tragic, because in that area of Esperance the largest single number of towers to cover black spots has in fact been approved, but they are obviously not yet in position. Of course, in September of this year, a communications satellite was launched, and when commissioned it will provide voice-over activity for telephone communications. So that is an area that we know we have to deal with. It is so tragic. As one lady from the Scaddan area said to me on Friday, 'I haven't spoken to my husband or my sons for the last four days. They're out fighting the fires. I don't know where they are and they can't communicate with us.'


In the more remote areas of Australia that community of people have the equal right as those of us in the urban and outer urban areas to good mobile communications, not just in the event of emergencies but, of course, for their normal business and their normal social life and their normal activity. I can assure that community that, with the member for O'Connor, Mr Rick Wilson, and others, we will certainly be addressing those issues. Some 4½ thousand livestock were killed in the fires, so the loss to that community of people and assets will be many years in the recovery phase.


I want to speak of the value of the volunteer brigade members, and I also want to speak to the communication with the Department of Fire and Emergency Services personnel in Esperance. I had the opportunity on Friday to attend the meeting convened by the incident controller. With my hat from the CEO of the Bush Fires Board days, I want to impress on everybody as we go into this fire season that the respect for and the communication between volunteers and paid personnel must be of the highest level. As Len Foster from the Country Fire Authority said to me when I first started as CEO of the Bush Fires Board, 'Chris, never mistake volunteerism for amateurism. Volunteers, properly trained and resourced, are the equal when it comes to their work on fire grounds.' Of course, as we saw in the Esperance fires, we needed the local expertise and the commitment of those many brigade members who, knowing one of their own close friends had died, continued fighting those fires.


I want to record again my appreciation for the management of the Department of Fire and Emergency Services for the mature way in which all services dealt with what was an horrific but ongoing situation. I was there on Friday, but on Saturday and Sunday, with the easterly and the northerly winds, we continued to see those problems emerging. It is critical that we have that level of respect for and the ability to recognise the different roles played by the different personnel.


Access to crown land was another issue. There were questions as to whether personnel were able to go into crown land reserves after the lightning strike had started the fires. I spoke with Minister Hunt yesterday and got his confirmation that there is never a circumstance in which volunteer brigade members could not go into crown land owned by the Commonwealth to suppress, fight and mitigate major fires if life and property are at risk. I have not spoken in the last few days to the state Minister for Environment, but I recall the days in which I administered the Bush Fires Act in Western Australia, and I say again in this place: there should never be an instance in which a well-meaning, properly trained and qualified volunteer cannot go into land owned by others—be it military, be it Commonwealth, be it state—to suppress bushfires that place other properties at risk. I give the undertaking that, whilst I am here in this place, I will never allow a circumstance where such a person can be the subject of successful litigation.


I want to speak briefly about the community response which I observed in a public community meeting in Esperance on Friday. We all know we have a scenario where we go from shock to grief to anger. That was being expressed, and so it should be, but at the same time my plea would be that we always allow every agency the opportunity to speak and to be heard, that we allow everybody in the community to be heard and that we learn the lessons that come from them. Of those involved in the particular incident, apart from the paid officers and the volunteer fire officers, I want to record the excellence of the work undertaken by groups like the State Emergency Service, the Red Cross, counselling services, Horizon Power, which has responsibility for the provision of power in that region, and Telstra. The work undertaken by all of those groups under horrific conditions must be recognised and applauded.


Esperance is a relatively remote area of Western Australia. It is an area that is self-sufficient. It is an area that has always relied upon itself. That community is going to need to dig very, very deep over the next months and years. Already, throughout Western Australia, farmers are donating grain, feed and seed stock for next year. My final words are directed towards the Chief Bushfire Control Officer, Mr Tom Brown, and his wife, Victoria, who, for her sins, was elected the shire president of Esperance only in the last four weeks. The work undertaken by those two people for their wider community has been professional, sympathetic, courteous and at all times has had the wellbeing of their community in mind. I congratulate them and I express my condolence. (Time expired)




Senator McEwen:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, without in any way wishing to diminish Senator Back's contribution there about the Western Australian bushfires, I raise a point of order that you could perhaps contemplate or refer to the President. Yesterday the President issued a statement to all senators, a procedural note about the use of props or other such items during debate and the appropriateness or otherwise of that. I would ask that you refer the matter to the President for his consideration in light of that procedural note.




Senator Ronaldson:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: I understand what Senator McEwen is saying, but I think there have got to be occasions where it is appropriate for someone to do as Senator Back has done. It is not a political prop. It is not a photo. These were devastating bushfires. There was tragic loss of life. The Esperance community has been decimated by what occurred. I would just urge a word of caution. I would not view what Senator Back has done as being the sort of thing that would elicit a political or other response.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Seselja
):  Senator McEwen, in relation to your point of order, I am very happy to refer it to the President. I will simply put to you that I saw the prop, or the jacket; Senator Back sought the indulgence of the chamber, and I saw nods from those across—and I did look across to Labor senators to see whether there was any objection. There was no formal objection. With indulgence, these things, in my judgement, can happen, but I am very happy to seek advice from the President to see whether that ruling is in fact correct.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:00):  I think I have seen this movie before. It sounds a bit like a broken record—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You'll be back!




Senator CORMANN:
  Yes, I thought 'I'll be back' was my line, but Senator Gallagher is back! And it is essentially the same question. And let me tell you something: I have a very high regard for Senator Gallagher's capacity to make a great and fine contribution to Australia in this chamber in the years and decades to come. Hopefully, it will be for a while longer in opposition, but eventually, down the track, I am sure she will make a fine contribution in a future Australian government. Let me give her one very well-intentioned lesson. If you keep asking the same question you will keep getting the same answer, and the answer is that the government does not have any proposal in front of it to make the sort of changes to the GST she is suggesting.


What we are doing as part of our commitment to growth and jobs is engaging in an open and transparent conversation with the Australian people. We are engaging in a good faith conversation with the states and territories on how our tax system can be further improved and how it can be made more growth friendly so that we can strengthen growth and create more jobs.


The premise of the question is entirely false, and what I would suggest to the Labor Party is that this was supposed to be the 'year of great ideas'—remember? And do you know that the three big, great ideas of the Labor Party are three tax increases? They have the tax on people's retirement savings, the tax on business—which will cost jobs according to Treasury—and they have the tax on cigarettes. So the great ideas on the Labor side are more new taxes, but on this side we are thinking very carefully on how we can strengthen growth and create more and better jobs. We would suggest that the Labor Party actually become part of the conversation rather than be part of the problem. (Time expired)

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:03):  The Prime Minister is of course 100 per cent correct. Housing affordability is a serious issue, and the way that you improve housing affordability is by increasing the supply of housing. What happens to the affordability of anything in a free market is a function of supply and demand. If you have stronger demand than available supply, prices go up; if you have stronger supply than demand, prices go down, and over time in a market things get back into balance.


The truth is that there are a whole range of things that we, with the states and territories, should be focusing on to improve housing affordability, but the premise of Senator Gallagher's question, as indicated in my primary answer, is false, and we reject it. She is trying to suggest that certain decisions have been made in relation to a process that has not reached a conclusion. So Senator Gallagher or any other Labor senator can keep jumping up and down every day— (Time expired)

That is what we are doing across the whole government of public policy. That is why we are engaged in an ambitious infrastructure investment program.

It has been obtained by my agile and nimble advisers in the last half hour.


Senator Wang, I can tell you that yesterday The West Australian newspaper reported that the cost to the harvest in the affected areas will be approximately $150 million. That is obviously a very early estimate. As yet, there is no available costing of the cost to public infrastructure or the cost to private property other than that estimate of the cost to the harvest. We know that several homes have been destroyed, so there will obviously be a substantial cost to private assets, but until insurance claims have been lodged and loss assessors have been engaged to value the losses we will not be able to arrive at a precise estimate of the cost in terms of private and public assets. That $150 million figure for the cost to agriculture is the only published figure that is available to us.


I touched on this in the answer to your question, Senator Wang. The National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements make provision for the Western Australian government to activate immediate recovery assistance to assist local government and communities to recover from these events. The operation of the NDRRA is by application made by the Western Australian state government. I am advised that the NDRRA has not yet been activated by the Western Australian government. The Commonwealth will continue to liaise with the Western Australian government regarding recovery assistance. We will seek to be responsive, subject to the guidelines, where we are able to be, and we will monitor the impact of these events.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:07):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) and the Minister for Communications (Senator Fifield) to questions without notice asked by Senators Ketter and McLucas today relating to the economy and to the National Broadband Network.


I rise to take note of answers to questions asked by Senators Ketter and McLucas. I want to point to two of the words that we have heard throughout the week while we have been playing 'nimble, agile' bingo on this side of the chamber. This is a government that uses those words and they are going to have to practise being nimble and agile because they are dancing everywhere around the truth. They need to mind the gap between what they say here and the reality that Australians understand about this government. There is a massive credibility gap. This government cannot be believed. In anything it says, it completely distorts the truth—even in response to the first question. The GST has been very much brought to life as a conversation by a government that, once upon a time, said there would 'never ever' be a change to the 10 per cent GST—and now they have opened it up. 'Everything is on the table', they say outside this chamber. But we ask a question to the minister and he says, 'No, we're not talking about that'. Ten per cent, and up to 15 per cent, on all the things that people are already paying GST on and from zero to 15 per cent proposed for everything, including fresh food—what a devastating impact!


There is a credibility gap between what they say here and what they say outside the chamber. These guys simply are not capable of telling the truth. If we in anyway needed to have that backed up, it became even more evident when Senator Katter, my good colleague here beside me, asked directly: 'Is it true what was said yesterday by the Treasury deputy secretary—that Australia is now in for a prolonged period of below par growth the likes of which we have rarely seen outside a recession?' That is the direct quote that was in the question, that is the direct quote from the speech that was given and it is the direct quote from the two articles that reported it in the paper—by Mark Coultan, in The Australian, and by Peter Martin in The Sydney Morning Herald. But do you think the fact that it was on the public record in those three places would prevent the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, from actually telling the truth? No. He decided that he was ready to absolutely slander other people who are telling the truth about what was said yesterday. He said that that was not accurate. Well, it absolutely was accurate and the sad reality is that it is going to have a devastating impact on Australians right across the country.


As the deputy treasury secretary said, we are in fact in a prolonged period of below par growth, the likes of which we have rarely seen outside a recession—and it is attributable to the shameful economic action of this government. They are out there telling the community, as they have done for many decades, that they are great economic managers. But the reality is that growth is well below trend. It was predicted to be three per cent in May but the reality we now see is that it has been downgraded to 2.75 per cent. That is bad for Australia and it does bear out the second part of the question that my colleague asked, which was about the fact that Australians knew that we were not doing too well under the member for North Sydney, Joe Hockey, but we are going to do an awful lot worse under the new Treasurer, Mr Morrison, who is doing an appalling job from the record of these economic forecasts that were put forward yesterday.


Finally, in another gilding of the lily, the MTM, the multi-technology mix, as those opposite would have us call it, which is really being translated into a disaster right across this nation—




Senator Bilyk:
  'Malcolm Turnbull's Mess'!




Senator O'NEILL:
  Indeed it is, Senator Bilyk. It is a disaster. It is a sell-out. They continue to tell the Australian people they are rolling out the NBN. They are rolling out an absolute mess! There is no ubiquitous delivery of the fair and equitable access to the future that a real NBN could deliver.


Questions were asked today by Senator McLucas about the HFC network possibilities. We know, from very early on, that this technology is completely inferior to fibre to the home; it is on a par with fibre to the node, and we have documented here the problems with that technology. There is a failure rate of 14 per cent—where it simply does not work. What we are seeing with the HFC rollout is another con, another sell-out, of the future technologies that Australia needs by this shameful government that has a massive credibility gap to bridge with the Australian people. We had a 17-year-old by the name of Kenneth Tsang provide a critique of the contestability problems on the HFC network—a 17-year-old can see through the disgraceful implementation of an inequitable distribution of access to the future through the NBN! We are getting a Dodgy Brothers version of the NBN instead of a real one under a government that refuses to tell the truth. (Time expired)

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-11-25,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:12):  It is pretty obvious what the Labor Party are going for and strategising about at the moment. It is pretty obvious that they are on a 'GST' campaign—a 'Give Shorten a Try' scare campaign! That is what they are all about at the moment. And aren't people scared! They are scared out of their pants about the potential of giving Shorten a try at running this country—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Canavan, I have let you go on a couple of occasions but we will refer to members in the other place by their correct title.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I think people now understand what I am referring to. This GST campaign is scaring voters. They are extremely scared about the prospect of Mr Bill Shorten, from the other place, leading this nation. They are so scared that they have even settled on a number to estimate that particular scare—15 per cent. That is the number of people that now support the GST process that the Labor Party are putting forward. Fifteen per cent—that is what they have settled on. That is why we have heard that figure a lot from the Labor Party as well.


I think some of those on the other side are getting a bit worried that this particular GST scare campaign is not working. Putting forward Mr Bill Shorten as an alternative, as a distraction tactic, may not be the best strategy going forward. There is an alternative approach from the other side—and it is not a GST scare campaign but a 'VAT' scare campaign—'Vote for Albo Tomorrow'! That is the alternative for them—have another campaign and put in Mr Anthony Albanese. That is what a few of them are talking about at the moment. Their GST scare campaign is not working, so they are going to try another one on the Australian people and see if that works—a 'VAT' scare campaign. They are going to roll out that proposal. The only ideas the Labor Party are coming up with are about who should lead them. That is what they always talk about. That is what the last five years have all been about. It is about which leader, which union hack—which particular former trade union leader—they should put forward, to the Australian people, this time. That is what their real 'year of ideas' is going to end up about. 


They are not talking about ideas for how we can grow our economy. They are not talking about ideas for how we can reform our tax system. They are not talking about ideas for how we can innovate and become more efficient. They are certainly not talking about ideas for how we can re-engage competition policy in this country. They are only focused on who will give them the best chance to save some of their seats, next year, at the election.


This government has a different approach. This government is focused on trying to make sure we promote strong economic growth in our country. We recognise it is difficult for the Australian economy, at the moment, because we have had a terms-of-trade boom that is ending and that, naturally—without any other influence—means lower per capita growth. In the last few years we have been experiencing higher economic growth just from getting higher prices, and those higher prices are not going to continue for us. Therefore, we need to look at other ways to energise our economy. 


We are going to find new sources of economic growth and potential for creating jobs. We have been creating a good level of jobs over the last couple of years. It has been quite a strong labour market, which is positive, but it will become harder. As I said, the North Queensland Cowboys have done a terrific job, this year, in winning the premiership but it will be even harder for them, next year, to back up. That is the same process for our economic growth. We have done a terrific job in not having a recession, for 25 years, in this country—the second-longest period in economic history—but it is becoming harder to make sure we keep growing from that high base, as we have avoided a recession for so long. 


That is why we need to have these difficult discussions on tax reform. That is why we have to think about how we can strengthen our innovation policy. That is also why we need to respond to the Harper review with stronger competition laws, with reform of health education and other sectors, to grow productivity and ensure a higher level of economic growth.


The reason we want that higher economic growth is not for growth in and of itself. It is not because we like seeing higher numbers in the budget every year. It is because only through that process can we make sure all Australians have the opportunity to have their own job or the confidence to start their own business, to get a loan from the bank to do so, to have the security to start their own family and make sure their own potential is fulfilled in this great nation of ours.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2015-11-25,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (15:17):  What a disappointing question time we had today. I draw my attention to the question I asked of Senator Cormann. The question was asked of Senator Cormann in relation to comments by Mr Nigel Ray, the deputy secretary of the Treasury. That question went to quite legitimate concerns in the community about the fact that we have had a prolonged period of below-par growth, the likes of which we have rarely seen outside of a recession. 


Rather than dealing with the facts in that question, rather than tackling the issue head-on, Senator Cormann chose an intellectually bankrupt route for dealing with that question by simply saying, 'That is not what Mr Ray said.' I happen to have the speech given by Mr Ray to the Australian Business Economists Conference. It is titled: 'The Macroeconomic Context'. On page 4 of that speech, Mr Ray said:


This means Australia is now in a prolonged period of below-par growth, the likes of which we have rarely seen outside of a recession.


Senator Cormann is totally incorrect in making the comment. He missed the opportunity to address the real issue behind the question.


I will begin by talking about some of the facts, as we know them. Treasury has released a new forecast for the Australian economy, indicating that this year's growth will slow even further than anticipated from the projected three per cent to 2.75 per cent. Over the last financial year Australia's GDP growth fell to just 1.5 per cent, the lowest growth rate in 50 years. Assuming all other things remain unchanged, this downgrade will add around $50 billion to Treasury's budget deficit projections over 10 years. Treasury pointed out that the economy recorded its third straight year of below-trend growth in 2014-15. Unemployment remains high at around six per cent. Labour-market analysis reveals the so-called under-utilisation rate of labour—that is, a measure of underemployment in the workforce—has risen to 14 per cent. For our young people, it is double at over 30 per cent. Consumer sentiment as measured by the Westpac-Melbourne Institute is nine per cent below where it was at the election.


The Turnbull government is failing us on many fronts. Firstly, we have a faltering economy that this government has no policies to fix. Secondly, we have a jobs crisis. Given the complete absence of any industry policy by this government, there is little evidence this is will change. We only need to think about the demise of the Australian car industry and associated loss of up to 200,000 jobs as evidence of this government's economic vandalism. At the same time, our economy is slowing: we have workers willing to work, but there is not enough work, not enough investment being undertaken to generate the jobs they require. Thirdly, we have the budget emergency, so-called. The No. 1 item this government was going to fix is getting worse, and the Turnbull government has no apparent solution for this. The budget deficit has doubled in just the last 12 months and here we are getting further away from fixing it.


The Abbott-Turnbull government has made every promise imaginable when it comes to the budget returning to surplus. Instead of an economy and budget getting back on track—as Senator Cormann always likes to say—we have 760,000 Australians out of a job and a budget deficit that has doubled in just the last 12 months. Instead of putting in place policies we need to kick-start the economy, accelerate investment and innovation, and grow our industries this government has, simply, elected to increase the GST by 50 per cent.


I would like to finish up by asking what purpose an increase in the GST would serve to kick-start our economy. Rather than injecting life into our economy, Mr Turnbull is going to slam those who can least afford it with another tax, and sit back and watch as our iconic local businesses disappear. The Turnbull government has not put forward a single policy that will tackle the poor, and slowing, performance of our economy, while at the same time we have a runaway budget that is out of control.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-11-25,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:22):  That was underwhelming, wasn't it! But nonetheless I will seek to respond to it. On behalf of those well-minded senators here I would like to apologise for that almost putting you to sleep there.


There are two keys to a strong economy. One is low taxation, and I am proud to say that I have always advocated for the lowering of taxation across the board in this country. I have fought tooth and nail against tax increases, because if we want to grow our economy and develop economic innovation we will cut the share of the pie that government takes. Ultimately, that will grow revenue to government. But that is not accepted by those on the other side, who want to continually put up taxes, whether it be the sin taxes for tobacco or alcohol, or whether it be the taxes on the hard-working people who go out to try to earn an honest and decent living.


The second part of growing an economy is innovation. This is where the other side have come unstuck. I would like to take you back to when Senator Conroy was communications minister. He decided to hop on a plane with Mr Kevin Rudd and on the back of a napkin he eked out a $50 billion spend for the National Broadband Network, which he said would revolutionise the entire country. The real revolution is taking place outside of Senator Conroy's small mind and his grandiose projects. It is taking place in places like the University of Oxford, where they are getting 224 gigabits a second, in a laboratory environment, on the transfer of data. It is taking place in areas like Estonia, where start-ups have developed a new technology called li-fi, which is getting one gigabyte per second in a commercial environment. Senator Conroy is tethered to the past. He is tethered to his utopian dream where the Conroy fibre network was going to be the solution to everything.


But we on this side of the chamber are open to innovation. We are open to a mix and range of technologies to deliver value for taxpayers' money, but also to embrace the latest technological innovations—the sorts of things that the Labor Party has had their mind closed to for successive generations. We know that those on the other side are adept at many things. We know they are adept at ethnic branch stacking in some of the Victorian Labor Party conferences. We know that they are adept at providing debit cards for these branch stackings so that they can anonymously re-sign up. We know they are adept at flouting the systems of the union movement, and everything else, for personal gain. But what they are not very skilled at is responding to true innovation. They are still anchored in the past, whether it is tax policy, whether it is the embracing of new internet and broadband techniques and systems of delivery, whether it is examining taxation, or whether it is workplace relations. They are still bogged down in 1950s class war rhetoric, which belongs more to the Soviet Union than it does to a modern-day Australia.


It gives me no pleasure to say this, because some of the people on the other side are good people—they are. But they have been captured. It is the Stockholm Syndrome. Some of the more extreme elements of the Labor movement have captured them and they cannot break free, because to break free means that they would lose their cosy sinecures over there, where they can sleep through question time and uncork their lunches. It is just wrong.


At the risk of labouring the point—and there is no pun intended there—I would like to suggest that those on the other side should embrace innovation. They should embrace change. They should embrace the spirit that Australia needs to confront for its viable future—and that is to throw off the shackles of yesteryear. The dinosaurs on the other side need to embrace modernity, much like I have. It is about saying that we need to move forward. We have to reject the tired old politics of fear that they have been peddling for such a long time.


People are no longer buying what you are selling. That is why Mr Shorten is at 15 per cent, it is why the percentage of people in trade unions is less than 15 per cent, and it is why the innovation quotient on that side is much less. (Time expired)

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:27):  Today is quite an extraordinary day. Today we have seen a document from the National Broadband Network Company that demonstrates once again the folly and the lies of those who have been peddling the NBN MTM. What we have seen today is a document showing that this government is so inept, so incompetent and so ideologically driven that they are prepared to buy a network from Optus that, today in question time, the minister said we are going to use. But, after Prime Minister Turnbull made nbn co buy it, what they have found is that it is 'not fit for use'.


There is a reason we were going to close it down—that is, because it was not fit for use. We knew it, Optus knew it, and the whole country knew it, but not Prime Minister Turnbull. He decided he knew better than all of the engineers and all of the experts in the country, and Optus today are laughing all the way to the bank.


Let us just check the scorecard, because we are regularly being told by this government what a great job it is doing. Let's check the score card of who is using the NBN today. Let me be the first to publicly out Senator Cory Bernardi, who has actually talked about his own NBN. He has the NBN, but he is not alone. Today, there are 610,000 users of the National Broadband Network on Labor's fibre network.


Let's compare that with after over two years in government: how many people are using Prime Minister Turnbull's network? Based on the last published figures, it is a grand total of 375. Six hundred and ten thousand are using Labor's network compared to, after two years and a billion dollars of wasted expenditure, 375 using the government's—Mr Turnbull's—network. So we have seen that this second-rate National Broadband Network is not meeting their election promises. They said it was going to cost $29 billion before this blow-out was exposed, and now it is going to cost $56 billion. Mr Turnbull said it would be rolled out in three years. Now it is going to be seven years before this cost and time blow-out are factored in. And Prime Minister Turnbull has no-one to blame but himself. Virtually every forecast that he has made on the NBN has been hopelessly wrong.


I want to go to the board of nbn co. Just recently, the board was asked to explain the difference for the board's approved strategic review, where the board decided that they had the information they needed to change the direction of the National Broadband Network. Based on the strategic review, this board made a decision to spend $56 billion—and more to come because of this cost blow-out and this time delay. When asked about this cost difference, Mr Morrow said, 'The strategic review did not have all the in-fill costs available to it.' That is a $15 billion blow-out, where the board of nbn co, the management of nbn co—and to be fair to Mr Morrow, he was not there—made a recommendation to shift to a $56 billion model without knowing the costs of the in-fill, the HFC or the FTTN.


Now we are getting all of this debacle coming home to roost. How could a board make a decision to switch to a $56 billion network without knowing the costs at the time? How could the CEO today say that the board members did not know the costs when the board made a decision to shift to a network that is now costing $56 billion? This board was one of political hacks! They were incompetent and they did not know what they were doing.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria—Assistant Cabinet Secretary) (15:39):  I table the explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Family Law Amendment (Financial Agreements and Other Measures) Bill will improve the operation of the financial agreements regime, strengthen laws against international parental child abduction, improve the operation of the family law courts and will also amend the Family Law Act 1975 to enhance protections for victims of family violence. 




Family violence measures



Today is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. It is therefore timely to note that this Bill contains measures that will improve the family law system's response to family violence.


Family violence is a serious social issue that affects the health and well-being of thousands of Australians and has far reaching effects on the Australian community as a whole. It is the Government's firm view that family violence and child abuse are unacceptable and require an urgent response. 


Measures in this Bill will enable state or territory courts making an interim family violence protection order to suspend or vary existing parenting orders until either a time specified by the court, or another court order is made. Currently, such suspension or variation expires after 21 days. This has the potential to put at renewed risk those who have been affected by family violence. 


This amendment represents the first step in responding to the recommendations of the Family Law Council's Interim report on Families with Complex Needs and the Intersection of the Family Law and Child Protection Systems andis consistent with a similar recommendation made by Victorian State Coroner, Judge Ian L Gray, in the inquest into the death of Luke Batty.


Other measures in this Bill will strengthen courts' powers to dismiss applications that are unfounded, an abuse of process, frivolous or vexatious. This will assist in ensuring that the family law system is not used as a mechanism to perpetuate abuse. 




Financial agreement measures



A key aspect of this Bill are amendments to the family law system's financial agreement regime to better enable families to resolve family law disputes outside of the courtroom.


Binding Financial Agreements are out-of-court, private agreements between people that outline how property and other financial matters will be dealt with in the event of the breakdown of a marriage or de facto relationship. Enabling separating couples to reach their own agreements allows them to take responsibility for, and provides them with certainty about, their own financial affairs. However, recent cases have created uncertainty surrounding the finality of Binding Financial Agreements.


Measures in this Bill will resolve uncertainties around requirements for entering into, interpreting and enforcing agreements. Provisions in this Bill will also make changes to the coverage of spousal maintenance matters in agreements, introduce a statement of principles to outline their binding nature, and reinforce the binding nature of the agreements to offer certainty to parties.


These measures are intended to ensure that prospective, current or former parties to a marriage, or a de facto relationship, can take responsibility for resolving their financial and maintenance matters with certainty, without involving a court. 




Parental child abduction measures



Measures in this Bill will strengthen Australia's laws against international parental child abduction by introducing new offences relating to the wrongful retention of a child overseas. This is consistent with Australia's obligations under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (the Hague Convention).


Amendments will also extend the location order provisions in the Act so that anyone, including the Commonwealth, State and Territory Central Authorities, can, for the purpose of the Hague Convention, apply for an order to locate children wrongfully removed from, or retained outside, Australia.




Operation of the courts 



Measures in this Bill are designed to improve the operation and efficiency of the family law courts.


Notably, this Bill will modernise the arrest powers provided by the Family Law Act. 


The existing arrest powers in the Family Law Act are broad, and lack significant mechanisms to guide arresters on the appropriate boundaries of their power. This amendment will add appropriate safeguards, consistent with the approach adopted for the other federal courts, and in the Crimes Act. 


For example, while currently the court may authorise any person to make an arrest and in doing so, authorise the person to use reasonable force and enter premises, these amendments will explicitly restrict the categories of persons who may exercise powers under the arrest provisions.


Technical and minor amendments 


Technical and minor amendments will improve the operation of the Family Law Act, including by correcting technical defects, ensuring consistent language and removing redundant provisions.




Conclusion 



The measures in this Bill will enhance the capacity of the family law system to address emerging issues identified by the Government in its partnership with the family law sector. In particular, the amendments will enable courts to offer better protection to victims of family violence and greater clarity to separating couples attempting to resolve disputes out of court.


Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

Senator SINGH:
  This week is Asbestos Awareness Week, yet James Hardie is reducing its support for asbestos victims, which is both unjustified and immoral. The company's interim profit statement shows that its contributions to the Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund were slashed by 44 per cent last financial year. That is despite Hardie's interim profits increasing by 22 per cent to more than $260 million. James Hardie must immediately step up to ensure that the Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund is properly funded.

Senator MUIR:
  At the time of writing this motion there was a significant stalemate between the Victorian state government and the federal government in relation to the $1.5 billion unspent allocations for the East West Link. I understand that in recent time there has been some conversations between the parties but no outcome as of yet. My motion acknowledges that only 30 per cent of the population lives in rural and regional Australia yet over 50 per cent of road fatalities occur in these areas. It was my intention to encourage all sides of government to consider the increasingly poor conditions of rural roads and the subsequent fatality rate and to spend the unspent allocations on upgrading rural roads, where the funding is desperately needed for safety reasons, not just congestion.


I acknowledge the federal Black Spot Program and Roads to Recovery program and note the increased allocations of funding over coming years. However, the need to repair many rural roads is more immediate. I had encouraged the public to send in pictures of damaged rural roads to visually highlight the issue. There is a large amount of interest, and I am still receiving them. I will continue to collect these pictures and will table them at a later date.

 (Victoria—Assistant Cabinet Secretary) (15:51):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator RYAN:
  The coalition government notes Senator Muir's ongoing interest in funding for regional roads. As Senator Muir would be aware, the coalition government is funding regional road upgrades not only in his home state and my home state of Victoria but right across Australia. In fact, the coalition government is spending $210 million to help the Victorian government duplicate the Princes Highway East between Traralgon and the regional town of Sale, where Senator Muir has his electorate office.


On top of this, the coalition government is also providing $500 million to duplicate the Western Highway and more than $180 million to duplicate the Princes Highway West—both projects, again, located in regional Victoria. These projects are in addition to the coalition government's funding commitments in the current Infrastructure Investment program, which include $3.2 billion for Roads to Recovery, $500 million for the Black Spot Program, $300 million for the Bridges Renewal Program and $230 million for the National Highway Upgrade Program.


The coalition government's preference is for funding which was previously set aside for the East West Link to be used on other transport projects already agreed to within Victoria, including those in regional areas rather than be dormant in a Victorian bank account.

 (Victoria) (15:52):  Mr President, I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator RICE:
  The Greens recognise the vital importance of making our regional roads safer, but we will not be supporting this motion because we do not believe that the full Commonwealth commitment to the East West Link should go to rural roads. The East West Link was a debacle and it is one that we are glad to have behind us. The Greens are committed to road safety and we acknowledge the trauma that regional and rural communities suffer as the road toll disproportionately affects those who live outside our major cities. 


We want to see a strong Commonwealth commitment to rural and regional roads so that we can bring down the road toll in regional Australia. However, we do not support the proposal that the full lot of Commonwealth funding for the dead and buried East West Link should go entirely to rural roads. The Commonwealth money should be redirected to cost-effective infrastructure that is built in the public interest. The $3 billion commitment should be returned to the Melbourne Metro Rail project to begin to unclog our congested city and reduce our car dependence. We commend Senator Muir's commitment to rural road safety and look forward to working further with him on this issue.

Senator MOORE:
  Thank you. Labor agrees with the core premise of Senator Muir's motion, especially the point about the cost of road trauma and death. Labor notes that more deaths per population occur in rural areas. Federal Labor invested record amounts to improve road and rail transport and there are several ongoing projects in rural Victoria, including the Western Highway and the Princes Highway and new projects to be funded under the boost to Roads to Recovery funding initiated by the opposition. Labor also spent $3.2 billion on the Regional Rail Link. Labor believes the East West funding should be spent on road and rail projects in Victoria. Whilst specifying roads, the motion does not specify rail or that the funding should go to Victoria. For this reason, Labor cannot support the motion as worded.

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Road Infrastructure</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,17,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2015-11-25,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (16:04):  I wish to make a contribution on what is now termed the Perth Freight Link, but I think there is a little bit of a history lesson that would not hurt those listening in. Perth's major port is the port of Fremantle, and it is no secret, Australia being an island nation, that there are hundreds of thousands of containers that come through the Fremantle port each year. Our major warehousing and distribution centre is the area of Kewdale and Welshpool. We also have up there our international airport, and we also have our domestic airport. Over the years since the Howard government, the domestic airport is now also a major warehousing facility.


For years we have had a patchwork system in our state where we have chucked in traffic lights every time a footpath crosses a road. We used to have this road called High Street when I was a young fellow living in Fremantle, before I moved out to Perth's eastern suburbs, to a place called Langford. Let me tell the eastern staters: when you move out to Perth's eastern suburbs, you are not progressing up the social ladder, I can tell you. It was always going to be the freight link, so to speak, between the port, our warehousing and distribution centres, and our major transport centres. This also is the doorway, as Senator Back and other colleagues from WA would know, to the resource-rich north-west. This major freight corridor has, over the years, carted millions and millions and millions of tonnes between Perth, the port, Kewdale and Welshpool and through to our northern areas, the Pilbara and the Kimberley. I spent 12 of my years running freight up and down that link.


But over the years it has just got ridiculous, and the Leach Highway is probably one of the worst highways in this country. I have said this on a number of occasions: whoever thought whacking traffic lights onto the Leach Highway and having two lanes each way over the Shelley Bridge, being four lanes—well, they actually merge, three into two—was a good idea, and whoever thought we had to have bus lanes running off and that it was a fantastic idea to bring in B-doubles and pocket road trains climbing Stock Road Hill, with up to 68 tonnes of freight, and to integrate general traffic, cars and people taking their kids to school, seriously should have been taken out the back and whacked around the ears.


So what we have got is an absolute disaster, but it has got even worse because successive governments over the years have done a lot of talking about how we are going to combat or face or approach our transport task doubling by 2020. In my previous life, it was not a secret. We all knew—those of us who were in the transport game all knew—our freight task was going to double, but no-one had the nous to think, 'Hang on, we'd better do something.' There is also live export out of our port of Fremantle. Just about everything comes in and out of Fremantle except fuel and fertiliser. Our port will be at capacity in somewhere between eight and 12 years—there are a few different figures around—but we still have this goat track called the Leach Highway. We need another port, and there is no secret. I do not think there is a Western Australian who would argue. We have to have the outer harbour. The outer harbour would be down at Kwinana, some 25 or 30 kays south of Perth, south of Fremantle, and we need a freight route to get to it.


We actually have to face facts: freight has to move. We cannot just put it in bloody balloons and float it around the suburbs. And do not worry, Mr Acting Deputy President; I actually saw something. Someone went to Germany to see some proposal about how you could airlift freight in balloons so you were not clogging roads. This is the mentality of some of the people we have had in Western Australia.


But what has made it worse? No-one has done a damn thing. We found out back in about 2014, not long after the election of the Abbott government. An announcement came out, with a freshly minted government and some freshly minted ministers, that the Perth Freight Link would be built. Those of us who have been around for a long time knew what the eastern bypass was, and we know the history behind the Fremantle eastern bypass and why it did not go ahead. We know that. So we had to find out: what was this Perth Freight Link? It was, in a nutshell—others will add to this—to upgrade that freight route I was talking about, the Leach Highway, that disastrous piece of infrastructure, to turn it into a major truck route. I do not know where all the cars are going to go, but they will probably stay on the Leach Highway, and that is their penalty. It also would be a toll road—and we were told we would never have toll roads. But it is a number of stages, Roe 8 and 9.


What it virtually boiled down to was that the federal government had a photo opportunity. I think there was newly minted Minister Cormann, as a senior Western Australian member of the government, and I think Minister Johnston was there as well. I think Assistant Minister Briggs was there announcing that just under a billion federal dollars was going to be spent in Western Australia doing up this freight route, and the state government—which really looked like the rabbit in the spotlight—would have to find the other $600 million, $700 million or whatever it was. To cut a long story short, it was going to be a $1.6 billion upgrade to move freight along.


So, bearing in mind that the government in Perth has lost its AAA credit rating, we also have the Perth-Darwin highway, which I have been absolutely 100 per cent behind from day one. That is a vital piece of infrastructure that we need. Plus there have been a few announcements in the last couple of elections about a Forrestfield rail line, but unfortunately the government over there says a lot of things during elections and then finds more excuses than a pregnant nun for why it cannot do it. I might withdraw that. This does wind me up. I withdraw that.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ketter
):  Thank you, Senator Sterle.




Senator STERLE:
  We did the inquiry. We went to Fremantle, and there were a number of us at the inquiry. We wanted to hear from people. We invited everyone. We invited those who were pro the freight link and those who were opposed to the freight link. Sadly, the main players, who are all for it, did not even turn up. They did not want to come and front the committee and tell the people why we need to move freight safely. We need to integrate the movement of freight and separate it from public transport.


We have now got to what we do know. There is now a $1.6 billion project. If you know Perth, you know we have a river just before the port. When we leave the Leach Highway at Kewdale or Welshpool, just before we get to the port we have a river, and we have to get across the river. This grand plan, which has now blown out to about $2.2 billion, stops about 50 metres before the river. I do not know what we are going to do there, because the existing bridge—for those of us who have the displeasure sometimes of having to drive over it—is a nightmare, and for heavy vehicles that is the only way they can get over to the port and back to Kewdale and Welshpool and over to other areas like Spearwood and so on.


But in the state government now—it is very public—the Premier, Mr Barnett, is bluing with his minister, Mr Nalder. They have conflicting time lines. We have now found out that the Premier has said, 'Well, we're not going to build Roe all the way.' We now read in TheWest Australian, that fantastic organ that we have over there, that the first stage will be built; for the rest, we do not even know what is going to happen there. We do not know when that is going to happen, because the Premier is now playing a game with his federal counterparts that he does not want to spend that money doing up the last stage—before we even talk about getting a bridge and upgrading the rail bridge across the river too—because he has other things he wants to build.


As a Western Australian, there are a number of things I have to say in a short time. I want freight to move. I was calling for a freight route 20 years ago, and I was ignored. I called for a freight route 10 years ago, and I was ignored. What would I know? But now, all of a sudden, when we really are at the pointy end, no-one knows what the heck we are doing. There are conversations about the tunnel. We have heard that; we picked that up in our inquiry. But we do not know where the tunnel will start, if there will be a tunnel. Infrastructure Australia told us that they did the costings on it. They did the work on it, but there was no inclusion of a tunnel. So it went from $1.6 billion to $2.2 billion and it stops 50 metres before the river, before we talk about another couple of bridges. It is just absolutely shambolic.


I heard Mr Ian King—he heads up the Western Australian Road Transport Association—on talkback radio in Perth a couple of weeks ago going absolutely berserk because even those who are part and parcel of the transport minister's forums and workshops and all that do not even know what is going on, and they are the ones who are responsible for representing the trucking industry. We have a lot of residents who live along the Leach Highway high street. Unfortunately, their homes are marked for destruction. We heard from people there.


There is an issue that I will not comment on. I will leave that to the Greens. They can have this argument about some wetland stuff. That is what they will do, and I am not surprised. It is next to my suburb. I will probably wander past on my morning walk and find Senator Ludlam chained to a bulldozer or something. That will not surprise me.




Senator Canavan:
  Tell us what you really think!




Senator STERLE:
  I will not be chained to the bulldozer, but it is just an absolute shambles. We are supposed to be the smart nation. We need to move freight in Western Australia, and successive governments have all put their heads in the sand.


Now I want to conclude with this because I do not have enough time to really tell you what I am thinking. I made a bet with Senator Johnston when he was the minister at the table in his very first round of estimates as the minister. I bet him in front of everyone—it is on Hansard—a $2 scratchie that this road will not be built. So, Senator Johnston, in my last five seconds I have remembered, and you are going to owe me a $2 scratchie.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-11-25,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (16:15):  I am delighted to rise to speak to this issue associated with the Perth Freight Link. I remind those listening that the coalition government has made a historic infrastructure investment commitment of some $50 billion to get on with building infrastructure that this nation so badly needs. In fact, it is the largest expenditure in our history. But in the context of Western Australia it is the Perth Freight Link project along with others like the NorthLink Perth-Darwin highway that Senator Sterle just spoke of, the Gateway WA project around the airport, the Forrest Highway in its time and now the commitment to Armadale Road. But it is the Perth Freight Link project for which the federal government has committed some $925 million towards construction. It is two stages at the moment and there will be a third. The first is the extension of Roe Highway in what is known as Roe 8. The extension beyond that is to the western side of the Swan River and then eventually will be the continuation, and that will be a doubling of the Stirling Bridge and approaches to it.


I then ask: where is the problem and why the issue? We know that congestion is crippling our city. We know, for example, that container traffic through the Port of Fremantle has gone up some 70 per cent from 2003-04 to 2013-14. Now some 700,000 boxes or 20-foot sea containers per year are destined to go towards 1.2 million. Senator Sterle quite correctly has drawn attention to the problems associated with Leach Highway, and I am going to confirm in my contribution that he has been talking about this for at least some 10 years when I draw attention to some comments he made.


But why have we got a problem? Because, contrary to what Senator Sterle said—that there was never a plan—of course there was always the Stephenson-Hepburn plan from 1955. The Stephenson-Hepburn plan included what is planned to be Roe 8 and an area known as the Fremantle Eastern Bypass, and that is where it all went wrong. The reason is the then minister, a Ms MacTiernan, now the federal member for Perth, protecting the political future of Mr Jim McGinty, the then Labor member for Fremantle, decided with him in her wisdom that they would actually delete the Fremantle Eastern Bypass and have it rezoned to residential. And this is why we are in this problem today. The government of the day made 17 million lousy dollars out of that exercise and, had that whole project been completed at that time, the estimates of cost are around about $220 million to $250 million in total. Instead, now we are looking at about $1.3 billion.


What did people at the time say? I am quoting now from the Hon. Simon O'Brien, still in the legislative council, from 7 April 2004. He was making reference to comments made by a TWU representative who we all now know is our good friend Senator Glenn Sterle. This is what he said, in part, on the idea of removing the Fremantle Eastern Bypass:


… this will create a frightening congestion problem of mammoth proportions in the very near future on all highways and major roads leading to the docks.


This was somebody of the same political persuasion as he. Mr Sterle said:


Even now Leach Highway, which carries most trucking to and from the port, is battling to handle the heavy freight …


That was in 2004, and of course we now have the horrific situation of Leach Highway. But it is even more interesting that his then colleague and, I guess, boss, Mr Jim McGiveron from the Transport Workers Union, made the comment about congestion killing, and of Ms MacTiernan, the then minister, he said:


Congestion kills our People; stuffs up our Environment, and it will destroy our Economy.


Yet Alannah in Wonderland is too busy playing choo choos with all our ""Monopoly Money"" to do anything about the impending traffic crisis.


He said she needed to spend a week in a truck driving backwards and forwards on Leach Highway to work out the gridlock situation that exists. I cannot actually use the words that Mr McGiveron used about Ms MacTiernan, because it would be un-parliamentary, but, if I was referred to the north end of a south travelling fat rat, I think you would get some sense of the words that Mr McGiveron was using in relation to whether or not Ms MacTiernan gave any care or consideration to truck drivers. He said, 'She didn't understand us and never recognises the vital role we play.'


So it is good to see Senator Sterle in this place today in fact confirming what we always knew, and that was that this Roe 8 has to be constructed, that Leach Highway was never designed—and for all the reasons Senator Sterle, with his depth of knowledge in the trucking industry, the number of sets of lights et cetera and the mixture of heavy vehicles and light vehicles. There are some hundreds of houses along Leach Highway that face straight onto and try to drive onto Leach Highway. It is predicted that we will see a 75 per cent increase in heavy vehicle traffic by 2021, rising to 110 per cent by 2031.


Something has to be done. Leach Highway is already carrying more than one and a half times the average metropolitan road traffic. There is already a rate of doubling of heavy vehicle accidents and incidents on that particular road. Something has to be done. We went into government at the state level back in 2008, when I was a candidate for the seat of Alfred Cove and unsuccessful—which, of course, allowed me to be able to then put myself forward as a candidate when then Senator Chris Ellison resigned. I very often thank both the Greens political party and the Labor Party for preferencing some 95 per cent against me in the seat of Alfred Cove, which has landed me where I am today.


But the simple fact of the matter is that there never has been any doubt that this was going to go ahead. I quote from an article in The West Australian newspaper from 12 November from a Mr Martin Stewart, a resident of the suburb of Willetton, in the approaches to Roe 8, where he and his wife bought in in 1985. In it he says, 'When my wife and I bought our land, clearly marked on the map was the route of the Roe Highway. We duly noted it. We bought our land anyhow within 300 metres of the proposed highway. As part of your approval process why don't you just get on with it?'


I want to lend my name and my voice to the fact that we will definitely have to have an outer harbour in the Kwinana area at some time into the future. It is disappointing to all Western Australians, in my view, that planning has not already started for the outer harbour. We are going to need the outer harbour, there is no question; and I would urge state and federal governments to get on with that planning process. 


It is my understanding that back in the 1890s when Charles Yelverton O'Connor was brought from New Zealand to the colony of Western Australia by Sir John Forrest, amongst others, as the chief engineer to build a new harbour, O'Connor said to Forrest that the place they needed to build it is where we are contemplating the outer harbour. So there are no arguments about that. 


There are two points to be made. Firstly, we know very well that even if we started the planning process today it would be 10 or 15 years before an outer harbour would be ready to be used. Secondly, we know that the inner harbour will always be used for container and related freight services. We know that the inner harbour will go up to maybe a million boxes rather than 1.2, but we know there will always be that demand. 


Senator Reynolds, who is sitting beside me, participated in the Senate hearing in Fremantle recently, along with Senator Ludlam, Senator Bullock and Senator Sterle, as I recall. It is disappointing to me that the community were not given a better and wider brief of the next phase, and that is the phase beyond Roe 8 up to the approaches of the Stirling bridge. The point that I made into the Hansard, answered by the relevant federal department person who was in Perth, was that contrary to the fears and expectations of the doomsayers and others, the actual extension of this road will have a heavy vehicle trench and residential traffic will not be on the road in competition with heavy traffic through that area. It is grossly disappointing that one of the witnesses who appeared before us was terribly upset by the fact that her home, along with others along High Road and Leach Highway, will be lost as part of this process. It was not appropriate for me to say to her, 'Your problem rests with Ms MacTiernan back in the period before 2002-04 when this problem should have been addressed by the Stephenson-Hepburn plan of 1955.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2015-11-25,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:25):  In every single major Australian city, people are stuck in their cars. It is making us late for appointments, costing us at the petrol pump and reducing the time we can spend at home with our friends and families. For decades, the response from state and federal governments has been to plough billions into bigger motorways, extra lanes and ever-more complex spaghetti junctions. This has achieved as much as loosening our belts to reduce obesity.


The initial sigh of relief is always short lived. From the Monash Freeway in Melbourne to the Mitchell Freeway in Perth to the M4 in Sydney, no matter how much a road is expanded it inevitably clogs up. And with 18 million motor vehicles registered in Australia, there are no more notches left on our motorway belt. We have hit peak road. Something has got to give. It is simply not efficient to build more tollways. They drain government coffers and destroy communities. 


The signs are there for all to see. The sooner we accept it, the easier it is going to be for everyone. You just have to look at the failure of the East West toll road in Melbourne. This was a project that was going to rip through homes and parklands at a cost of $1 billion for every kilometre. The Liberals kept the business case in a locked cabinet, and for good reason—because, for every dollar that was spent on the project, Victorians would have seen a benefit of a mere 45c. But the community would not stand for it. It was the people who won that campaign, with the Liberals losing what was dubbed by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott as 'a referendum on the East West Link'. Labor might have leapt to power in Victoria on the back of the Greens' and community's campaign against the toll road, but they do not seem to have learnt the lesson. They announced that they are pouring $400 million into adding more lanes to the Monash Freeway. It will inevitably become a 10-lane carpark.


This week we saw Brisbane's Airportlink sold to Transurban for $2 billion—60 per cent less than it cost to build just a few years ago. This loss of $2.8 billion comes off the back of a mess experienced since the start of this project by shareholders and every person paying tax. What a disgraceful waste. Four thousand kilometres away, the community is rallying against the Perth Freight Link, where the Liberals have once again underestimated the extent of the community outrage. A very similar story is playing out in Sydney with the Baird government's secretive WestConnex motorway. 


The Greens will continue to stand with those who are protecting their homes, their wetlands and their parks until these bad projects are dumped. These governments must start making decisions in the interests of the people they represent rather than the interests of big motorway businesses. If they fail to do so, they will be thrown out. 


The solution to our congestion woes does not lie down the same old path of more and more massive polluting tollways. We must give people a new way. We must give them an option of getting to work, to the shops or to visit a friend in a way that is quicker, cheaper and easier than driving their car. This means prioritising tram, train and bus projects and paths for people to safely walk and ride their bikes. 


We hear a lot from many on the government benches about the need to reduce public spending. The good news is that shifting our focus from roads achieves just that. It will free up our roads for the people who need them most. Modelling from Vancouver—a city with a very similar transport makeup to Melbourne—shows the high cost to society for every kilometre driven by road. Travelling on public transport has a cost too, but it is a fraction of that of roads. In contrast, when someone walks or jumps on their bike, the health benefits provide a net gain to society as a whole. I will repeat that. There are massive costs to society for every kilometre travelled by car but big benefits to society for every kilometre walked or cycled. Under former Prime Minister Abbott and Prime Minister Turnbull, this economically responsible new way forward has been beaten by an ideological insistence on roads. Prime Minister Turnbull may be good at taking selfies on trains, but that has not addressed the lack of transparency and waste that we are still seeing with toll road projects around the country. We must put this old way of thinking where it belongs—in the past—and make it quicker, cheaper and easier for all Australians to get around.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2015-11-25,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (16:30):  I just love following the Greens. It is like rainbows and lollipops. If we could all just bike and walk our way to work and address the significant freight task we have going forward as a country by walking and with pushbikes, we would be a better nation. It points once again to their absolute fixation on inner urban electorates and the elites in our community. They stand there and they profess that they are sticking up for workers. They profess to stick up for rural and regional Australia. They are doing nothing more than pandering to the elites in inner urban capital cities such as in my own home state of Victoria.


I rise to speak to the motion before us about the 'chaos, lack of transparency and waste surrounding the Abbott-Turnbull Government's outdated urban freeway projects', including, amongst other things, the East West Link in my home state of Victoria. Outdated! The Eddington report showed that the significant increase in cars on Melbourne's road infrastructure was actually going to increase from, I think, 165,000 cars to over 213,000 by 2030.


Senator Sterle made a significant contribution about the increased freight task going forward. That is the reality of the society, community and economy that we live in and work in and that provides the standard of living, particularly for those that have those wonderfully high house prices in Fitzroy—and that comes at a cost. That means we have to grow stuff and make stuff. We have to consume it domestically. We also have to get it to the ports to get it to the markets right around the world. So, Senator Rice, we have to build highways, we have to build bridges and we have to build railways because we need to get that product off the farm, down the road, onto port and out to market. Do you know what that does? That ensures that Australians have jobs and that local communities can do things together. They can educate their children, provide for their aged citizens and ensure that we have a sustainable health and education system because we have an economy that works and because we sell stuff to other people.


We are the infrastructure government and have made a $50 billion infrastructure commitment. We do not back away about being very proud of building the infrastructure that is going to help our nation grow and develop and be ready to maximise and take advantage of all the opportunities available to us in the 21st century, including those inherent in the free trade agreements negotiated this year and signed off by Minister Robb, which are going to have a fantastic impact on regional Australia. We also need our highways, bridges and railways for safety. Emergencies happen out in the regions. We have bushfires. We have floods. We have bushwalkers getting lost; we have issues in the snow. So we need infrastructure to ensure our community is safe. In the regions, we also need to ensure that our communities can socialise and that they can educate, volunteer, interact, play sport et cetera. That requires roads.


I am not sure how the under-13s from Irymple up in the Mallee will all get on their pushbikes to play their under-13 footy game on Saturday morning against Donald under-13s. They are going to have to leave Friday morning. They are going to have to skip school Friday so they can get on the pushbikes, Senator Rice, and get from Irymple down to Donald so they can compete against the under-13s in Donald. That is just ridiculous! It shows how out of touch the Greens are. Seriously, Senator Rice, are you going to subject the under-13s from Irymple to that? I cannot believe it.


I am straying, because I am supposed to be talking about East West Link. When we talked about the significant freight task—particularly in Victoria, the great state of ag—we recognised that earlier. It was the state coalition government that signed up to ensure that the Western Ring Road was connected to the Eastern Freeway. Do you know what that did, Senator Rice? In your contribution, you talked about people spending time in their cars, reducing the time they are able to spend with their families. Do you know what the East West Link would have done? It would have allowed people who now spend hours sitting gridlocked on Melbourne roads to be home an hour earlier. But do you know what it would cost? A small percentage of people in the inner urban electorates would have to have a tunnel under their homes. 


So that is what we are really talking about. We are not talking about walking and pushbikes. We are talking about the people that are living in Laverton, the people that are living in Dandenong, the people that are living in Noble Park and Berwick and Lilydale. The people who do not vote for the Greens. They are the ones that will have to continue sitting in their cars, because they cannot walk to work, Senator Rice. They cannot pushbike to work. The East West Link was going to and could still deliver real benefits, not only in quality of life for Victorians, particularly for outer urban Melburnians, but also—and, I think, incredibly importantly, going forward, given that the greatest product off the dock every morning out of the port of Melbourne is Murray-Goulburn dairy product going to the markets of the world—by underpinning regional Victorian local economies. The East West Link project would have taken those tankers off roads that they are currently on and put them on a much more sustainable and faster and more efficient and effective route.


I know that poor Senator Sterle was bemoaning his Premier playing games in Western Australia. I tell you what: he is not the only one. Senator Sterle did not mention my own Premier, Premier Andrews, and the games that the Labor Party in the state of Victoria is playing with this particular project. If Senator Siewert, through this motion, thinks the government is chaotic and non-transparent and wasteful, how about she open a Victorian newspaper whilst sipping a Fitzroy latte? Or maybe she would be down at Clifton Hill. Collingwood, maybe, is her cafe of choice. I would say that she should take Senator Rice, but Senator Rice would be riding her bike, so it might take her some time to meet up with Senator Siewert. But I will leave them to work out the logistics of how they actually get to the inner urban cafe to sip their lattes. But, if she put her Age down and picked up a Herald Sun—it might take a while to find one in Fitzroy—that is all she would have to do. If she turned its pages over the last couple of months, she would see the carnage of broken contracts that the Labor state government has caused. Goodbye, jobs. Goodbye, family time. Hello, drivetime radio—great for the ABC—which can only go so far to relieve driver boredom and stress. 


The coalition government wants to help Victoria solve its growing east-west transportation dilemma, and that is why we have committed $3 billion to the East West Link as part of a broader $7.6 billion infrastructure funding commitment to the state through our Infrastructure Investment Program. It was the Victorian Labor government who, after coming to power in late 2014, cancelled this project which had the capacity to transform Victoria's transport network and the state economy. The Victorian Labor government originally indicated costs of around $400 million for cancelling contracts. That is okay, Victoria; it is only going to cost us $400 million to cancel the contracts! That is a lot of state schools. That is a lot of kindergartens. That is a lot of hospitals. That is a lot of nurses. That is a lot of teachers. That is okay—Andrews can write that off. 


But do you know what is more appalling than him writing off $400 million for cancelling contracts? It now appears as though the full cost of cancellation will exceed $600 million. Thank you very much, Premier Andrews. How absolutely derelict is my Premier, the Premier of the great state of Victoria? The money of hardworking Victorians is handed over to not build the East West Link. I do not want to get all X gen on it, but I am going to quote Dire Straits—indeed Melbourne's congested roads are in dire straits—by saying that Victorians have unwillingly coughed up 'money for nothing' but they have definitely got their 'kicks for free'. What an absolute waste of money and a smack in the face for Victorians. 


Cancelling the East West Link not only cost Victorian taxpayers money; it also cost around 7,000 jobs, not that Senator Rice is concerned about that, because people with these types of jobs do not vote for the Greens party. They vote for the Labor Party. They vote for the coalition. They never vote for the Greens. These are construction jobs. Senator Rice and Senator Siewert, through this matter of public importance, you are claiming that you want to give Victorians more time at home and deal with the freight task by riding pushbikes. I am not sure how I am going to get a tonne of wheat in my pushbike's little front basket to get it around, but anyway. It shows how absolutely out of touch you are as a party and why you are absolutely irrelevant to our future.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2015-11-25,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (16:40):  This matter of public importance correctly identifies the 'chaos, lack of transparency and waste' surrounding a range of major infrastructure projects. It is important to reflect on this, thinking about the importance of transport infrastructure for our economy and for the communities that we represent here. There are limited dollars available in the Commonwealth budget to support transport, and it is critical that the dollars that we do have go to projects that we know will improve the productivity of our economies and, as Senator McKenzie rightly points out, the wellbeing and the lifestyles of the people that we represent.


Unfortunately, what is required to do that is an evidence base, and what we have seen from the government over the last two years has been a complete unwillingness to consider evidence, to develop evidence, to use it in making decisions. On being elected, the coalition provided billions of dollars in funding for major projects prior to any assessment whatsoever by Infrastructure Australia. That included the East West Link and the Perth Freight Link. The business case for WestConnex was only last week released, despite calls for it for over two years. It has been left to hardworking local state members like Jo Haylen and Jodi McKay to hold the New South Wales government to account and to demand that this information be brought into the public domain.


In all of these cases, the funding was allocated and, in the case of the East West Link and WestConnex, paid to the states prior to the assessment processes having been completed. This is not merely a technical problem or a bureaucratic problem, because, as a consequence of proceeding in this way, as a consequence of rushed processes, poor processes, processes in breach of election commitments, these projects have become mired in controversy and confusion. There have been constant changes to the scope and the routes, and it has brought out ridicule and cynicism amongst the broader community about the way that the Commonwealth goes about establishing transport projects.


It stands in stark contrast to the approach that we on this side of the chamber took to this issue when we were in office. In 2008 we understood that this was a real issue that we needed to grapple with, and we established Infrastructure Australia. It was a body explicitly designed to bring evidence to the fore. It was designed to independently assess infrastructure proposals using proper cost-benefit analysis. It was designed to some extent to take the politics out of decision making, to make decisions on the basis of economic benefit, not for political or other considerations. The way it went about that was that it produced an annual infrastructure priority list and it listed projects in order in terms of their ability to promote productivity. In government, we followed those recommendations. The top 15 priority projects developed by IA were funded by Labor, and we also used that body to produce national infrastructure audits as well as national freight, land and urban transport strategies.


The coalition came to government promising to maintain this approach and indeed promising to extend and intensify it. Their election policy said that they would make Infrastructure Australia a more transparent, accountable and effective adviser on the planning, selection and procurement of infrastructure projects. What actually happened was that the coalition introduced legislation to the parliament in November 2013 that sought not to give more power to Infrastructure Australia but to increase the minister's power to interfere in the decision-making processes of that body. It was only because of the good sense of the senators in this chamber that that proposal was blocked.


The policy also said that there would be a rigorous and transparent assessment of tax funded projects and that they would require all infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million to undergo a cost-benefit analysis. As I have already mentioned, the money for the East West Link and the Perth Freight Link was provided before these processes took place, before IA had a chance to assess those projects—absolutely in breach of the promises made by the coalition before coming to government and absolutely to the detriment of good policy, sound investment and productivity in the states where those moneys were allocated. 


I want to talk a little bit about WestConnex in my home state of New South Wales because, despite having $25 million to support the development of a business case as part of proper planning, the full business case was only released in redacted form last week. That saw in 2014 the New South Wales Auditor-General highly critical of the New South Wales government's compliance with its own project planning and approvals process, and major elements of that project have been sent back to the drawing board. 


The failure to properly articulate the case for WestConnex to explain what its role might be and the failure to consult with local people has meant that there is enormous public cynicism about the government's motives in supporting this project. And every time a government does this around questions of infrastructure, it diminishes our ability to make the decisions that we need to make as a government to fund sensible projects to improve our cities. It is absolutely critical that we get this right. 


People talk in general terms about the economic benefits of increased connectivity in cities, but what we forget is that there are real lived experiences behind that economic story. Transport is not an end in itself. It is a link between places that people want to be, where they are now and where they would like to get to. It is enormously important in terms of creating productive cities where people can get access to the jobs that they need to secure themselves and their families' livelihoods. 


The Grattan Institute has done some excellent work around this: looking in my home town of Sydney, in some suburbs, only 14 per cent of the total jobs available in Sydney can be accessed within a 45-minute car trip. It is even worse—much worse—if you are reliant on public transport. In many outer suburbs of Sydney, they offer access to fewer than one in 10 of the cities' jobs within an hour's travel on public transport.     


Of course I want to draw this chamber's attention to the fact that this has a gender dimension: women's workforce participation falls dramatically in Sydney's outer suburbs, and this is related to the availability of transport and the accessibility of jobs. Men and women in Sydney's eastern suburbs and inner west participate in the workforce in relatively similar levels but, in parts of Sydney's outer western and south-west, workforce participation falls to more than 20 per cent below that of men's. In part it is because of women's caring responsibilities that require them to have jobs that are within easy transport distance of their homes. If they need to get their children from school or take care of a sick parent or a disabled relative, they need to be working in a job that is within easy access of their home. The absence of transport options is absolutely making lives harder for residents in these parts of my city. 


The frustration for me—and I want to say this very clearly—is that, every time we muck up one of these projects, every time we fail to engage the community and every time we fail to present the evidence about the significance of one of these projects and we generate cynicism, we decrease our ability to make the decisions that we need to make our cities work. 


Transport is a most significant issue. We know that there are limited resources in the budget and we know that we need to apply those resources efficiently. We need to apply them to the projects that can really make a difference. An efficient investment does not mean prioritising road all the time to the exclusion of all other modes of transport. It also does not mean prioritising rail to the exclusion of all other forms of transport. It means gathering the evidence and making an evidence based decision about what will be the best project to provide the transport solution. That is the approach that people on this side of the chamber took whilst in government. That is the approach we recommend, and it is a terrible shame that the government does not adopt— (Time expired)

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-11-25,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:50):  It has been fascinating listening to the various sides of the chamber grappling with these questions of transport planning and freight movement for the 21st century—from Senator Sterle's contribution and his background in the trucking industry to the bizarre rant by Senator McKenzie who assumed that, if you did not support the establishment of eight-lane freight highways through sensitive wetlands and suburban areas, you must want to transport freight by bicycle. The divide in this parliament, I think, has never been greater around the provision of public transport infrastructure. 


I would also suggest that some of those coalition contributions that we have heard this afternoon have been quite stridently out of step with the new pitch and tone that I think Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is trying to establish. It will be interesting to see whether he is going to be able to bring his colleagues into line. This is no longer a question of rhetoric or messaging, because very substantial sums of public money are about to be invested by the Turnbull government and there will not be any place to hide. 


Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is visiting Western Australia on 9 December, we understand, and a short time ago my office hand delivered a letter to his office inviting him—I think, probably this is his first visit to the state of WA since taking office—to visit the Beeliar Wetlands and to meet with local residents and me. This is an area that people have been defending for more than 20 years from proposals to put freeway infrastructure bisecting the wetlands and flattening one of the last really decent stretches of old-growth banksia and mature woodland in the Perth metropolitan area.


In his contribution, Senator Back went to great lengths to talk about the Stephenson-Hepburn plan of 1955. Senator Back, with the greatest respect, transport planning has moved on some since 1955. Ms MacTiernan, the ALP member for Perth, who was planning minister, was briefly sledged by Senator Back for deleting the Fremantle eastern bypass. Ms MacTiernan does not need me to come in here and defend her—she is perfectly capable of standing up for her record—but she was absolutely right. She was absolutely spot-on. I do not know whether Senator Back realises it, but he just stood in here and advocated a four-lane freight highway through White Gum Valley and East Fremantle. It would have been an absolute catastrophe for that highway to have been smashed through those quiet suburban streets. Yet Senator Back is still in here condemning the former minister, Alannah MacTiernan, for doing what the community at the time was demanding and what was exactly the right thing to do.


I do not know how well-known this is—I presume Senator Back knows this, as I think he has lived in Perth his whole life—but the Stephenson-Hepburn plan of 1955 had a freeway and an overpass going over the river from a Stock Road extension at Point Walter onto Jutland Parade in Dalkeith, which is the street that for a while had—I do not know if it still has—the most expensive real estate in Perth. That got deleted and nobody misses it. It did not do any damage at all. We do not have to stick to the cast-iron template set down in 1955—which, we should also say was somewhat farsighted for its time. It had a huge amount of public transport infrastructure in it that successive governments failed to introduce. It was on the planning books but never actually made it to the ground.


Our invitation to Mr Turnbull when he visits Perth on 9 December is a very simple. The Prime Minister has the opportunity to put his state colleagues in their place, because they are in the process of seeking nearly a billion in Commonwealth funding for what I would say is now the greatest planning debacle in Western Australian history. I have never in my life seen incompetence on this scale for a project of this scale. They are making it up as they go along. Premier Barnett is now in open conflict with his hapless transport minister, Mr Dean Nalder. They cannot agree from one day to the next where this freeway is supposed to go, and they have their hands out for nearly a billion dollars. One day it is a tunnel and one day it is a trench. They still do not know how they are getting it into North Fremantle. People are having to piece together the jigsaw puzzle pieces of this catastrophic puzzle on the fly. After a while you realise that the reason we cannot find any coherence or sense in the Perth freight link is that it is not there to find. When Prime Minister Turnbull arrives in Perth he will be met and welcomed by the local community if he is willing to have a real talk with Premier Barnett and whoever happens to be transport minister at the time—because this can be fixed very easily.


It was actually good to hear Senator Back acknowledge the outer harbour. A new overflow container terminal in Cockburn Sound is simply a matter of time. It will need to be built. He said that it could not be built in less than 10 to 15 years. Fremantle Port and many others beg to differ. Seven years is the period of time that I have seen that we could get an overflow container terminal built in Cockburn Sound. There is already an uninterrupted stretch of freight freeway on Tonkin Highway between Kewdale and Orrong Road, and there is an almost direct and unbroken freight-rail link between the Kewdale container terminal and the site of the proposed outer harbour. The solution is actually right there in front of us. Rather than torching $2.2 billion—or whatever it is up to these days—of state and federal funds for wherever the Barnett government lands on the freight link, we can start that investment now, today, at the outer harbour and resolve this once and for all, with a dedicated road and rail link to a new overflow container terminal. Nobody in their right mind would try to move 1.5 million boxes a year through the container terminal at Fremantle. It is simply not going to happen.


So Prime Minister Turnbull, when he visits Perth in a week or so—a week and a half—will be met by a sustained and growing movement of ordinary people. Fifteen thousand people have already signed their names against this project. There are 31 formal organisations in the Save Beeliar Wetlands Coalition, including some who have been active on this campaign literally for decades. Yesterday, when drilling began, many of those people were there. The Western Australia Police, who are unfortunately going to be the meat in the sandwich at this confrontation that will simply escalate, were there in numbers and so were ordinary members of the community, who sat down in front of vehicles until the Main Roads Department moved that drilling rig offsite. There are many legal avenues. The environmental approval by the state EPA is presently tied up in the state Supreme Court. That is a matter that will be heard within a week. Only in the last 48 hours an application for an emergency declaration under section 9 of the federal Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act has been lodged. And it is likely that this project will also be challenged in the Federal Court, because Minister Hunt's approval was based on flawed state approvals.


The federal Liberal Party and the National Party, despite some of the rather poorly informed commentary that we have heard from them this afternoon, do have the opportunity in an election year to differentiate themselves very sharply from their state colleagues. If they do so, I personally—and I imagine I would speak for a reasonable number of participants in this debate from right across the political spectrum—will not be beating them up for a backflip; I will be congratulating them for seeing reason. The Perth freight link will not be going ahead. As much as Senator Sterle would like to joke about politicians chained to earthmoving equipment, it has been a long while since I have been arrested for non-violent civil disobedience.



Senator Canavan interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  You can laugh all you like, Senator Canavan. One day if a project such as this is passing your back fence you might find yourself in this position too when you realise just how poorly conceived some of these funding decisions are. Local community members from North Lake, Bibra Lake, Perth's western suburbs and also from much further afield—as we discovered at a rally just this past weekend—have pledged non-violent civil disobedience, and I and many others will be standing shoulder to shoulder with them.


The Prime Minister has the opportunity when he visits Western Australia in 10 or so days to actually resolve this issue once and for all. It is not an intractable planning decision that has been made here. It is not an intractable confrontation. There is a solution that is staring us right in the face. Professor Peter Newman and his team at CUSP, the local governments who have found themselves in the path of this immensely unpopular project, residents, those who have just taken the time to inform themselves, Aboriginal people who are trying to protect 40,000 years of continuous occupation and culture over that piece of country and a very wide political coalition—all of us—standing together will welcome the Prime Minister or any of his federal Liberal-National colleagues if, when they visit Perth, they swing that large public investment behind a genuinely scalable freight solution for Perth's suburbs. That proposal is there on the table. It is reasonably well delineated.


It would have fallen at the first hurdle if we had a genuinely independent assessment process for Commonwealth infrastructure funding because the state government has chosen to put no information into the public domain at all. If they are so proud of their project, the first thing they should do is table the full business case, table the freight modelling and table any one of the nine freedom of information requests that have been denied that we have submitted and that other colleagues have submitted. If this project is so great, put the evidence on the table. It is going to be a disaster. It will not get built, but fortunately the solutions are well at hand.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:00):  Urban motorways reveal some of the worst aspects of how major parties do politics and the worst aspects of their own transport policies. In Sydney we have this madness of a WestConnex urban motorway project. A 33-kilometre, dirty tollway that would divide Sydney, bring greater air pollution, increase congestion, divide suburbs and rip up bike lanes. We know that is so often the case because we have seen it in the past with urban motorway projects that have brought so many problems—not just transport, not just health wise but also economic. There have been disasters.


We know who the winners are out of this. The winners are the mates of the Liberals and Labor—the developers and motorway builders—who stand to pick up the billions of dollars that is the cost of these massive projects. In Sydney we have the Cross City Tunnel that has gone into receivership twice. The Lane Cove Tunnel has been in receivership once. On both those motorway projects bike lanes that had to be built as part of the project were subsequently ripped up as one problem with the project after another had to be solved, and they partly tried to do that by ripping up bike lanes.


What we also know from experience with these urban motorways is that there is a huge fudge when it comes to the business case. The assertions that there are so many cars that will use this and that great profits can be made out of these motorways. Again, going to the Cross City Tunnel, that is just a joke. To this day so often you cannot see a car in it as you go through it.


I pay tribute to the EcoTransit organisation, and particularly to Michelle Zeibots who identified the problem early on that you could not trust the figures. Right from the beginning the backers of the Cross City Tunnel said 95,000 cars would use this tunnel. Ms Zeibots identified that you could not fit that many cars in it in a day. Now it is running at about 40,000 and it is not expected that it will increase very much at all.


Coming back to the WestConnex, again we see the problems with the transport policies of Liberal and Labor. There has already been a blow-out. A project that started as supposedly $10 billion in 2012 is now out to $16.8 billion, and this is what the state and federal governments are combining forces to push through.


Imagine what that money could do if spent on public transport. The solutions it would bring to Sydney would be fantastic. But it is money that could be spent in other areas—other capital cities or regional areas—that are crying out for public transport. Now we have this madness of the WestConnex project running at what we understand are $26 tolls with tens of thousands of cars dumped into the inner city. That effectively is the policy that Labor and the Liberals would bring to our city if it is allowed to proceed.


Again, it does put the spotlight on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. He cannot get away with making out he is a great advocate of public transport if he is going to allow the WestConnex project to go ahead in his city. It will divide suburbs, cause more congestion, which will lead to more air pollution and more health problems, rob money from public transport and make it harder for a lot of businesses that are along the main roads where there will be 24-hour clearways. Every way you look at this project it is a disaster.


What adds to the outrage is that now there is an asbestos scandal building around this, as large numbers of trucks are moving asbestos from the St Peters area, where they will want to build a spaghetti junction, out to Western Sydney, dumping it at a waste facility that has on its website that it does not take asbestos. And now they are discovering asbestos along the M5 Motorway, which has to be expanded as part of the WestConnex project. I have visited residents who are deeply concerned that asbestos is in their backyard, it has not been properly stored and it is being disturbed in the ways that we know are so wrong.


This is a project that really should be stopped now. Let's get those billions of dollars into public transport. It is a policy of urban motorways and it is a failed policy. It is 2015. We hear from so many politicians in this place that we need liveable cities. What goes hand in hand with liveable cities is public transport. Public transport needs money. The projects that we need have been identified—light rail, heavy rail and more buses. We can do it with clean energy. The future is clear.

The speeches read as follows—





ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2015





It is my pleasure to introduce the Bill to this chamber. The Bill reflects this Government's ongoing commitment to empowering Indigenous land owners and community members with localised decision making, particularly about the use of their land. It enables Indigenous land owners and community members to play an integral role in fostering economic development in their communities, and move them closer towards owning their own homes.





The Bill also demonstrates the Government's commitment to recognise the ownership of land in the Northern Territory by its traditional owners. To that end, it schedules three parcels of land which will enable that land to be granted as Aboriginal land. 





Delegations of Land Council functions and powers have been a part of the 
Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 
since 2006 but have as yet not been used. 





Delegations allow for the Land Council to agree to Aboriginal corporations, comprised of traditional owners or community members from a certain area, carrying out Land Council functions and powers in that area where appropriate.





The members of these corporations have an intimate knowledge and connection to the land in that area and the community who live on that land. Furthermore, delegations would allow the Land Councils to streamline decision-making processes with respect to activities on Aboriginal land.





This Bill will make changes to the delegation provisions to give clear requirements for corporations applying for delegations; provide clear time frames for Land Councils to make decisions about delegations; and have the Minister for Indigenous Affairs receive copies of applications.





This Bill will also repeal the ability for the Minister to override a decision by a Land Council not to delegate functions or powers, and will enable a Land Council to exercise functions or powers that have been delegated. This brings the delegations into line with standard practice and will encourage Land Councils and applicants to consider delegations as an opportunity that should be pursued.





Another element of the Bill relates to the community of Mutitjulu which is located on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory and in 1985 was leased by the Uluru-Kata Tjuta Land Trust to the Director of National Parks for 99 years. Because of the nature of the lease to the Director of National Parks, tenure arrangements in Mutitjulu are irregular, uncertain, and inconsistent with other communities on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. 





In order to resolve this issue, this Government, through the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, has been working in close cooperation with the Mutitjulu community, traditional owners and the Central Land Council to negotiate a sublease which will provide certainty of tenure in Mutitjulu. 





The Bill amends the Land Rights Act


to allow the Executive Director of Township Leasing, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to hold a sublease of Aboriginal land.





The Bill also makes provision for the Executive Director to transfer this sublease of Aboriginal land to an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation, and for that corporation to transfer that sublease back to the Executive Director.  Any such transfers will need to be in accordance with the terms of the relevant sublease.





The Bill allows for the Minister for Indigenous Affairs to direct that funds from the Aboriginals Benefit Account be paid to an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation for the purpose of acquiring and administering that sublease. The Minister may also direct that such funds be paid to the Executive Director of Township Leasing if it holds a sublease of Aboriginal land.





Accordingly, the amendments contained in the Bill will allow for the subleasing of the community of Mutitjulu to the Executive Director of Township Leasing. The Bill will also facilitate a robust Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation, comprised of community members and traditional owners, holding that sublease in the future. 





Certainty of tenure in Mutitjulu will allow the Mutitjulu community to take advantage of the unique economic development opportunities offered by its location in close proximity to two of Australia's most visited World Heritage sites, Uluru and Kata Tjuta. These negotiations signal the strong interest of this Government, the Mutitjulu community and traditional owners in their community's economic future.





The Mutitjulu arrangements, which contemplate transferring responsibility for holding the sublease to a community corporation in the future, are also reflective of the Government's direction in township leasing. 





Similar negotiations in the Northern Territory are being undertaken between traditional owners, Land Councils and the Government to give communities with economic vision a new way forward for making land decisions. Instead of leasing their community to the Executive Director of Township Leasing, a strong community entity may instead take control of the township lease and have direct responsibility for decisions about land use in their communities. Some communities may wish to lease to the Executive Director with provision for a transfer to a community entity in the future. 





This Bill will also allow for the Minister for Indigenous Affairs to vary the administrative boundaries of existing Northern Territory Land Councils, where the relevant Land Councils have requested the variation.





This will enable the implementation of agreed settlement arrangements for the Vernon Islands Land Claim, which requires the transfer of the land subject to claim from the jurisdiction of the Northern Land Council to the jurisdiction of the Tiwi Land Council, and will allow any such agreed variations to be resolved in the future.





Finally, the Bill will add parcels of land in the Wickham River area, in the Simpson Desert and in the Vernon Islands to Schedule 1 to the Land Rights Act. These amendments will enable the parcels of land to be granted to the relevant Aboriginal Land Trusts.





I commend the Bill to the chamber. 



AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT (CARGO) BILL 2015


The Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Cargo) Bill 2015 will amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to ensure Australia's air cargo security arrangements keep pace with international standards. In particular, the amendments will ensure that Australia's $4.8 billion worth of air freight exports to the United States continue without disruption. 


The United States obliges all airlines transporting air cargo to the US on passenger flights to examine 100 per cent of air cargo at piece-level. This means that each individual box, carton or other item in a shipment must be examined by technology or physically inspected before it is loaded onto a US-bound aircraft. This is a US Government legislative requirement. . The US has recently re-evaluated Australia's air cargo security arrangements and determined that they do not meet US standards.


The Australian Government has negotiated a two year timeframe to implement the changes required by the US. This will give Australian-based exporters, freight forwarders and airlines time to adopt new security measures for the preparation of US-bound air cargo. The amendments proposed in the Bill are an important element of the Government's two part strategy to respond to the US requirements, a strategy which will be implemented in partnership with industry. 


The first element in the response is already being implemented. Approved businesses are now able to examine air cargo off-airport and have this process recognised under the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005. Cargo screened under these arrangements is not required to undergo further examination at the airport cargo terminal.



The second element in the response is the establishment of a Known Consignor scheme under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004. 


Known Consignor is an internationally recognised method of meeting air cargo security requirements that focuses on ensuring the security of goods from early in the supply chain through to their ultimate loading onto an aircraft. It can be an effective, alternative means of securing air cargo from unlawful interference compared to the traditional methods of screening or alternative examination techniques. 


The purpose of the known consignor concept is to place the emphasis for the practical implementation of security controls on the actual shipper or originator of the goods and to ensure the security of air cargo and mail as they move through the supply chain. This requires goods to be produced, packaged, stored, transported and handled in a manner that ensures their integrity and protects them from unauthorised interference from the point of origin and throughout the secure supply chain.


The Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 establishes a regulatory framework to safeguard against unlawful interference with aviation. This includes measures to ensure the security of air cargo. 


The Act gives effect to Australia's international obligations under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago Convention, in particular Annex 17 to that Convention which deals with security.


The amendments proposed by the Bill are required to establish the legal authority for the establishment of the Known Consignor category of industry participant.


The amendments clarify what is meant by cargo receiving clearance and being cleared for carriage through a secure supply chain. They will also establish a framework to enable the making of additional regulations and other legislative instruments to provide the details of the new enhanced measures.


The Government has an ongoing commitment to ensuring the safety and security of Australians and Australian interests. The Government is also committing to maintaining and growing Australia's international trade.


This Bill ensures that the Australia is positioned to deal with emerging security risks and continues to have a sound, effective and internationally recognised air cargo security framework.


I commend the Bill to the House.


HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (SAFETY NET) BILL 2015


This bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 to remove the two existing Medicare safety nets and the Greatest Permissible Gap, and replace them with a new and simpler Medicare safety net.


This bill will result in savings of around $266.7 million over five years.


This amendment will ensure that a strong safety net continues to protect all Australians from high out‑of‑pocket costs for medical services provided out‑of‑hospital. It will also address many of the known equity and complexity issues of the current arrangements.


The current arrangements that assist families with their expenses for medical services include the Extended Medicare Safety Net, the Original Medicare Safety Net and the Greatest Permissible Gap. These arrangements provide additional benefits to individuals and families that have high out‑of‑pocket costs for out‑of‑hospital services. The services assisted include GP and specialist attendances and services provided in private clinics and private emergency departments. 


Of the three arrangements, the Extended Medicare Safety Net accounts for the majority of the expenditure.


There are a number of problems with the current arrangements which this bill seeks to address. 


The current safety nets are complicated and confusing. They all serve the same purpose of assisting patients with out‑of‑pocket costs for out-of-hospital services. However, they work in different ways and have different thresholds. They interact with each other and can sometimes all be applicable to the same medical service. They are unnecessarily complex and difficult to understand. 


The current arrangements are also inconsistent. There is a limit on safety net benefits that will be paid for some but not all out‑of‑hospital services. Some of these limits are fixed dollar amounts, while others are based on a percentage of the Medicare fee. This inconsistency in arrangements can be very confusing for patients and medical practitioners. 


While most doctors charge reasonable fees for their services, some doctors and service providers have used the Extended Medicare Safety Net to underwrite excessive fees. This has led to increased patient out‑of‑pocket costs in some areas. Evidence of this behaviour was found in two independent reviews of the Extended Medicare Safety Net in 2009 and 2011 which were undertaken by the Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation from the University of Technology, Sydney. Both reviews found that the Extended Medicare Safety Net programme had the unintended consequence of increasing the fees charged by doctors, and that the majority of the benefits available were being paid to people living in high income areas rather than to people with significant medical conditions. The 2009 review found that for some services, for every dollar spent through the Extended Medicare Safety Net, more than 78 cents was going to health providers in the form of fee increases, whilst only 22 cents was assisting patients with their costs. Clearly, this is not an efficient use of Government money.


The current arrangements may also support less safe medical practice, such as providing complicated surgical services out‑of‑hospital to take advantage of the unlimited rebate available under the Extended Medicare Safety Net.


Many changes have been made to the programme to address some of these issues since its introduction in 2004, including increases to eligibility thresholds and capping of safety net benefits. Obstetric services, Assisted Reproductive Technology services and a number of other selected items were capped in 2010 to address excessive fees charged by a small number of service providers. All consultation items, including for GPs and specialists and a number of other selected items were capped in 2012. More recently, in January 2015 the upper threshold of the Extended Medicare Safety Net was increased to $2,000.


However, these changes have contributed to the complexity of the programme and have not addressed all issues. At the moment, medical services are not uniformly capped which means excessive fee inflation can still occur to services that are uncapped. For example, immediately after the capping of the safety net benefit for a cataract surgery service, the provider fee for an anaesthetic for cataract surgery increased greatly, in some cases by almost 400 per cent. Furthermore, some people reach their threshold almost immediately due to the unlimited amount of out‑of‑pocket costs that count towards the threshold. This makes the consumer relatively insensitive to the further fees charged, allowing for fee inflation.


The time is right to replace the complex, inefficient Medicare safety net arrangements with a new Medicare safety net. The new Medicare safety net will strengthen the system for patients into the future while contributing to a more sustainable Medicare system. Its design has been informed by the findings of two independent reviews; ongoing consultation with the medical profession since the introduction of the Extended Medicare Safety Net in 2004; and concerns raised by patients. 


The new Medicare safety net will continue to provide an additional benefit to families and singles for out-of-hospital Medicare services once an annual threshold has been reached. Unlike the Extended Medicare Safety Net, the amount of out‑of‑pocket costs per service that count towards the threshold will have a limit, as will the amount of safety net benefits paid per service to qualified people. This will restrict excessive fee inflation by medical providers. These limits are universal, unlike the ad hoc capping arrangements for the Extended Medicare Safety Net. Importantly, although there will be a limit on the accumulation and benefits payable for each individual service, there is no limit to the total safety net benefits that can be paid to a person in a year.


Currently families are able to pool their out‑of‑pocket costs to reach the safety net threshold sooner. This arrangement will continue and in addition non-concessional singles will have a lower threshold than most non-concessional families. This acknowledges that people who are single and not part of a family are required to meet their health costs on their own, but do not always have access to the significant Government support provided to Concession Card holders.


The thresholds to access the new Medicare safety net will be significantly lower than the current thresholds for the majority of people. More people will receive a safety net benefit than under the current safety net. The new thresholds in 2016 will be $400 per year for singles and families that are concession card holders, $700 for families eligible for Family Tax Benefit Part A and non-concessional singles and $1,000 for non-concessional families. 


In response to concerns about the Extended Medicare Safety Net that have been raised by the public, changes have been made to assist families where members are living apart due to ill health, as often occurs in nursing home arrangements. Under the new Medicare safety net, couples who are living apart because of ill health or infirmity will be able to register as a safety net family and pool their out‑of‑pocket costs to reach the threshold sooner. 


The administration arrangements for families where some members are concession card holders and some are not will be streamlined to the benefit of those families. The definition of a dependent will also expand to allow youths aged 16 to 25 who are temporarily unable to study full time due to ill health to be considered part of the safety net family. 


In summary, this bill will introduce a new, carefully designed Medicare safety net which will allow the Government to continue to support singles and families experiencing high out‑of‑pocket costs, while streamlining the Medicare safety net arrangements and contributing to the sustainability of Medicare.


 


MARITIME LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2015


Australia has the 5th largest shipping task in the world. 99 per cent of our imports and exports are carried by ships. As a Government it is our duty to ensure that our laws for prevention of marine pollution are adequate, up to date and consistent with international law. 


Today I introduce to the house the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill (the bill) that will implement measures to amend and correct errors in Australia's maritime legislation ensuring our domestic obligations are aligned with various international conventions under our international obligations stemming from the International Maritime Organization (IMO).


The bill will amend four principle acts, namely the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships Act 1983), known as the POTS Act; the Navigation Act 2012, known as the Navigation Act; the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage) Act 2008, known as the Bunkers Act; and the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981, known as the CLC Act. 


Of particular importance is the amendment to the Navigation Act, wherebythe definition of 'dangerous goods' is amended to align with the current definition of dangerous goods as defined in Chapter VII (Chapter 7) of the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, commonly referred to as SOLAS. 


This bill also corrects minor drafting errors identified from the original drafting of the Navigation Act. 


The bill will make amendments the POTS Act to replace the definition of ""sea-near-a-state"" that was amended as an unintended consequence of a drafting error in the Maritime Legislation Amendment Act 2012. 


Importantly this bill will include an additional measure to close a loophole that has been identified in relation to the carriage of heavy grade oil (HGO) in Antarctic waters. In 2014, the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the IMO was made aware that a fishing vessel sank in the Antarctic while carrying HGO in its ballast tank for later use as fuel once the ship had left the Antarctic Area (a ballast tank assists with ship stability and would ordinarily hold water). The flag State of this vessel did not take action, as they interpreted the regulation as not extending to banning HGO carried as ballast. This interpretation / loophole is inconsistent with the original intent to minimise the presence of HGO in Antarctic waters to the maximum extent practicable. It also highlighted the real risk to the Antarctic area since this loophole was brought to light as a result of this serious incident. As such, this amendment will close that loophole ensuring Australia's Domestic legislation is consistent with our obligations at the International level.


The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development identified a drafting error in the Bunkers and CLC Acts that affects the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's (AMSA) ability to take enforcement action against vessel operators who do not carry appropriate insurance certificates. This bill will correct the errors in the legislation, which will allow action to be taken by AMSA against non-compliant vessel operators. Currently the Bunkers and CLC Acts do not accurately specify the appropriate certificate which is to be maintained by a vessel operator. 


I commend this bill to the Senate.


 


MARITIME TRANSPORT AND OFFSHORE FACILITIES SECURITY AMENDMENT (INTER-STATE VOYAGES) BILL 2015


This Bill reiterates this Government's efforts to boost productivity by reducing the cost of regulation on Australian industry.


The Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Inter-State Voyages) Bill 2015 will amend the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 to remove Australian regulated ships that are used solely for inter-State voyages from the existing regulatory regime. 


The Act establishes a regulatory framework to safeguard against unlawful interference with Australian ports, maritime transport and offshore facilities.  It gives effect to Australia's international obligations under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974 and the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. 


Currently under the Act, all Australian flagged ships of 500 gross tons or more; or that carry 13 or more passengers on international and interstate voyages are security regulated.  They must have a Ship Security Plan which includes a security assessment of their operations that provides information on the security measures that the ship has put in place to prevent unlawful interference and the action they would take if an incident occurs.


At present, Australian flagged ships that travel on domestic interstate voyages incur costs due to security regulation that are not incurred by (unregulated) Australian flagged ships that only undertake intrastate voyages. This is despite there being arguably no increase in security risk as a result of crossing a domestic state border.



Australia has no obligation to security regulate interstate shipping and there is limited benefit in continuing to do so. The security risks will not change if the existing regulatory regime is removed. The proposed deregulation action will remove the disparity between intrastate and interstate shipping and provide an estimated saving to industry of $938,000 per year.  


It is in the public interest to continue security regulating passenger and vehicle ferries used for inter-State voyages due to the nature of their operations in transporting large numbers of passengers and vehicles. Therefore, it is proposed to develop appropriate amendments to the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Regulations 2003 to continue the security regulation of such ships.


The Government is committed to ensuring the safety of the travelling public and advancing our maritime trade interests.


Ensuring Australia's maritime transport sector is secure and efficient is central to those outcomes.  As such, the maritime transport security regulatory framework is regularly reviewed to ensure it is responsive to changes in the maritime security environment. 


This Bill has no impact on the security obligations of foreign-flagged ships under the Act.


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:36):  I move:


That the Small Pelagic Fishery (Closures Variation) Direction No. 1 2015, made under subsection 41A(3) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991, be disallowed [F2015L01450].


This motion I have moved is to disallow a set of regulations that were tabled on 12 October. Those of us in this place understand that all senators have the right and the privilege as parliamentarians to move to disallow regulations within 15 days of them being tabled in the Senate. This disallowance is quite simple. It is to stop a new set of regulations that remove an existing night ban on fishing by the supertrawler called the Geelong Star.


I want to make it very clear to those who may read this Hansard or who may be listening to this debate that this is a function of being a senator: having the right and the privilege to move a disallowance. But it is not something to be taken lightly. We are here as elected representatives for our voters, for our members and for those who share the same values as we do. On top of that, and most importantly, we are here to represent our state. In my case, that is the state of Tasmania. I know that this issue is not just something that people feel strongly about to the point where they may disagree in arguments. They actually go out of their way to tell you that they have significant concerns over the operation of large factory freezer vessels in Australian waters.


The next thing I want to point out is that the government have an existing ban in place for supertrawlers. The legislation was brought to parliament, to both houses, last year, and they implemented a ban on large factory freezer vessels over 130 metres in length. I have yet to receive an explanation at all from the government or from AFMA as to how that 130-metre limit was set. There has been no explanation about how a trawler that is slightly less than 100 metres is any less dangerous to marine life than a boat over 130 metres. Nevertheless, we still have acknowledgement from the government that these kinds of vessels should be banned, so they banned vessels longer than 130 metres.


Why have they banned these vessels? I can just guess that they have also received feedback from communities around the country, from fishing communities, from conservationists and from seaside communities, that they have grave concerns over very large factory freezer vessels operating in our waters, taking and targeting small pelagic fish. These fish are essentially in the base of our food chain in the ocean for a lot of other species of fish—target species of fish for recreational fishers—and of course for marine life such as dolphins, seals, penguins and seabirds. They all feed on these building-block fish, the small pelagics.


The government may also be concerned about the international reputation of these vessels. These are vessels that have helped break the ocean everywhere they have fished. They have plundered the seas all around the world. That could be a reason that the government do not want to see these kinds of vessels. But also they know that this is a slippery slope to seeing a lot more industrial fishing in this country, industrial fishing that may allow other supertrawlers to come here and that may increase the total allowable catch for small pelagic fish into the future. We have seen a lot of pressure and a lot of lobbying and an enormous amount of debate in the Senate and around the country about the arrival of the Margiris, or Abel Tasman, and the current supertrawler, the Geelong Star. We have seen an enormous amount of debate.


Clearly, the Liberal government have facilitated the arrival of both these boats. They have been champions of supertrawlers. It concerns a lot of people, given the public discomfort and in some cases even outrage over the arrival of these boats, that nothing is going to stop them, and we will see a lot more of them into the future.


For me, it really hit home to me last Christmas when I was lucky enough to sail on a boat in Sydney to Hobart race. I was on a yacht, and I was hundreds of kilometres off the coastline, off Tasmania. Acting Deputy President Bernardi, you have been there yourself. I remember seeing one of these bait balls—what fishermen call bait balls—where a lot of the small fish are schooling. You can spot them from a mile away because seabirds come from every direction. When you get close to one, and we sailed close to one, you see the dolphins. I even saw pilot whales. You see seals, and of course fairy penguins are another example. They feed on these fish, and it is amazing to watch.


You can imagine that a large factory freezer vessel out there catching these fish is going to have impacts on the marine life that also feeds on those fish. This was pointed out to us by the independent scientific panel that was set up by Labor on the arrival of the first supertrawler, when it looked at the potential impacts of this kind of fishing activity. It made it very clear that these were risks that needed to be addressed and that these kinds of marine life feeding on these small pelagic fish would be impacted by this kind of fishing activity.


To me, it really hit home. Where my family and I go for our summers and where I go surfing with my kids, every night when my kids were young we would go and watch the fairy penguins. They leave at sunset, and they go out. They catch these fish, and they come home, and they feed their young. Those are the same fish that are going to be targeted by this vessel. People think through these kinds of things, and they wonder what impact a future of industrial fishing in this fishery will have for marine life.


We then have to ask ourselves why, with the arrival of the Geelong Star, a smaller boat than the Abel Tasman, at slightly less than 100 metres, this boat was allowed to go fishing without the proper precautions being put in place to prevent the bycatch of seals, dolphins and other marine creatures. This is what we are debating here today. This is ultimately what this disallowance motion is about. The Greens feel very strongly that we should take the strongest possible precautions to protect especially cetaceans such as dolphins, and seals and other marine life—the strongest possible protections.


Why do we protect dolphins and seals? People may not be aware, even in this chamber, that dolphins and seals are protected under Australian law. They are protected. It is an offence to harm a dolphin. The maximum penalty is two years in jail or a $180,000 fine. Seals are also protected with similar clauses under a different section of EPBC. The fishing industry gets an exemption. They are allowed to kill dolphins and seals, but to do that they have to have a fisheries management plan in place—a vessel management plan.


In the case of the Geelong Star a vessel management plan was put in place but minister Hunt has to sign off on it. I will read how the minister may accredit plans, regimes or policies if the minister is satisfied:


(f)  the plan, regime or policy requires persons engaged in fishing under the plan, regime or policy to take all reasonable steps to ensure that cetaceans are not killed or injured as a result of the fishing …


When the Geelong Star arrived here it went out on its first weeks of operations and killed nine dolphins, including four dolphins in one throw of its net, and 12 seals—not to mention 10 tonnes of other bycatch that was later discarded. The 'proverbial' hit the fan and a number of mitigation measures were put in place to protect protected species in this country—dolphins and seals.


Essentially, two things were done. A night ban on fishing was put in place because that is when there is most activity in the small pelagic fishery, especially closer to the surface. That is when the dolphins and seals are most active and it is also when it is harder to see these protected species around the nets. Another mitigation measure put in place was essentially a move-on clause—a sting in the tail—where if a dolphin was killed the supertrawler would have to leave that area for six months and fish somewhere else. So there were two mitigation measures in place, and I have to say I felt very glad they were put in place. I remember being outraged and speaking to the media, and it was not just me. Minister Hunt came out and spoke to the media and said very similar things. I have his quotes here in front of me. He said that 'dolphin bycatch is simply unacceptable'. I am glad our environment minister came out and made such statements. This is only part of his quote as it is too long for me to read, but he said:


I would hope that the position that myself and others have taken—


that is, the precautions I have just talked about—


has compelled AFMA to put in place a really tough restriction with some very final points that if there are any more failures then there will be big consequences. They’ve already imposed consequences but they’ll go further. The dolphin by-catch is simply unacceptable.


So we have an environment minister that is speaking out on behalf of protected species as I would expect him to.


The next question is: why was the night ban lifted? Let's make it very clear. There is no science behind the protection of dolphins and seals. It is not about them being endangered or critically endangered. We protect them under our laws because we value them. People love dolphins and they love seals. They have an affinity with them. They have a very strong affinity with highly intelligent, highly social marine creatures. That is why they are protected. That is why if I were to shoot one with a spear gun and drag it up on the beach I would hope there would be someone there to protect me, because I do not think people would be very happy. They are protected in this country for a good reason: basically, we love them. As a surfer I especially feel I have a very close affinity with dolphins and seals.


It is also worth pointing out that, in the reporting period we have seen already, the Geelong Star has accounted for nearly three-quarters of the dolphin mortalities by the fishing industry over the first reporting period—



Senator Ruston interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  That is correct, and I could give you that later, Senator Ruston. So this is a high-risk fishing activity, as is pointed out by the independent scientific panel. The Greens and others feel we need to take the strongest possible protections for cetaceans that are protected under our laws—for dolphins and seals. They are high-risk bycatch, and we need to do whatever we can.


I am concerned about the precedent of removing the night ban. I asked AFMA directly at estimates why the night ban was removed, and they were very open and honest with me. They were not trying to hide anything. We talked about how site was important and how at night-time you cannot see things such as dolphins and seals. We talked about the seal excluder device and for incentives to get the vessel to basically do whatever it takes to mitigate. We said:


Senator WHISH-WILSON: You implemented a night ban on fishing for the Geelong Star? 


Dr Rayns: Yes. 


Senator WHISH-WILSON: Did that work? 


Dr Rayns: It worked in the sense that it did not lead to any further dolphin mortalities. However, we also have to balance that with enabling the vessel to fish and bearing in mind that we are trying to balance a set of regulations to make sure we are protecting protected species and, at the same time, reasonably allowing the vessel to fish.


So AFMA made a decision, and I understand that they consulted other stakeholders. They made a decision that the economics of this boat, this supertrawler—I am not sure how many Australians it employs or how much tax it pays as a foreign vessel, but we know that it is planning to sell its fish to Africa—had to be balanced against the protection of protected species. Some people have different views from me on which is more important or where that balance should lie, and clearly my party's view is different from AFMA's. We feel we should take the strongest possible protections, including maintaining a night ban.


Let me wrap up in the next five minutes by saying AFMA's own media release from the time when the night ban was put in place was that it was a logical mitigation measure. But the companies lobbied have it removed; the supertrawlers lobbied to have it removed, and now it is no longer necessary because there are other measures in place, such as a move-on clause. 


I am concerned that if we do not make a stand on this night fishing ban the next thing is going to be a dolphin move-on clause and that is going to be lobbied to be removed. AFMA have not confirmed—I would be happy for the minister to confirm today if she wishes to—that observers are even going to stay on this boat. It was only for 10 trips initially. We put pressure on them and AFMA said the observers would stay on the boat for 12 months. That is up soon; what happens after that? How much more lobbying is going to occur around these regulations? How can we have any certainty, and how can the public have any certainty around these regulations? The government themselves put these regulations in place. They put the night ban in place, and they said it was the right thing to do.


Senator Colbeck, on his own website, said that the night ban was an important measure to protect dolphins and seals. He said that on his own website. All we know is that it has been removed because of the economics of this operation, and that is a decision that has been made by AFMA. Even if it is in relation to consultation with other experts, it is the balance in the fishery between letting the boat fish and protecting protected species that AFMA has made this decision on. 


What we are looking at here today is actually quite simple, and we have got a simple decision to make—a very important value judgement. Do we back the economics of what is, I think, a very divisive and unpopular fishing activity, being a large industrial factory freezer in our waters? I personally question the benefits of that fishing activity. Or do we look after our loved marine life?


I have, through freedom of information, copies of conversations between the AFMA observers who were on board the boat when the dolphins and seals were originally killed. I have copies of those. They are actually quite compelling. I felt sorry for the AFMA observer who, at one stage, actually said in exasperation, 'There really isn't anything further we can do to prevent the deaths of these dolphins and seals.' At that stage there were 42 seals around the net. But they made it very clear, and I am happy to give the minister copies of these conversations. It is a whole chain of emails around when the proverbial hit the fan and the boat's first few weeks of operations. There is even pressure shown in those first few weeks by the company to reduce the aperture on the seal-excluding device, because up to 30 per cent of their fish were actually swimming out of the nets because the seal-excluding device was too wide. Even with the device that wide, they were still killing dolphins and seals.


We will probably hear from the minister that since the night ban has been lifted there have been no more dolphins killed. I would like to know if there have been any more seals killed, because they only get reported every three months and we have not had an update for some time. But remember: this ban was only lifted seven weeks ago. Looking back and saying, 'There have been no dolphins killed since late June,' that is because there was a night ban in place. I do not think it is unreasonable for us, when we are representing the people who voted us in, and the constituencies in our state that have significant concerns around this, to raise these issues in parliament. I would like to see the strongest possible protections for dolphins and seals kept in place for this boat. I believe I speak on behalf of a lot of Tasmanians and no doubt other people around the country. We have protected species in this country for a reason, and I think the simple reason is: these sea creatures are valuable to us. They are valuable to each and every one of us. I welcome the debate from the minister and from other senators, and I look forward to the vote.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-11-25,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:57):  Labor will vote to reinstate the night-time fishing ban on the trawler the Geelong Star. We understand this will be very disappointing to the company involved; however, the Turnbull government has failed to act to put in place the proper rounds of public consultation and to respond to the expert panel's report to ensure that the broader community can be reassured that mid trawlers the size of the Geelong Star with refrigeration capacity can fish in our pelagic fisheries without threats to the sustainability of those fisheries and indeed threats to our marine environment more generally.


When the former Labor government banned the supertrawlers for two years, it put in place requirements that an expert panel review be undertaken to look at the future of the sector. That report was delivered to the new government in October 2014. Yet the government has been sitting on that report ever since. The panel said that there were still some unanswered questions involving the risks over sub trawlers and proper risk management programs would have to be put in place if they were to be fishing sustainably. The Turnbull government has failed to respond to the experts report.


Labor has tried other pathways to deal with this issue, including a private members/senators bill and the initiation of a Senate inquiry. So the fate of the Geelong Star is in the hands of the Turnbull government. There will be people disappointed but we stand with the overwhelming majority of Australians who are very concerned about the marine environment, very concerned about the sustainability of our fishing stock and our environment more generally. Labor will stand to protect the environment and we will continue to do so unless someone presents to the industry and to the broader community a risk management plan and capacity to allow the big mid trawlers to fish without any threats to our marine environment.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (17:59):  Firstly, I want to put on the record that the Australian government supports a robust management system for our fisheries to ensure that our fisheries are sustainable and available for everyone who wants to share in this resource. I would like to emphasise the comment about it being a shared resource. This is not a resource for any one member of our community or one sector in our community. There are a number of people who have every right to have access to our fisheries, as long as they are sustainably managed and appropriately managed. We have recreational fishers who like to go and throw a line over the side. We have game fishers who have a commercial stake in the fishery. We have commercial fishers who catch fish. We also have the public, and I think it is my responsibility, as much as anything, to stand here and represent the public of Australia who would like to go into a shop at night and buy fish that they can serve their children for dinner. We need to ensure that everybody who has a stake in this fishery has the opportunity to participate.


Tonight, the debate is not about whether this boat should fish or not fish. The debate tonight is about the removal of a temporary ban that was put on the boat as a precautionary measure following a number of our sea mammals being caught by this boat when it first began to fish. I want to make sure that we are very clear about this: we are here tonight because there is a direction before this parliament to allow the lifting of the ban of night-time fishing on the Geelong Star.


I want to put some facts on the record without the spin and the misinterpretation and the emotion that have been put into it by one of the previous speakers. There was no doubt that there was an unacceptable catch of dolphins when the boat first began fishing in the Small Pelagic Fishery of Australia earlier this year. There were eight dolphins caught. It was considered by the government and considered by AFMA, the independent regulator, that that was an unacceptable level and that something needed to be done immediately.


As a precautionary measure, two things were put in place. Firstly, there was a ban put on night-time fishing because it was believed that it was more likely they would catch the dolphins at night. This was not based on science. This was a knee-jerk, precautionary action taken because we believed that the level of dolphins that were being caught was unacceptable. Subsequent to that, there was also a new condition placed on the boat that if it caught a dolphin in any of the fishing zones around Australia there would be an immediate six-month ban on the boat fishing within that fishery. It did not matter whether the dolphin was caught during the day or whether it was caught at night—exclusion from that zone would exist for a six-month period. Subsequent to this being put in place, one dolphin has been caught. That dolphin was caught and that triggered the immediate exclusion of the Geelong Star from that zone, and it has not been able to fish in that zone for six months. It will not be allowed to fish there again until the middle of December, when the six-month period is up.


At the time, because it was a quick-reaction, precautionary activity that was undertaken, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority sought to take some in-depth research and analysis into why these dolphins were being caught. Subsequent to that, the Geelong Star has had a number of other regulations, actions and requirements put onto it. We need to remember that this boat is the most heavily regulated boat in the Australian fishery. There is no other boat in the whole of the Australian fishery that has more regulation than this boat. At all times, it carries two observers from AFMA, and I can assure Senator Whish-Wilson that there is no intention for those observers to no longer be required to stay on the boat.


But I also should point out that the Geelong Star themselves have an observer. They also have cameras on the boat and on the nets. These are monitored at all times. There is absolutely no capacity for this boat to catch a dolphin and for no-one to know about it. That is just an unreasonable proposition. The other really good thing is that these observers are also undertaking scientific research while they are out on the boat so that we can make sure that we understand better, at firsthand and with close observation, what this fishery is doing. In addition, there was a requirement undertaken at great expense by the boat to increase the level of excluding devices that are on the nets—they have changed nets—to make sure that the boat has the least possible chance of being able to interact with a sea mammal.


As Senator Whish-Wilson rightly pointed out, since 17 September when the ban was lifted on the operation of the boat there has not been an interaction with a dolphin. So, quite clearly, the decision for the ban to be lifted has not resulted in any adverse reaction in relation to any dolphins being killed.


The overwhelming majority of the evidence that was gathered by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation and AFMA in analysing whether this ban was something that was necessary suggested that, because the boat fished largely at night, the interaction with the dolphins was likely to happen at night. It is a little hard to catch a dolphin during the day when you are not fishing during the day. But I do point out that the dolphin that was caught in June was caught during the day.


We believe that the exclusion from a zone and the punitive action put on this boat should it catch a dolphin in any fishery is very severe. It is probably the most severe punitive action you could possibly take on any fishing vessel. To say that if it had an interaction with but one of these mammals it cannot fish there for another six months is a very significant action. As I said, it is a massively regulated boat. It has observers. It has the most up-to-date, state-of-the-art devices on it to prevent these dolphins from being caught. I repeat again: this boat has not caught or had an interaction with a dolphin since it has been fishing at night again for the last couple of months.


The other thing I would also point out is that the length of the boat has nothing to do with how it catches fish. This obsession with how long a boat is seems a little silly, because whether a boat has a freezer is completely irrelevant to how it catches fish. The most important thing is the quotas that are put in place to make sure that we maintain the sustainability of our fishery. I point out that the quota that is allocated for the Small Pelagic Fishery is an extraordinarily conservative quota. It is believed that the quota allowed to be caught is somewhere between six and seven per cent of the biomass. It is a very small number. 


This particular boat has a quota within the broader total allowable catch within this fishery. The boat cannot catch any more fish than its quota. If I sent out 17 little boats that caught 1/17th of the quota, as opposed to sending out one big boat that catches the quota, there would be no less fish caught by the little boats and there would be no more fish caught by the big boats. So it is not the size of the boat that matters; it is how the boat fishes and the conditions under which it fishes. I think we just have to get off the table any suggestion that the length of the boat has anything to do with it. It is the size of the nets, the method of the nets, where it fishes, what its quotas are and a whole heap of other things that go towards it. 


We are very proud of having one of the world's best-managed fisheries. We are recognised around the world for how we manage our fisheries. If we now start attacking what is recognised as one of the most highly regulated, best-managed fisheries in the world, what sort of message are we sending to the rest of the world about our fisheries? We are sending this scaremongering message to the world, to say: 'It doesn't matter how good you are; we're quite happy not to worry about the science; we're not going to worry about whether the fishery is sustainable; we're just going to go on with an emotive argument.' 


I take all of the issues that Senator Whish-Wilson has put on the table and accept that there is definitely a very strong public sentiment that the public out there do not want to see our dolphins harmed or killed. I do not think there is anyone amongst us who would not agree with that. But, if we can put in place conditions and regulations that almost entirely prevent any of these unfortunate deaths of dolphins occurring, then surely we should be seeking to maximise the opportunity for Australia and our wonderful fisheries so that we can feed not just ourselves but the world and we can have a fishing industry that is free from the sovereign risk that constantly gets placed on us as a country if we make decisions that are not based on science.


Obviously I am very keen for the directive that is before this place at the moment to be upheld and to allow the ongoing night fishing of the Geelong Star. I say so for a number of reasons but most particularly because I think that there is the opportunity for us to go forward and operate our fisheries in a collegiate way with all the people who have every right to participate in the shared resource which is our fisheries. They should be allowed to do so. If we take these sorts of actions without basing them on science, without looking at how the boat catches and how much the boat catches instead of worrying about how long the thing is, I think that we are actually making very bad policy decisions.


I am very keen to see this disallowance motion overturned so that we can get on with managing our fisheries in the best possible way and can continue to manage our fisheries based on science, sustainability and access for everybody who has a right to have part of this fishery. I would like to formally put on the record that the government will, obviously, be opposing this disallowance motion.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2015-11-25,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:10):  I rise proudly to support Senator Whish-Wilson and the rest of the Australian Greens. I want to say very, very clearly that I do not support lifting the ban on night fishing for the Geelong Star. There has been a lot of discussion in this place this evening about dolphins and seals. These are beautiful, magnificent creatures. They are top predators of our marine ecosystem. As Senator Whish-Wilson said, they are protected because the Australian people have a relationship with them, because we as a people love these beautiful, magnificent creatures. It is important that we all understand this and understand that actually parliaments exist, in significant part, to give expression to the will of the people that we represent in this place. That is what democracies are all about. Yes, it is important that we listen to advice from scientists. It is important that we listen to advice from bureaucrats, administrators and experts in the various fields of life that exist in Australia. However, the buck stops with us, and it is important that we listen to the views of the people we represent in this place. If we are not going to give effect to those views, we had better have a very good reason why we are not going to give effect to those views.


I want to put it very firmly on the record, in response to some of the minister's comments, that we are not talking here about food for Australian people. This is not about whether, when people open a fridge in Australia, they can get a bit of fish out of the fridge. The point has been made by Senator Whish-Wilson that the fish that are harvested by the Geelong Star from the Small Pelagic Fishery are exported from Australia. We do not know how many Australian jobs are created on the Geelong Star. We do not know how much tax the company that is operating the Geelong Star pays in Australia. There is arguably very little benefit, very little upside, to the Geelong Star fishing in Australia, but recent history shows us there has been quite a significant downside to the Geelong Star fishing in Australian waters, particularly the deaths of a significant number of dolphins.


I cannot avoid reflecting on the fact that the minister describes dolphin deaths as 'interactions'. Let us call spades spades in this place. Let us be honest about what we are talking about here. We are talking about dolphin deaths. It is true to say that not every interaction will result in death. However, the words 'dolphin deaths' or 'killing dolphins' did not pass the minister's mouth in her contribution. We need to be very clear here that we are talking about a vessel that was supposedly regulated according to the best science and the best regulatory advice, and it slaughtered its way through dolphins and seals. It carved a swathe through dolphins and seals. It got four dolphins in a single throw of its nets. That is what we are talking about here. This move-on condition, the exclusion from zone condition, is potentially doing nothing more than spreading out these deaths. That is what we are dealing with here.


Like Senator Whish-Wilson, I have been lucky enough to spend a fair bit of my time interacting with the ocean. I have done the Sydney to Hobart and spent a lot of time in waves around Tasmania's magnificent coastline. Like so many Australians, whether it be through sailing, surfing or fishing—which I have done a fair bit of as well—I feel a connection with our marine environment and our coastline. We should not devalue that connection in the conversation we are having about the way the Geelong Star fishes and whether or not it should be banned from fishing at night. That connection should not be devalued; it should be highly valued because, as human beings, our connection to place is one of the most important things that we have. That is why people will fight passionately to defend places they love against inappropriate developments. The people I represent, the Tasmanian people, are renowned for fighting passionately to protect the places they love, the places they have a relationship with, from what they consider to be inappropriate development. That relationship with place goes to the very heart of what it is to be a human being. Our relationship with the marine ecosystem—those places on the coastline that we love, the waterways that we love—should be highly valued, because just as our connections to places on land define in large part who we are as people so do our connections with the marine ecosystem. 


Quite frankly, whilst we should consider advice from scientists and experts and factor all of those things into our decision making, they are not the only things that we should consider when we make these decisions. Otherwise, we could have a board of scientists or bureaucrats running the country; however, we do not because, as people, we have made the decision to have a democracy where people come from all walks of life—and I look around this chamber and I see people with myriad backgrounds and skill sets, and that is how it should be—in a parliament, because we should reflect the people who elect us to this place. So I accept the importance of science and expert advice but I reject any assertion that science and expert advice should be the only considerations as we go about our decision-making processes in this place. 


I want to say something about ecosystems—in fact we heard the word ecosystem mentioned in the context of innovation this morning in the Senate by a couple of government members. They talked about the innovation ecosystem—and that is a very fine description and one I have used myself in this place in the innovation context. However, I can only hope that the government understands the innovation ecosystem better than they understand the environmental ecosystem. There are serried ranks of people in this country and the world who believe correctly that old-style political parties do not get ecosystems. They do not understand that ecosystems have a level of interconnectedness that we cannot hope to fully grasp. They do not understand that, when you interfere unduly with one part of an ecosystem, that can have significant ramifications around the whole ecosystem. Exhibit A in that case of course is global warming—how humans, by simply emitting large amounts of greenhouse gases, are now seeing feedback loops kick in around the planet that will result in ever-increasing problems; not only environmental problems but human problems. Humans are a part of the global ecosystem, and in fact we rely on the complex global ecosystem for our very survival, the health of our families, the health of our communities and, for that matter, for the health of our economy—and that is a simple fact that old-style political parties do not get. 


While the science may offer some level of surety to some members in this place and they may come in and make their arguments on the basis of the science that they believe is in place, I am here today to say there is more to life. There is more to our deliberations in this place than simply science. I want to express my concerns—ongoing concerns, notwithstanding the comments of the minister—around localised depletion caused by these vessels, and to equate one massive super trawler with a fleet of smaller boats catching the same amount of fish does the minister no credit at all. 


While the Greens are here, we will continue to stand up for our ecosystems. We will continue to stand up for sustainable management of a range of fisheries and other natural resources in this place. But we will take the long view, unlike many others in this place, that looks not only at the impact of our human actions in the next year, the next electoral cycle or the next decade: we will sit and ask ourselves—as we all should—what is the impact of our actions today going to be on people who are alive in 50 or 100 years? Intergenerational equity is something that drives us in the Greens. It drives me as a Greens member of parliament, because I often lie in bed at night wondering what sort of a world we are going to hand over to our children and their children and their children. And, unfortunately, if we keep going on the business-as-usual scenario with our climate and with our management of natural resources, we are going to hand over a world where our kids and their kids have far fewer opportunities than we have today. That, to use an Australianism, is simply not fair. It is not fair on them. That is why we need to make sure that the decisions we make in this place consider human life and the functioning of our ecosystem into the long-term future.


So I want to congratulate Senator Whish-Wilson for bringing this matter before the chamber today. I want to say to members that I will proudly stand with Senator Whish-Wilson and, I might add, proudly stand with the large number of Tasmanian people who have attended rallies and have campaigned against this vessel and previous iterations of the supertrawler and will no doubt continue to stand strong and continue to fight to ensure that the ecosystem functions in the long-term future and that, in the context of recreational fishing, their children and their grandchildren can still throw a line into the water in their childhood and have a reasonably similar expectation of catching a fish as we did in our childhood.

Senator MUIR
 (Victoria) (18:23):  I understand that all fishing can present a potential risk to the marine environment and can sometimes lead to the unintentional harm of marine mammals, but I realise that it is unrealistic to cease all forms of fishing. In saying that, I hope the government and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority ensure that inclusive consultation with all relevant stakeholders is carried out and respond to the concerns across the board.


It is my understanding that a meeting between the recreational fishing sector, the Australian Recreational Fishing Foundation and the Game Fishing Association of Australia, the Australian Commercial Fishing Industry, the National Seafood Industry Alliance, the and the operators and owners of the Geelong Star has been arranged for Tuesday, 1 December, to negotiate a memorandum of understanding about the operation of the Geelong Star. These negotiations will include an agreement for the boat to avoid areas of high-recreational activity, as I understand it.


The outcome of this disallowance motion should not determine the direction of this meeting. In addition to this initial meeting, I believe the Senate inquiry into the environmental, social and economic impacts of large capacity fishing vessels—commonly known as supertrawlers—operating in Australia's marine jurisdiction is a valuable opportunity for all stakeholders to voice their opinions, and the report will be beneficial to the outcome of the memorandum of understanding.


I have listened to both sides of the debate and see the merit in both sides. I would particularly like to thank Senator Ruston and Senator Scullion for taking the time to sit down and speak to me about the government's point of view on this. However, it is important that I am representative of my Victorian constituents and their desires and, after a thorough consideration of both sides, I advise that I will be supporting this disallowance motion.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-11-25,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:25):  Senator Ruston, I agree with you that the size of the boats is not the important factor in this. But I am a little bit confused, because it was your government that put the 130-metre length on your ban for supertrawlers. Your ban is actually based on the size of a boat, so I am not quite sure what you are getting at there. But, if you are saying that it is actually about the operations of the boats and how they operate, I totally agree with you. We certainly have that in common on this issue.


The independent scientific panel that looked at this fishing activity warned that there were risks around potential bycatch issues. Unfortunately, those risks were borne out in a very in-your-face way in the first few weeks after this vessel arrived in this country. This is a really important point: AFMA, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, signed off on the Geelong Star when it arrived in Western Australia. They checked the seal excluder device on the net and they gave it the okay to go fishing. We know that it immediately caught seals and dolphins and had to return to port. They then checked it again and allowed the boat to go fishing a second time, and the same thing happened—and it happened a third time. So the Australian Fisheries Management Authority oversaw those seal and dolphin deaths. And now you are asking us to put faith in the fact that you have got it right now and there will not be any more mortalities of protected species—dolphins and seals. That is what you are asking us to take into account here. Senator Ruston, you also mentioned that the night ban was a knee-jerk reaction. They were the words you used.




Senator Ruston:
  A precautionary measure.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  You used those words as well but you also used the words 'knee-jerk reaction'. As I said, I thought it was absolutely necessary at the time, and I am not convinced—and I think a lot of people I represent are not convinced—that the night ban should be lifted. We know from the evidence that we have received, including from our FOI, that visual identification of dolphins and seals is critical to their protection. They are actually the words that were used by the AFMA observers in their conversations with other AFMA people—and it is something that I have confirmed with the AFMA management. But a decision was made around the economics of this boat and achieving a balance between allowing it to fish and make a buck and the protection of dolphins and seals. We have to make a judgement today about whether we have got that balance right. I think, and the Greens think—and I am glad that Labor and Senator Muir support this—that the ban should stay in place and that we should take all possible mitigation measures to protect dolphins and seals.


I would like to point out to Senator Collins and Labor that, yes, you may feel sorry for the owners of this boat, but let's remember that it was Seafish Tasmania that brought the first supertrawler here three and a bit years ago. That literally set this country on fire—it was literally like wildfire—in terms of the reaction. That was not the first supertrawler to come here. The Veronica came here in 2007, and it caused the same reaction. So Seafish Tasmania made the decision to bring a smaller vessel, the Geelong Star—still a very big trawler—knowing what public sentiment was in this country and knowing that the independent scientific panel had said that there would be risks to bycatch and localised depletion and the impacts that might have on seals, dolphins, seabirds and other marine life and other fish. The boat came without any consultation with the rec fishing groups and with environmentalists. Had they learnt the lessons of the Margiris and the Abel Tasman and actually sat down and talked to stakeholders, then this could have been avoided. But in the end, and I do not say this with any pride, we turned out to be right. The arrival of that boat was a catastrophe for marine life.


I am glad you, Senator Ruston, have acknowledged that it was unacceptable. I acknowledge you also made the point that you—and even the people on board the boat and in fisheries—do not like to see dolphins, whales or other cetaceans and seals killed. None of us do. I totally accept that. The question here is: have we got the balance right? I would like to see the night ban stay in place for longer, as a lot of people I represent would too.


Lastly, in relation to the videos that are on the boat, I have attempted through freedom of information to get copies of the videotape and so far, after repeated attempts, have not been successful. They are not open and available for people to view, and that is unfortunate. We are continuing to try and get copies of those, but they are not available to us at the moment even though we have made numerous FOI requests.


I hope that you are correct and that the observers do stay on board the vessel. I know it has fished at daytime for months. You have not told us how often it has been fishing at night-time. We do not even have that data in front of us to work out the likelihood of having caught and killed dolphins in the seven weeks that the night ban has been released. Perhaps when the Senate inquiry looks at these kind of things and more information comes to light, then we can get a lot more light shed on this.


I ask the Senate to disallow the removal of the night ban on the supertrawler Geelong Star in the Small Pelagic Fishery and take a stand to protect our marine life.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the disallowance motion moved by Senator Whish-Wilson be agreed to.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-11-25,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:36):  I move:


That the Small Pelagic Fishery (Closures Variation) Direction No. 1 2015, made under subsection 41A(3) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991, be disallowed [F2015L01450].


This motion I have moved is to disallow a set of regulations that were tabled on 12 October. Those of us in this place understand that all senators have the right and the privilege as parliamentarians to move to disallow regulations within 15 days of them being tabled in the Senate. This disallowance is quite simple. It is to stop a new set of regulations that remove an existing night ban on fishing by the supertrawler called the Geelong Star.


I want to make it very clear to those who may read this Hansard or who may be listening to this debate that this is a function of being a senator: having the right and the privilege to move a disallowance. But it is not something to be taken lightly. We are here as elected representatives for our voters, for our members and for those who share the same values as we do. On top of that, and most importantly, we are here to represent our state. In my case, that is the state of Tasmania. I know that this issue is not just something that people feel strongly about to the point where they may disagree in arguments. They actually go out of their way to tell you that they have significant concerns over the operation of large factory freezer vessels in Australian waters.


The next thing I want to point out is that the government have an existing ban in place for supertrawlers. The legislation was brought to parliament, to both houses, last year, and they implemented a ban on large factory freezer vessels over 130 metres in length. I have yet to receive an explanation at all from the government or from AFMA as to how that 130-metre limit was set. There has been no explanation about how a trawler that is slightly less than 100 metres is any less dangerous to marine life than a boat over 130 metres. Nevertheless, we still have acknowledgement from the government that these kinds of vessels should be banned, so they banned vessels longer than 130 metres.


Why have they banned these vessels? I can just guess that they have also received feedback from communities around the country, from fishing communities, from conservationists and from seaside communities, that they have grave concerns over very large factory freezer vessels operating in our waters, taking and targeting small pelagic fish. These fish are essentially in the base of our food chain in the ocean for a lot of other species of fish—target species of fish for recreational fishers—and of course for marine life such as dolphins, seals, penguins and seabirds. They all feed on these building-block fish, the small pelagics.


The government may also be concerned about the international reputation of these vessels. These are vessels that have helped break the ocean everywhere they have fished. They have plundered the seas all around the world. That could be a reason that the government do not want to see these kinds of vessels. But also they know that this is a slippery slope to seeing a lot more industrial fishing in this country, industrial fishing that may allow other supertrawlers to come here and that may increase the total allowable catch for small pelagic fish into the future. We have seen a lot of pressure and a lot of lobbying and an enormous amount of debate in the Senate and around the country about the arrival of the Margiris, or Abel Tasman, and the current supertrawler, the Geelong Star. We have seen an enormous amount of debate.


Clearly, the Liberal government have facilitated the arrival of both these boats. They have been champions of supertrawlers. It concerns a lot of people, given the public discomfort and in some cases even outrage over the arrival of these boats, that nothing is going to stop them, and we will see a lot more of them into the future.


For me, it really hit home to me last Christmas when I was lucky enough to sail on a boat in Sydney to Hobart race. I was on a yacht, and I was hundreds of kilometres off the coastline, off Tasmania. Acting Deputy President Bernardi, you have been there yourself. I remember seeing one of these bait balls—what fishermen call bait balls—where a lot of the small fish are schooling. You can spot them from a mile away because seabirds come from every direction. When you get close to one, and we sailed close to one, you see the dolphins. I even saw pilot whales. You see seals, and of course fairy penguins are another example. They feed on these fish, and it is amazing to watch.


You can imagine that a large factory freezer vessel out there catching these fish is going to have impacts on the marine life that also feeds on those fish. This was pointed out to us by the independent scientific panel that was set up by Labor on the arrival of the first supertrawler, when it looked at the potential impacts of this kind of fishing activity. It made it very clear that these were risks that needed to be addressed and that these kinds of marine life feeding on these small pelagic fish would be impacted by this kind of fishing activity.


To me, it really hit home. Where my family and I go for our summers and where I go surfing with my kids, every night when my kids were young we would go and watch the fairy penguins. They leave at sunset, and they go out. They catch these fish, and they come home, and they feed their young. Those are the same fish that are going to be targeted by this vessel. People think through these kinds of things, and they wonder what impact a future of industrial fishing in this fishery will have for marine life.


We then have to ask ourselves why, with the arrival of the Geelong Star, a smaller boat than the Abel Tasman, at slightly less than 100 metres, this boat was allowed to go fishing without the proper precautions being put in place to prevent the bycatch of seals, dolphins and other marine creatures. This is what we are debating here today. This is ultimately what this disallowance motion is about. The Greens feel very strongly that we should take the strongest possible precautions to protect especially cetaceans such as dolphins, and seals and other marine life—the strongest possible protections.


Why do we protect dolphins and seals? People may not be aware, even in this chamber, that dolphins and seals are protected under Australian law. They are protected. It is an offence to harm a dolphin. The maximum penalty is two years in jail or a $180,000 fine. Seals are also protected with similar clauses under a different section of EPBC. The fishing industry gets an exemption. They are allowed to kill dolphins and seals, but to do that they have to have a fisheries management plan in place—a vessel management plan.


In the case of the Geelong Star a vessel management plan was put in place but minister Hunt has to sign off on it. I will read how the minister may accredit plans, regimes or policies if the minister is satisfied:


(f)  the plan, regime or policy requires persons engaged in fishing under the plan, regime or policy to take all reasonable steps to ensure that cetaceans are not killed or injured as a result of the fishing …


When the Geelong Star arrived here it went out on its first weeks of operations and killed nine dolphins, including four dolphins in one throw of its net, and 12 seals—not to mention 10 tonnes of other bycatch that was later discarded. The 'proverbial' hit the fan and a number of mitigation measures were put in place to protect protected species in this country—dolphins and seals.


Essentially, two things were done. A night ban on fishing was put in place because that is when there is most activity in the small pelagic fishery, especially closer to the surface. That is when the dolphins and seals are most active and it is also when it is harder to see these protected species around the nets. Another mitigation measure put in place was essentially a move-on clause—a sting in the tail—where if a dolphin was killed the supertrawler would have to leave that area for six months and fish somewhere else. So there were two mitigation measures in place, and I have to say I felt very glad they were put in place. I remember being outraged and speaking to the media, and it was not just me. Minister Hunt came out and spoke to the media and said very similar things. I have his quotes here in front of me. He said that 'dolphin bycatch is simply unacceptable'. I am glad our environment minister came out and made such statements. This is only part of his quote as it is too long for me to read, but he said:


I would hope that the position that myself and others have taken—


that is, the precautions I have just talked about—


has compelled AFMA to put in place a really tough restriction with some very final points that if there are any more failures then there will be big consequences. They’ve already imposed consequences but they’ll go further. The dolphin by-catch is simply unacceptable.


So we have an environment minister that is speaking out on behalf of protected species as I would expect him to.


The next question is: why was the night ban lifted? Let's make it very clear. There is no science behind the protection of dolphins and seals. It is not about them being endangered or critically endangered. We protect them under our laws because we value them. People love dolphins and they love seals. They have an affinity with them. They have a very strong affinity with highly intelligent, highly social marine creatures. That is why they are protected. That is why if I were to shoot one with a spear gun and drag it up on the beach I would hope there would be someone there to protect me, because I do not think people would be very happy. They are protected in this country for a good reason: basically, we love them. As a surfer I especially feel I have a very close affinity with dolphins and seals.


It is also worth pointing out that, in the reporting period we have seen already, the Geelong Star has accounted for nearly three-quarters of the dolphin mortalities by the fishing industry over the first reporting period—



Senator Ruston interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  That is correct, and I could give you that later, Senator Ruston. So this is a high-risk fishing activity, as is pointed out by the independent scientific panel. The Greens and others feel we need to take the strongest possible protections for cetaceans that are protected under our laws—for dolphins and seals. They are high-risk bycatch, and we need to do whatever we can.


I am concerned about the precedent of removing the night ban. I asked AFMA directly at estimates why the night ban was removed, and they were very open and honest with me. They were not trying to hide anything. We talked about how site was important and how at night-time you cannot see things such as dolphins and seals. We talked about the seal excluder device and for incentives to get the vessel to basically do whatever it takes to mitigate. We said:


Senator WHISH-WILSON: You implemented a night ban on fishing for the Geelong Star? 


Dr Rayns: Yes. 


Senator WHISH-WILSON: Did that work? 


Dr Rayns: It worked in the sense that it did not lead to any further dolphin mortalities. However, we also have to balance that with enabling the vessel to fish and bearing in mind that we are trying to balance a set of regulations to make sure we are protecting protected species and, at the same time, reasonably allowing the vessel to fish.


So AFMA made a decision, and I understand that they consulted other stakeholders. They made a decision that the economics of this boat, this supertrawler—I am not sure how many Australians it employs or how much tax it pays as a foreign vessel, but we know that it is planning to sell its fish to Africa—had to be balanced against the protection of protected species. Some people have different views from me on which is more important or where that balance should lie, and clearly my party's view is different from AFMA's. We feel we should take the strongest possible protections, including maintaining a night ban.


Let me wrap up in the next five minutes by saying AFMA's own media release from the time when the night ban was put in place was that it was a logical mitigation measure. But the companies lobbied have it removed; the supertrawlers lobbied to have it removed, and now it is no longer necessary because there are other measures in place, such as a move-on clause. 


I am concerned that if we do not make a stand on this night fishing ban the next thing is going to be a dolphin move-on clause and that is going to be lobbied to be removed. AFMA have not confirmed—I would be happy for the minister to confirm today if she wishes to—that observers are even going to stay on this boat. It was only for 10 trips initially. We put pressure on them and AFMA said the observers would stay on the boat for 12 months. That is up soon; what happens after that? How much more lobbying is going to occur around these regulations? How can we have any certainty, and how can the public have any certainty around these regulations? The government themselves put these regulations in place. They put the night ban in place, and they said it was the right thing to do.


Senator Colbeck, on his own website, said that the night ban was an important measure to protect dolphins and seals. He said that on his own website. All we know is that it has been removed because of the economics of this operation, and that is a decision that has been made by AFMA. Even if it is in relation to consultation with other experts, it is the balance in the fishery between letting the boat fish and protecting protected species that AFMA has made this decision on. 


What we are looking at here today is actually quite simple, and we have got a simple decision to make—a very important value judgement. Do we back the economics of what is, I think, a very divisive and unpopular fishing activity, being a large industrial factory freezer in our waters? I personally question the benefits of that fishing activity. Or do we look after our loved marine life?


I have, through freedom of information, copies of conversations between the AFMA observers who were on board the boat when the dolphins and seals were originally killed. I have copies of those. They are actually quite compelling. I felt sorry for the AFMA observer who, at one stage, actually said in exasperation, 'There really isn't anything further we can do to prevent the deaths of these dolphins and seals.' At that stage there were 42 seals around the net. But they made it very clear, and I am happy to give the minister copies of these conversations. It is a whole chain of emails around when the proverbial hit the fan and the boat's first few weeks of operations. There is even pressure shown in those first few weeks by the company to reduce the aperture on the seal-excluding device, because up to 30 per cent of their fish were actually swimming out of the nets because the seal-excluding device was too wide. Even with the device that wide, they were still killing dolphins and seals.


We will probably hear from the minister that since the night ban has been lifted there have been no more dolphins killed. I would like to know if there have been any more seals killed, because they only get reported every three months and we have not had an update for some time. But remember: this ban was only lifted seven weeks ago. Looking back and saying, 'There have been no dolphins killed since late June,' that is because there was a night ban in place. I do not think it is unreasonable for us, when we are representing the people who voted us in, and the constituencies in our state that have significant concerns around this, to raise these issues in parliament. I would like to see the strongest possible protections for dolphins and seals kept in place for this boat. I believe I speak on behalf of a lot of Tasmanians and no doubt other people around the country. We have protected species in this country for a reason, and I think the simple reason is: these sea creatures are valuable to us. They are valuable to each and every one of us. I welcome the debate from the minister and from other senators, and I look forward to the vote.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-11-25,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:57):  Labor will vote to reinstate the night-time fishing ban on the trawler the Geelong Star. We understand this will be very disappointing to the company involved; however, the Turnbull government has failed to act to put in place the proper rounds of public consultation and to respond to the expert panel's report to ensure that the broader community can be reassured that mid trawlers the size of the Geelong Star with refrigeration capacity can fish in our pelagic fisheries without threats to the sustainability of those fisheries and indeed threats to our marine environment more generally.


When the former Labor government banned the supertrawlers for two years, it put in place requirements that an expert panel review be undertaken to look at the future of the sector. That report was delivered to the new government in October 2014. Yet the government has been sitting on that report ever since. The panel said that there were still some unanswered questions involving the risks over sub trawlers and proper risk management programs would have to be put in place if they were to be fishing sustainably. The Turnbull government has failed to respond to the experts report.


Labor has tried other pathways to deal with this issue, including a private members/senators bill and the initiation of a Senate inquiry. So the fate of the Geelong Star is in the hands of the Turnbull government. There will be people disappointed but we stand with the overwhelming majority of Australians who are very concerned about the marine environment, very concerned about the sustainability of our fishing stock and our environment more generally. Labor will stand to protect the environment and we will continue to do so unless someone presents to the industry and to the broader community a risk management plan and capacity to allow the big mid trawlers to fish without any threats to our marine environment.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2015-11-25,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (17:59):  Firstly, I want to put on the record that the Australian government supports a robust management system for our fisheries to ensure that our fisheries are sustainable and available for everyone who wants to share in this resource. I would like to emphasise the comment about it being a shared resource. This is not a resource for any one member of our community or one sector in our community. There are a number of people who have every right to have access to our fisheries, as long as they are sustainably managed and appropriately managed. We have recreational fishers who like to go and throw a line over the side. We have game fishers who have a commercial stake in the fishery. We have commercial fishers who catch fish. We also have the public, and I think it is my responsibility, as much as anything, to stand here and represent the public of Australia who would like to go into a shop at night and buy fish that they can serve their children for dinner. We need to ensure that everybody who has a stake in this fishery has the opportunity to participate.


Tonight, the debate is not about whether this boat should fish or not fish. The debate tonight is about the removal of a temporary ban that was put on the boat as a precautionary measure following a number of our sea mammals being caught by this boat when it first began to fish. I want to make sure that we are very clear about this: we are here tonight because there is a direction before this parliament to allow the lifting of the ban of night-time fishing on the Geelong Star.


I want to put some facts on the record without the spin and the misinterpretation and the emotion that have been put into it by one of the previous speakers. There was no doubt that there was an unacceptable catch of dolphins when the boat first began fishing in the Small Pelagic Fishery of Australia earlier this year. There were eight dolphins caught. It was considered by the government and considered by AFMA, the independent regulator, that that was an unacceptable level and that something needed to be done immediately.


As a precautionary measure, two things were put in place. Firstly, there was a ban put on night-time fishing because it was believed that it was more likely they would catch the dolphins at night. This was not based on science. This was a knee-jerk, precautionary action taken because we believed that the level of dolphins that were being caught was unacceptable. Subsequent to that, there was also a new condition placed on the boat that if it caught a dolphin in any of the fishing zones around Australia there would be an immediate six-month ban on the boat fishing within that fishery. It did not matter whether the dolphin was caught during the day or whether it was caught at night—exclusion from that zone would exist for a six-month period. Subsequent to this being put in place, one dolphin has been caught. That dolphin was caught and that triggered the immediate exclusion of the Geelong Star from that zone, and it has not been able to fish in that zone for six months. It will not be allowed to fish there again until the middle of December, when the six-month period is up.


At the time, because it was a quick-reaction, precautionary activity that was undertaken, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority sought to take some in-depth research and analysis into why these dolphins were being caught. Subsequent to that, the Geelong Star has had a number of other regulations, actions and requirements put onto it. We need to remember that this boat is the most heavily regulated boat in the Australian fishery. There is no other boat in the whole of the Australian fishery that has more regulation than this boat. At all times, it carries two observers from AFMA, and I can assure Senator Whish-Wilson that there is no intention for those observers to no longer be required to stay on the boat.


But I also should point out that the Geelong Star themselves have an observer. They also have cameras on the boat and on the nets. These are monitored at all times. There is absolutely no capacity for this boat to catch a dolphin and for no-one to know about it. That is just an unreasonable proposition. The other really good thing is that these observers are also undertaking scientific research while they are out on the boat so that we can make sure that we understand better, at firsthand and with close observation, what this fishery is doing. In addition, there was a requirement undertaken at great expense by the boat to increase the level of excluding devices that are on the nets—they have changed nets—to make sure that the boat has the least possible chance of being able to interact with a sea mammal.


As Senator Whish-Wilson rightly pointed out, since 17 September when the ban was lifted on the operation of the boat there has not been an interaction with a dolphin. So, quite clearly, the decision for the ban to be lifted has not resulted in any adverse reaction in relation to any dolphins being killed.


The overwhelming majority of the evidence that was gathered by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation and AFMA in analysing whether this ban was something that was necessary suggested that, because the boat fished largely at night, the interaction with the dolphins was likely to happen at night. It is a little hard to catch a dolphin during the day when you are not fishing during the day. But I do point out that the dolphin that was caught in June was caught during the day.


We believe that the exclusion from a zone and the punitive action put on this boat should it catch a dolphin in any fishery is very severe. It is probably the most severe punitive action you could possibly take on any fishing vessel. To say that if it had an interaction with but one of these mammals it cannot fish there for another six months is a very significant action. As I said, it is a massively regulated boat. It has observers. It has the most up-to-date, state-of-the-art devices on it to prevent these dolphins from being caught. I repeat again: this boat has not caught or had an interaction with a dolphin since it has been fishing at night again for the last couple of months.


The other thing I would also point out is that the length of the boat has nothing to do with how it catches fish. This obsession with how long a boat is seems a little silly, because whether a boat has a freezer is completely irrelevant to how it catches fish. The most important thing is the quotas that are put in place to make sure that we maintain the sustainability of our fishery. I point out that the quota that is allocated for the Small Pelagic Fishery is an extraordinarily conservative quota. It is believed that the quota allowed to be caught is somewhere between six and seven per cent of the biomass. It is a very small number. 


This particular boat has a quota within the broader total allowable catch within this fishery. The boat cannot catch any more fish than its quota. If I sent out 17 little boats that caught 1/17th of the quota, as opposed to sending out one big boat that catches the quota, there would be no less fish caught by the little boats and there would be no more fish caught by the big boats. So it is not the size of the boat that matters; it is how the boat fishes and the conditions under which it fishes. I think we just have to get off the table any suggestion that the length of the boat has anything to do with it. It is the size of the nets, the method of the nets, where it fishes, what its quotas are and a whole heap of other things that go towards it. 


We are very proud of having one of the world's best-managed fisheries. We are recognised around the world for how we manage our fisheries. If we now start attacking what is recognised as one of the most highly regulated, best-managed fisheries in the world, what sort of message are we sending to the rest of the world about our fisheries? We are sending this scaremongering message to the world, to say: 'It doesn't matter how good you are; we're quite happy not to worry about the science; we're not going to worry about whether the fishery is sustainable; we're just going to go on with an emotive argument.' 


I take all of the issues that Senator Whish-Wilson has put on the table and accept that there is definitely a very strong public sentiment that the public out there do not want to see our dolphins harmed or killed. I do not think there is anyone amongst us who would not agree with that. But, if we can put in place conditions and regulations that almost entirely prevent any of these unfortunate deaths of dolphins occurring, then surely we should be seeking to maximise the opportunity for Australia and our wonderful fisheries so that we can feed not just ourselves but the world and we can have a fishing industry that is free from the sovereign risk that constantly gets placed on us as a country if we make decisions that are not based on science.


Obviously I am very keen for the directive that is before this place at the moment to be upheld and to allow the ongoing night fishing of the Geelong Star. I say so for a number of reasons but most particularly because I think that there is the opportunity for us to go forward and operate our fisheries in a collegiate way with all the people who have every right to participate in the shared resource which is our fisheries. They should be allowed to do so. If we take these sorts of actions without basing them on science, without looking at how the boat catches and how much the boat catches instead of worrying about how long the thing is, I think that we are actually making very bad policy decisions.


I am very keen to see this disallowance motion overturned so that we can get on with managing our fisheries in the best possible way and can continue to manage our fisheries based on science, sustainability and access for everybody who has a right to have part of this fishery. I would like to formally put on the record that the government will, obviously, be opposing this disallowance motion.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2015-11-25,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:10):  I rise proudly to support Senator Whish-Wilson and the rest of the Australian Greens. I want to say very, very clearly that I do not support lifting the ban on night fishing for the Geelong Star. There has been a lot of discussion in this place this evening about dolphins and seals. These are beautiful, magnificent creatures. They are top predators of our marine ecosystem. As Senator Whish-Wilson said, they are protected because the Australian people have a relationship with them, because we as a people love these beautiful, magnificent creatures. It is important that we all understand this and understand that actually parliaments exist, in significant part, to give expression to the will of the people that we represent in this place. That is what democracies are all about. Yes, it is important that we listen to advice from scientists. It is important that we listen to advice from bureaucrats, administrators and experts in the various fields of life that exist in Australia. However, the buck stops with us, and it is important that we listen to the views of the people we represent in this place. If we are not going to give effect to those views, we had better have a very good reason why we are not going to give effect to those views.


I want to put it very firmly on the record, in response to some of the minister's comments, that we are not talking here about food for Australian people. This is not about whether, when people open a fridge in Australia, they can get a bit of fish out of the fridge. The point has been made by Senator Whish-Wilson that the fish that are harvested by the Geelong Star from the Small Pelagic Fishery are exported from Australia. We do not know how many Australian jobs are created on the Geelong Star. We do not know how much tax the company that is operating the Geelong Star pays in Australia. There is arguably very little benefit, very little upside, to the Geelong Star fishing in Australia, but recent history shows us there has been quite a significant downside to the Geelong Star fishing in Australian waters, particularly the deaths of a significant number of dolphins.


I cannot avoid reflecting on the fact that the minister describes dolphin deaths as 'interactions'. Let us call spades spades in this place. Let us be honest about what we are talking about here. We are talking about dolphin deaths. It is true to say that not every interaction will result in death. However, the words 'dolphin deaths' or 'killing dolphins' did not pass the minister's mouth in her contribution. We need to be very clear here that we are talking about a vessel that was supposedly regulated according to the best science and the best regulatory advice, and it slaughtered its way through dolphins and seals. It carved a swathe through dolphins and seals. It got four dolphins in a single throw of its nets. That is what we are talking about here. This move-on condition, the exclusion from zone condition, is potentially doing nothing more than spreading out these deaths. That is what we are dealing with here.


Like Senator Whish-Wilson, I have been lucky enough to spend a fair bit of my time interacting with the ocean. I have done the Sydney to Hobart and spent a lot of time in waves around Tasmania's magnificent coastline. Like so many Australians, whether it be through sailing, surfing or fishing—which I have done a fair bit of as well—I feel a connection with our marine environment and our coastline. We should not devalue that connection in the conversation we are having about the way the Geelong Star fishes and whether or not it should be banned from fishing at night. That connection should not be devalued; it should be highly valued because, as human beings, our connection to place is one of the most important things that we have. That is why people will fight passionately to defend places they love against inappropriate developments. The people I represent, the Tasmanian people, are renowned for fighting passionately to protect the places they love, the places they have a relationship with, from what they consider to be inappropriate development. That relationship with place goes to the very heart of what it is to be a human being. Our relationship with the marine ecosystem—those places on the coastline that we love, the waterways that we love—should be highly valued, because just as our connections to places on land define in large part who we are as people so do our connections with the marine ecosystem. 


Quite frankly, whilst we should consider advice from scientists and experts and factor all of those things into our decision making, they are not the only things that we should consider when we make these decisions. Otherwise, we could have a board of scientists or bureaucrats running the country; however, we do not because, as people, we have made the decision to have a democracy where people come from all walks of life—and I look around this chamber and I see people with myriad backgrounds and skill sets, and that is how it should be—in a parliament, because we should reflect the people who elect us to this place. So I accept the importance of science and expert advice but I reject any assertion that science and expert advice should be the only considerations as we go about our decision-making processes in this place. 


I want to say something about ecosystems—in fact we heard the word ecosystem mentioned in the context of innovation this morning in the Senate by a couple of government members. They talked about the innovation ecosystem—and that is a very fine description and one I have used myself in this place in the innovation context. However, I can only hope that the government understands the innovation ecosystem better than they understand the environmental ecosystem. There are serried ranks of people in this country and the world who believe correctly that old-style political parties do not get ecosystems. They do not understand that ecosystems have a level of interconnectedness that we cannot hope to fully grasp. They do not understand that, when you interfere unduly with one part of an ecosystem, that can have significant ramifications around the whole ecosystem. Exhibit A in that case of course is global warming—how humans, by simply emitting large amounts of greenhouse gases, are now seeing feedback loops kick in around the planet that will result in ever-increasing problems; not only environmental problems but human problems. Humans are a part of the global ecosystem, and in fact we rely on the complex global ecosystem for our very survival, the health of our families, the health of our communities and, for that matter, for the health of our economy—and that is a simple fact that old-style political parties do not get. 


While the science may offer some level of surety to some members in this place and they may come in and make their arguments on the basis of the science that they believe is in place, I am here today to say there is more to life. There is more to our deliberations in this place than simply science. I want to express my concerns—ongoing concerns, notwithstanding the comments of the minister—around localised depletion caused by these vessels, and to equate one massive super trawler with a fleet of smaller boats catching the same amount of fish does the minister no credit at all. 


While the Greens are here, we will continue to stand up for our ecosystems. We will continue to stand up for sustainable management of a range of fisheries and other natural resources in this place. But we will take the long view, unlike many others in this place, that looks not only at the impact of our human actions in the next year, the next electoral cycle or the next decade: we will sit and ask ourselves—as we all should—what is the impact of our actions today going to be on people who are alive in 50 or 100 years? Intergenerational equity is something that drives us in the Greens. It drives me as a Greens member of parliament, because I often lie in bed at night wondering what sort of a world we are going to hand over to our children and their children and their children. And, unfortunately, if we keep going on the business-as-usual scenario with our climate and with our management of natural resources, we are going to hand over a world where our kids and their kids have far fewer opportunities than we have today. That, to use an Australianism, is simply not fair. It is not fair on them. That is why we need to make sure that the decisions we make in this place consider human life and the functioning of our ecosystem into the long-term future.


So I want to congratulate Senator Whish-Wilson for bringing this matter before the chamber today. I want to say to members that I will proudly stand with Senator Whish-Wilson and, I might add, proudly stand with the large number of Tasmanian people who have attended rallies and have campaigned against this vessel and previous iterations of the supertrawler and will no doubt continue to stand strong and continue to fight to ensure that the ecosystem functions in the long-term future and that, in the context of recreational fishing, their children and their grandchildren can still throw a line into the water in their childhood and have a reasonably similar expectation of catching a fish as we did in our childhood.

"Muir, Sen Ricky",AMEP,2015-11-25,"



Senator MUIR
 (Victoria) (18:23):  I understand that all fishing can present a potential risk to the marine environment and can sometimes lead to the unintentional harm of marine mammals, but I realise that it is unrealistic to cease all forms of fishing. In saying that, I hope the government and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority ensure that inclusive consultation with all relevant stakeholders is carried out and respond to the concerns across the board.


It is my understanding that a meeting between the recreational fishing sector, the Australian Recreational Fishing Foundation and the Game Fishing Association of Australia, the Australian Commercial Fishing Industry, the National Seafood Industry Alliance, the and the operators and owners of the Geelong Star has been arranged for Tuesday, 1 December, to negotiate a memorandum of understanding about the operation of the Geelong Star. These negotiations will include an agreement for the boat to avoid areas of high-recreational activity, as I understand it.


The outcome of this disallowance motion should not determine the direction of this meeting. In addition to this initial meeting, I believe the Senate inquiry into the environmental, social and economic impacts of large capacity fishing vessels—commonly known as supertrawlers—operating in Australia's marine jurisdiction is a valuable opportunity for all stakeholders to voice their opinions, and the report will be beneficial to the outcome of the memorandum of understanding.


I have listened to both sides of the debate and see the merit in both sides. I would particularly like to thank Senator Ruston and Senator Scullion for taking the time to sit down and speak to me about the government's point of view on this. However, it is important that I am representative of my Victorian constituents and their desires and, after a thorough consideration of both sides, I advise that I will be supporting this disallowance motion.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-11-25,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:25):  Senator Ruston, I agree with you that the size of the boats is not the important factor in this. But I am a little bit confused, because it was your government that put the 130-metre length on your ban for supertrawlers. Your ban is actually based on the size of a boat, so I am not quite sure what you are getting at there. But, if you are saying that it is actually about the operations of the boats and how they operate, I totally agree with you. We certainly have that in common on this issue.


The independent scientific panel that looked at this fishing activity warned that there were risks around potential bycatch issues. Unfortunately, those risks were borne out in a very in-your-face way in the first few weeks after this vessel arrived in this country. This is a really important point: AFMA, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, signed off on the Geelong Star when it arrived in Western Australia. They checked the seal excluder device on the net and they gave it the okay to go fishing. We know that it immediately caught seals and dolphins and had to return to port. They then checked it again and allowed the boat to go fishing a second time, and the same thing happened—and it happened a third time. So the Australian Fisheries Management Authority oversaw those seal and dolphin deaths. And now you are asking us to put faith in the fact that you have got it right now and there will not be any more mortalities of protected species—dolphins and seals. That is what you are asking us to take into account here. Senator Ruston, you also mentioned that the night ban was a knee-jerk reaction. They were the words you used.




Senator Ruston:
  A precautionary measure.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  You used those words as well but you also used the words 'knee-jerk reaction'. As I said, I thought it was absolutely necessary at the time, and I am not convinced—and I think a lot of people I represent are not convinced—that the night ban should be lifted. We know from the evidence that we have received, including from our FOI, that visual identification of dolphins and seals is critical to their protection. They are actually the words that were used by the AFMA observers in their conversations with other AFMA people—and it is something that I have confirmed with the AFMA management. But a decision was made around the economics of this boat and achieving a balance between allowing it to fish and make a buck and the protection of dolphins and seals. We have to make a judgement today about whether we have got that balance right. I think, and the Greens think—and I am glad that Labor and Senator Muir support this—that the ban should stay in place and that we should take all possible mitigation measures to protect dolphins and seals.


I would like to point out to Senator Collins and Labor that, yes, you may feel sorry for the owners of this boat, but let's remember that it was Seafish Tasmania that brought the first supertrawler here three and a bit years ago. That literally set this country on fire—it was literally like wildfire—in terms of the reaction. That was not the first supertrawler to come here. The Veronica came here in 2007, and it caused the same reaction. So Seafish Tasmania made the decision to bring a smaller vessel, the Geelong Star—still a very big trawler—knowing what public sentiment was in this country and knowing that the independent scientific panel had said that there would be risks to bycatch and localised depletion and the impacts that might have on seals, dolphins, seabirds and other marine life and other fish. The boat came without any consultation with the rec fishing groups and with environmentalists. Had they learnt the lessons of the Margiris and the Abel Tasman and actually sat down and talked to stakeholders, then this could have been avoided. But in the end, and I do not say this with any pride, we turned out to be right. The arrival of that boat was a catastrophe for marine life.


I am glad you, Senator Ruston, have acknowledged that it was unacceptable. I acknowledge you also made the point that you—and even the people on board the boat and in fisheries—do not like to see dolphins, whales or other cetaceans and seals killed. None of us do. I totally accept that. The question here is: have we got the balance right? I would like to see the night ban stay in place for longer, as a lot of people I represent would too.


Lastly, in relation to the videos that are on the boat, I have attempted through freedom of information to get copies of the videotape and so far, after repeated attempts, have not been successful. They are not open and available for people to view, and that is unfortunate. We are continuing to try and get copies of those, but they are not available to us at the moment even though we have made numerous FOI requests.


I hope that you are correct and that the observers do stay on board the vessel. I know it has fished at daytime for months. You have not told us how often it has been fishing at night-time. We do not even have that data in front of us to work out the likelihood of having caught and killed dolphins in the seven weeks that the night ban has been released. Perhaps when the Senate inquiry looks at these kind of things and more information comes to light, then we can get a lot more light shed on this.


I ask the Senate to disallow the removal of the night ban on the supertrawler Geelong Star in the Small Pelagic Fishery and take a stand to protect our marine life.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the disallowance motion moved by Senator Whish-Wilson be agreed to.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (19:20):  Last week I had the honour of participating as a guest of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in their Asian women parliamentarians dialogue in Brussels. The subject was on empowering women in Asia and Europe. The purpose of the dialogue was to examine the policies and practices of the EU and NATO in relation to gender advancement and the role of women in peace and security. Arriving in the middle of a terrorism shutdown in Brussels certainly sharpened our focus on the topic at hand.


The Konrad Adenauer Foundation is a civic research and education foundation named for the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. Chancellor Adenauer led Germany from a broke, defeated nation in the years following World War II to a vibrant, stable and prosperous democracy. The foundation is dedicated to promoting right around the world Adenauer's ideas of the basic democratic values: the rule of law, freedom, peace, and justice—values most Australians share. But, sadly, as we saw in Brussels, today not everyone around the world or even here in Australia share these values with us.


For many years I have worked with, trained and mentored young political leaders, party officials and candidates all over the world on behalf of a number of Australian and overseas democracy support organisations. Officially my role has been to provide advice and practical assistance to those who are fighting for democracy in their own nations, under their own system of government and in their own society. While that was officially my role, I often reflect that instead I have been the major beneficiary of these experiences and the ensuing life-long friendships. I am undoubtedly a better person and, I hope, now a better politician for these rich experiences.


It is the work with women that I love the most and am most proud of: witnessing such passion and commitment in the face of what for us would be unimaginable conditions—for ourselves as women and for ourselves as politicians, and also for our own families. They suffer from egregious gender discrimination, physical violence, suicide attacks and extended imprisonment—to name just a few of the barriers and conditions.


In Brussels last week I was reunited with female colleagues from across Asia and met some amazing new female MPs. Quite simply, they are the most extraordinary group of women, whose passion, commitment and sheer bravery is inspirational and terribly humbling. For many of them, our worst ever day in politics here in Australia would be their best ever day in politics. To me, all these women are heroes and leaders in the truest sense of those words.


By way of example, last week marked the 12-month anniversary since my friend Shukria Barakzai, a 10-year member of the Afghanistan parliament and a very prominent women's rights campaigner, was the target of a suicide bombing in Kabul in which nine people were tragically killed and she and 35 others were wounded, both physically and mentally.


Shukria is an extraordinary woman who, at only 42, has had a most remarkable life—in fact, I think she has had several lives—fighting for the rights of girls and women in Afghanistan. During that struggle, she has lost two of her own children to the Taliban, she has been beaten, but still she ran an underground school for girls to ensure that, during Taliban rule, they got the education that they needed. Despite the attack she and her family—her five children—remain in Afghanistan fighting for women and for the next generation of her country, all the while under the protection of a large team of bodyguards due to the ever-present threat of another suicide attack on her and those around her. Witnessing Shukria and other brave women fight so hard for what we largely take for granted here in Australia is sobering. But it also reminds me that women all over the world, including here in Australia, share universal socioeconomic challenges that will never just fix themselves.


Today is White Ribbon Day. As we have heard from so many colleagues so poignantly in and out of both chambers, including from Sarah Henderson, women and children suffer terribly from domestic violence right across our country, and two women a week die from the injuries inflicted—mostly by the men in their lives—and thousands of others silently bear the scars and misplaced shame of these attacks.


I arrived in Brussels last Monday when the city was in an eerie state of lockdown. The streets where we were staying in the heart of the European Commission and the European Union parliament were almost empty as Belgian police carried out raids in the hunt for the perpetrators of the Paris terrorist attacks and potential new terrorist attacks in Brussels. None of us who attended would have thought before the Paris attacks almost two weeks ago that we would be warned, by our embassy and by concerned loved ones, not to walk around the streets of central Brussels—in the middle of western Europe—and that they would be in lockdown, as we know they continue to be today.


Most of my colleagues are all too familiar with terrorism in all its forms, particularly with religious based extremism. My colleagues from Afghanistan and Pakistan in particular told us of their experiences dealing with the threat of religious-based terrorism and they were crystal clear in their advice to us: if you allow the terrorists to change us, they win. So together we must stick to our principles defeat them. We have no choice. They are Islamic jihadists, they pervert Islam, but they still must be tackled head on. They will never respect our kindness and our generosity. Instead they will exploit it to harm us. There is no-one more qualified to make this observation to me and to all of us than these brave Muslim women who face this threat every day.


The consensus from the workshop was that women have a critical contribution to make in all facets of public life and society. This is especially so in achieving peace and security in areas of conflict. It was also clear to me and others that gender equality and, more generally, diversity first need peace, stable government and civil society. Women and children always suffer the most in conflict and during periods of austerity; but, despite this, if and when empowered women can be key agents of change.


One focus of our dialogue in the EU parliament with our European colleagues was how the new Sustainable Development Goals have the potential to drive gender and diversity change not just in developing countries but also in Australia, in Europe and in the United States. The key issue for us all now is how we translate the goals into meaningful action in our own countries. That is the work that I think we all need to face together and work together on. 


In conclusion, my sincerest thanks to the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and to their dedicated staff for making this wonderful program possible. It brings together women in parliaments from across Asia to provide professional development, networking and the opportunity for mutual support. My thanks also to the Australian Embassy staff for their professional guidance and assistance during my visit. Most of all, to my Asian colleagues, all I can say is thank you.
