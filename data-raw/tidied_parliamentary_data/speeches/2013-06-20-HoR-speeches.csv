Mr STEPHEN SMITH
 (Perth—Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (09:01):  by leave—The government is committed to providing regular reports and updates on its response to allegations of sexual and other forms of abuse in Defence, including to the parliament. In April 2011, in the aftermath of the so-called ADFA Skype incident, I announced a range of reviews into aspects of the culture within both the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to address ongoing concern in relation to failure to meet appropriate standards of conduct.


The cultural reviews included the use of alcohol in the ADF, personal conduct of ADF personnel, the use of social media in Defence, employment pathways for Australian Public Service women in Defence and the management of incidents and complaints in Defence. The reviews assessed the good work that had been done to date in these areas and examined what further improvements could be made.


In addition to the reviews into aspects of defence culture, I also announced at that time two significant reviews into the treatment of women at ADFA and in the ADF generally, to be conducted by the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Elizabeth Broderick, on behalf of the Australian Human Rights Commission, and the DLA Piper Review of Allegations of Sexual and Other Abuse in Defence.


On 11 April 2011, I also announced that the Chief of the Defence Force would bring forward for implementation by the government the opening up of all roles in the ADF to women on the basis that determination for suitability for roles in the ADF is to be based on their ability to perform in the role, not gender. In September 2011 the government announced it had formally agreed to the removal of gender restrictions from ADF combat roles.


Defence's comprehensive response to the cultural reviews, the March 2012 Pathway to change document, outlines how the recommendations of the various cultural reviews will be implemented consistent with the wider Defence reform program. Pathway to change sets out the requirement that Defence personnel demonstrate exemplary behaviour commensurate with the nation's expectations, in and out of uniform, on and off duty, and how the Defence leadership will require these standards are met. It states that Australia rightly expects that Defence will deliver to consistently high standards, including in everyday personal behaviour and in how personnel treat their colleagues.


This requirement was again underlined by the formal statement by the Defence leadership in October 2012 in response to the Broderick review into the treatment of women in the ADF, which stated that every sexual offender and harasser will be held to account together with leaders who fail to appropriately address such behaviour. As the Defence leadership stated on that occasion, when the government and Defence adopted all of the recommendations of the Broderick reviews, these standards are not open to negotiation.


The failure to meet the standards required of Pathway to change and the Broderick reviews was sadly demonstrated by the appalling revelations last week by the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General Morrison, in relation to an ongoing investigation by the Australian Defence Force Investigative Service (ADFIS), in cooperation with the New South Wales Police, into the actions of a group of officers and noncommissioned officers of the Australian Army. 


The matters under investigation are serious and centre on the production and distribution of highly inappropriate material demeaning women across both the Defence computer systems and the public internet. Three already suspended Army members are the subject of an ongoing investigation by New South Wales Police. The Chief of Army has initiated action to consider the suspension of another five members who are the subject of a parallel ADFIS investigation into a number of alleged service offences. Pending the outcome of the ongoing ADFIS investigation, the Army may consider further suspension decisions against nine others if the circumstances warrant. ADFIS is also investigating a further 90 individuals who have been identified as peripheral to the group's email exchanges. 


The government strongly supports the actions taken by the Chief of Army. Lieutenant General Morrison has unambiguously reinforced his expectations of appropriate behaviour and demonstrated his resolve to act decisively in response to such despicable incidents. Incidents such as these do significant reputational damage to the good work of the vast majority of the Australian Defence Force and are symptomatic of a systemic cultural problem within Defence. 


For two reasons this is a different case of inappropriate behaviour to that of the ADFA Skype incident. First, this situation does not involve young men with weeks in the Defence Force. It involves commissioned and noncommissioned officers who have been in the Army for years. Second, the response on this occasion has been qualitatively different and significantly better than the response in the ADFA Skype incident. The response to the ADFA Skype incident was wanting and led directly to the reviews I have referred to, as well as the DLA Piper Review of Allegations of Sexual and Other Abuse in Defence.


In contrast to the response to the ADFA Skype incident, the government strongly supports the robust response that demonstrates in the post-ADFA Skype environment the zero tolerance of Defence leadership for failure to meet appropriate standards. 


General Morrison has unambiguously demonstrated the standard set by the Chief of the Defence Force, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, the Vice Chief of the Defence Force and the Service Chiefs for the Defence leadership's zero tolerance response to inappropriate conduct.


General Morrison has set the benchmark for future zero tolerance responses to inappropriate conduct.


The Defence leadership is absolutely committed to pursuing the reforms necessary to ensure zero tolerance of inappropriate conduct.


On 26 November 2012 I announced the government's response to the Report of the DLA Piper review into allegations of sexual or other abuse in Defence and on 14 March 2013 I presented to the House the first interim report of the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce.


Today I provide an update to the parliament on the government's response to the DLA Piper review and the work of the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce, chaired by the Honourable Len Roberts-Smith RFD, QC. 


As well I will table the task force's second interim report.


As the report outlines, the task force is continuing to gather material and assess both information provided to DLA Piper during its review and information relating to new complaints registered with the task force since its establishment in November 2012.


As at 31 May 2013, there were 2,410 complaints which will be assessed by the task force. 


Of these, 1,535 are new complaints received by the task force between 26 November 2012 and by 31 May 2013, and 875 are complaints which came from DLA Piper that the task force has consent from the complainant to reassess.


Approximately 331 complaints have been identified as duplicates or multiple lodgements by the same person. 510 have not yet provided consent for information to be passed to the task force. 


These include 173 regarded by DLA Piper as plausible allegations. The task force has received 602 of the plausible allegations made to DLA Piper.


I have asked the task force to follow up with DLA Piper to ensure that individuals who have not yet given consent are given every opportunity for their complaints to be assessed by the task force. If they provide such subsequent consent, their allegations will be assessed by the task force.


By 6 June 2013, the task force had contacted approximately 1,380 complainants to answer enquiries, assist complainants complete the task force's forms, provide supporting information, discuss the options available to complainants and ascertain which outcomes they wish to pursue.


More than 240 complaints were at various points of the assessment process on 6 June 2013 and eight complaints had been provided to the reparation payments assessor for consideration. 


The task force will endeavour to provide resolution in consultation with the complainant, taking into account his or her individual circumstances and wishes. 


The task force will only work towards those outcomes the complainant indicates he or she wants.


The task force is expressly considering if further investigation through a Royal Commission is required into particular matters identified in the report of the DLA Piper review, in particular in relation to ADFA as outlined previously and in relation to alleged events at HMAS Leeuwin in the 1960s and 1970s.


The ADFA 24 is a group of 24 serious allegations of rape from 19 complainants identified in 1998 in the course of the Grey review and later in 2011 in the DLA Piper volume 1 report.


I asked the task force to prioritise any ADFA 24 cases that came before it, so that it could provide outcomes for the victims and, where possible, identify the perpetrators of the abuse.


In accordance with the long-established practice regarding sexual abuse cases, the task force can only assist victims who come forward and consent to their case being assessed. 


This ensures that the wishes and welfare of victims are the primary concern. It recognises that a victim might have strong reasons for not wanting their case to be examined, especially if the abuse occurred a long time ago.


To date, only four of the 19 complainants of the so-called ADFA 24 cases have consented to their complaints being assessed by the task force. 


If a victim from the ADFA 24 cases told DLA Piper about their abuse but did not consent to that information coming to the task force, they are still able to provide consent should they decide to do so.


Again, I have asked the task force to follow up with DLA Piper to ensure that any such individual who made a complaint to DLA Piper about the ADFA 24 cases who have not yet given consent are given every opportunity for their complaints to be assessed by the task force. If they provide subsequent consent, their allegations will be assessed by the task force.


The task force however now has an additional 48 complainants alleging incidents of physical abuse, sexual abuse, harassment or bullying at ADFA. The task force is assessing these ADFA cases as well as the HMAS Leeuwin matters reported to it.


At this stage of analysis, several issues are becoming apparent to the task force:


the allegations of serious abuse at HMAS Leeuwin and ADFA are more widespread and persistent than was reported in the 1971 Rapke report and in the 1998 Grey review respectively;


there are not presently sufficient complainants from those training institutions or detailed information to enable all alleged abusers to be properly identified;


the particular issues which arose at HMAS Leeuwin and ADFA can also be seen at other ADF recruit schools and training institutions; and


while powers to gather evidence would assist in examining these matters, the task force is currently of the view that it is by no means clear that a Royal Commission is the necessary or the most appropriate mechanism to do so.


Implementation of Pathway to change, the Broderick reviews and the work of the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce are all essential to ensuring that Defence continues to serve Australia's national interests in a way that is consistent with modern community standards. This includes standards in Defence culture and everyday personal behaviour. Full implementation of the range of cultural reforms is essential to prevent future occurrences of inappropriate conduct and ensuring a zero tolerance response is adopted and implemented if it does occur. This requires ongoing attention and oversight from the highest levels. The government and the Defence leadership are absolutely committed to pursuing the reforms necessary to ensure a zero tolerance response to such inappropriate conduct. 


I present a copy of the second interim report to the Attorney-General and the Minister of Defence by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce and I present a paper tabled in conjunction with my ministerial statement. 


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Fadden to speak for 13 minutes.


Leave granted.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2013-06-20,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (09:14):  I thank the minister for once again keeping the House informed on this very important issue of the abuse task force. From the outset, the coalition has provided the strongest bipartisan support to the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce and the great work of judge Len Robert-Smith. As I said to the House at the time of the ministerial apology to those members and former members of the ADF who have been subject to abuse in the ADF, ours is a unique fighting force, a small but potent military that has delivered a disproportionate effect upon every battlefield upon which it has fought. We have a rich military history, and we can rightfully hold our heads high in the concert of nations when it comes to defending freedom. Our history of military endeavour is second to none.


Yet despite our overwhelming battlefield success there has been a flood of complaints, some going back to the 1950s, of abuse within the ranks. Our military personnel are our greatest asset, and their wellbeing is our No. 1 priority. Their care while serving our nation is not a price we pay; it is a duty we undertake. By any standard the litany of abuse allegations are completely unacceptable, let alone by the standards of the finest fighting force in the world—the Australian Defence Force. This conduct does not accord with the values of our society, let alone the values of our military.


We may well be beholden to our past but it is now our responsibility to ensure that the wrongs inflicted on these fine men and women of the ADF over the last six decades are addressed and, importantly, that these egregious acts and wrongs are addressed to the satisfaction of those aggrieved, whether through counselling, reparation payments, apologies, restorative justice or all of the above. This is what the abuse task force is seeking to achieve.


To that extent, we are satisfied with the process being undertaken by the task force, and satisfied with the minister keeping the House completely up-to-date. The minister and I discussed this extensively yesterday, and we agreed to the two following changes that the minister has outlined in his speech: that those who have lodged a complaint to the DLA Piper review but not yet provided consent for their information to be passed to the task force—approximately 173 individuals—will continue to have the ability to do this, to provide consent. In general terms, the deadline of 31 May will ostensibly be waived for them to ensure they have every opportunity for that consent to be provided.


Likewise, we agreed that only four of the 19 complainants of these so-called ADFA 24 have consented, again for their information to be provided to the task force. The minister has quite rightly ensured that they will continue to have the provision to have that consent provided and, again, the deadline of 31 May will ostensibly be waived for them. I agree with both of those sensible and reasonable changes that the minister has outlined, quite rightly.


I share the minister's concern that allegations of abuse at training institutions may be more widespread than first thought. I am confident, however, that the 'Pathway to Change' that the ADF senior leadership has embarked upon, and the Chief of Army's current response to the issues, have shown that they not only have embarked upon it but that they believe in it and stand behind it. I am confident that this is addressing the change needed. Can I say, as a former ADFA cadet and a former army officer, that I remain resolute that ADFA is an outstanding institution in the modern day. I commended it highly to our nation's sons and daughters. I believe the approach being taken by the senior Defence leadership to address underlying issues of abuse is making and will make a sustained and significant difference.


We accept the task force view that they are progressing the matter sensibly and as quickly now as they can, and that they do not yet believe that a royal commission is necessary or, indeed, appropriate in the circumstances. We will continue to monitor the issue with the minister and with the task force. But let me thank the minister for his update to the House. He knows he enjoys the complete bipartisan support of the coalition as he progresses this matter, and I thank him for keeping the nation informed.

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (09:19):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia's taxation laws.


Schedule 1 amends the Tax Agent Services Act 2009 to ensure that entities that provide tax agent services in the course of giving advice of a kind that is usually given by a financial services licensee or a representative of licensees are subject to the regulatory regime of the Tax Practitioners Board.


These are important consumer protection amendments to ensure the appropriate regulation of all forms of tax advice, irrespective of whether it is provided by a tax agent, a BAS agent or an entity in the financial services industry.


These reforms have been subject to extensive consultation with industry. On 6 June 2013, the amendments were also referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The committee delivered its report on 17 June and recommended that parliament pass the amendments.


Throughout this process, we have listened to the concerns of the financial services industry. The government will extend the current exemption and the commencement date of the new regime by 12 months until 1 July 2014. This will allow industry ample time to prepare for the new regime.


From 1 July 2014, there will be a three-year transitional period, during which financial services licensees and their representatives may register with the Tax Practitioners Board without meeting all of the education and experience requirements.


The government will also undertake further consultation on whether it is necessary to amend the Tax Agent Services Regulations 2009 to ensure the regulations align with the government's intent that the following services should not constitute tax agent services:


tax advice provided by a superannuation fund or pension fund pursuant to the issuance of a payment summary;


services provided by a superannuation fund's representatives pursuant to 'intra-fund advice' provisions;


advice provided by an insurer pursuant to payments of income protection or salary continuance insurance payments and corresponding issue of payment summary and advice therein; and


services provided by responsible entities of managed investment schemes to the scheme.


Schedule 2 also amends the Tax Agent Services Act 2009 to correct a range of technical issues.


Schedule 3 amends the list of deductible gift recipients (DGR) in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Taxpayers can claim income tax deductions for certain gifts to organisations with DGR status. DGR status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their activities.


Schedule 3 adds two new organisations to the act, namely, the Australian Council of Social Service Incorporated and Make a Mark Australia Incorporated.


Full details of these measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


Debate adjourned.

Ms KING
 (Ballarat—Minister for Road Safety, Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories) (09:23):  I move:


That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approve the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 17 June 2013, namely:


(1) pay parking infrastructure, including machines, signage and minor civil engineering works necessary for the introduction of pay parking in the Parliamentary Zone; and


(2) relocation of the Torsional Wave outdoor exhibit to the corner of King George Terrace and Mall Road West adjacent to the Questacon Building.


The National Capital Authority proposes to install paid parking voucher machines and signage within the Parliamentary Zone. The National Capital Authority will also commission some minor civil works, such as the construction of additional traffic islands for the successful implementation of this initiative. The installation of this equipment will assist the National Capital Authority in better managing parking in that zone, which has become a problem of late, freeing up much-needed parking space for visitors to our many national institutions in that zone. The works are not inconsistent with relevant policies and strategies in the heritage management plans for the area and will have minimal impact on environment and heritage values. I commend that part of the motion to the House.


Also in November last year approval was provided for an outdoor exhibit in a location to the west of Questacon. The National Capital Authority has now received an application for an amended location for the exhibit—that being on the corner of King Edward Terrace and Mall Road West. Questacon proposes to install the torsional wave outdoor exhibit, which I understand is a sculpture that demonstrates the twisting forces in water. It sounds like a particularly beautiful sculpture. That exhibit was proposed to be installed in November this year to celebrate 25 years as Australia's National Science and Technology Centre. The work is consistent with relevant policies and strategies in the heritage management plans for the area. It is considered that the work will have minimal impact on environment and heritage values. I commend this part of the motion to the House.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2013-06-20,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (09:26): In continuing from last night, I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013. Last night I said that I thought this was a disgraceful bill. It is a disgraceful bill because it is deliberately designed to crack down on what has been a successful program to date and there is no evidence that it has not been successful or has been rorted. Secondly, this is a disgraceful bill because it shatters the decades-long bipartisan support for skilled migration into this country.


I believe, and I said this last night, that good members of the Labor Party would be deeply embarrassed and indeed be ashamed about this bill. They would be ashamed because it actually abandons the values that they have held for a long time. They would be ashamed because it abandons the bipartisan support for skilled migration that has been so central to the economic and social success of this nation. I know that members on the other side of this chamber, such as Martin Ferguson, Robert McClelland, Simon Crean and even the former minister for immigration, Chris Bowen, would never have put forward a bill such as this one. I do not think that when it comes to voting on this bill they on the other side of the chamber will feel very proud at all that they will have to line up and vote for this disgraceful bill that has been put forward.


The bill itself is designed to completely strangle the 457 visa program in red tape. That is what it is designed to do. Make no bones about it. If there are visa rorts in this program then let us deal with them. Of course, Australians should get the jobs first and that should always be the case, but this is not about that. This bill is actually all about delivering for the unions because they have requested this bill be rushed into this parliament in the dying days of this government. We all know that if the unions say to the Labor Party, 'Jump,' then the Labor Party will say, 'How high?' They cannot bring this bill in quickly enough. I am sure they will attempt to guillotine it through this parliament later on today.


Why has the government said that we need this legislation which cracks down on 457 visas? Why have they said we need this? In essence they have given two reasons. The first is because they say the 457 visa program has been extensively rorted. The minister for immigration even gave a figure. He said that 10,000 visas have been rorted, which would constitute almost 10 per cent of the program. If that was the case, then, yes, we absolutely need to get on top of this program. But was there any evidence for this 10,000 figure? No, there was no evidence. Where did this figure come from? It transpired, after he announced this figure, that he had actually just made it up. That is right: he made up this figure and the immigration department officials, some of whom are in this chamber today, confirmed this to the Senate estimates. They said that they provided no such advice and could not provide any evidence to support that number.


When Tony Sheldon, a union leader, was asked how many 457 visa complaints he had received over the past 12 months—Tony Sheldon has been on this campaign to abolish the 457 visa program, or at least to crack down on it—do you know how many he said? Twenty-four. He had 24 in 12 months. So he is one of the key leaders out there saying, 'This is an outrage; it's being rorted on a daily basis,' and he has had 24 complaints. How many did he report to the immigration department? Zero. Twenty-four complaints, zero reported to the immigration department, and the immigration minister is running around saying there are 10,000 that have been rorted. It is a disgraceful, despicable act of this minister, who does not deserve to be in that high office.


The second reason the government has given for needing to crack down on the 457 visa process is they say there has been excessive growth in this program. They say we need to crack down on it because if there is excessive growth, then maybe it is out of control. Again, let us have a look at the numbers. What has been the growth rate between last year and this year? It has been 1.7 per cent. That constitutes 940 more visa holders this year versus last year. Nine hundred and forty, and they have the gall to come in and try to pass this bill because of that. About 940 people come in illegally on boats every few days, but they do not worry about that. But 940 additional applications this year compared to last year, and apparently that is a catastrophe.


We know what the Prime Minister said last year. Last year it was all hunky dory, all absolutely perfect because the Prime Minister herself said:


I believe we've got the visa settings right … with short-term 457 visas.


That was 12 months ago. The Prime Minister herself said that. But we have had 940 additional visa applications and apparently we need to completely crack down on this very successful program. Of course, if you were concerned about the rorting going on in the program—and if there is rorting, let us absolutely deal with it—you would not cut the compliance costs by 30 per cent, which is what this government have done since they came to office. They have cut the compliance cost by 30 per cent. This is not about dealing with rorts; this is squarely about dealing with an issue that the unions want. And when the unions want something, this government delivers.



My final point is that this is gross hypocrisy because we all know the Prime Minister herself employs a person on a 457 visa who did not go through their proposed process. (Time expired)

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2013-06-20,"



Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (09:37):  The purpose of this bill is to propose a package of measures that are aimed at eliminating the illegitimate use of subclass 457 visa program and other temporary sponsored visa programs. Together with proposed amendments to the Migration Regulations 1994 and other policy changes announced in February 2013, this bill presents a comprehensive package of reforms that would balance the interests of Australian workers with the need to strengthen the protection of overseas workers, so we stop people being ripped off, being exploited. This false argument that we have heard in this parliament in the past few days on this bill, which does not give any concern for Australian workers—but one would not expect much else from the Liberal Party, the Work Choices party! One would not expect anything else from them: these false arguments being proposed, the attacks on the minister—all this false stuff.


Importantly this bill gives powers to the Fair Work Ombudsman, the Fair Work inspectors, to monitor, investigate compliance with sponsorship obligations, and to ensure workers are working in their nominated occupation and being paid market salary rates. Well, what is wrong with that? There should not be anything wrong with that, but somehow it is wrong from the Liberal Party's point of view. We had a situation in northern Tasmania: a guy was sponsored into Australia to work in Queensland as a miner and he ended up working as a plasterer in Launceston when there were six or seven other plasterers walking around the streets looking for work. That sort of thing should not occur and there should be some monitoring of that. That is all this bill is asking.


There have been a number of cases recently, some of which have been reported in the press and some others anecdotally have come to my attention, that people have been employed on 457 visas, have been employed well below the award rates and have been made to work long hours without proper income. Only on Monday this week, a case was reported on the front page of the Launceston Examiner, and that was an underpayment of $88,000. So what we had there was someone using the legislation to employ people on lower rates. There is also the incidence where 457 visa holders are being employed, despite there being in an Australian, a Tasmanian, to undertake work that is being advertised. We have an unemployment rate in Tasmania of 7.3 per cent against a 5.6 per cent rate for the rest of the country.


This legislation will now require subclass 457 sponsors to undertake labour market testing in relation to a nominated occupation in a manner consistent with Australia's relevant international trade obligations to ensure that Australian citizens and permanent residents are given the first opportunities to apply for skilled vacancies in the domestic labour market. It is of concern that, at a time when the labour market has been flattening and some sectors and regions have experienced layoffs and increased unemployment, the subclass 457 program has continued to grow—and grow it has. In the last year, the number of primary 457 visa holders has risen by 20 per cent from 80,000 to 100,000, while employment growth has been just one per cent.


There are issues here that need to be dealt with and this bill deals with them. I have real concerns that some employers are turning to overseas workers first, rather than investing in local training and local recruitment—of course, that is a whole other area about training the Australian workforce. There have also been a growing number of low-skilled industries and occupations such as retail and hospitality, while in the IT industry growth in the use of 457 visa holders has been accompanied by lower than average wages, which is the opposite of what you would expect if there were some genuine skill shortages. You would not expect lower than average wages to apply. We have considerable evidence that some sponsors are paying overseas workers below the market rate, undercutting Australians, failing to commit to the training requirements of the program and using the visas fraudulently to help family and friends migrate.


The purpose of this bill is to propose a package of integrity measures that seek to enhance the government's ability to eliminate rorts in the subclass 457 visa program and of course other temporary sponsored visa programs. Together with proposed amendments to Migration Regulations 1994, this bill represents a comprehensive package of reforms which will balance the interests of Australian workers with the need to strengthen the protection of overseas workers. We do not want people coming here on 457 visas and being exploited—well, this side of the House does not.


This bill amends the Migration Regulations 1994 to extend the period from 28 days to 90 consecutive days, enabling a more socially just outcome for visa holders as they have more time to find other jobs and to arrange their personal affairs at the conclusion of their sponsored employment. It is felt that they need to complement the reforms to the migration regulations announced in February this year. The bill will enshrine in the Migration Act the kind of sponsorship obligations which must be made by the regulations. Employers must ensure equivalent terms and conditions of employment—including payment of a market salary rate—keep certain records and provide records and information to the department and cooperate with the inspectors. These new sponsorship obligations come into effect on 1 July of this year. The obligations need to meet training requirements for the term of sponsorship approval, with no transfer, charge or recovery of certain costs from sponsored visa holders, and restrict on-hiring arrangements. These will be spelled out in the Migration Regulations 1994 and are scheduled to come into effect on 1 July this year.


There is an enforcement framework to bar or cancel the approval of a person as a sponsor with an infringement notice and a civil penalty scheme, which would be enforceable in court. This amendment will allow the minister to publish enforcement undertakings on the department's website. This is an important tool to encourage compliance by all sponsors and is a means of providing transparency to the Australian public on the monitoring of sponsors. It will get a bit of transparency in there and will not let people rip people off without having their name exposed for doing it. There seems to be reluctance on the other side of the House to want that to happen.


Importantly, the bill gives power to the Fair Work Ombudsman to monitor and investigate compliance with sponsorship obligations to ensure workers are working in their nominated occupation and are being paid market salary rates. By doing so, the government's capacity to monitor sponsors will increase from 33 active inspectors to over 300 inspectors. The government has always said that the subclass 457 visa program, where used genuinely, plays an important role in supplying skilled labour, when such labour is unavailable in the local workforce. It is intended to allow employers to quickly supplement the Australian labour market.


These bills seek to realign the program to ensure that it is only used when genuine skills shortages exist, to ensure a balance between considering the interests of employers, the Australian domestic labour force, and strengthening protection for overseas workers. It is worth noting that there has been an increase in the visa application charge from $455 to $900, and as announced in the 2013-14 budget, consideration was also given to increasing the nomination fee for each 457 position from $85 to $330. It is really about getting that balance, and the balance is not right at the moment. People are being ripped off.


Australian workers are missing out on jobs that they should have access to. There are jobs that should be advertised better. We have had these debates about the mining industry as well. I think there should be a lot more transparency in the way jobs are advertised in Australia. I have had people say to me that they have every ticket under the sun, they have applied to many websites to get jobs in the mining industry in Australia, they are quite free to travel and to live in mining communities, yet they just do not have access and they get nothing back from applications put in through websites. So there is something happening in this country which is not working properly in the field, and then you have employers sponsoring people to come in from overseas. And then we have this total exploitation taking place, as I mentioned, which was run on the front page of the Tasmanian Examiner on Monday—not a paper which one would say was a Labor radical paper in any way but it certainly got into telling the story about somebody who was in the fast food business and was brought into Australia from China. That person is going to receive $90,000 in back pay as a result of underpayment. That is what the Fair Work Ombudsman's report claimed. The story goes on to highlight that the gentleman involved was made to sign false pay slips, was forced to work enormous amounts of hours as a cook and then had to put his name to false documentation. He did not have a lot of good English so it was very difficult for him to stand up to the exploitation, but inspectors were able to do that. I guess it is about having an inspector with time to do the work and to be able to talk to people about that. It was about being forced to sign documentation which was not true and was not a true reflection of what the proper case was. So here is a prime example in Tasmania of exploitation of a 457 visa person working there. I do not know, given the unemployment rate of 7.5 per cent, if there are any chefs or cooks in Tasmania looking for work but I think there probably are.


So I think there is a great deal of need for this bill to rectify some of the problems. It concerns me greatly that the party of Work Choices do not seem to think that this is a major issue in Australia. I believe it is and I believe it needs to be rectified. I believe that the minister responsible for this bill is endeavouring to do that so I ask the House to give full support to this bill.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2013-06-20,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (09:48):  I think the member for Lyons has really put the argument very succinctly as to why the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013 is not necessary. He has given us an example of where there has been a problem with the current system, and we are talking about the current system before this legislation had been put in place. So what has happened? The matter was looked at, it was addressed and it was dealt with. So it has been fixed without this bill, which is another clear example of why this bill is unnecessary and should not be here before us today.


Let us go back and see what has led to this bill being in parliament. I think that we should rename this bill, calling it the City West Water Bill. For those of us who cannot remember it, in February there was a dispute in Melbourne where the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union took offence at 457 visa holders, Filipinos, who were working in skilled positions constructing a water facility in Werribee. They put in place a community picket line—and we are about to see whether the AMWU were behind that community picket line or not. All of the evidence points out that the AMWU did instigate that picket line, but anyway the courts will decide whether it was a union picket line or a community picket line. In the end what happened to break that picket line was that the state government stood firm and it made sure that the water authorities, City West Water and Melbourne Water, acted. It took the water authorities a little bit of time to act. The union movement thought that they would not act and they thought the authorities would just cower and would not take unions on, but the Victorian state government—and, in particular, the then Premier, Ted Baillieu—stood very firm and insisted that the water authorities do the right thing, which they did. The workers were flown in by helicopter and ultimately the picket line was dismantled.


But the AMWU did not want to leave the matter there so they went to Victorian Trades Hall and said, 'We've got an issue with regards to 457 workers. We don't want them anymore doing these skilled jobs.' So Trades Hall then put out a pronouncement saying that if the union movement in Victoria were to get strongly behind this federal Labor government one of the conditions would be that something be done about 457 visas. So Trades Hall said, 'It's up to you, federal government. If you want additional support you do something in this area.' That is why we are here today debating this bill. It has nothing to do with evidence, it has nothing to do with facts and it has everything to do with this Labor government being dictated to by the union movement.


It is a sad state of affairs when you have a Prime Minister, desperately clinging to power, who is prepared to put the national interest over here and act in her own base political interest to try to hang on to her prime ministership. There are reports today that it is still not going to work for her, because the key ally of the union movement in this place, Bill Shorten, is meant to be off talking to the unions to see whether they should continue to support this Prime Minister or whether they should switch camps. We have a piece of legislation before us which will do nothing for this nation. As a matter of fact, it will set the cause of this nation back, all because we have a Prime Minister clinging desperately to power, hoping that the union movement will continue to back her. Now we hear on the news wires that the grip that the union movement have on her is slipping away, because they are once again looking at reinstalling Kevin Rudd.


Why is this a bad piece of legislation? It is a bad piece of legislation because, as I said before, there is no evidence whatsoever that the 457 visa system is being systematically rorted. As a matter of fact, as my good friend the member for Aston highlighted in his speech, there have been 24 complaints in the last 12 months about the 457 visa system and of those 24 complaints zero have been passed on to the immigration department. That is right: 24 complaints in 12 months and zero passed on to the immigration department. Those facts say it all. It shows what an absolute sham piece of legislation this is.


And it is worse than that, because it is adding a regulatory impact on those employers who are using this system to fill skills gaps, and there is a real need for us to continue to fill skills gaps in this country. One of the sad things about this bill is that until now there has been broad bipartisanship for the 457 visa system and for using skilled migration in this country. I take this opportunity to once again thank the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, for the support he gave to one of my local communities in Warrnambool. Six families who had come in under 457 visas, because of some issues with regard to meeting English language proficiency, might have been sent back to where they came from—in this case, China—but the minister was prepared to intervene. The six workers had worked in the local abattoir for over five years and their families had been through the local schools. Minister Bowen, to his credit, intervened and made sure that those families could stay and continue to work in our community and participate in our community. 


That is the type of bipartisan approach to 457 visas that we have seen historically. Yet, sadly, with this Prime Minister desperately clinging to power, at the behest of the union movement we see a bill like this come into this place. We on this side know that most of the good people on the other side do not support it. They have said that publicly. They do not think that this is a good piece of legislation. They know that this is a piece of legislation aimed at trying to address a problem which does not exist.


It is a great pity we are here today examining this bill, spending time on this bill, because it will add a regulatory burden on employers. We know that it will because the government refused to have a regulatory impact statement done on it. Why would they refuse to have a regulatory impact statement done on this bill? Because they know, and it is there for all to see, that it will add to the burden of employers trying to bring skilled workers into this country. And it is not as if this is a rare piece of legislation that will be adding a regulatory burden. We have seen over the course of the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments over 21,000 pieces of legislation which have added a regulatory burden for employers. This is just another one to add to this list.


The real shame is that there is a real need for the 457 visa system. Just this week I have had a group of my local councils up here—the Great South Coast Group of councils. One of the priority items on their list was to talk to ministers and shadow ministers about is how we can improve the 457 visa system to bring more skilled people into our community. They are up here on behalf of our local community asking how the system can be improved, how it can be streamlined, how it can work better to bring people in. That is what my community is seeking. Yet what do we have here? We have a government so out of touch that they are doing exactly the opposite. They are making it harder. When we are looking to get workers for our abattoirs, when we are looking to get workers for our dairy farms, when we are looking to get medical staff for our hospitals, what will we be faced with?


We will be faced with an additional regulatory burden, not a situation which makes it easier for us to cope with these skill shortages. And let us not forget that, if you do not have the nurses and you cannot get the doctors and support staff from overseas, it places great risks on our local health services.


I think this is a problem which is not understood by this Gillard Labor government. This is a real area of need. We have to continue to get the workforce so that we can keep our medical facilities operating, especially in regional and rural areas. We need to build our own Australian medical workforce, but while we are doing that we need to ensure that we can fill the gaps, because if you do not fill the gaps then you place undue pressure on these services, which can lead to parts of them closing.


So this is a bad bill. Once you start to join the dots, what has occurred here is incredibly transparent. It is like one of those children's colouring books where you are given the dots and you have to get your pencil and just follow the dots to draw the picture. Here it is very easy to join the dots. This bill has come about because of an industrial dispute that the unions were on the wrong side of in February in Melbourne. They tried to take on a contractor who was legally using 457 visas that had been approved by this government. The AMWU tried to take it on. They lost. They went to Trades Hall. Trades Hall then said: 'Okay, federal Gillard government. If you want our continued support, we want action.' And what do we have here today? We have a bill which adds a regulatory burden on the use of 457 visas, with no evidence to support the idea that there should be an additional regulatory burden added to this area. It breaks what has been a very good bipartisan approach to bringing skilled migration into this country—an approach that we are going to need in the future because, as we continue to grow and develop as a nation, we are going to have to continue to bring skilled migrants into this country.


So in many ways what we are here debating today is shameful, and I feel sorry for those on the other side who, in their heart of hearts, know that as well—who know that this is a bill masquerading as something else, trying to cover up a broader problem that this government has. That broader problem is that it does not know how to run a properly functioning immigration system. This bill should be strongly opposed. I hope that more people on the other side will have the courage also to call this bill for what it is.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER

Mr Tehan:
  No, he can ask this question.




Mr JENKINS:
  I thank the member for Wannon. Without getting into the debate—because you cannot debate through a question—I ask the member for Wannon whether he believes that, in the case of the abattoirs and health services that he has talked about locally, it is appropriate that those that are employed under 457 visas get the same pay and conditions as Australians and, if so, how he believes that that should be regulated.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (10:04):  I thank the member for his question. It is a shame that he was not here at the very start of my speech, because the previous speaker on the government side on this bill, the member for Lyons, gave an example of an instance in Tasmania where there had been an issue and an employee had been exploited. Then he went through the story and gave the example of how it had been dealt with satisfactorily, how the worker had been back-paid some $88,000 and how the employer had been dealt with in having to pay that back pay. So he gave an example of how the system is working. So the reason we are here today is not to debate whether the system is working or not, because the example that the member for Lyons gave showed that it is working. What we are here debating today, and the whole point of my speech, is that this is nothing but a piece of legislation aimed at trying to fix a broader political problem that this government has, and that broader political problem is that it cannot run a functioning immigration system.


There is no evidence whatsoever to support this bill being in this place. As I indicated, over the last 12 months there have been 24 complaints, none of them—zero—referred on to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. There have been 24 complaints in 12 months, none reported on to the immigration department. This bill is here at the behest of the union movement because they saw a problem and they said to the Gillard government, 'We want you to fix this political problem for us.' It is a sham piece of legislation.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2013-06-20,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (09:26): In continuing from last night, I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013. Last night I said that I thought this was a disgraceful bill. It is a disgraceful bill because it is deliberately designed to crack down on what has been a successful program to date and there is no evidence that it has not been successful or has been rorted. Secondly, this is a disgraceful bill because it shatters the decades-long bipartisan support for skilled migration into this country.


I believe, and I said this last night, that good members of the Labor Party would be deeply embarrassed and indeed be ashamed about this bill. They would be ashamed because it actually abandons the values that they have held for a long time. They would be ashamed because it abandons the bipartisan support for skilled migration that has been so central to the economic and social success of this nation. I know that members on the other side of this chamber, such as Martin Ferguson, Robert McClelland, Simon Crean and even the former minister for immigration, Chris Bowen, would never have put forward a bill such as this one. I do not think that when it comes to voting on this bill they on the other side of the chamber will feel very proud at all that they will have to line up and vote for this disgraceful bill that has been put forward.


The bill itself is designed to completely strangle the 457 visa program in red tape. That is what it is designed to do. Make no bones about it. If there are visa rorts in this program then let us deal with them. Of course, Australians should get the jobs first and that should always be the case, but this is not about that. This bill is actually all about delivering for the unions because they have requested this bill be rushed into this parliament in the dying days of this government. We all know that if the unions say to the Labor Party, 'Jump,' then the Labor Party will say, 'How high?' They cannot bring this bill in quickly enough. I am sure they will attempt to guillotine it through this parliament later on today.


Why has the government said that we need this legislation which cracks down on 457 visas? Why have they said we need this? In essence they have given two reasons. The first is because they say the 457 visa program has been extensively rorted. The minister for immigration even gave a figure. He said that 10,000 visas have been rorted, which would constitute almost 10 per cent of the program. If that was the case, then, yes, we absolutely need to get on top of this program. But was there any evidence for this 10,000 figure? No, there was no evidence. Where did this figure come from? It transpired, after he announced this figure, that he had actually just made it up. That is right: he made up this figure and the immigration department officials, some of whom are in this chamber today, confirmed this to the Senate estimates. They said that they provided no such advice and could not provide any evidence to support that number.


When Tony Sheldon, a union leader, was asked how many 457 visa complaints he had received over the past 12 months—Tony Sheldon has been on this campaign to abolish the 457 visa program, or at least to crack down on it—do you know how many he said? Twenty-four. He had 24 in 12 months. So he is one of the key leaders out there saying, 'This is an outrage; it's being rorted on a daily basis,' and he has had 24 complaints. How many did he report to the immigration department? Zero. Twenty-four complaints, zero reported to the immigration department, and the immigration minister is running around saying there are 10,000 that have been rorted. It is a disgraceful, despicable act of this minister, who does not deserve to be in that high office.


The second reason the government has given for needing to crack down on the 457 visa process is they say there has been excessive growth in this program. They say we need to crack down on it because if there is excessive growth, then maybe it is out of control. Again, let us have a look at the numbers. What has been the growth rate between last year and this year? It has been 1.7 per cent. That constitutes 940 more visa holders this year versus last year. Nine hundred and forty, and they have the gall to come in and try to pass this bill because of that. About 940 people come in illegally on boats every few days, but they do not worry about that. But 940 additional applications this year compared to last year, and apparently that is a catastrophe.


We know what the Prime Minister said last year. Last year it was all hunky dory, all absolutely perfect because the Prime Minister herself said:


I believe we've got the visa settings right … with short-term 457 visas.


That was 12 months ago. The Prime Minister herself said that. But we have had 940 additional visa applications and apparently we need to completely crack down on this very successful program. Of course, if you were concerned about the rorting going on in the program—and if there is rorting, let us absolutely deal with it—you would not cut the compliance costs by 30 per cent, which is what this government have done since they came to office. They have cut the compliance cost by 30 per cent. This is not about dealing with rorts; this is squarely about dealing with an issue that the unions want. And when the unions want something, this government delivers.



My final point is that this is gross hypocrisy because we all know the Prime Minister herself employs a person on a 457 visa who did not go through their proposed process. (Time expired)

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2013-06-20,"



Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (09:37):  The purpose of this bill is to propose a package of measures that are aimed at eliminating the illegitimate use of subclass 457 visa program and other temporary sponsored visa programs. Together with proposed amendments to the Migration Regulations 1994 and other policy changes announced in February 2013, this bill presents a comprehensive package of reforms that would balance the interests of Australian workers with the need to strengthen the protection of overseas workers, so we stop people being ripped off, being exploited. This false argument that we have heard in this parliament in the past few days on this bill, which does not give any concern for Australian workers—but one would not expect much else from the Liberal Party, the Work Choices party! One would not expect anything else from them: these false arguments being proposed, the attacks on the minister—all this false stuff.


Importantly this bill gives powers to the Fair Work Ombudsman, the Fair Work inspectors, to monitor, investigate compliance with sponsorship obligations, and to ensure workers are working in their nominated occupation and being paid market salary rates. Well, what is wrong with that? There should not be anything wrong with that, but somehow it is wrong from the Liberal Party's point of view. We had a situation in northern Tasmania: a guy was sponsored into Australia to work in Queensland as a miner and he ended up working as a plasterer in Launceston when there were six or seven other plasterers walking around the streets looking for work. That sort of thing should not occur and there should be some monitoring of that. That is all this bill is asking.


There have been a number of cases recently, some of which have been reported in the press and some others anecdotally have come to my attention, that people have been employed on 457 visas, have been employed well below the award rates and have been made to work long hours without proper income. Only on Monday this week, a case was reported on the front page of the Launceston Examiner, and that was an underpayment of $88,000. So what we had there was someone using the legislation to employ people on lower rates. There is also the incidence where 457 visa holders are being employed, despite there being in an Australian, a Tasmanian, to undertake work that is being advertised. We have an unemployment rate in Tasmania of 7.3 per cent against a 5.6 per cent rate for the rest of the country.


This legislation will now require subclass 457 sponsors to undertake labour market testing in relation to a nominated occupation in a manner consistent with Australia's relevant international trade obligations to ensure that Australian citizens and permanent residents are given the first opportunities to apply for skilled vacancies in the domestic labour market. It is of concern that, at a time when the labour market has been flattening and some sectors and regions have experienced layoffs and increased unemployment, the subclass 457 program has continued to grow—and grow it has. In the last year, the number of primary 457 visa holders has risen by 20 per cent from 80,000 to 100,000, while employment growth has been just one per cent.


There are issues here that need to be dealt with and this bill deals with them. I have real concerns that some employers are turning to overseas workers first, rather than investing in local training and local recruitment—of course, that is a whole other area about training the Australian workforce. There have also been a growing number of low-skilled industries and occupations such as retail and hospitality, while in the IT industry growth in the use of 457 visa holders has been accompanied by lower than average wages, which is the opposite of what you would expect if there were some genuine skill shortages. You would not expect lower than average wages to apply. We have considerable evidence that some sponsors are paying overseas workers below the market rate, undercutting Australians, failing to commit to the training requirements of the program and using the visas fraudulently to help family and friends migrate.


The purpose of this bill is to propose a package of integrity measures that seek to enhance the government's ability to eliminate rorts in the subclass 457 visa program and of course other temporary sponsored visa programs. Together with proposed amendments to Migration Regulations 1994, this bill represents a comprehensive package of reforms which will balance the interests of Australian workers with the need to strengthen the protection of overseas workers. We do not want people coming here on 457 visas and being exploited—well, this side of the House does not.


This bill amends the Migration Regulations 1994 to extend the period from 28 days to 90 consecutive days, enabling a more socially just outcome for visa holders as they have more time to find other jobs and to arrange their personal affairs at the conclusion of their sponsored employment. It is felt that they need to complement the reforms to the migration regulations announced in February this year. The bill will enshrine in the Migration Act the kind of sponsorship obligations which must be made by the regulations. Employers must ensure equivalent terms and conditions of employment—including payment of a market salary rate—keep certain records and provide records and information to the department and cooperate with the inspectors. These new sponsorship obligations come into effect on 1 July of this year. The obligations need to meet training requirements for the term of sponsorship approval, with no transfer, charge or recovery of certain costs from sponsored visa holders, and restrict on-hiring arrangements. These will be spelled out in the Migration Regulations 1994 and are scheduled to come into effect on 1 July this year.


There is an enforcement framework to bar or cancel the approval of a person as a sponsor with an infringement notice and a civil penalty scheme, which would be enforceable in court. This amendment will allow the minister to publish enforcement undertakings on the department's website. This is an important tool to encourage compliance by all sponsors and is a means of providing transparency to the Australian public on the monitoring of sponsors. It will get a bit of transparency in there and will not let people rip people off without having their name exposed for doing it. There seems to be reluctance on the other side of the House to want that to happen.


Importantly, the bill gives power to the Fair Work Ombudsman to monitor and investigate compliance with sponsorship obligations to ensure workers are working in their nominated occupation and are being paid market salary rates. By doing so, the government's capacity to monitor sponsors will increase from 33 active inspectors to over 300 inspectors. The government has always said that the subclass 457 visa program, where used genuinely, plays an important role in supplying skilled labour, when such labour is unavailable in the local workforce. It is intended to allow employers to quickly supplement the Australian labour market.


These bills seek to realign the program to ensure that it is only used when genuine skills shortages exist, to ensure a balance between considering the interests of employers, the Australian domestic labour force, and strengthening protection for overseas workers. It is worth noting that there has been an increase in the visa application charge from $455 to $900, and as announced in the 2013-14 budget, consideration was also given to increasing the nomination fee for each 457 position from $85 to $330. It is really about getting that balance, and the balance is not right at the moment. People are being ripped off.


Australian workers are missing out on jobs that they should have access to. There are jobs that should be advertised better. We have had these debates about the mining industry as well. I think there should be a lot more transparency in the way jobs are advertised in Australia. I have had people say to me that they have every ticket under the sun, they have applied to many websites to get jobs in the mining industry in Australia, they are quite free to travel and to live in mining communities, yet they just do not have access and they get nothing back from applications put in through websites. So there is something happening in this country which is not working properly in the field, and then you have employers sponsoring people to come in from overseas. And then we have this total exploitation taking place, as I mentioned, which was run on the front page of the Tasmanian Examiner on Monday—not a paper which one would say was a Labor radical paper in any way but it certainly got into telling the story about somebody who was in the fast food business and was brought into Australia from China. That person is going to receive $90,000 in back pay as a result of underpayment. That is what the Fair Work Ombudsman's report claimed. The story goes on to highlight that the gentleman involved was made to sign false pay slips, was forced to work enormous amounts of hours as a cook and then had to put his name to false documentation. He did not have a lot of good English so it was very difficult for him to stand up to the exploitation, but inspectors were able to do that. I guess it is about having an inspector with time to do the work and to be able to talk to people about that. It was about being forced to sign documentation which was not true and was not a true reflection of what the proper case was. So here is a prime example in Tasmania of exploitation of a 457 visa person working there. I do not know, given the unemployment rate of 7.5 per cent, if there are any chefs or cooks in Tasmania looking for work but I think there probably are.


So I think there is a great deal of need for this bill to rectify some of the problems. It concerns me greatly that the party of Work Choices do not seem to think that this is a major issue in Australia. I believe it is and I believe it needs to be rectified. I believe that the minister responsible for this bill is endeavouring to do that so I ask the House to give full support to this bill.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (09:48):  I think the member for Lyons has really put the argument very succinctly as to why the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013 is not necessary. He has given us an example of where there has been a problem with the current system, and we are talking about the current system before this legislation had been put in place. So what has happened? The matter was looked at, it was addressed and it was dealt with. So it has been fixed without this bill, which is another clear example of why this bill is unnecessary and should not be here before us today.


Let us go back and see what has led to this bill being in parliament. I think that we should rename this bill, calling it the City West Water Bill. For those of us who cannot remember it, in February there was a dispute in Melbourne where the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union took offence at 457 visa holders, Filipinos, who were working in skilled positions constructing a water facility in Werribee. They put in place a community picket line—and we are about to see whether the AMWU were behind that community picket line or not. All of the evidence points out that the AMWU did instigate that picket line, but anyway the courts will decide whether it was a union picket line or a community picket line. In the end what happened to break that picket line was that the state government stood firm and it made sure that the water authorities, City West Water and Melbourne Water, acted. It took the water authorities a little bit of time to act. The union movement thought that they would not act and they thought the authorities would just cower and would not take unions on, but the Victorian state government—and, in particular, the then Premier, Ted Baillieu—stood very firm and insisted that the water authorities do the right thing, which they did. The workers were flown in by helicopter and ultimately the picket line was dismantled.


But the AMWU did not want to leave the matter there so they went to Victorian Trades Hall and said, 'We've got an issue with regards to 457 workers. We don't want them anymore doing these skilled jobs.' So Trades Hall then put out a pronouncement saying that if the union movement in Victoria were to get strongly behind this federal Labor government one of the conditions would be that something be done about 457 visas. So Trades Hall said, 'It's up to you, federal government. If you want additional support you do something in this area.' That is why we are here today debating this bill. It has nothing to do with evidence, it has nothing to do with facts and it has everything to do with this Labor government being dictated to by the union movement.


It is a sad state of affairs when you have a Prime Minister, desperately clinging to power, who is prepared to put the national interest over here and act in her own base political interest to try to hang on to her prime ministership. There are reports today that it is still not going to work for her, because the key ally of the union movement in this place, Bill Shorten, is meant to be off talking to the unions to see whether they should continue to support this Prime Minister or whether they should switch camps. We have a piece of legislation before us which will do nothing for this nation. As a matter of fact, it will set the cause of this nation back, all because we have a Prime Minister clinging desperately to power, hoping that the union movement will continue to back her.

That is right: 24 complaints in 12 months and zero passed on to the immigration department. Those facts say it all. It shows what an absolute sham piece of legislation this is.


And it is worse than that, because it is adding a regulatory impact on those employers who are using this system to fill skills gaps, and there is a real need for us to continue to fill skills gaps in this country. One of the sad things about this bill is that until now there has been broad bipartisanship for the 457 visa system and for using skilled migration in this country. I take this opportunity to once again thank the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, for the support he gave to one of my local communities in Warrnambool. Six families who had come in under 457 visas, because of some issues with regard to meeting English language proficiency, might have been sent back to where they came from—in this case, China—but the minister was prepared to intervene. The six workers had worked in the local abattoir for over five years and their families had been through the local schools. Minister Bowen, to his credit, intervened and made sure that those families could stay and continue to work in our community and participate in our community. 


That is the type of bipartisan approach to 457 visas that we have seen historically. Yet, sadly, with this Prime Minister desperately clinging to power, at the behest of the union movement we see a bill like this come into this place. We on this side know that most of the good people on the other side do not support it. They have said that publicly. They do not think that this is a good piece of legislation. They know that this is a piece of legislation aimed at trying to address a problem which does not exist.


It is a great pity we are here today examining this bill, spending time on this bill, because it will add a regulatory burden on employers. We know that it will because the government refused to have a regulatory impact statement done on it. Why would they refuse to have a regulatory impact statement done on this bill? Because they know, and it is there for all to see, that it will add to the burden of employers trying to bring skilled workers into this country. And it is not as if this is a rare piece of legislation that will be adding a regulatory burden. We have seen over the course of the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments over 21,000 pieces of legislation which have added a regulatory burden for employers. This is just another one to add to this list.


The real shame is that there is a real need for the 457 visa system. Just this week I have had a group of my local councils up here—the Great South Coast Group of councils. One of the priority items on their list was to talk to ministers and shadow ministers about is how we can improve the 457 visa system to bring more skilled people into our community. They are up here on behalf of our local community asking how the system can be improved, how it can be streamlined, how it can work better to bring people in. That is what my community is seeking. Yet what do we have here? We have a government so out of touch that they are doing exactly the opposite. They are making it harder. When we are looking to get workers for our abattoirs, when we are looking to get workers for our dairy farms, when we are looking to get medical staff for our hospitals, what will we be faced with?


We will be faced with an additional regulatory burden, not a situation which makes it easier for us to cope with these skill shortages. And let us not forget that, if you do not have the nurses and you cannot get the doctors and support staff from overseas, it places great risks on our local health services.


I think this is a problem which is not understood by this Gillard Labor government. This is a real area of need. We have to continue to get the workforce so that we can keep our medical facilities operating, especially in regional and rural areas. We need to build our own Australian medical workforce, but while we are doing that we need to ensure that we can fill the gaps, because if you do not fill the gaps then you place undue pressure on these services, which can lead to parts of them closing.


So this is a bad bill. Once you start to join the dots, what has occurred here is incredibly transparent. It is like one of those children's colouring books where you are given the dots and you have to get your pencil and just follow the dots to draw the picture. Here it is very easy to join the dots. This bill has come about because of an industrial dispute that the unions were on the wrong side of in February in Melbourne. They tried to take on a contractor who was legally using 457 visas that had been approved by this government. The AMWU tried to take it on. They lost. They went to Trades Hall. Trades Hall then said: 'Okay, federal Gillard government. If you want our continued support, we want action.' And what do we have here today? We have a bill which adds a regulatory burden on the use of 457 visas, with no evidence to support the idea that there should be an additional regulatory burden added to this area. It breaks what has been a very good bipartisan approach to bringing skilled migration into this country—an approach that we are going to need in the future because, as we continue to grow and develop as a nation, we are going to have to continue to bring skilled migrants into this country.


So in many ways what we are here debating today is shameful, and I feel sorry for those on the other side who, in their heart of hearts, know that as well—who know that this is a bill masquerading as something else, trying to cover up a broader problem that this government has. That broader problem is that it does not know how to run a properly functioning immigration system. This bill should be strongly opposed. I hope that more people on the other side will have the courage also to call this bill for what it is.

  I thank the member for Wannon. Without getting into the debate—because you cannot debate through a question—I ask the member for Wannon whether he believes that, in the case of the abattoirs and health services that he has talked about locally, it is appropriate that those that are employed under 457 visas get the same pay and conditions as Australians and, if so, how he believes that that should be regulated.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (10:04):  I thank the member for his question. It is a shame that he was not here at the very start of my speech, because the previous speaker on the government side on this bill, the member for Lyons, gave an example of an instance in Tasmania where there had been an issue and an employee had been exploited. Then he went through the story and gave the example of how it had been dealt with satisfactorily, how the worker had been back-paid some $88,000 and how the employer had been dealt with in having to pay that back pay. So he gave an example of how the system is working. So the reason we are here today is not to debate whether the system is working or not, because the example that the member for Lyons gave showed that it is working. What we are here debating today, and the whole point of my speech, is that this is nothing but a piece of legislation aimed at trying to fix a broader political problem that this government has, and that broader political problem is that it cannot run a functioning immigration system.


There is no evidence whatsoever to support this bill being in this place. As I indicated, over the last 12 months there have been 24 complaints, none of them—zero—referred on to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. There have been 24 complaints in 12 months, none reported on to the immigration department. This bill is here at the behest of the union movement because they saw a problem and they said to the Gillard government, 'We want you to fix this political problem for us.' It is a sham piece of legislation.

 (Ryan) (13:45):  I am very proud to announce that the University of Queensland Pipe Band at Emmanuel College has retained its grade 4 champions title following the 2013 Queensland Pipe Band Championships recently held in Ipswich. The band took out first place from a field of 13 bands representing Queensland and New South Wales to be named Queensland grade 4 champions for the second year in a row. The band will now go on to compete at the World Pipe Band Championships in Glasgow, Scotland, in August. Pipe Major Andrew McCabe said 


Learning a specialised instrument like the bagpipes takes many years of practice and for any piper or drummer in Queensland to have the opportunity to compete at the World Championships is, for many, a once in a lifetime experience.


The band won the Queensland pipe association trophy, the Donald Mackie Trophy for best pipe corps and the Best Medley Performance award in grade 4. The University of Queensland Pipe Band is under the patronage of Emmanuel College principal Professor Stewart Gill, and he says the band is excited about representing the university, the college and, indeed, the Queensland community at the world championships.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:01):  I move:


That the House express its deep regret at the death on 19 June 2013 of the Honourable William Michael Hodgman AM QC, a former Minister and Member of this House for the Division of Denison from 1975 to 1987, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


All members will mourn the loss of one of the most colourful figures in modern Australian politics, Michael Hodgman, who passed away yesterday at the age of 74. Mr Hodgman enjoyed one of the longest and most extraordinary careers since Billy Hughes. He entered politics at just 27 years old soon after Menzies stepped down from the prime ministership, beginning a career that continued over five decades and saw him elected to three chambers in two parliaments, defeated on three occasions but restored successfully to the fray each time.


Mr Hodgman was the great-nephew, son, brother and father of politicians. The calling of public life ran in his veins, and he did it well. But politics was just one strand of a life that left one wondering how he could possibly fit it all in. Michael Hodgman was a successful barrister who took silk, a Navy reservist, an avid sportsman and punter, a gentleman larrikin with a story always on his lips and a twinkle in his eye. Michael Hodgman was a splendid old-style orator, and the Hansard bears witness to that.


He also had a fine sense of humour. When called upon to represent the notorious Chopper Read, Michael gave him a Liberal Party tie to wear in court—and, yes, maybe it was a blue one! One news headline called Michael Hodgman 'the Laughing Cavalier', and at times it almost seemed he belonged in Regency England or the days of King Charles II. But Tasmania was his stage, and he strutted that stage with real affection for the island state and for its people—so much so that, as a member in this place, he was famously called a 'Mouth from the South'.


Michael Hodgman also loved the Liberal Party, and he proclaimed that faith to the last in his farewell speech three years ago along with his faith in another institution: the monarchy. But he was a Liberal of both the large-L and small-L kind. One moment he might be supporting traditional conservative policies, but at another he could be decrying the invasion of East Timor or opposing the flooding of Lake Pedder—a true old-style Liberal.


In the end Michael Hodgman also proved to be something else: a man of courage. More than a decade ago he was given the worst possible news: that he had emphysema, a disease that no-one could cure. It is reported that on the day of his diagnosis he went to see his brother Peter and said: 'I've got bad news and good news. The bad news is I'm going to die. The good news is not yet.' Told he would last three years, he survived 14, most of that time still active in politics, where he was able to share the floor of the Tasmanian House of Assembly with his son, Will—a rare feat in any Westminster democracy.


Sadly, emphysema compounded with Alzheimer's finally accomplished its awful work, and Michael Hodgman's grand life came to an end yesterday in Hobart. On behalf of all Australians I extend my sincere condolences to his family, friends and colleagues. We pay tribute to Michael Hodgman's remarkable life and, in death, we remember him with gratitude and with respect.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:05):  I thank the Prime Minister for her fine speech in tribute of a great Australian and a great Liberal. Like her, I rise to support Michael Hodgman, the so-called 'Mouth from the South' who nevertheless has not been stilled, because his voice still echoes around our nation in the form of his son, Will, who I hope might soon become the next Premier of Tasmania.


Although Michael was much more than a member of parliament, he certainly was a parliamentarian of rare distinction. He served a span of 43 years in total in state and national parliament, including 12 years in this place and three years as a minister. As the Prime Minister has mentioned, his great-uncle, his father, his brother and his son all served in state or national parliaments, so it is a family tradition to be dedicated to the service of our nation just as his life was dedicated to the service of our community.


He did have high standards; he once joked that he drew the line at serving in the Senate!



Government members interjecting—




Mr ABBOTT:
  I see members opposite agree! At different times in his life he was a barrister, a sailor, a boxer and a jockey as well as a long-serving member of parliament.


He not only defended Chopper Read for free, but did him the honour of giving him, as the Prime Minister has mentioned, a Liberal Party tie. Who said the Liberal Party is not a broad church! He was a character in an era of blander and safer politics.


We grieve with his family, including his brother Patrick who is in the gallery today, I believe. We cherish his memory and we will do our best to do him proud by working for the election of his son as the Premier of Tasmania.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (15:11):  On indulgence—on 27 May 2013 the member for Tangney raised a matter of privilege concerning the possible provision of false or misleading evidence by Mr Tom Burbidge of Lockheed Martin Corporation during an appearance before the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Mr Burbidge's testimony concerned the Joint Strike Fighter Program and was provided on 20 March 2012 during the committee's review of the Defence annual report of 2010-11.


Speaker, you responded to the member for Tangney by advising that, prior to you giving the matter consideration, it should be brought to the attention of the committee and dealt with there. On behalf of the committee I wish to advise you of the outcome of the committee's deliberations on this matter.


Prior to Dr Jensen's statement here, the Defence Subcommittee, of which Dr Jensen is the deputy chair, had concluded its examination of this matter. At its meeting on 12 March 2013 the subcommittee invited a response to Dr Jensen's concerns from the Chief Executive Officer and President of Lockheed Martin Corporation, Ms Marillyn A Hewson. The subcommittee inquired if, in retrospect to and in light of a December 2012 report on the joint strike fighter by the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, which was brought to the members' attention by Dr Jensen, the company endorses Mr Burbidge's testimony to the committee. Ms Hewson responded in correspondence dated 16 April 2013 by saying that Lockheed Martin: 


… believes that Mr Burbidge's statements were accurate in all material aspects.


Ms Hewson went on to state:


We recognise the possibility that various statements contained in these materials could create a misunderstanding. We therefore hope to dispel any such misunderstandings with the clarifications included herein.


The correspondence goes on to clarify the distinction between 'Key Performance Parameters' and other performance capabilities, and responds to the three specific issues—acceleration, sustained turn performance and weight—which were raised by Dr Jensen and that could appear to be contradicted by information contained in the operational test and evaluation report. 


The Defence Subcommittee considered Ms Hewson's response and Dr Jensen's critique of her correspondence at its meeting on 16 May 2013. Speaker, the view of the subcommittee is that a prima facie case for the alleged contempt had not been established. I should note that Dr Jensen alone dissented on that question. The subcommittee formed the view that it had not been deliberately misled or presented with false evidence by Mr Burbidge. Further, the subcommittee formally resolved not to proceed with the privilege matter canvassed by Dr Jensen and, importantly, not to authorise publication of the correspondence from Lockheed Martin. The full committee has now also considered this matter. The committee agrees with the decision of the defence subcommittee.


There is another important issue in connection with this matter that I wish to refer to. In raising the privilege matter the member for Tangney presented papers to the House, including correspondence by the chair of the subcommittee and Lockheed Martin. The defence subcommittee had previously asked Lockheed Martin if it would give permission for its correspondence to be published. The company subsequently asked that its correspondence not be published. Choosing to respect the company's wishes, the subcommittee resolved that the correspondence would not be authorised for publication. Regardless, Dr Jensen presented the correspondence in the House when he raised the matter of privilege. The effect of this was to disclose the documents, which are now, of course, publicly available.


I can advise that the committee has decided not to raise a matter of privilege in relation to the member for Tangney's unauthorised disclosures, because it does not feel or consider that the conduct constitutes a substantial interference in its work. Nevertheless, the committee notes that the unauthorised disclosure of correspondence was contrary to the expressed wishes of the defence subcommittee and breaches the undertaking made to the company with which it was corresponding in good faith. This, the committee believes, is deeply regrettable. The committee is disappointed that a member has chosen to act in such a regrettable manner and expresses concern over the dangerous precedent such conduct could set.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2013-06-20,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (15:53):  Today is World Refugee Day and I think it is important that in this place today we acknowledge that. There are 10½ million people classified by the UNHCR as refugees—men, women, children, mums, dads, sisters, brothers, grandparents; 10½ million people under the mandate of the UNHCR under the refugee convention. These are 10½ million people whose lives have been uprooted by violence, by hate and by persecution. There were 12½ million such people 10 years ago when the Howard government was dealing with the issues on our borders to the north. In the most recent report that has been provided by the UNHCR, it is disturbing to note that the most significant increase in that figure to 10.5 million people, in terms of refugees defined by the UNHCR, is the increase out of Syria. I am sure all members of this House would agree about the seriousness of that situation and would be grieved at the situation in Syria and the increase in the numbers of people now being defined as refugees coming out of Syria. There were 19,900 in the previous report, and in this report there are 728,218. These are deeply disturbing numbers. These are numbers that have not played into the things we are seeing to our north, but they are part of the global issue that relates to the matters of world refugees. We have had many debates in this place on this issue, but there is one thing I am sure is true: whatever position you take on how the matters of our border protection should be addressed, I am quite confident that, in this place at least, members of this House come to the issue with a concern for people.


On World Refugee Day, we need to acknowledge that. We may differ, and we do differ—we differ significantly on how this matter should be addressed in terms of our border protection but, putting that matter in its context, the broader global issue is one that I think we all understand and on this day I think that it is important we note it. Important in the debate that follows on from that, when it comes to refugees, is the debate about asylum seekers who are seeking to come to Australia.


The sad truth about the 10½ million people—or 10.4 million in the previous report—that are defined as refugees is that 99 per cent of those around the world will never see a resettlement outcome. One of the things that need to inform this debate is the notion of resettlement in Australia. No matter how many numbers of places there are in Australia, less than one per cent of people are going to be resettled around the world. Resettlement is not the global answer, and anyone who suggests so has very little knowledge of this topic. It does not matter what, frankly, the intake is from Australia: unless it is 10.5 million together with our other major partners who undertake resettlement around the world we are going to fall well short.


The answer to the global refugee problem is over there, but the answer to the issues we are having on our borders is over here. That is the difference in this debate. We can stand as members of this place and we can acknowledge the global humanitarian stain of the issue of refugees, and it has been with us for all time, sadly. We can stand proudly in this place and acknowledge that 700,000 refugees have been resettled in Australia since the Second World War. That is something that we can all commend. We can commend those people who work in our community in the settlement services program, which enjoys bipartisan support in this place. We can commend the work they do trying to resettle legitimate refugees into our community, and helping them on the pathway to a sustainable life here in Australia—a happy life, a safe life, a peaceful life, a prosperous life. That is the thing that Australians should commend themselves on today, because we are a generous nation. But we are not mugs. It is World Refugee Day today but, sadly, every day under this government is People Smugglers' Day.


On the issue of border protection—and that is why I have sought to distinguish these issues very clearly—this is a government that has failed us like none other. I am proud, like other members who sit on this side of the House, and as a member of the Liberal Party in particular, to be part of a party that in 1951 signed the refugee convention under Prime Minister Robert Menzies. There were 1.5 million refugees at that time. There are 10.5 million today. A lot has changed since then and, frankly, a lot has changed as to how the refugee convention is now contorted and interpreted and used—whether it is by advocates or by the smugglers themselves—and how it is interpreted in the courts, which I think goes well beyond the original intention of that document which was signed by the Menzies government. That is a debate that I am sure will continue. That is a debate the coalition participated in and one we have expressed great reservations over. Significantly, the issue we face in this country is people who move beyond their country of first asylum, their secondary movement from one place into our region and then on to Australia.


The Indochinese refugee crisis was a very different situation, which the father of the House will remember well—he was in this place when the matter was addressed, as part of the Fraser government. It was a genuine regional problem generated from within our region with people directly fleeing from within our region. The Fraser government responded and should be commended for doing that. I am sure that an Abbott government would respond in the same way if we were faced with a similar regional crisis. But we are not faced with a regional crisis; we are faced with a people-smuggling crisis and that is something this government has failed to understand from the outset.


Of course, it was the Howard government that stopped the boats and stopped the business of the people smugglers. I say in response to the Prime Minister, if she wants three words about the Howard government's plan, it is this: it did work. They are the three words she should understand about the stop-the-boats policies of the Howard government: they did work, whether it was turning back the boats where it was safe to do so, whether it was temporary protection visas, whether it was the offshore processing or whether it was establishing the Bali process. The Bali process was focused under the Howard government as a regional deterrence framework, not a regional accommodation framework, which is what we get from the government today. The government has taken that Bali process off course, turning to regional processing hubs and magnets to draw even more people into the region. The coalition have a very different view—that is, deterrence. We believe deterrence works because it did and it will again, and that is the nature of our policy.


The record of this government is that it has taken a different approach. The first immigration minister this government had described as his proudest day the abolition of the Pacific solution, the abolition of temporary protection visas and the turning back of the promise of the then opposition leader, Mr Rudd, who became the Prime Minister. Mr Rudd promised before the 2007 election he would turn boats back and then recanted on that when he came to office and abolished those policies.


In 2007-08 there were 25 people who turned up on three boats, an average of two per month. In November 2007 there were just four people in detention who had arrived by boat. The budget for managing illegal arrivals by boat was $85 million and 4,706 people received offshore humanitarian visas. After applying offshore, they were granted the visas and, combined with the refugee program, the offshore component of our refugee humanitarian program was over 75 per cent of the total intake. What do we see today? We see 24,824 people have arrived this financial year illegally by boat. We are now at a rate up from two per month to more than 3,000 per month. More than 23,000 people are now in the system. And I expect there are many more since that figure was advised in Senate estimates, who are in the system today and who arrived illegally by boat, up from four when this government started.


The budget is up from $85 million to $2.9 billion next year, as we learned today. That is based on an average monthly arrival of 1,000. Today we are operating at an average monthly arrival of over 3,000. So in 10 days time a miracle is going to occur. The number of illegal arrivals to Australia by boat is going to fall by two-thirds in 10 days. That question was put to the Treasurer today. He said he stood by that forecast. It is absurd. That level of delusion and denial by the government on this issue is their greatest area of failure. They simply do not get it. They simply do not believe in the responses that are necessary to address it. It is a failure of resolve. It is a failure of belief in the policies that worked. That is why they abolished them and that is why they will not return them.


Sadly, there is the reduction in those who are receiving offshore humanitarian visas under this government. It fell from over 4,700 in 2007-08 to 714 last year, in 2011-12. Less than half for the first time in our refugee and humanitarian program; the offshore humanitarian program established by the Fraser government, and for the first time less than half those have come from applications offshore. That is a great shame and I think that is a great indictment of the performance of this government.


The minister will tell you that he has increased the intake to 20,000, and so there will be more. But what he neglects to tell people is that the 20,000 figure that the minister is using includes all the visas he would hand out to people who arrive illegally by boat. Now, 25,000 are likely to turn up this financial year, so he is already on a 5,000 deficit for a start. Where that leaves all of those 40,000-odd who are applying around the world for these places in the orderly process I do not know.


But the difference with the coalition policy is this: of the 13,750 visas that we have committed to, not one of those will go to someone who arrives illegally by boat. Not one! Temporary protection visas are not part of that quota. We will not be dipping into the quota for people who are applying offshore, which will include those coming from Syria. It will include those who are still in Iraq, it will include those in Afghanistan, it will include those in Malaysia and it will even include those in Indonesia and in the Thai camps, where many of our members have visited—the member for Brisbane has visited those camps. We will not be dipping into their visas to deal with Labor's mess that they have left on our borders, if we are elected later this year. But this government will. They will continue to take those visas any which way they can.


We know the failures; we know that more than a thousand people are dead. We know there are more people arriving by boats claiming asylum than arrive by plane claiming asylum—that was achieved last year for the first time ever. We know of the asylum freeze under Prime Minister Rudd that laid the platform for the riots that occurred. We know that despite the promises of the then minister that he would come down tough, that just one person, I think, ultimately had their visas rejected. We know about the East Timor farce. We know about the solution that was heralded before the last election—the last time the Prime Minister got agitated about this issue. She goes out there and makes commitments before the election, and we see her doing the same thing today.


We know about the Malaysian people flop, and we know about it because this minister and this government know that they have no policy on the Malaysian people flop. He could tell me, if he can, in his response where the Malaysian government's agreement is to the recommendation from the Houston panel to include the protections they said were necessary to proceed with the agreement. The minister opposite knows this; there is no such agreement. They do not agree to it. I know they do not agree to it because his predecessor told me. His predecessor informed me and the shadow foreign affairs minister that they would not agree to legally-binding protections for people sent to Malaysia. So the Malaysian people swap is a mirage—it does not exist! They have nothing to put on the table when it comes to that issue, other than to wave it around as an excuse to do absolutely nothing. Nothing! Absolutely nothing!


We have the Captain Emad farce—and I could not go through this MPI, of course, without mentioning Captain Emad.



An opposition member:  And his family.




Mr MORRISON:
  He sailed in and he flew out, and the government was none the wiser either way. But his family remains in public housing here in the ACT.


There is the community-dumping policy. But Mr Deputy Speaker, know this: the coalition has the resolve and the coalition has the policies, and it will get done. We cannot afford another three years of the failures under this government; the cost, the chaos and the tragedy that has followed from their decisions. They can go and look their electors in the eye and explain to them the cost, the chaos and the tragedy. After six years, the Australian people have had enough; they want a change and they know that the coalition can deliver that change on 14 September.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2013-06-20,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton—Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (16:09):  I rise to respond to the member for Cook. Firstly, I would like also to reflect on Refugee Day today. I think it is important that the parliament recognise a very important day for refugees around the world. In fact, on Saturday I was at an event recognising our 800,000th refugee—just in excess of what was referred to by the member for Cook—arriving and being settled in Australia since World War II. It is a remarkable figure. Eight hundred thousand of eight million people that have come to this country—so approximately 10 per cent of the intake of people we have had—are refugees who have built this country, who have made this place their home, who have made this country better and bigger than it was and who have contributed in a way of which we can all be proud. We have a great record in responding to people who are in danger, providing a haven for people who might be fleeing persecution, and that record should not be denied. I agree with the member for Cook insofar as us recognising that.


I also think it is important to talk about the level of displacement. The member for Cook talks about a figure in excess of 10 million. In fact, beyond even the determined or approximated number for refugees, there are—according to the UNHCR—45.2 million around the world in situations of displacement, meaning that more people are refugees or internally displaced than at any point since 1994. In this place yesterday, I believe—certainly in this week—the member for McMillan went to the comments in The Guardianfrom the UK from authors Oliver Laughland and Nick Evershed. They go to the issues of numbers. They talk about the fact that there were 1.1 million new refugees around the world in 2012, the highest rise in new refugee numbers since 1999. They also show that the annual UNHCR global trends in displacement report highlights that last year 7.6 million people were newly displaced due to conflict or persecution. On an average day in 2012—so in one average day last year—23,000 people were forced to flee their homes around the world, which is more than the total number of people claiming asylum in Australia for the entire year. So around the world there were 23,000 people displaced, which is higher than those that are looking to claim asylum in an entire year in Australia. That is a remarkable, and quite frightening, number of people in such an awful situation. The statistics also reveal that Australia had 0.3 per cent of the world's refugees at the end of 2012, or just over 30,000. Pakistan had the highest number of refugees, with 1,638,456—which is nearly 17 per cent of the world's total—and Australia had 2.14 per cent of the world's asylum seekers at the end of 2012, with just over 20,000. South Africa, for example, had the highest number, with 230,442, constituting 24.6 per cent of the total number of asylum seekers globally. In the case of comparing us with South Africa, you can see the challenges they have in dealing with more than tenfold the number that we have to deal with. 


I think that sometimes gets lost in this debate. This is a global problem, this is an international challenge, and, so far as our own region goes, it is a regional challenge requiring a regional response. It is important, therefore, that if we are to do this successfully and see a reduction or cessation in vessels arriving in such a manner, if we are going to see fewer people endangering their lives, then we do need to have the compact with the region. We do need, through the Bali process, to find ways to do that. That is not an easy thing to do—no one is suggesting that from this side of the House. There has been a view that if we coin a slogan we can realise a solution, but I think that it is just disingenuous and dishonest to suggest that. That is what the opposition have done for over three years—coin a slogan and suggest that somehow they have got a fi The interesting thing is that nobody agrees with them. The experts do not agree with them. The agencies of government that advised the Howard government do not agree with them. No eminent person or person with experience in border protection, refugee settlement or diplomatic matters has come out and agreed with the opposition leader, because it is a fraud. The 'turn back the boats' policy is an element of the 'stop the boats' fraud. Their 'turn back the boats' policy does not exist except in the minds of those opposite. The opposition leader pretends that he has a 'turn back the boats' policy. What does he have? 


The former immigration minister is here in the House. I know he sits through every debate, living through some glory days. The fact is that he knows that, without the agreement of Indonesia, it cannot work. He knows that and he also knows that the discussions that have occurred between the opposition and the Indonesian government have not gone to the issues of turning back the boats, because they will not raise it, because they know the President will say no. We have had the Vice President of Indonesia say, 'We're not going to support the ""turn back the boats"" policy.' We have had the ambassador for Indonesia say, 'We won't be supporting the ""turn back the boats"" policy.' We have had the foreign minister of Indonesia say, 'We won't support the ""turn back the boats"" policy.' We have had a former admiral of the Navy say that, if we were to embark on this mission, we would be endangering the lives of naval personnel. We know the dangers that are likely to occur if we are to turn people back on the high seas in the manner in which the opposition are suggesting.


During the last election, we saw the opposition leader say he would have a 'boat' phone sitting on his desk so he can pick up the phone and call the master of the vessel and tell them to the turn back that boat. What a brave opposition leader that would be, sitting behind a desk on a 'boat' phone and telling people who are the ones who have to deal with these matters how to conduct an operation.


Judi Moylan, I think, gave an honourable speech in her valedictory this week and I was witness to her contribution. She has been a fine member of parliament. She quite rightly pointed to the fact that that policy will endanger the lives of men, women and children. She made it very, very clear that to suggest that we return vessels in that manner is unconscionable. It is dangerous not only to those on the vessel, because of the likelihood of sabotage, but also for our own naval and Customs personnel. We saw that with SIEV36, where there was an effort to sabotage that vessel. Five people died in April 2009 and others could have died too, including our own personnel. Of course, it is foolish for the opposition to suggest otherwise.


We have also seen a change insofar as the opposition suggesting it can stop the boats. I refer to an interview given by the member for Cook on 13 March 2013. In this interview there were two interviewers but the person asking the questions was Mr Andrew Bolt—who I would not say was an enemy of the opposition but a dear friend of the opposition. On five occasions he asked the member for Cook when we will see the boats stop if they are elected. The member for Cook gave five answers. His first answer was, 'I don't put time frames on this.' That was a good answer. So it is now: 'Stop the boats. I don't put time frames on it.' His second answer was, 'I'm not making such forecasts.' So it is now: 'Stop the boats. I'm not making such forecasts.' His third answer was, 'We'd like to see it happen as soon as possible.' So, it is now, 'Stop the boats,' and the subtitle is, 'We'd like to see it happen as soon as possible.' His fourth answer was, 'I'll let you interpret what it means.' So now: 'Stop the boats. But you can interpret what that means.' Andrew Bolt was just trying to get an answer out of the shadow minister and he asked, 'When are you going to stop the boats?' His fifth answer was, 'That's what we're attempting.' 


We know why the member for Cook went on that show. He thought that Andrew Bolt was going to say: 'How are you going to solve this? You are remarkable people. You're going to fix all these things.' He did not expect to be asked the question, 'How are you going to stop the boats'. He asked him five times. On each occasion he could not answer because he does not know how to stop the boats or when the boats will stop under those policies because not one agency in this country supports the proposition put by the opposition leader that you can turn back the boats. Nobody supports the proposition put by the opposition. It is a slogan. It is unworkable. It is unsafe.


It was quite right that Judi Moylan raised concerns about these issues. We can have this banter across the table, but the reality is these are very serious issues. The only way there is going to be a sustainable solution to this issue is by having a compact of countries of origin, transit and destination. The only way that can happen is engaging responsibly, not saying one thing privately to them and coming out and publically verballing people from another country. Not going, as the member for Cook did, to Malaysia, standing up, talking to the media and traducing the reputation of Malaysia while on its own soil; not attacking Malaysia in the way he did.


If he thinks he is going to have some relationship—if he is ever appointed a minister; if they are ever elected—with Malaysia, after the effort he put into traducing the reputation of that country, well I can assure the House he is very, very deluded. Malaysia will not forget the way in which he went about attacking the human rights record of that country. The fact is Malaysia put forward an arrangement that should be considered. Malaysia put forward and arrangement that—



An opposition member interjecting—




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  Look, if we were to agree upon this in the parliament, we would be able to return people to a transit country safely. We would be able to do that without potentially causing the deaths of our own personnel, causing deaths of men, women and children on the high sea.


Even if you had any doubt about it at all—even though this has been recommended by the former Chief of the Defence Force Angus Houston, even though it has been recommended by Michael L'Estrange, a former diplomat; even though it has been recommended by Paris Aristotle—even if you had any doubt about the efficacy of transferring people in that manner, the fact that you do not even want to embrace it, the fact that you will not even support it if it came into the parliament, is a real tragedy. They will not support the Malaysia arrangement not because it will not work; they will not support the Malaysian arrangement because they are afraid that it will work.


Now why would you not listen to the experts in relation to these matters; why would you not give it a go? Even if there was a skerrick of doubt in relation to the effectiveness of that arrangement, why would you not put that forward? Because you want to see more boats come. You rub your hands together every time a vessel arrives in our waters, an unseaworthy vessel on a perilous journey with people who could—well they are risking their lives at sea. That to me is an unconscionable response to a very important issue that is before this debate. We should be undertaking that arrangement, but we are not doing that. And that is, I think, a shame and it is something the opposition should rethink.


We have an opportunity to realise the Malaysian arrangement and give it a go, as advised by the experts. But in the end, this opposition will stand in the way of the government realising that proposition for fear of it working. It is not because they think it will not work but because they are afraid it will. I think that is a dreadful shame because this issue is very serious. It goes to our border protection, yes. It goes to our management. It goes to our immigration reputation. But it also goes to what happens to people on the high seas and what we must do to ensure that the chances of people dying at sea are reduced.


This is a global problem. I agree with what the member for Cook said at the commencement of his contribution. This is a global problem and it is a regional problem, but it needs a regional solution. It is not going to work with a slogan and it is not going to work attacking Indonesia or Malaysia. (Time expired)

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2013-06-20,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (16:24):  As we have been sitting here having this debate, the government has put out another announcement: another boat has arrived. It has arrived very close to Darwin, because our Border Protection Command have a very difficult time in intercepting the sheer volume of boats that are arriving under Labor's failed border protection regimes. Those announcements can occur up to five or six times a day at the moment. People smugglers have ramped up their activity to a level we have never before seen in our history.


We are all politicians in this place. We all follow politics closely and we all know what is going on in the government at the moment. Basically, we have got a group of warring tribes who occupy the Treasury benches and they are totally consumed by their own internal politics. 


I went to the Midwinter Ball last night. I enjoyed it very much and I congratulate those who organised it in aid of the charities that they supported. And I kid you not, I was speaking to one person who swore to me black and blue that we would have a change of Prime Minister on Monday—it was definitely going to happen on Monday. I spoke to another person who said, 'No, no, it won't be Monday. It will be Tuesday.' Finally, a third party said to me, 'No, no, no, that is not going to happen. It will happen on Thursday. We will have a new Prime Minister on Thursday.' That means that the Prime Minister might be safe if she comes to work on Wednesday, but of course I did not actually talk to that many people so it is quite possible that people are saying that she could go that day as well.


The point that I am making is that regardless of what happens next week, regardless of who emerges as Prime Minister, whether we have the member for Lalor or whether we have the member for Griffith, nothing will actually change. That is why the Australian people are so over this. That is why it really makes no difference who emerges as Prime Minister. Under Prime Minister Rudd we had 139 illegal boats arrive. That was considered so serious by the current Prime Minister that she said it was one of the reasons she needed to take over from the member for Griffith as Prime Minister. Then subsequently her record—after saying that Kevin Rudd's record was so bad with 139 boats—is that 590 illegal boats have arrived under her watch. It is a rate of illegal boat arrivals that we have never before seen in our history.


It is hard to know who is going to be worse for protecting our borders: the Prime Minister who introduced the measures that led to this very sorry state of affairs, or the Prime Minister who said she was going to do something about it and has made things so much worse. All the Australian people can take from this is that nobody on the government benches has any idea about what to do apart from continuing their policy of abject surrender to the people smugglers. That is all we have from the Labor Party—abject surrender to the people smugglers. The government's policy is now just to shrug their shoulders and say, 'Oh well, it has got nothing much to do with us. We are only the government.' 


The worst thing about this is that it would not be occurring if the Labor Party had come into office and just left well enough alone. They inherited a border protection policy that worked, one that meant that boats were not arriving, one that meant that people smugglers were not active and that people were not coming here in leaky boats on the high seas. They took that solution and created a problem. In a fit of moral vanity they abolished those proven measures that actually worked, reinvigorated the people-smuggling trade and, since then, we have had this record number of illegal boat arrivals—almost 45,000 people on 729. But in fact it is 730, because we have just had another arrival announced.


What we are seeing from the Labor Party at the moment is less of a government and more of a circus. It is far more of a circus. I am surprised that cabinet ministers do not walk in here with a red noses and large multicoloured wigs. I am surprised that they do not arrive in a cabinet meeting in a very small car. The point is that nobody on the government benches has any idea about what to do with the challenges that are facing this country. Whether it be the current Prime Minister or whether it be the member for Griffith, the people smugglers know that they are the ones who are going to remain in charge. Nothing is going to change. We could have the former Prime Minister who broke it, or we could have the current Prime Minister who has made it so much worse. No matter what the Labor Party does, we are not going to get a resolution to this very serious problem.


What we need to do of course is ensure that we return to a suite of policies that we know works. How do we know that they work? We know that they work because they have achieved the goal that we need them to achieve—that is, when we implemented them in the past they smashed people smuggling: temporary protection visas, turning the boats back when it is safe to do so and a genuine approach to offshore processing that means that people do not actually set foot on mainland Australia. What we have at the moment is a circus running this country and it is time we brought the curtain down.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2013-06-20,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (16:30):  Australia may have once ridden on the sheep's back, but our wealth and lifestyle are now delivered in the back of a dump truck, through hard work and investment in the resource sector. We are a lucky country and a wealthy country, but we did not get here by making soybean sandwiches. We got here by playing to our strengths and using the resources that we have. In the North Queensland town of Bowen, families are doing it tough through lack of industry, lack of jobs and lack of opportunities. The one light at the end of the tunnel has been the proposed expansion of the nearby Abbot Point coal terminal. That proposal now depends on a decision from the environment minister, a decision being hijacked by the extreme greens who aim to close not just the ports but all mining in this country.


I have always been a strong supporter of this development because it is vital for the Australian economy and desperately important for the people of Bowen in North Queensland, but my initial preference was that the dredged material was to be disposed of on land. This preference was supported through consultation with the fishing and diving industries. However, it has been found out that if the developers are forced to dispose of the dredged material on land the project would be killed off, which would make the extreme greens very happy.


The extreme greens, in their attempt to close down the port and mining altogether, have used local fishermen as pawns in their political game, but the plan backfired. Through further consultation with the fishing industry, the diving industry and the developers, an agreeable alternative marine proposal has been identified. So the greens have now switched their attack by calling in overseas reinforcements who share their goal of shutting down Australian resource exports. They now employ the UNESCO World Heritage Committee's threat of listing the Great Barrier Reef as 'in danger' to further their cause. Who is this unelected body anyway? 


There are 21 states who are parties to the current World Heritage Committee, and Australia is not one of them. However, our major resource export competitors are very well represented on that committee: Algeria, the world's 10th largest producer of natural gas; Colombia, the fourth largest exporter of coal in the world; the Russian Federation, the world's largest holder of natural gas; South Africa, the holder of 95 per cent of Africa's coal reserves and fifth largest coal exporter in the world; the United Arab Emirates, exporter of natural gas to Asia; Qatar, the world's largest producer of liquid natural gas; Malaysia, an exporter of natural gas and LNG; and India and Iraq, both with reserves of natural gas. It is hard to imagine there not being a conflict of interest when a committee of those countries is helping to shut down Australian resource exports.


Another member of the committee is Senegal, which has no coral reefs at all, and other members—Mexico, Thailand, Cambodia, South Africa, Colombia and the United Arab Emirates—have all badly abused reefs of their own. None of the committee members have any real expertise about reefs but are happy to use our reef, the Great Barrier Reef, as a reason to shut down our coal industry. In fact, member nations passing judgement on our reef, including Colombia, Ethiopian, Iraq, Mali, Senegal and Serbia, all have sites already on an 'in danger' list. Indeed, some of them have more than one site on the list—and they sit in judgement of Australia.


In employing the World Heritage Committee to wield a hypocritical political weapon, the extreme greens have committed nothing short of economic treason. The real agenda of the extremists is not any concern for the environment; they merely use the environment as a reason to shut down industry, to destroy jobs, to prevent wealth creation and to dismantle democracy.


Dave Nebauer, a member of the Bowen Collinsville Enterprise Group, wrote to me yesterday very concerned about the radical campaign that the extreme Greens are waging against the resource sector. He said:


The environmental groups involved are not interested in ensuring acceptable environmental outcomes are achieved as the industry develops. They have a specific goal of shutting down our industry in total.


More alarmingly, he points to where this campaign may lead next. He says:


Once the green groups have shut down mining they will come after the next industry (Sugar? Horticulture? Fishing again?).


As a community, we need to ensure that a balanced view is maintained and that our economic future is not hijacked by radical groups who are not about sustainable development … rather they are anti-development.


Mr Nebauer is one of the many North Queenslanders who can see through the green smokescreen and see the extreme agenda that the greens have for what it is. I implore the federal Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities to actually do the same and approve the Abbot Point expansion for the sake of the township of Bowen, for the sake of our resources sector and for the sake of the Australian economy.


I have here a document which is a petition, but it is not a petition in accordance with the rules, so I seek leave to table the document of 1,550 signatures in support of the Abbot Point coal terminal expansion and also note that there are many more coming into my office.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2013-06-20,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (09:31):  While historically Melbourne has benefited from thoughtful planning, there remain 172 level crossings within the metropolitan area in comparison to only eight in Sydney. Many of these crossings are positioned on or adjacent to Melbourne's busiest roads and major arterials. The Burke Road intersection and railway crossing is but one significant example in my electorate.


Railway crossings cause substantial delays to motorists, road based freight and public transport, while imposing capacity constraints on rail based public transport. Along the Dandenong rail corridor, the hands-down single largest issue facing constituents on a daily basis is the need to remove level crossings and the associated congestion. It influences key decisions—where people will shop, where they will send their children to school and how they will access work. I have heard this directly from constituents through my surveys, through my regular mobile office meetings at train stations and in Koornang Road Carnegie, through the community forum I held at Carnegie Community Centre, through telephone calls to my office and by simply by knocking on doors in the local area to say hello. The traders agree. Both the Murrumbeena Village Traders Association and the Carnegie Traders Association know that the railway crossings hurt business and impact the amenity of the local community.


The 2012 RACV Redspot survey ranks three Higgins level crossings in Victoria's top 10 worst congestion sites. They are (1) Murrumbeena Road, Murrumbeena; (4) Koornang Road, Carnegie; and, (5) Burke Road, Glen Iris. Since 2011 the Victorian government has been unsuccessful in seeking federal government support via Infrastructure Australia and the Nation Building Program for Commonwealth funding to augment the more than $400 million it has already committed to level crossing removals.


I congratulate my state colleagues for focusing on this issue. In their three years of government they will have removed five level crossings. In the previous state Labor government, over 11 years, only three level crossings were removed.


There is a broad agreement as to the nature of the problem and the need for action. How these projects are funded remains less clear. The magnitude of the costs and potential productivity dividend requires federal intervention. I am pleased to present this petition, with more than 1,151 signatures, which draws to the attention of the House the severe congestion caused by the regular closure of the level crossings along the Dandenong rail line, and I ask the parliament to give greater priority to their removal. I table the petition.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:   I understand it the petition has been through the committee and will be processed.




The petition read as follows—



To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives


This petition of the residents of Melbourne draws to the attention of the House the severe congestion caused by regular closure of the level crossings along the Dandenong Rail Line.


In particular we note:


1. The substantial congestion of pedestrian, car and road freight traffic caused by constant level crossing closures during peak train times.


2. The negative impact for local business and community life as a result of level crossing related traffic congestion.


3. The consequent stifling of economic growth and loss of productivity within the Dandenong Rail Line catchment area, which currently accounts for approximately half of Melbourne's GDP or 9% of national GDP.


4. The failure of the Commonwealth Government to provide any funding, as per the Victorian Government's 2011 Infrastructure Australian Bid, to address level crossings within the 2012 Commonwealth Budget.


We therefore ask the House to prioritise the funding for the removal of the level crossings on the Dandenong Rail Lines through road/rail grade separation of level crossings at Koornang Road, Carnegie, Murrumbeena Road, Murrumbeena and Poath Road, Murrumbeena commencing with the 2013 Commonwealth Budget and subsequently via the next Nation Building Program.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2013-06-20,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (10:02):  I rise on behalf on the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney. The coalition will be supporting the passage of these two bills. The government introduced them into the House of Representatives yesterday. The government has sought coalition support to expedite the passage of them through the parliament.


The coalition has taken a stance on rushed legislation in the past. I was speaking about this issue on amendments that were made necessary by rushed legislation on the unclaimed money and other measures bill earlier in the week. As I said at the outset, the coalition will assist supporting these. They form part of the government's superannuation changes announced back in April of this year and were also included in the budget delivered just last month.


The bills belatedly remove the extreme penalty that arises when individuals inadvertently exceed their annual superannuation concessional contribution cap, currently at $25,000 per year for all taxpayers. When this occurs, more often than not, it is an honest mistake. Currently excess concessional contributions are subject to contributions tax at a rate of 31½ per cent, adding to the 15 per cent contributions tax rate and taking the total to 46½ per cent, regardless of the individual's level of income or the marginal tax rate. These contributions are generally not included in an individual's taxable income.


The amendments will instead include excess concessional contributions in an individual's taxable income which will then be taxed at their marginal rate, not at 46½ per cent indiscriminately. As a result this excess is not effectively subject to concessional contributions tax at 15 per cent or excess concessional contributions tax at 31½ per cent. The bills also allow individuals to elect to release an amount of excess concessional contributions from their superannuation interests.


The associated cognate bill, the Superannuation (Excess Concessional Contributions Charge) Bill 2013 imposes a charge on taxpayers who have concessional contributions in excess of their annual cap. This will ensure that individuals do not receive an advantage over taxpayers who do not exceed their annual cap. To achieve this, any tax shortfall that an individual has for a time or might hold and therefore benefit from will be charged the shortfall interest charge for the period that it is held.


The tax shortfall or potential benefit is in effect the excess contribution for the year multiplied by the difference in tax rates between the individual's marginal tax rate for that year and the 15 per cent concessional contribution rate. The shortfall interest charge is based on the 90-day bank-accepted bill as published by the Reserve Bank, plus a three per cent uplift factor.


The coalition has been on record with our position on this policy for a very long time, particularly through our shadow spokesman, Senator Cormann. At present, people who inadvertently breach their concessional caps are hit with a top marginal rate of 46½ per cent irrespective of what their actual tax rate is on their income taken as take-home pay. The situation is even worse in relation to inadvertent breaches of non-concessional contribution caps. Non-concessional contributions are made in after-tax income, which has already been taxed by up to 46½ per cent. After the penalty is applied, even for inadvertent breaches of those non-concessional caps, the government effectively imposes a tax of up to 93 per cent. We have made the point that this is hyper-punitive, to say the least.


It must be remembered that this tax of up to 93 cents in the dollar is targeting people who are trying to do the right thing by saving more towards their retirement to get themselves into a position where they can look after their own needs in retirement and do not have to rely on the public purse. Yet the government hits them with a tax of up to 93 per cent when an inadvertent error is made, often in circumstances, of course, outside of their control.


This should not be imposing a cost on the budget either. The point that our shadow spokesman has made repeatedly is: surely the government is not planning its revenue estimates on the basis of an assumption about people saving for retirement making errors so the government can collect revenue. The government is still not fixing this problem in this legislation, and we maintain that it should have.


Finally, I am advised that the minister's officers have been asked by our shadow spokesman for an explanation as to the difference between the costings provided in the budget—which came in at the cost, I am told, of $60 million over the forward estimates—and outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the bill. The explanatory memorandum states that these measures will have a cost to the budget of only $10 million. I am also advised that no detailed breakdown or background as to the differences within these costings have been provided, and so we would ask in good faith that, as the minister sums up, he address this issue and reconcile the difference, out of respect for the parliament.


As stated at the outset, the coalition will be supporting the passage of both of these bills.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (10:09):  First of all, I would like to thank the members who have contributed to this debate. Currently, excess contributions above the concessional contributions caps are generally taxed at the top marginal rate of 46½ per cent regardless of an individual's income. This is unfair for lower- and middle-income earners. The changes contained in the legislation will enable excess concessional contributions to be included in an individual's taxable income and allow them to be taxed at the individual's marginal tax rate, plus an interest charge, regardless of their income or the cause of the breach. In addition, individuals will be able to withdraw excess concessional contributions from their super provider.


This is the latest in a long line of financial services amendments bills that this parliament has passed. I believe fixing up excess contributions is an appropriate outcome for this parliament and it is one which will stand the test of time. This Labor government has achieved a lot in superannuation in terms of legislative reform. We have tackled adequacy by lifting superannuation over the next seven years from nine per cent to 12 per cent. We have improved fairness for people who earn less than $37,000 a year. They do not pay a 15 per cent tax on their superannuation. We do not see the point in perpetuating the gender gap in savings between men and women for retirement. We believe that low-paid workers who go to work every day should have a chance to save money for their retirement. So adequacy has been tackled and fairness has been tackled.


We also believe that these concessional contribution issues that we are dealing with in this bill tackle the issue of fairness. We have seen downward pressure on superannuation fees and charges through the development of MySuper. And also through the SuperStream proposals we believe we are making the system of superannuation more efficient and effective in the back-office transactions, decreasing pressure on people's savings accounts. We have also tackled conflicts of interest and improved public confidence in the system through our Future of Financial Advice reforms and indeed through our MySuper changes and also through improvements to the governance arrangements, giving power to APRA to be able to look behind the arrangements of superannuation trustees such that people can have renewed confidence in the system. We repudiate the attack on industry funds perpetuated by those in the coalition. We believe that, for good governance, it should be about giving APRA the powers to intervene directly in specific matters rather than just going after a class of superannuation fund altogether.


When you look at the extensive list of legislation, I would like to acknowledge, in case I do not get this opportunity again before the end of the parliament, the hardworking people from Treasury, APRA, ASIC and indeed the Australian Taxation Office. I also acknowledge the work of all those in the industry who have provided so much advice and counsel and pragmatic, business focused advice. I believe what motivates the vast bulk of the debate in superannuation, as it should be, is the best interests of consumers.


Furthermore, when we look at the budget measure, a fairer excess contributions tax system, it was costed on the basis that individuals would receive a refundable tax offset, where applicable, for the 15 per cent tax already paid on contributions within the fund. The refundable offset may result in individuals paying a lower rate of tax on excess contributions than their contributions under the cap. This is not the intention of the reform. The offset is now non-refundable. The measure was costed on the basis that the interest charged would apply from 1 July of the year following the year in which the contribution was made. However, to deter individuals from deliberately breaching the caps—which, by the way, I do not think happens a great deal; it is for the sake of policy consistency—the new interest charge will be applied from 1 July of the year in which the contribution is made. There are also some other parameter variations related to other interactions with the personal income tax superannuation systems. I commend this bill to the House.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (10:02):  I rise on behalf on the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney. The coalition will be supporting the passage of these two bills. The government introduced them into the House of Representatives yesterday. The government has sought coalition support to expedite the passage of them through the parliament.


The coalition has taken a stance on rushed legislation in the past. I was speaking about this issue on amendments that were made necessary by rushed legislation on the unclaimed money and other measures bill earlier in the week. As I said at the outset, the coalition will assist supporting these. They form part of the government's superannuation changes announced back in April of this year and were also included in the budget delivered just last month.


The bills belatedly remove the extreme penalty that arises when individuals inadvertently exceed their annual superannuation concessional contribution cap, currently at $25,000 per year for all taxpayers. When this occurs, more often than not, it is an honest mistake. Currently excess concessional contributions are subject to contributions tax at a rate of 31½ per cent, adding to the 15 per cent contributions tax rate and taking the total to 46½ per cent, regardless of the individual's level of income or the marginal tax rate. These contributions are generally not included in an individual's taxable income.


The amendments will instead include excess concessional contributions in an individual's taxable income which will then be taxed at their marginal rate, not at 46½ per cent indiscriminately. As a result this excess is not effectively subject to concessional contributions tax at 15 per cent or excess concessional contributions tax at 31½ per cent. The bills also allow individuals to elect to release an amount of excess concessional contributions from their superannuation interests.


The associated cognate bill, the Superannuation (Excess Concessional Contributions Charge) Bill 2013 imposes a charge on taxpayers who have concessional contributions in excess of their annual cap. This will ensure that individuals do not receive an advantage over taxpayers who do not exceed their annual cap. To achieve this, any tax shortfall that an individual has for a time or might hold and therefore benefit from will be charged the shortfall interest charge for the period that it is held.


The tax shortfall or potential benefit is in effect the excess contribution for the year multiplied by the difference in tax rates between the individual's marginal tax rate for that year and the 15 per cent concessional contribution rate. The shortfall interest charge is based on the 90-day bank-accepted bill as published by the Reserve Bank, plus a three per cent uplift factor.


The coalition has been on record with our position on this policy for a very long time, particularly through our shadow spokesman, Senator Cormann. At present, people who inadvertently breach their concessional caps are hit with a top marginal rate of 46½ per cent irrespective of what their actual tax rate is on their income taken as take-home pay. The situation is even worse in relation to inadvertent breaches of non-concessional contribution caps. Non-concessional contributions are made in after-tax income, which has already been taxed by up to 46½ per cent. After the penalty is applied, even for inadvertent breaches of those non-concessional caps, the government effectively imposes a tax of up to 93 per cent. We have made the point that this is hyper-punitive, to say the least.


It must be remembered that this tax of up to 93 cents in the dollar is targeting people who are trying to do the right thing by saving more towards their retirement to get themselves into a position where they can look after their own needs in retirement and do not have to rely on the public purse. Yet the government hits them with a tax of up to 93 per cent when an inadvertent error is made, often in circumstances, of course, outside of their control.


This should not be imposing a cost on the budget either. The point that our shadow spokesman has made repeatedly is: surely the government is not planning its revenue estimates on the basis of an assumption about people saving for retirement making errors so the government can collect revenue. The government is still not fixing this problem in this legislation, and we maintain that it should have.


Finally, I am advised that the minister's officers have been asked by our shadow spokesman for an explanation as to the difference between the costings provided in the budget—which came in at the cost, I am told, of $60 million over the forward estimates—and outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the bill.

I am also advised that no detailed breakdown or background as to the differences within these costings have been provided, and so we would ask in good faith that, as the minister sums up, he address this issue and reconcile the difference, out of respect for the parliament.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-06-20,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:49):  I rise to highlight a legal case in Peru which is causing considerable distress to six young Australians: Harrison Geier, originally from Wagga Wagga, Andrew Pilat, Jessica Vo, Sam Smith and brothers, Hugh and Tom Hanlon, as well as their families and friends. In 2012 the doorman at the apartments where these young Australians were staying in Peru died, apparently as a result of a fall from an upper storey. The six were interviewed by Peruvian police, who at the time accepted their innocence. The verdict was suicide. The Australians were allowed to leave Peru and are now back in Australia.


I would like to read from a letter I received from Phillip Geier, on behalf of his son Harrison, dated 29 November 2012. He stated: 'As a parent, I'm sure that, once you have read the outline of events, you will feel the same degree of disbelief and worry that this can happen to educated Australian citizens doing nothing more than checking into an apartment. As you can imagine, to be falsely accused of murder, let alone in a country with very different judicial standards, is very distressing for six lovely young Australians and their families. This awful situation is the result of the death of a doorman, Mr Lino Rodriguez Vilchez, in Miraflores, Lima, Peru, on 19 January 2012. The six young Australians had checked into their apartment and Mr Vilchez was the doorman who took their luggage to the lift. He was also at the front door when the six left to get groceries. He was not at the front door when they returned. This is the extent of their involvement with the deceased.'


After agitation by the deceased's family and the local media, another police investigation was opened. This alleged that the Australians were implicated in the doorman's death. The Peruvian courts have overturned the original verdict and have ordered the six Australians to return to Peru to give statements and to face trial. The young Australians and their families are understandably concerned that the decision to open a trial does not appear to take account of forensic and other evidence which, they believe, exonerates them.


The coalition welcomes the advice and assistance of the government, including our professional consular officials. We urge the Australian government to give the matter the highest priority. The coalition will continue to monitor this case very closely and hopes that, with the assistance of the government, the matter will be satisfactorily resolved, with the Australians' names cleared and no need for them to return to Peru to face trial. I spoke this morning to Rosemary Pilat, the mother of Andrew Pilat, one of the six young Australians who have unfortunately been caught up in this dreadful situation. Obviously she is very distraught about the situation, as are the families of the other five young people. I ask the government to do everything it can to see that this situation is resolved satisfactorily. It is a very worrying situation for these six young Australians, who obviously maintain their innocence. As you heard from that letter, Harrison Geier's father is also extremely worried and distraught. It is an alarming situation and I would impress upon the Commonwealth government of Australia to do everything it can to see that it is resolved satisfactorily.
