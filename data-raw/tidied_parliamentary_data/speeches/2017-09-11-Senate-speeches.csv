Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (10:01):  I rise to speak in support of this bill. This bill gives effect to an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to provide a standing appropriation and authority to borrow for payments to meet drawings made by the IMF, under the decision to renew the new arrangements to borrow made by the IMF executive board in November 2016. The previous five-year arrangement will expire on 16 November 2017, with a new arrangement to go from 17 November 2017 to 16 November 2022. Under this agreement, the maximum amount of Australia's lending commitment to the IMF's special drawing rights is $2.22 billion—around A$4.05 billion.


The SDR is an international reserve asset which can be allocated to member countries in proportion to their IMF quotas. The agreement is only activated when additional funds are required to support lending to member countries. This requires agreement from the participant countries that make up 85 per cent of the total credit committed under the NAB and the IMF executive board that the quota resources available to the IMF for lending are not sufficient for its lending needs.


The bill has no direct impact on the budget bottom line. However, if the agreement is activated and the funds are provided, there is an indirect impact due to the government's lending to the IMF increasing our borrowing requirement, and where the interest payable on any money borrowed by Australia to meet an IMF drawdown exceeds the interest paid by the IMF in regard to that drawdown. This agreement will be included in the budget papers as a quantifiable contingent liability.


The NAB became operative in November 1998, arising out of concerns first raised in 1995 that more resources might be required for the IMF to respond to future financial crises. Australia has been a participant in these arrangements since their commencement. This updates an arrangement that we made in government, which arose out of the IMF quota and governance reforms, in 2010. That legislation passed the parliament in September 2012 for the same special drawing rights amount of $2.22 billion, worth around A$3.2 billion at the time. This represents an important aspect of our international obligations as a member of the International Monetary Fund, and Labor will be supporting this bill.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:04):  I have deep concerns about our ongoing commitments to organisations like the IMF and the United Nations, in particular, where we are pledging what is effectively borrowed money to support the bailout of nations that can't manage their own financial affairs. I don't have that much confidence in the IMF as the arbiter of responsible financial management. If they were having a positive role in international affairs, you would expect that they would pre-empt and be able to forecast some of the crises that have captured the globe—for example, Greece, which was on a trajectory to bankruptcy for many decades. The problem we have right around the world is that the level of debt is far too high, because governments of all persuasions insist on giving people the impression that there can be a magic placement of cash that they don't have to work for, that they can just receive, and everything will be all right. There is this perception of: 'What's in it for me?'


One of the great tragedies is that Australia is heading down the same path. About 50 per cent of the people in this country receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes. It operates such that the top 10 per cent of earners pay in the region of 40 or 50 per cent of the taxes, or even more. That's simply not sustainable. Those on the other side of the chamber will say that they should be taxed more to provide more benefits. Well, that's wrong. It is absolutely wrong. We need to get our own house in order before we can be better, more responsible contributors to the global economy, and pledging access to some billions of dollars for the IMF—about $8.6 billion, I understand, of money borrowed from Australian taxpayers—doesn't seem very prudent to me. In fact, it's less than prudent. It's foolish; it's inane.


First of all, we have obligations to repay the intergenerational debt that has been clocked up by those on both sides of the chamber in the past 10 years. That is expected to peak at $726 billion, but I can tell you now, that will not be the peak. The runaway debt in this country shows no signs of abatement at all, and I would lay London to a brick that the debt incurred in the last 10 years will not be repaid while any of the current members of this place are still here. We'll all be long gone and leaving it to others to pay for the activities and the actions that successive governments have responded to. I'm opposed to the International Monetary Agreements Amendment (New Arrangements to Borrow) Bill 2017, because we are pledging borrowed money to give to an organisation that is unaccountable and unelected and that then gives the money to countries that have been unable to manage their finances. It's imprudent; it's illogical. There is a better way. So, I oppose this bill.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:08):  The International Monetary Agreements Amendment (New Arrangements to Borrow) Bill 2017 allows the Treasurer to borrow $4 billion on which we will pay interest at around 2½ per cent so that the Treasurer can lend it to the International Monetary Fund and receive interest at 0.4 per cent. Let me repeat that: the bill before us today allows the Treasurer to borrow $4 billion on which we will pay interest at around 2½ per cent so that the Treasurer can lend it to the IMF and receive interest at 0.4 per cent. As you can see, I am almost alone here in the Senate. Almost no-one else has any concerns about this lunacy. Once I sit down, the minister will speak for about 30 seconds, and 30 seconds after that the bill will have been passed by the parliament, through indifference.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:09):  I thank senators who have spoken in this debate for their contributions. The new arrangements-to-borrow legislation form part of a broader global effort to ensure that the global financial safety net remains strong and resilient in the face of economic crisis. The IMF's mandate to support global economic and financial stability is of critical importance given continuing risks to the global economic outlook. For Australia, as an open trading economy engaged with and exposed to the world and to global economic and financial conditions, it is very much in our interests to do all we can to ensure that the IMF has the resources it needs to fulfil its role, which is why I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:09):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Regional Development (Senator Nash) and the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Watt and Chisholm today relating to the award of contracts to Newlands Civil Construction.


This is a very serious issue, and I don't think this issue has been given the due diligence from the Attorney-General in relation to how serious this is. The Attorney-General has dismissed this on a couple of occasions now, and this goes to the very serious issue of whether Senator O'Sullivan has a direct or indirect interest in a range of Commonwealth funded projects that are jointly funded by the state and the Commonwealth.


Senator O'Sullivan denied to AAP that he either directly or indirectly holds a pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth. This is not about an agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth; this is about a direct or indirect pecuniary interest. After the questions were asked of Senator O'Sullivan, Senator O'Sullivan updated his pecuniary interests in this area on 16 June 2017, and it says under O'Sullivan and Sons Pty Ltd, 'remove its subsidiary Newlands Civil Construction Pty Ltd'. This was done on 16 June 2017.


Newlands Civil Construction has been subcontracted to work on an 80 per cent federally funded government project which is worth about $2.5 million. Senator O'Sullivan went on to say, importantly, that a review by Newlands Civil Construction has proven that it does not hold any agreement with any company or any entity that has an agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth. So what we are expected to do, as Senator Brandis has done, is accept that Barry Jr, the son of Senator O'Sullivan, who is now the managing director of Newlands, says, 'There's nothing to see here; nothing to see here.' This is a company whose managing director, between 1991 and 2013, was Senator O'Sullivan.



An opposition senator interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  That is correct. That's what the pecuniary interest says. Senator O'Sullivan has, as part of the O'Sullivan family, controlling interests. They are the controlling shareholders in this company. Due process, proper accountability and ensuring that the senator has no direct or indirect interest actually demands more than Barry Jr saying that Barry Sr—that is, Senator O'Sullivan—has no problem. Well, we think that there is more to be seen here. We think there is more to be answered. We agree with Minister Chester, who says that Senator O'Sullivan has an issue that he needs to explain. In my view, he certainly does need to explain why, after questions were asked, the pecuniary interests were changed so quickly. We need to ensure that Senator O'Sullivan is not using his privileged position as a senator to influence contracts and that he is not benefitting from these contracts, one of which is 80 per cent funded—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, please resume your seat. Senator Brandis?




Senator Brandis:
  Madam Deputy President, as you well know, under standing order 193(3) there is a prohibition against senators using imputations of improper motives or personal reflections on other senators. I ask you to call the senator to order.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, I ask that you be careful in this area, and perhaps rephrase your comments so that there are no direct imputations.




Senator CAMERON:
  Certainly, Madam Deputy President. These are issues that go to the credibility of the Senate, not just any individual senator. We cannot have a position where any senator is under a cloud in relation to section 44, or any practice that does not meet the requirements of both the Senate and the Constitution. Senator O'Sullivan does need to explain what's going on here.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  No, he doesn't.




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator Macdonald says, 'No, he doesn't,' need to explain. Well, he does need to explain, because this is a problem that he has that should be resolved. This needs further clarity as to exactly what's going on with this web of companies that he controls. (Time expired)

Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (15:16):  I thank Senator Cameron for raising this extremely trivial issue. I can't believe we're back here talking about ourselves once again. There are so many important things going on in the world and there are so many important things going on in our nation, yet those opposite once again decide to play the man, and not the ball, by talking about section 44.


Last week, it was all about Senator Nash. Not a single question during question time in this chamber was not directed to Senator Nash, yet this was at a time when we could have been talking about the military brinkmanship going on in North Korea. There was not a single question from those opposite about that. We could have spoken about the incredibly good news stories that were coming out of the economy, the green shoots that are showing through in the Australian economy—a quarter of a million new jobs—yet those opposite continued to speak about Senator Nash. We could have spoken about the genuine action that is taking place on energy prices—imposing downward pressure on energy prices and finding a solution to the energy crisis in this country going forward—yet those opposite continued to speak about Senator Nash.


The repetition is becoming not just tiresome for those of us in the government but tiresome for those in the gallery. How very dull this can be. And yet, this week, they've decided to move away from Senator Nash and to move onto Senator O'Sullivan and whether Senator O'Sullivan directly or indirectly holds a pecuniary interest in an organisation. The irony, of course, in all of this is that whatever contract there may or may not have been was definitely a contract with the Queensland government, not with the Commonwealth. Again, what we see is a significant misunderstanding of the issue by those opposite and an opportunity to play politics as opposed to dealing with issues of policy. I've got to say, at one stage I thought there was a moment there where, potentially, we could have been speaking about energy policy—energy policy which, let's face it, is possibly the most pressing issue facing this country right now. And what is it that those opposite are doing on energy policy? Well, I can't imagine—



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator HUME:
  I've not heard a single solution, Senator Cameron; not a single solution. Now, I'm not going to go the way of Senator Scullion and start talking about Blackout Bill, because I think that saying the words Blackout Bill when referring to those opposite is disrespectful, and Senator Scullion was right to withdraw it—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hume, please resume your seat. There is a message from the President about repeating offences. You are well aware that that was an issue raised at question time. I would draw your attention to the remarks of the President. I would ask you to withdraw those statements.




Senator HUME:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy President. You are absolutely right. I think that Senator Scullion was absolutely right to withdraw those remarks and to not refer to the Leader of the Opposition by such a disrespectful name. And I, too, withdraw—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Resume your seat, Senator Hume. Senator Cameron?




Senator Cameron:
  Senator Hume has reiterated the issue that the President dealt with. She should be asked to withdraw it and she should not be allowed to comment further.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, on the same point of order?




Senator Brandis:
  Senator Hume did not repeat what was objected to. It's as simple as that and, therefore, there is no point of order—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Brandis. I think you are now raising a debating point. 




Senator Brandis:
  It's not a debating point. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Please resume your seat, Senator Brandis. 



Senator Brandis interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, I've asked you to resume your seat. Are you now disobeying a request that I've made? 



Senator Brandis interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Sit down, Senator Brandis. I think I've heard enough on this point of order. Senator Hume, whilst you did not repeat the offence, I think there was an implication there, so I ask you to note what happened at question time and note the comments from the President about repeating language that disparages senators or those in the other place. Senator Cameron?




Senator Cameron:
  Senator Hume on two occasions used exactly the same words that the President commented on. She should withdraw them. It should be clear and simple. That is not appropriate and they should be withdrawn.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Cameron. I'll seek advice from the Clerk. I think she withdrew them, but I'm more than happy to check the record, Senator Cameron, and come back to you if necessary. Senator Brandis, did you have a further point?




Senator Brandis:
  No, I just want to make the point that Senator Hume did withdraw—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Brandis. 




Senator Brandis:
  and did not repeat the remarks in any event.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I've made a decision, thank you. Senator Hume.




Senator HUME:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy President. I understand that there is a need in this place of dignity to treat colleagues and those in the other place with respect, and I wouldn't dream of impugning those in this place or those in the other place either. What I am very disappointed about, though, is the inability of those opposite to deal with the issues of importance, not just the issues of importance in this place but the issues of importance to the Australian people. That's something that this opposition seems to have failed to do repeatedly. 


On the issue of energy, which is how this topic came up—and rising energy prices and reliability are of great importance—what we've seen from those opposite is little more than game playing. It has been a game-playing exercise. The best example of that is this government's policy to abolish the limited merits review. The limited merits review was a policy that was imposed upon the Australian people by those opposite during their time in government. The Turnbull government has been moving in this parliament to abolish the limited merits review to stop the electricity networks gaming the system and boosting their profits. What we've instead seen is those opposite, as part of their game playing and as part of their lack of focus on what is important, not supporting such a basic and sensible policy. The limited merits review has cost consumers approximately $6.5 billion since it was implemented in 2008 under the previous Labor government, because it has come out in favour of the electricity companies, as opposed to the consumers, 31 out of 52 times.



If Labor were serious about the cost of living, it would support this very important policy. If it were serious about seeking solutions to rising electricity prices, it would do so. Instead, it has sent this legislation to a Senate committee for review. Again this is a delaying tactic. It could support the government's efforts, but instead it has sent the legislation to a Senate committee. Those opposite clearly are not focusing on the game and are not focusing on the ball; they are focusing on the man by focusing on Senator O'Sullivan and Senator Nash. (Time expired)

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:24):  I rise to also speak on the growing controversy surrounding the business affairs of Senator O'Sullivan, a Queensland LNP senator. I think it's useful to just map out what this controversy is all about. It comes down to three different contracts that have been awarded to companies controlled by Senator O'Sullivan and his family. Not only are there three contracts but—and this is the important point—they are contracts to provide works that are funded by the Commonwealth government. 


In 2015, Senator O'Sullivan's family company was awarded a contract to undertake roadworks in Emerald in Central Queensland under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. That was a contract valued at $2.2 million. In October 2016, a second contract was awarded to Senator O'Sullivan's family business, this time for $2.5 million worth of work on the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing—again, a project that is majority funded by the Commonwealth government. 


What we've learned today is that there is a third contract for Commonwealth-funded works that has been awarded to Senator O'Sullivan's family company—this time for works on the Warrego Highway west of Brisbane to the value of $1 million. So putting those three contracts together, what we now learn is that Senator O'Sullivan's family company has benefited to the order of $6 million in contracts to provide works funded by the Commonwealth government. The common theme across all three of these contracts is that they are performed by Newlands Civil Construction Pty Ltd. When you dig into the ownership of that company, of course it has the opaque, difficult-to-understand company structure that we've come to expect of Senator O'Sullivan. Newlands Civil Construction Company until June 2017 was owned 100 per cent by a company called O'Sullivan & Sons Pty Ltd. That, of course, is a company which, when you trace it all back, is part-owned by Senator O'Sullivan himself in combination with another company that is owned by his very own son. It seems that Senator O'Sullivan likes to keep it in the family—not only are he and his son both called Barry but they like to own companies which benefit from Commonwealth contracts. 


Mysteriously, only a week or two ago, Senator O'Sullivan updated his pecuniary interests register. One would have to wonder why, after all of this activity being undertaken for so long, all of a sudden he decided to update his register to record company restructuring which happened back in June. So he was well beyond the 30-day requirement to update his register after a company restructure. But let's leave that aside. The most interesting thing about that is that in June 2017, on the very day the government made announcements about new NDRRA funding that it was going to be providing, he restructured his arrangements to transfer his company's interest in Newlands Civil Construction to another company. And, what do you know, that's a company that is part-owned by his son. So we're still keeping it in the family. We're still keeping it from Barry Sr to Barry Jr, and now we're passing it from Barry Sr's company through to Barry Jr's company. It doesn't really matter, as long as there's a Barry O'Sullivan who's drawing a benefit. That seems to be the guiding rule for Senator O'Sullivan's business activities.


We've asked a number of questions about this today and last week in question time. What has been very conspicuous is the lack of enthusiasm by both Senator Brandis and Senator Nash to jump to the defence of their colleague Senator O'Sullivan. The strongest we've heard from Senator Brandis is that he has no reason to believe that Senator O'Sullivan is in any trouble or that anything untoward has occurred. I would hardly call that a ringing endorsement. That's not the kind of language I'd be looking for from my Senate leader if I was in a spot of bother. The reason for that is that they know that Senator O'Sullivan is in trouble. They know that he has a problem under section 44 of the Constitution, which says that a senator is disqualified from holding office if they have a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Commonwealth.


In Senator O'Sullivan's case, there's not just one agreement with the Commonwealth; there's not just two. There are now three agreements under which Senator O'Sullivan's family companies draw a benefit via Commonwealth funding. Commonwealth funding is passed through a range of different entities and, what do you know, at the end of the day it finds itself in the pockets of Senator O'Sullivan and his son, Barry Jr. Senators Brandis and Nash should ask Senator O'Sullivan some questions, and Senator O'Sullivan should make a statement to the Senate explaining himself.

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2017-09-11,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (15:29):  Another question time and another little grubby display of Labor backroom tactics. They are probably mildly amusing to those people who sit at home and do nothing other than watch Senate question time. But, to the rest of the world, it matters nought. I feel sorry for the people here in the gallery today and for those students who have come through to see what's on display when it comes to the tactics—




Senator Brandis:
  That's why they're all leaving.




Senator DUNIAM:
  Yes, they're walking out. You're quite right, Senators Brandis, they are leaving—I suspect in disgust. Off the back of a failed tactic at the beginning of question time, where questions were being asked of the wrong minister, which backfired embarrassingly—I haven't seen that in my time in the Senate, I have to say—they picked themselves up, or at least so they thought, changed tact and went on with this fascination, this obsession, the Labor Party has with pecuniary interests of senators in this place. Again, it's something that matters nought to the people of Australia, frankly.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator DUNIAM:
  And, as much as those on the other side chuckle and guffaw and think it's a great little show and that we should be sitting down with a bucket of popcorn to take it all in, the reality is that people out there in the real world, don't care. They're not worried about this sort of thing.


I have to say, though, in my own mind, it conjures up images of Labor senators and their staff sitting in smoky, dark rooms with dim lighting, rifling through the pecuniary interest register of senators to see what they've changed, what they own, what they had yesterday and what they're going to be changing if things are put on the public record, as they assert. It doesn't fill one with confidence about a group of people that aspires to lead this country in government one day. They're more interested in rifling through bits of paper and trying to sling mud at members of this place about fake arguments around what they own and the benefits they may be drawing. As Senator Brandis mentioned in his answer to the questions that he was asked, he canvassed these matters last week, and much of this was put on the public record. That begs the question: why are we back here? Because it's all about mud-slinging; it's all about characterising this as something that it is not. The questions have so much loaded language around the actual situation. All are assertions that are trying to draw conclusions that cannot be established on the facts available.


It was most enlightening to hear Senator Watt, under pressure by way of interjection from the Attorney-General, change his language. He was talking about Senator O'Sullivan having contracts with the Commonwealth when, in fact, the contracts with companies—whether or not there is an interest held by Senator O'Sullivan—are held with the Queensland state government, not the Commonwealth. Senator Watt realised that and he changed his language quite significantly, talking about benefits derived. There, immediately, he highlighted that he accepts that this argument does not hold water, and, really, it is only further ambulance-chasing and grubby politics, which is exceptionally disappointing.


One thing I would ask is whether those opposite have actually done an ASIC search of Senator O'Sullivan's companies. I wonder whether they would find, as I understand the case to be, that a simple ASIC search will show that Senator O'Sullivan holds shares in none of the companies that have been mentioned. I wonder if the next opposition speaker—I assume that will be Senator Chisholm—would be able to answer that question for me when they rise to their feet to contribute to this debate. It is about the facts; it's not about the assertions. We have to remember that.


The other thing we have to remember—as I started by saying—is that we ought to be focusing on the issues that actually really matter to people. It was revealing that this took up the lion's share of the opposition's questions today. Again, there is more of that 'gotcha politics' arrangement going on. They are not focused on things that people are concerned about. Senator Gallacher did ask a question about jobs. It was the last question, just squeezed in in time. But, beyond the feigned interest in jobs for communities outside of Canberra, Sydney or Melbourne, there was not much talk of real-world issues, which is disappointing. I think it is about getting the facts on the record. It's about clarifying the assertions that have been put on record in here—the disappointing reflections on individuals and just slinging mud left, right and centre to try to get someone. That is what this is all about. It's politics; it's not policy. It's not about advancing our country and it's not about advancing the lives of Australians that we apparently represent in this place; it's about slinging mud. It is exceptionally disappointing. I invite senators who want to pursue this matter to do so in a way that is based on facts and nothing else.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:34):  I think the important point that Senator Duniam touched on here is: let's get the facts on the record. I couldn't agree more. Let's get Senator O'Sullivan in the chamber to make a statement about these important issues. That's a sure-fire way we can get the facts on the record. The reality is that he has not addressed them. There have been numerous questions put to the government and they, as well, have failed to address them. I'd love nothing more than to get on with it and talk about other issues. But integrity is so important.


The question marks over this government around section 44 are so important. They go to the very heart of this government's decision-making. We know the Nationals have a problem with section 44 of the Constitution. Two other senators, Senator Canavan and Senator Nash, have a problem with section 44. We know the Deputy Prime Minister in the other place has a problem with section 44, as does Senator O'Sullivan. For those opposite who have a bit of a whine about wanting us to ask other questions, the answer is easy: give Senator O'Sullivan a ring and get him to come here and put on the record what he knows about this. The reality is that he has not done that and he won't do that, and the government won't come forth either.


There have been a number of questions that raised serious concerns last week and this week that the government have failed to answer. These have been questions around the contracts that Newlands Civil Construction have won, how many contracts there have been and how much money they are worth. From questioning that we have put and from what we have been able to identify, so far we know that three projects that have federal input have been won by Newlands Civil Construction: the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing, the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements in Emerald, and the Warrego Highway west of Brisbane. All up, we know that this company has done more than $6 million worth of work that has a federal contracting influence. But, when we have put questions to Senator Brandis and Senator Nash, the lack of answers only raised further alarms with us about the way in which the government has been dealing with this matter.


It would be easy for Senator O'Sullivan to come in here and clear this up a very quickly. But what has Senator O'Sullivan done? Recently, he changed his entry on the pecuniary interest register and failed to make a comprehensive statement to the Senate on these concerns. We know from Minister Chester, his own National Party colleague in the other place, who is in the cabinet—and I think this is very illustrative—that this is an issue that needs to be explained. This is coming from someone on his own side, a National Party minister in government, who is saying that Senator O'Sullivan needs to explain.


We will continue to pursue this because of the failure of the government to have answers and also because of the actions of Senator O'Sullivan. What are those actions? Why can't they come up and tell us the number of projects that Newlands Civil Construction has won that have federal government influence in them, the amount of money these contracts are worth and what the government have done about these serious allegations. These are the themes of the questions that we put to Senator Brandis and Senator Nash today and also raised in this place last week. But, so far, the government have been dismissive and have failed to answer the substantive nature of these questions.


When you look at the way they treated the questions that we put in the chamber today, it's easy to see why they have become embroiled in so much controversy over section 44. They really fail to do their homework. They fail to realise the seriousness of the allegations and, therefore, they pay the price. This leads to the chaos and dysfunction that we see from the government. We see it when it comes to the ministers and their failure to tackle the important policy challenges around section 44. When those opposite come in here to take note of answers, they talk about why they want questions on the serious policy challenges, but they're a government that are unable to deal with such questions because of the chaos that they face around the potential ineligibility of three senators—two when it comes to citizenship and one when it comes to the pecuniary interests of Senator O'Sullivan. So, when the government have opportunities to answer questions about Senator O'Sullivan throughout the rest of this week, it really is incumbent on them to have a look at what they have done in this regard and come into this chamber prepared to go on the record about contracts from which Senator O'Sullivan's company has benefited.

Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (15:50):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum and to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Customs Amendment (Safer Cladding) Bill 2017 (the bill) responds in part to a recommendation made by the Senate Economics References Committee in its inquiry into non-conforming building products.


The bill amends the Customs Act 1901 to expressly ban the importation of polyethylene (PE) core aluminium composite panels (ACPs).


The cladding issue is a most serious public safety issue that requires urgent action. The issue was brought to the public's attention in November 2015 when the Lacrosse building in Docklands Melbourne caught fire. Since that time governments, both Federal and State, have failed to adequately respond.


The Lacrosse incident was the trigger for the Senate inquiry. The Lacrosse apartment block in Docklands, Melbourne, had aluminium cladding fixed to its exterior. Flames raced up several floors and it was only through sheer luck that no lives were lost.


Builders who consciously choose to cut costs using the non-compliant panels save only about $3 per square metre, putting profit ahead of lives.


Evidence given to the inquiry revealed PE and ACPs are so hazardous that in the event of a fire, one kilogram of polyethylene will release the same amount of energy as one and a half litres of burning petrol.


Unless the States act with a greater sense of urgency, the only way is to legislate to stop bringing this potentially lethal product into the country.


We cannot under any circumstances, bear the tragedy that occurred in London. We must prevent any risk of that happening here.


There needs to be urgent action from the Commonwealth and the States to complete audits of all suspect buildings and houses so remediation can be carried out; so that people can work and live safely in them.


It is unacceptable that some States, including my home State of South Australia, have been unable to identify which buildings contained the flammable material.


It is a simple test to identify whether cladding contains the cheap, flammable polyethylene or the slightly more expensive version treated with fire retardant.


The Senate inquiry heard disturbing evidence that dangerous and non-compliant goods were coming into the country undetected and, in some cases, with false or forged compliance documents.


The committee found greater enforcement of existing regulations was needed and recommended a national licensing system for a range of workers in the building and construction industry, along with severe penalties for non-compliance of the National Construction Code.


In light of the Grenfell Tower tragedy, there cannot be legitimate use of PE core ACPs on any building type. The committee found that as there are safe non-flammable and fire retardant alternatives available there is no place for PE core ACPs in the Australian market. 


While Australian Border Force and suppliers of Aluminium Composite Material are currently unable to determine whether an imported building product will be used in a compliant manner, a ban on importation is necessary to prevent any disasters such as the Grenfell Tower tragedy occurring in Australia.


I commend the bill to the Senate and urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to support it.

Leave granted.




Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE:
  I, and also on behalf of Senators Griff and Xenophon, move the motion as amended:


That the Senate—


(a)   notes that:


(i)   on 22 August 2017, Mr Kunmanara Gibson, a 47-year-old Aboriginal man for whom English was a second language, died in custody after being found unconscious in his cell at Adelaide’s city watch house,


(ii)   an Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement (ALRM) duty officer was advised of Mr Gibson’s arrest, however, the South Australian Aboriginal Visitor’s Scheme, operated by the ALRM, was not informed of Mr Gibson’s arrest until after he died,


(iii)   one of the key recommendations of the 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was that all states notify a custody notification service whenever an Indigenous person is arrested to offer support, language and legal services,


(iv)   recommendation 224 states: 'in jurisdictions where legislation, standing orders or instructions do not already so provide, appropriate steps be taken to make it mandatory for Aboriginal Legal Services to be notified upon the arrest or detention of any Aboriginal person other than such arrests or detentions for which it is agreed between the Aboriginal Legal Services and the Police Services that notification is not required',


(v)   in October last year, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs announced that the Coalition Government had written to all state and territory governments offering to fund a national roll-out of the Custody Notification Service (CNS) – similar to the scheme that currently operates in New South Wales, and credited with saving the lives of Aboriginal people in custody – the three year funding offer was to be contingent on the jurisdictions mandating the use of the CNS and agreeing to fund it after the three-year introductory period,


(vi)   to date, ALRM has been operating a limited Custody Notification Service in South Australia, however, it does not satisfy requirements of a best practice model, as exemplified by the NSW scheme,


(vii)   Mr Gibson’s death is the second Aboriginal death in police custody in the last three months nationally, and the fourth in South Australia in the past year,


(viii)   last year marked the 25th anniversary of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, and


(ix)   according to figures obtained from the Australian Institute of Criminology, between 1987 and 1991, while the Royal Commission was underway, there were 23 Indigenous deaths in prison custody and 28 in police custody – from 2009 to 2013 there were a further 41 Indigenous deaths in prison custody and 19 in police custody; and


(b)   calls on:


(i)   the Coalition Government to urgently negotiate a solution with those jurisdictions that have yet to implement a Custody Notification Service consistent with the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, and


(ii)   those state and territory governments that have yet to implement a Custody Notification Service consistent with the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody to do so.

  The opposition won't be supporting this motion.

The opposition believes that the Prime Minister should be fixing the energy crisis, not blaming others and saying what he might do in five or 10 years. If Mr Turnbull were serious about fixing the energy price he would do three things right now: intervene in the gas market so that more gas stays in Australia for Australians at lower prices; end the war on renewables and implement a clean energy target, which would drive new investment and jobs in energy; and stop the blackouts this summer by developing a strategic energy reserve so that there is enough power when we really need it.

It is absolutely remarkable that the business community is fleeing coal-fired power because they see it as a bad investment, yet here we have the government—the champions of free market economics—criticising the opposition for wanting to intervene in the marketplace, when here they are adopting some of the most interventionist, backward looking, retrograde policies in the energy area that one could imagine.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:07):  I rise to speak on this MPI on investment in renewable energy which, indeed, does make economic and environmental sense. Unfortunately, the energy crisis that we're facing has come about because of this government's energy policy paralysis. This paralysis has been going on now for years and years because of an ideological split within the Liberal government—we had it first with the Abbott government and now with the Turnbull government—against investment in renewable energy. This investment is occurring right across the world to ensure that a number of nations, including ours, meet the Paris climate agreement that we signed on to. 


Let's have a look at what's occurred under this government's watch. Under this government's watch we have lost one in three renewable energy jobs, and yet we hear nothing from the Turnbull government senators about those jobs at all. What else have we seen? We've seen wholesale power prices double. We've seen carbon pollution consistently rising, with the most recent data showing an annual increase of 1.4 per cent. We have this ridiculous internal division within the Turnbull government and their bizarre ideological obsession to stop investment in renewables. We should be ensuring that we put in place good energy policy for not only Australia but our region. 


The clean energy target, which has been proposed by the Chief Scientist, Dr Finkel, is designed to get investment flowing—we know investment means economic growth; it means jobs—to ensure reliable and affordable electricity is guaranteed for Australian households and Australian businesses. Inevitably, those old, outdated coal-fired power stations will therefore start shutting down, just as we have seen in other parts of the world. There is nothing new here about Australia tackling its energy policy. It is the same story the world over.


But what did we have on the weekend? On the weekend, the National Party sought to veto the consideration of the Chief Scientist's report, which the government itself commissioned, remember—this is the government-commissioned, Chief Scientist's report introducing a clean energy target. They voted to reject it—let's just make that very clear: the National Party, which helps form government in this country, voted to reject Dr Finkel's clean energy target of 42 per cent of renewables by 2030. That is the kind of division and the kind of farce that is going on. But, unfortunately, it does not just stop there.


We now have the CEO of AGL stating that the company is getting out of coal in the next five years—he has said it way ahead of time, with plenty of time for transitioning—and yet what does the government do? The government wants AGL—and is meeting them today, and urging them—to keep this old, coal-fired power station open beyond these five years. In a tweet last week the CEO of AGL, Mr Vesey, rightly pointed out:


Keeping old coal plants open won't deliver the reliable, affordable energy our customers need


He knows exactly the industry he's playing in, because he's the CEO of AGL. He hasn't got politics on his mind—he has the interests of his shareholders, of the company and of the customers on his mind. And yet what does this government come along and do? It wants to play politics, because it can't get the support from the National Party for a clean energy target for an investment in renewable energy. And in turn, it will add to the diminution of renewable energy jobs that has been going on for years now under this government's watch. This is driven by a baseless ideology. It is stupid political opportunism, where the Nationals want to tear down this one piece of bipartisan energy policy that is providing new generation into the system, rather than support renewable energy.


I thought that the coalition was a coalition that supported market forces, that actually responded to the economics of policy. And yet we've had so many economists come out in support of carbon pricing, an emissions trading scheme, clean energy targets—action on climate change in an economically modelled sense—and this government has turned every single one of them down. But let's not forget that this is the same Prime Minister who once supported these things. This is the Prime Minister who once supported a CPRS. Just as we almost moved towards it, of course, he lost his leadership and the rest is history—and now he's completely changed his tack on things and doesn't even know what he believes anymore, but he is hiding the fact that he was an environment minister and someone that supported a CPRS. The conservative elements in the coalition are insistent, not just on the current arrangements of old, coal-fired power stations staying open beyond the next five years, like AGL's—they probably would have preferred Hazelwood's to have stayed open as well—but, no, they actually also want new coal-fired power stations. You know, it is just beyond belief where this government is leading our nation, at a time when there are countries like China that are putting hundreds of their coal-fired power plants on hold.


Today, I met with a number of really concerned citizens about what this government is doing. I met with them to hear what their views are—the views of people living out there who really want their government to take some action to invest in renewable energy. The group is named the Citizens' Climate Lobby and they want to look at the implications of climate change on Australia's national security. Indeed, they're a group of volunteer citizens who advocate for us to address global warming in the most transparent and equitable way. I had a really good chat to them, and I've had a chat to a number of community groups and NGOs in the field who made it very clear that this is not the way that they want their government headed—to be keeping dirty, coal-fired power stations open. They want their government to be investing in renewables. I look at my own home state, where we have a government owned electricity system based on hydropower and added to with wind power. These are the kinds of investments they want because they know they're a part of the clean energy future. But, instead, what we have is a government continuing their war on renewable energy.


I say to the government senators opposite: if you were really serious about fixing the energy crisis, instead of meeting Mr Vesey from AGL and demanding or urging him to keep open a dirty, coal-fired power station that, in five years, he as CEO has said his company wants to close because of the fact that it, as he said, won't deliver the reliable, affordable energy their customers need, you could, indeed right now, do three things. You could intervene in the gas market so that more gas can stay in Australia for Australians and, therefore, at lower prices. You could end this ridiculous war on renewables—this ridiculous war on solar plants, wind turbines, hydro; all of this is just ridiculous. By doing that, you could implement the clean energy target that Mr Finkel, the Chief Scientist in this country—who submitted a report that the government commissioned—said should be introduced, which would drive new investment and jobs in energy. You could stop the blackouts this summer by developing a strategic energy reserve so that there is enough power when we really need it. Stop playing politics, Mr Turnbull. (Time expired)

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2017-09-11,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (16:17):  I rise today to speak in response to the matter of public importance submitted to the Senate by Senator Gallagher, our parliamentary colleague from the ACT. Senator Gallagher would like this chamber to discuss investment in renewable energy which makes economic and environmental sense. It gives me great pleasure to speak on this issue because it gives me a chance to inform both Senator Gallagher and the Senate of all the good work that the Turnbull coalition government has been doing with regard to energy policy.


As Minister Frydenberg and the Prime Minister have said many times, this government is committed to solving the trilemma which is energy affordability, reliability and meeting our international obligations for emissions reductions. Importantly, this is a government that is technology agnostic when it comes to how we go about actually achieving those goals. Rather than pursuing this ideologically driven, single-minded agenda of non-commercially-sustainable wind- and solar-energy production, I think it's incredibly important to understand the vernacular of this debate. Renewable energy and clean energy are not interchangeable, but they, in fact, walk hand in hand. This is a government that is pursuing clean energy alternatives without the ideology. Instead, its policies are based on economics and on engineering. Of course, one of those clean energy policies that could be considered as part of this clean energy mix is, in fact, clean coal. Clean coal is a technology that exists right now which renders coal-fired power stations as secure, reliable and, importantly, clean sources of energy. Clean coal technology is not something to be derided; it's not something to be mocked. It is one potential way that this government could ensure that Australian households are able to keep the lights on without paying exorbitant energy prices while also meeting those international obligations for emissions reductions. To remove conversations about clean energy sources from the debate, purely because you are ideologically opposed to them, is essentially economic vandalism. Those on this side of the chamber know very well that one of the most fundamental and important responsibilities of government, when it comes to energy, is ensuring that the lights stay on and that prices stay low for Australian households and Australian businesses.


Where once the opposition were more interested in pursuing sensible policy outcomes for the betterment of all Australians, they're now more interested in safeguarding those inner-city seats against the growing popularity of the Australian Greens. Now, perhaps it can be said that middle- to high-income earners, residents of those gentrified suburbs—those inner city suburbs, where the Greens are encroaching on Labor heartland—may not find electricity prices of particular concern. They have the luxury of being able to take an ideological approach towards energy policy. However, for ordinary Australians, that is simply not the case. For ordinary Australians, there is an ever-increasing proportion of household budget spent on electricity, and this is of huge concern. It's not just the direct effect of high electricity bills and it's not just the bills that land on the kitchen table; it's also the bills that we see in the accounts payable ledger. Electricity prices have an indirect effect on the cost of living as well as a direct effect.


Senator Gallagher has phrased her matter of public importance in such a way as to make a claim about both the environmental and the economic rationale for investment in renewable energy. Fortunately, on this particular matter, the Turnbull government quite agrees with Senator Gallagher. Indeed, for many forms of renewable energy sources, there is a very sound economic rationale. This is one of the reasons that the Turnbull government has committed to an investment in an upgrade of the snowy hydro scheme—colloquially, and of course affectionately, known and referred to as 'Snowy 2.0.'


There is hardly a better example of the government's commitment to energy security, affordability and a reduction in emissions than Snowy 2.0—an enormous infrastructure project that will allow for the kinetic storage of energy through a pumped hydro scheme. Snowy 2.0 allows us to pump water to higher altitudes during off-peak times and use that pumped water during the peak periods. This allows for a very efficient use of energy in Australia for Australian households, and it stands as a shining example of public infrastructure spending by Australian governments. Once again, this evidences the Turnbull government's commitment to solving the energy trilemma of security, affordability and reduced emissions.


The Finkel review developed a range of options to maintain the security, reliability and affordability of the national energy market and the coalition, along with state governments, has agreed already to 49 of the 50 recommendations. Many of these recommendations are aimed at ensuring the affordability and reliability of the energy market, but there is a need to safeguard base load power in Australia. We need to make sure that we have enough power to meet future needs, and that base load power is required to anchor our electricity system.


AEMO's analysis recently showed that there is heightened risk of shortages during the summer peaks and, without targeted action to provide additional firming capability, that threat will become real. The reckless policy of state Labor in Victoria and South Australia—of course, contributing to the closure of Hazelwood in Victoria and the Northern Power Station in South Australia—has seen the need for AEMO to take these quite dramatic steps. The government therefore stands in quite stark contrast to the ideologically driven peddlers of the myths of the panacea of renewable energy that is the calling card of those opposite and also of their party colleagues at a state level. I thank Senator Gallagher for bringing this very important matter to the attention of the Senate. It is an honour to speak on behalf of the Turnbull government on this issue. (Time expired)

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-09-11,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (16:24):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I need to start by saying that this MPI is yet another MPI about trust, and it shows that the Labor-Greens alliance, destroying energy, cannot be trusted. The dictionary defines investment as 'the investing of money or capital in order to gain profitable returns as interest, income or appreciation of value'. Investment in intermittent energy sources is a waste of money. It is not an investment; it is a scandal. Let me illustrate by quoting from an exercise on Greg Combet, who was Labor's and environment and climate change minister in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. Journalist James Delingpole, on 3 May 2012, identified what he claims is a scandal involving wind farms and guaranteed government subsidies:


At the heart of this scandal are the union superannuation funds that are using the wind farm scam as a kind of government-endorsed Ponzi scheme to fill their coffers at public expense. One of the biggest wind farm developers, Pacific Hydro—


Remember that name, Pacific Hydro—


is owned by the union superfund Members Equity Bank. To meet its carbon reduction quotas, we're told—


by then Labor ministers—


Australia needs to build about 10,000 new wind turbines like the ones that have destroyed Waterloo (and dozens of communities like it from NSW to South Australia).


The figures are mind-boggling. Each of those turbines will cost about $3 million, which means $30 billion even before you've started building the power lines. And where's this money coming from? The consumer, of course—mostly via tariffs whacked on to the price of conventional, fossil-fuel energy prices, in the form of payouts called Renewable Energy Certificates.


Note that wind turbines produce very little power. Because wind is intermittent, they operate at between one-fifth and one-third of their capacity, meaning they are erratic, unreliable and have to be fully backed up by conventional 'black' (mostly coal-fuelled) power. Where the money is to be made is through the REC subsidy. A 3MW wind turbine that generates (at most) $150,000 worth of electricity a year is eligible for guaranteed subsidies of $500,000 a year. A ridgeline hosting 20 or 30 turbines generates very little power—but an awful lot of free cash for those lucky enough to get their snouts in the trough.


If the unions were merely exploiting government environmental legislation to milk the taxpayer it would be bad enough …


Industry Super Holdings Pty Ltd's annual report for 2007 states that Greg Combet was Director of Industry Super Holdings Pty Ltd until the middle of 2007, the year he was parachuted into parliament. It owned Members Equity Bank and Pacific Hydro. He shovelled tens of millions of dollars into this scam. That's why we're going to be standing up, beside the people of Lakeland on Cape York—where we met with them under the poinciana trees—a people concerned about these bird chopper eyesores, the hurt energy supply and the health risks that are well documented by the Waubra Foundation and any number of peer-reviewed medical and scientific papers. This is a scam!

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:27):  I also rise to contribute to the debate on renewable energy, a debate that, under Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's watch, has got out of control. This weekend the party that wants to take everything out of our bush capital, The Nationals, held its annual conference here in Canberra, but that act of hypocrisy has nothing on one particular motion that was passed at their conference on renewable energy this weekend. The Nationals passed a motion which calls on the federal government, of which they are a key junior partner, to eliminate subsidies for renewable energy. This is a party of government calling for an end of support for the renewable energy industry!


I note that the Nationals, through their leader in the Senate, have continued this argument in the chamber today. Instead of proposing positive ideas to address our nation's energy crisis, instead of embracing job-creating opportunities of renewable energy, the Nationals are seeking to tear down the piece of bipartisan energy policy that is providing new generation into the system. Rather than propose positive ideas to address our nation's energy crisis, the Nationals are driven by baseless ideology and political opportunism. This is the same political party that regularly travels across regional Australia promoting the use of renewable energy, cutting the ribbons on renewable products and praising the jobs and investment created in regional communities, that then comes to Canberra, holds a national conference and stabs the people who work in renewable energy in the back. For the Liberals and Nationals, it's always about politics. They're so hopelessly behind on the energy debate that they've jumped even further into the abyss. It is clear that the current energy policy paralysis is the fault of the government, through its ridiculous move in the last parliament to repeal the Clean Energy Future package, with nothing in its place. Instead of trying to fix the problem, we had the National Party trying to blow up the one piece of bipartisan energy policy. Instead of embracing sensible solutions for our current and future energy needs, we had the National Party, with former Minister Canavan and the member for Dawson, supporting the extreme position of simply ending all government support for renewable energy.


It's important to note that there has always been government support across the energy sector regardless of generation type. It is a core business of government to provide the energy needs for householders and businesses. There is government support for poles and wires. There was government support for building the coal- and gas-fired power stations in the first place, and that was a good thing. The provision of reliable energy is absolutely the role of government. The one-eyed approach that the Prime Minister is appeasing—the one-eyed approach that we must hark back to the good old days—will just not cut it. Holding the ridiculous ideological positions of one generation type over another is not going to improve the reliability, is not going to put downward pressure on prices and is not going to do anything for the environment.


I note that Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said, in response to the motion passed at his party's conference, that Australia must comply with its international obligations. Mr Joyce went on to say that we must not abscond from the reality of our economics. Our international obligations include the Paris agreement. The world's first comprehensive climate agreement has three aims: holding the increase in temperatures below two degrees, increasing our ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and improving financing pathways for low greenhouse gas emission energy development. Mr Joyce would be well advised to consider that our economics are intractably linked to our international obligations and that investment in renewable energy makes sense for both the economics and the environment.


Even still, the reality of our economics is that, regardless of government intervention, the price per unit for renewable energy is on a downward trajectory and the banks are refusing to finance new coal-powered generation. The reality of our economics is that, under a business-as-usual situation, prices will continue to rise but, with a sector-wide approach through a clean energy target, prices will fall and reliability will increase. It's time for Mr Turnbull to show some leadership on energy. Labor has offered and is still offering to work with the government to find middle ground and set a place for a credible, low-carbon energy policy that will take us into the future in Australia.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:32):  The Attorney-General has very coyly referred to the coalition as having 'differing opinions' on renewables. It almost makes it sound like his colleagues aren't tearing each other to bits the moment the subject comes up. 'Differing opinions' makes it sound a little bit more like the Oxford debating society, but, based on the weekend reporting, one suspects that the situation is a bit more like Game of Thrones. If we're very honest about it, differing opinions don't generally induce the total policy paralysis that we are seeing from the government on energy. So let's call it what it actually is. We have full-throated disagreement between half-hearted environmentalists over in the moderates and the vociferous climate denialists of the hard Right.


It is becoming very clear that the job of the Prime Minister and the energy minister, Mr Frydenberg, of getting a clean energy target through the coalition party room is becoming more and more difficult every day. An anonymous source told the newspaper after the first coalition party room meeting on this that Finkel was dead. Unfortunately, it looks like he might be right. Unfortunately, for all of the boosters over there who would like to return to a 1970s version of Australian industry policy, the problem is that none of the participants in Australian industry are investing in coal. And there is a really good reason for that. It is because the numbers simply don't add up. The world has moved on and technology has moved on.


Oliver Yates, the CEO of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, told a Senate committee that I sat on that he wouldn't invest in ultra-supercritical coal plants because it wouldn't be a good use of taxpayer funds. AIG wrote in February:


… new-for-old replacement of our coal fleet does not look like a good solution for price, reliability or the environment…


And, critically, they said this:


Electricity sector investors are unlikely to finance a new coal-fired power station in Australia again.


If coal was truly clean or cost effective, industry would back it. But the problem is: it isn't. Bloomberg, recognised as a global authority on these questions, provide a range of costs, but, for the levelised cost of electricity for wind in terms of dollars per megawatt hour, they say wind comes in at $118 per megawatt hour; solar comes in at $140; gas is still only $90 a megawatt hour. But ultra-supercritical coal, the preferred technology of many of the people on the other side, comes in at $203 per megawatt hour. And if you add carbon capture and storage to that, which you must do if you have any hope of reaching Australia's threadbare emissions targets, it comes out at $352 a megawatt hour. Once you do that, once you add in carbon capture and storage, coal is not the cheapest technology on the market. It is absolutely the most expensive. It is just under three times as much per megawatt hour as the most expensive estimates that are available for wind power.


The thing is: because of the enormous global expenditure on R&D in renewables and in storage technology, renewables are going to become cheaper and more effective in the coming years. Over the past seven years the cost of wind has dropped over 50 per cent and solar PV costs have dropped by 80 per cent. The technology is in transition. We have an enormous opportunity to adjust our arrangements in the national electricity market to respond to that, to use these technologies and to build a resilient system that can cope with the future. But all we get, instead, is a kind of hankering for an old-style of energy generation that doesn't make sense to business and doesn't make sense for the country.


If we have a problem, it's not actually that businesses are unwilling to finance coal. The problem is, instead, this: businesses lack the certainty to invest in any of the other options that would make sense. The business community has been crying out for certainty for years, and that has intensified since late last year. It's a cry that's reinforced in the report from Dr Finkel. It's also reinforced in the two reports from AEMO that have come through in the last seven or eight days. In their report on electricity forecasting insights, they note that energy system is going through a significant transition. I'm going to quote them. They say:


There is an important opportunity—


And there's that word again, 'opportunity', because it is our big opportunity—


for new market and regulatory arrangements, improved system planning, and new market, network, and non-network solutions, to support an orderly transition…


I am a former public servant and I'm fluent in public sector language. I can translate this for the benefit of senators and anyone else who might be listening. When you put it simply, AEMO are simply saying we need to adjust the market rules to make the market work so that we can benefit from new technologies. But what's more important is what they don't say. They don't say in their report that the solution is for government to get in and get its hands dirty in managing just one asset. They don't say the government should buy the Liddell power station. They do note in their advice to the Commonwealth government that, prior to the closure of Liddell, additional resources will be required, but they're very clear that 'most stakeholders see changes to market rules as the most economically efficient way to remedy this deficiency'.


Wouldn't you think that the idea that the market might be the way to respond to a shortfall in supply might get a little bit of traction from the Liberal Party? But there's no interest in that conversation. There's no interest at all because, presumably, the last sensible people in the Liberal Party are so tied up dealing with Mr Christensen, Senator Canavan and Mr Joyce and their obsession with returning to coal and managing that problem that they can't see what's right in front of them—that there are market solutions for this and there is an industry ready to invest, but there needs to be serious reform of the National Electricity Market to do so.


I know that coalition senators frequently come into this place and point to China. They like to point to China's reliance on fossil fuels and say: 'Look how big China is. Look how dependent it is on thermal generation. See how pointless it would be for Australia to participate in any kind of emissions reduction activity.' I want to point to recent reports coming out of China, because, unlike us, the Chinese are embracing the technologies that are emerging. China is ramping up its investment in renewable energy, planning for the future and planning to meet the growing demands on its electricity system through investment in new technologies.


In the first half of 2017, renewable sources—wind, solar, water—made up almost 70 per cent of new capacity in China's electricity system. I don't pretend that they're not coming off a low base. They have an electricity system highly reliant on thermal generation. But the new investment is overwhelmingly in renewables. That is because the Chinese government can see the writing on the wall and they know that they need to make the transition. They are going to do that as part of a commitment to a global solution for climate change. Colleagues, we have an enormous opportunity to get out in front of the herd, to make change before change is foisted upon us and to build an electricity system at this point in time when new investment is required to build the technologies of the future, not stick our heads in the sand and stare longingly at the past.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2017-09-11,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:42):  It's quite amazing to hear the other side talking about economic and affordable electricity. Amazingly, Senator McAllister talked about China. Acting Deputy President Bernardi, you come from South Australia. I know that. I was born there. I didn't know you in my younger days, but I'm very familiar with your state. What has South Australia done? There has been a huge reliance on wind generation and selling electricity cheap because of the huge subsidies on wind turbines.


Mr Acting Deputy President, do you realise that an average wind turbine at three megawatts per hour, running for eight hours a day, 365 days a year will attract around $700,000? One turbine equals $700,000 in renewable energy certificates a year. That's a pretty good subsidy to get from the people and the businesses who use electricity, from anyone who is hooked to the network, from anyone who has 240 volt to the house. That is most Australians. They are paying for that: $700,000 for one wind turbine. That means that the coal-fired generators can't compete. What happened to Port Augusta's privatised coal-fired power station? They shut it down. No money in that. They blew it up, literally.


It is amazing that Senator McAllister talked about how the Chinese are doing a great job with their renewables. Let me make this point. As I speak to you now, 621 units of coal-fired generation are being constructed around the world. You might ask: what's a unit? If you go to the Hunter Valley and visit Liddell or Bayswater power stations: they are both four-unit generating plants. You will see the four big cement cooling towers. Often the Greens and those opposite will say you can see the pollution coming out of the top of those big cement towers. It's actually water vapour, the same as clouds. It's not pollution at all. 


I visited Liddell a few years ago. They put in a solar thermal plant—I think it was about $16 million—to assist the coal, to reduce their carbon emissions. Well, between the two stations, it reduced their carbon emissions by one-sixteenth of one per cent, which is not much at all for $16 million. Anyway, I was in Tonga just recently, talking to a bloke who designed and was a key player in putting the solar thermal in there, and he said that now it's been mothballed; it no longer exists. When I was there, the big risk they had was cleaning the top of the plant all the time. The dust was settling on it. If a hailstorm was coming over the hill, they had to turn all the panels upside down so the hail wouldn't break them. Here we are talking about reliable and economic supply of electricity, and of course the best thing to do that is coal, as we've had all my lifetime. 


China is now constructing 299 new units of coal-fired generation, as I speak. Those 299 units will produce 677 million tonnes of CO2 a year. That 677 million tonnes extra is more than the whole of Australia produces. Just by their additional 299 units of coal-fired generation—adding to some 2,100 units they already have in place and operating—they are going to put out more CO2 than the whole of Australia. Mr Acting Deputy President, I'm going to give you a curly question. What do you think they're going to burn in these coal-fired generation plants? They're going to burn coal. Believe it or not, they'll burn coal Where will they get the coal from? They have the choice of getting much cleaner black coal from Australia, unless we shut down our coalmines, as the Greens and many in the Labor Party want to see. I don't know why the CFMEU finances and backs the Greens and Labor Party when they're trying to shut all those CFMEU workers out of a job. China is going to buy our clean coal or go to Indonesia. Even China itself has huge production of coal. China a few years ago was a net exporter of coal. One year it imported 32 million tonnes and exported 33 million tonnes. Its coal is nowhere near the quality of Australian coal, but it is going to use it. 


India is building 132 new units of coal-fired generation, alongside China's 299. That will produce an extra 288 million tonnes of CO2. But we're going to change the world from Australia here, you see! We've got just 73 units of coal-fired generation. Those opposite want to wind them down, shut them down, get rid of them and basically spread the problems of South Australia Australia wide. That is what the Andrews government wants to do in Victoria, with a 50 per cent renewable target. Queensland is talking the same. 'Let's make electricity expensive'—a $700,000 subsidy. 


I'm amazed about the people who are saying the renewable energy certificate market is going to come down. I've been looking all my life for people who can tell me where markets are going. It's just a fact of genius to know where the markets are going in the future. I want to know where the Australian dollar is going—to help our exports if it's going down or harm our exports if it's going up. I want to know where the ASX will be in couple of years time, because I've got my super invested and I've got to retire in a couple of years time. And those opposite know where the markets are going. That is simply amazing! That is dreaming. That is just not right. The markets will go where demand and supply take them. 


If we want electricity prices to go down, we need good base supply so that, when the hot weather is on around much of Australia, in January-February, people—especially our elderly and those in our aged-care facilities—can turn their air conditioners them on and afford to turn them on, and likewise with their heaters in wintertime, in the freezing cold. I, like you, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, know what it's like in South Australia with that cold south-easterly coming off the South Pole—it can get pretty fresh at times. That's when you need to have the heaters on and to be able to afford to put those heaters on. 


Quite amazingly, there is this whole story about renewables being the only economic way to go, the best way to go. Hydro is a great way of generating electricity. As the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Joyce, has said, we want to build new dams. When those dams are built, no doubt they will have hydroelectricity generators at the base of those dams. But watch the Greens. As soon as the site is picked to build a dam, in come the Greens: 'No, there's a frog there. You can't build the dam there. It'll destroy the habitat of the frog,' even though it'll be storing more water, as we have to do in this country, especially as the population grows, and for industry and agriculture. But the protesters will be out there: 'You can't build a dam here.' The response will be: 'But we're going to put hydroelectricity at the base of it.' They will say: 'No, you can't do that. You'll upset the habitat of the frog.' 


We've seen it all before—these people with their green religion. This is what their green religion says: 'Come follow me and I will lead you to the land of poverty.' That is what their green religion is: make everything expensive, have our businesses not able to compete overseas and make electricity prices go up. The reason those opposite want to see this clean energy target set is for their politics. It means that when they go to the next election they will not have to promote their carbon tax again—as they have promised to bring back in the carbon tax that most of Australia despises. They will put up the electricity prices even more and change the planet while all these coal-fired generation units are being constructed around the world. They'll say, 'We're going to change the planet from here.' Unless we get a big tent over this country, we're not going to do that. 


Here's the situation: we need affordable, reliable electricity, and coal will be a major source of that for decades to come. In Australia we are swimming in coal and gas, and in our nuclear efficiencies and capability. We have probably more energy per capita than any other country in the world, and our energy prices are going up because of that green religion—that 'Come follow me and I will lead you to the land of poverty.' That's what it means.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (16:51):  I rise to participate in this debate today on renewable energy. Of course, this is an issue as vitally important to my home state of South Australia as it is for the rest of the country—and, indeed, the globe—because we are confronted with the very real consequences of global warming. We are confronted every day by the fact that too much pollution is creating changes in weather patterns, such as the hurricane that we have seen devastate the Americas only in the last few days. We know that unless we get a handle on dangerous global warming, things are only going to get worse. What we have from the government is just more desire to flog coal. Let me put it here clearly today: coal is dead; finished. It is time to get your head out of the sand and start investing in the energy of the future, energy that is here already, systems and technologies that are ready to go. 


The fact that this government wants to keep spending billions of taxpayer dollars propping up the failed coal industry and making climate change worse, making severe weather events worse, is absolutely criminal. We all know that one of the best things we can do to reduce carbon emissions, reduce the negative impact of climate change, is to fund clean, renewable energy sources. And we could be doing that today by investing in battery storage. One of the things that the Prime Minister could do right now is change the settlement periods for the spot price in the energy market from 30 minutes to five. Electricity prices would drop instantly—that's what the market regulator and the commissions say. Don't wait 3½ years to do it. Get it done now and stop funding the lunacy that is the coal industry. Taxpayer money should not be spent keeping coal-fired power stations open or exporting more coal overseas to burn the planet.

Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (16:54):  Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, I have noticed, on occasion, a wry smile pass your face during this debate, indicating you have enjoyed the debate so far this afternoon. I hope you enjoy my contribution as much as you have enjoyed the previous contributions.


We are here today debating this MPI because on the weekend a grassroots political party, our valued coalition partner, the National Party, engaged in a grassroots political debate about a weighty policy issue facing Australia. Unlike others who have spoken in the debate so far, I'm not going to condemn the National Party for confronting these issues; I'm not going to condemn branch members from the National Party for raising these issues. They are doing exactly what they should do as active citizens in our democracy, helping their political party to deliberate on these very weighty and difficult issues. I congratulate them for tackling this issue, for proposing a solution, and for debating it in such a constructive way.


I also want to congratulate my colleague Senator Williams for his excellent contribution to this debate. I particularly want to single out his fact-filled response to Senator McAllister's claims about China. In a sense, Senator McAllister is right: China is investing at a record level in renewable energy. But Senator Williams is also right: it is also investing at a record level in coal. It is investing in coal by building new coal-fired power stations, and by retrofitting existing coal-fired power stations to make them more efficient and to extend their life. China is investing in all forms of energy on a massive scale, because they are a country with massive energy needs and they need to increase their energy. They have taken what you could perhaps call an energy-agnostic approach, or an 'all of the above' approach, and they are investing in every form of energy available. Curiously, that's similar to the approach that this government has taken. This government adopt an 'all of the above' energy policy approach, where we are willing to invest in and support all technologies that can help meet Australia's energy needs. So it was curious to see Senator McAllister raising China as an example contrary to the direction the Australian government is taking.


The statement of the MPI listed for debate today is really a statement of the obvious. Is there anybody who opposes the statement: 'Investment in renewable energy, which makes economic and environmental sense? In fact, is 'renewable' even a necessary word to have in that sentence? We all support investment in energy which makes economic and environmental sense, or at least we should. The sad fact is that some participants in this debate don't support the investment in energy which makes environmental and economic sense if it clashes with their ideological opposition to and hatred of traditional sources of thermal energy, including coal and gas. We saw a very good example of that earlier from Senator Hanson-Young. Of course, I suspect what the Labor Party are getting at in their motion is not really that we should all support investment in renewable energy which makes economic and environmental sense; I suspect what they are really getting at is that we should support investment in renewable energy whether it makes economic sense or not. It all depends, of course, what we mean by economic and environmental sense.


For the record, I should say that I'm excited by the technological developments and evolution in renewable technology. I think there's been some fantastic progress already made, and there's no doubt that there have been significant improvements in the efficiency of renewable energy, and that is a really positive thing. As a sidenote, there have been improvements in the generation of energy not only in the renewable space but also in the traditional forms of energy production. That is why we have seen the advent of so called high-efficiency, low-emissions, ultrasupercritical coal-fired power stations, which generate energy far more efficiently, far more effectively, and with a lower environmental burden than their predecessors did.


But although there have been some exciting developments in renewable technology, and although there no doubt will be more in the future, I think we also have to acknowledge that there are some limitations to renewable energy today. We should be honest and confront that. One of those limitations is their inability to provide reliable, consistent baseload energy, and we have seen this most powerfully in South Australia. As we all know, on a great day—a windy day—the South Australian wind farms can produce up to 120 per cent of South Australia's energy needs and export its energy elsewhere. But we also know that, on a bad day—a day that's not windy enough, or too windy—South Australia's wind-energy generators provide no energy at all to South Australia, and put it in a very perilous state indeed. Until we can figure out how we can efficiently and, crucially, affordably store energy generated by renewable energy power forms on a large scale, then it can never supply all of our baseload power needs. Obviously, the government is taking a really important and bold step in this direction by supporting the further development of the Snowy hydro scheme, which will allow it to store more energy and supply it at times of critical need. But we all admit that that's not going to be a silver bullet and, on its own, won't solve this problem. 


The reality is that renewable energy today, as we know it, is intermittent and unreliable. It doesn't provide that traditional and reliable baseload power that only thermal power like coal and gas does. So, if we're talking about the economic sense that we need to justify an investment in energy, there is always going to be, and there will be for some time, a big role to play for traditional power sources, I think, for the foreseeable future. 


I think it's also important that we consider cost. There's a very common refrain in this debate—and we saw it a bit from Senator McAllister earlier—that renewables are cost-competitive or sometimes even, they claim, cheaper than traditional forms of electricity. And, if that were the case, that would be a wonderful thing. But the same people who say that renewable energy is cost-competitive or, indeed, cost-advantageous compared to traditional forms of energy also say—whenever anybody suggests that perhaps we should look at the generous subsidies that the renewable energy industry has received in recent years in Australia—that, if we touch it in any way, let alone scrap it, the sky will fall in and the renewable energy industry, as we know it, will collapse. Now, those two ideas are contradictory: they cannot both be true. If renewable energy was competitive or indeed cheaper than traditional forms of energy, it would need no support through subsidies or government mandates and it would exist healthily and on its own perfectly fine, if they were removed. 


The truth is: we know that renewable energy does require a lot of assistance in order to be competitive and, hopefully, with technological development and change in the future, it will be able to stand on its own two feet. But it is false to say that it is able to do so now. 


Another very common refrain in this debate is that what we lack today is certainty and, if we provided certainty for energy industry investors, these problems would be solved. The truth is that we do have certainty for some energy industry investors and we have a lack of certainty for others. The energy industry investors, who have certainty, are those who want to invest in renewable energy, and that's why billions of dollars are being invested in renewable energy in this country year after year after year. At the moment, it's at record levels. They've got the certainty of knowing that, if they make an investment in renewable energy, they will be in part protected by the government to ensure that they get a good return on their investment. Those subsidies and protections in the form of policies, like the renewable energy target, ensure that they've got their certainty. So there has been no shortage of investment in renewable energy. 


There has, however, been a shortage of investment in traditional forms of energy generation, and that's why, for about a decade, no new coal-fired or gas-fired power stations have been built in Australia. They lack certainty because they know there is a great risk that in the future there will be a Labor government and that that Labor government will hit them with a carbon tax, an emissions trading scheme or an emissions intensity scheme. They know at some point that that will come and, when they have to get a return on their investment over 30 years, that's a very serious prospect indeed. So these are the people who have lacked the certainty to invest, these are the people who have been absent from the market. It is telling that even South Australia's Labor Premier Jay Weatherill recognises this problem and, in order to get around it, has proposed the extraordinary step of effectively renationalising the electricity industry in his home state by building a government-funded, gas-fired power station. 


So the idea that, if we provide even more certainty than already exists for renewable energy investors, this problem will somehow be solved, that prices will come down and that we'll have the reliability we need, is a total furphy. If you want to get prices down, you need to provide certainty for everyone, and that includes our traditional forms of power generation.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (17:03):  Imagine how the men and women in what used to be Holden's factory in South Australia feel watching the debate around coal and renewable energy. I'm glad I don't have to explain why Holden closed its factories after the coalition government refused to support them with taxpayers' money. They've been watching the government falling over itself to change the rules to subsidise coalmines and power plants, wondering why it's one set of rules for one industry and another set for another. Obviously, I need to ask the question: didn't Holden give enough political donations?


We set up rules for how the energy market will operate and then we ask people to invest based on those rules. Then we change the rules and wonder why nobody wants to invest. It's not the fault of the renewable energy target that nobody wants to invest in new coal-fired power stations—and, when I say nobody, I mean nobody outside the Nationals party room. Blaming the success of one technology for the decline of another makes no sense when what's needed is a mix of all of the above. 


Renewables and coal have to coexist. This isn't like the rise of CDs, marking the decline of cassettes. We need all of the above. Any government with foresight would have seen the problems we're experiencing today coming a mile away. Instead of shoring up Australia's energy security, governments on both sides have preferred to play the leadership version of musical chairs. For a party obsessed with opinion polls, they've done a shocking job of listening to the polls telling them the price of electricity is one of the biggest issues concerning all Australians. If you really want to help with electricity prices, stop fighting and arguing and start working together. Energy policy needs to be bipartisan, and, as long as it is not, there will be question marks over its future, let alone its investment. The higher the uncertainty, the higher of price. Stop blaming renewables for your failure to reach consensus. The problem isn't your subsidies; it is your party room.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:05):  The reality is that coal is dead. We have Engie closing Hazelwood. They don't see any future in coal. We have AGL, whose stated aim is to get out of coal. They have absolutely committed to closing down Liddell, that old clunker of a power station, because they understand that coal is dead. And yet here we have a government trying to conjure up some sort of spell, like a medieval wizard trying to bring coal back to life. The reality is that coal has no long-term future. Today, we learnt that the government, through Efic, a finance body, is going to throw good money after bad to try to continue to fund fossil fuel projects. They're doing what they can to pressure AGL into keeping Liddell open. The reality is that we are seeing the decline of an industry, a whole sector in transition, and this government doing everything it can to stop that transition. They don't have a national energy policy; they've got some slogans. Their policy is to try to keep these old clunkers going for a few more years in an effort to win a few votes and try to wedge the Labor Party. This is instead of acknowledging the reality that any comprehensive energy policy needs to recognise that there has to be more investment in renewables like solar and wind. There has to be an investment in storage like battery technology. Batteries are a game-changer, and yet here we have a government sticking their heads in the sand.


They have a go at the mob over here, calling him 'Red Bill', with allusions to the Labor Party being socialists. Well, the mob over there is prepared to throw taxpayer money at keeping this old clunker of a coal-fired power station open—unbelievable! It is absolutely remarkable that we are seeing a Liberal-National Party government that are a wholly owned subsidiary of the coal lobby. They have been captured by the coal lobby. Their energy policy is written and authorised by the coal lobby, thanks to those billion-dollar donations. The reality is we need to shut down coal in an orderly way and bring in more solar and wind. It is about energy efficiency and demand management, and that's how we make the transition to a clean, renewable economy.


Debate adjourned.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:08):  I present the second interim report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References committee on the impact of defence training activities and facilities on rural and regional communities.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator GALLACHER:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I seek leave to have the tabling statement incorporated in Hansard and to make some additional comments.


Leave granted.




The document read as follows—



I rise as Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee to speak on the second interim report for the committee's inquiry into the impact of Defence training activities and facilities on rural and regional communities. 


The committee has decided to table interim reports after regional hearings so local communities don't have to wait until the final report from the committee for the issues in their area to be highlighted. This report covers public hearings in Rockhampton and Townsville. 


The committee was pleased with the level of engagement by the Department of Defence during these hearings and the willingness of officers to acknowledge that there is room for improvement in their engagement with local communities.




Policy framework



The 2016 Defence White Paper sets out a number of investment projects in QLD particularly upgrading the Shoalwater Bay Training Area, redeveloping the Townsville Field Training Area and upgrading facilities at RAAF Base Townsville and Lavarack Barracks. 


In addition, there is the investment from Singapore of up to $2.25 billion in the expansion of the Shoalwater Bay and Townsville Training Areas. 


Government ministers have emphasised the new investment in Defence will create jobs across the regions and bring benefits to local businesses and communities. 


These policies and statements from the government have generated expectations that regional Australia will be able to benefit directly and indirectly through the participation of local businesses, particularly SMEs, in building defence capability.




Focus of the committee



The focus of the committee has been to investigate whether regions, local communities and businesses have sufficient awareness of and effective access to information about the plans to upgrade training facilities so that they can be in a position to offer goods and services. 


The committee also explored communication by Defence with stakeholders in the local communities who will be affected by upgrades or expansion as well as communication about existing training activities. In addition to looking at channels of communication the committee spoke with businesses currently working with Defence in an effort to provide guidance for other businesses looking to engage.




Rockhampton hearing



The committee held a hearing in Rockhampton on 12 July 2017. The Shoalwater Bay Training Area is a category 1 training area with Rockhampton as the closet regional centre. Exercise Talisman Sabre is a biennial Australia and US training activity conducted at Shoalwater Bay and other sites in the NT.


The committee was pleased to hear the overall message that the Defence presence is welcomed and supported. The committee would like to see Defence capitalise on this goodwill as well as the local knowledge, experience and skills. 


The committee recognises that Defence cannot source everything it needs locally as do the local communities. However, the clear message from the hearing was that local businesses wish to have the opportunity to be fairly considered when Defence is sourcing goods and services. 




Communications mechanisms 



The committee heard about a number of regional forums such as Capricorn Enterprise which engages with Defence and provides information and workshops to develop local capacity. In order to look specifically at opportunities in relation to the Singaporean investment the Capricornia Business Advisory Alliance has been established. The committee was pleased to hear that Defence is open to being more involved in localised processes. 




Exercises 



A key issue raised with the committee was communication regarding exercises. It was explained to the committee that it is crucial for landowners to be notified of exercises conducted in airspace as some graziers have light aircraft or helicopters, or engage contractors, for mustering. In addition, there was a call for better consultation for noise and plane activities over animals, especially cattle at weaning time. Defence acknowledged the impact of aircraft noise on the local community and outlined the steps being undertaken to address the issue.




Land acquisition



A key issue for the Rockhampton community was communication about the proposed expansion of training areas and land acquisition. The community was profoundly disappointed about the processes undertaken and level of consultation by Defence. Witnesses were also concerned that Defence engagement had only been with the landowners, and local business which would be potentially affected by the expansion plans, were not considered to be stakeholders. Defence indicated that they have learnt from the process and advised that a local community engagement officer has now been appointed who will be based in Townsville. 




Land management 



Land management of training areas was another issues raised with the committee. Defence confirmed that two people used to be based locally in order to deal with issues around the Rockhampton estate. They were relocated to Townsville around 2 years ago but are still available to be contacted about issues. However, Defence indicated that they will review the arrangements going forward in light of Talisman sabre exercises and the partnership with the Singaporeans. 




Indigenous business 



The committee heard about limited engagement with Indigenous businesses and that the size of the businesses could be a factor affecting the level of engagement with Defence. Defence noted the growth in Defence Indigenous procurement in the last two years and spoke about recent initiatives. 




Townsville hearing



The committee held a hearing in Townsville on 14 July 2017. Townsville is a major base for defence facilities and hosts four major Defence establishments. The message was that Townsville was proud of its historical and current military role and there is strong support to sustain and expand Townsville's capability as a base for ADF operations and personnel. 




Communication mechanisms



The committee heard about some communication mechanisms in place which are working well to facilitate local business engagement with Defence and planned arrangements designed to enhance engagement. In particular, the Townsville City deal will improve visibility for local businesses about defence industry investment in Townsville and encourage local business involvement. A Townsville Defence Liaison Officer position has been created and the council is in the process of appointing someone to that position. 


The committee was told about a Defence community stakeholder group where there may be an opportunity to strengthen the agenda beyond relationship building. 


The committee was please to hear that Defence has no issues being involved in localised communication processes. 




Business experience



The committee heard from some larger companies which had secured contracts with Defence and were utilising local businesses where possible. These companies generally indicated that they have had positive interactions with Defence. However, smaller businesses advised the committee of the challenges they face in getting information about opportunities and navigating Defence's procurement processes. 




Engaging with Singapore



A cross departmental group involving all levels of government has been set up to discuss preparation for capturing opportunities from the Australia-Singapore Military Training Initiative. This is a semi formal operational level group convened by AusIndustry in partnership with Defence representatives. It looks at providing and sharing information, raising issues about how to get companies Defence ready, how to capture the opportunities and how to manage expectations. 




Rates



While the contribution of Defence was acknowledged Defence does not pay rates. The loss of rateable land due to the presence of a Defence establishment and the impact this has on council's income base was raised. This effect would be exacerbated by any further uptake of land by Defence, noting the burden placed on smaller councils. 


In particular, the burden placed on local government managing large road networks which are impacted by the size and volume of equipment operated by Defence was mentioned. It was noted that this will only increase with an enhanced presence. 




Land acquisition



Land acquisition was also raised with the committee in Townsville by a number of graziers affected by the proposed expansion. All were highly critical of the failure of Defence to adequately consult with the local community on the proposal which resulted in a high level of stress and anxiety. Defence acknowledged the evidence from the graziers and confirmed that there would be no acquisition of land unless the seller is willing. The broader economic and social impacts on the region from the proposed land acquisition were also raised. Defence indicated that there was no automatic process for compensation but it would be open to anyone to make a claim. 




Recommendations



The committee has made recommendations: 


to ensure the most efficient communication mechanisms are in place for the most effective flow of information which may generate potential business opportunities;


to ensure as much information about upcoming training exercises is being disseminated;


to provide a contact point regarding local exercises on an ongoing basis;


to make information available to local communities about Defence expenditure in the area;


to commission an independent economic impact assessment of the loss of rateable land which would result from the proposed expansion plans.


The committee has welcomed the recent announcement by the Minister for Defence of the Local Industry Capability Plan pilot which aims to provide local industry with more opportunity to participate in major Defence infrastructure projects. Two of the three pilot projects are in QLD: the Shoalwater Bay Training Area Redevelopment and the Townsville Field Training Area Mid-Term refresh. The committee looks forward to seeing the outcomes of this new approach. 


Once again I thank committee members for the bipartisan approach to this inquiry. In August the committee held hearings in Darwin and Katherine and there will be a separate interim report to cover those hearings. 


I commend the report to the Senate.




Senator GALLACHER:
  This report originated out of some representations from the Upper Spencer Gulf mayors who came to Canberra and said: 'We have a great disposition towards Defence. We love them in our community, and they do bring some economic activity, and we would like to see it improve.' Out of that sort of conversation, and given that Cultana was on the expansion footing, so to speak, we sought the Senate's leave to do a report. And how we've been conducting the report is quite straightforward and simple. We are producing an interim report at the end of each series of visits and/or hearings. So we produced a report in the Upper Spencer Gulf. This report is in relation to Townsville and Rockhampton. We followed a very similar framework and format.


Basically, there is good policy here. Right at the minister and the Prime Minister level, there are good, transparent statements about what should happen. There are clear, unequivocal, concise statements about the effect investment in regional economies and regional communities should have—a net positive outcome. We thought that we would find plenty of evidence that this is true. Disturbingly, the evidence isn't quite as clear. The evidence is that the money has been spent, but the evidence that we're seeing is that it's not sticking, for want of a better description, to the local economies and/or communities. We're making some abundant and clear recommendations in respect to this. I think it's really important to put on the public record that the Minister for Defence has got onto the front foot, particularly in the statement she made in the Northern Territory recently, with smaller packages of work and a better effort to get all of the opportunities from competitive tension from good local businesses into the equation. I think that is very good work.


The simple and clear recommendations we're making here is that the most efficient communication mechanism should be in place. There should be an effective flow of communication between the respective entities, which will generate potential business opportunities. We need to ensure as much information about training exercises is disseminated as possible. We need a contact point for local communities and local businesses, with either economic opportunities to pursue, environmental concerns to pursue or just some general information. They need to be abundant and clear, and easy to find and easy to contact. I think, importantly, in the Rockhampton area there's a need for an independent economic impact assessment of the loss of rateable land which may occur, if the huge expansion that is proposed there goes ahead in the format that it is in.


The evidence is really clear that the local communities are very, very supportive of Defence. They are keen to take opportunities economically and in all areas of value. But it's not quite happening. It isn't quite happening. The transparency that's required is not there. The tier 1 contractors rarely win the work. The job of engaging the local community actually goes to the tier 1 contractor. It is not coming to fruition. I wasn't going to be at all political about this particular inquiry because I think it's very useful work done by a bipartisan committee that is delivering good, effective review processes. But I read in Adelaide's The Advertiser today that the Department of Defence is deserting regional SA—it is from no less than the member for Grey, Mr Rowan Ramsey. He is quoted in the paper as saying:


REGIONAL Australian businesses, particularly those based in South Australia’s Upper Spencer Gulf, are being ""ripped off on a regular basis"" when it comes to securing Department of Defence work…


That's what he is reported as saying. I'm not used to seeing Mr Ramsey use such language myself, but he's reported as saying we've got a real problem.


Suffice to say the evidence we are collecting is widespread. The concerns are widely held and deeply felt. We need to do a better job here. The investment is critical to Australia's defence and Australia's economic future. To get regional businesses more in tune with the opportunities in Defence is good for regional employment, it's good for all of the tier 1 sectors that we're looking at and, I think, it's in tune with the Prime Minister and the defence minister's policies.


We look forward to pursuing this inquiry through to its fruition, so to speak. We look to having, along the way, actually achieved some regional impacts in the economy, environment and the social cohesion around the Defence networks. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted.

The loss of rateable land due to the presence of a Defence establishment and the impact this has on council's income base was raised. This effect would be exacerbated by any further uptake of land by Defence, noting the burden placed on smaller councils. 


In particular, the burden placed on local government managing large road networks which are impacted by the size and volume of equipment operated by Defence was mentioned. It was noted that this will only increase with an enhanced presence. 




Land acquisition



Land acquisition was also raised with the committee in Townsville by a number of graziers affected by the proposed expansion. All were highly critical of the failure of Defence to adequately consult with the local community on the proposal which resulted in a high level of stress and anxiety. Defence acknowledged the evidence from the graziers and confirmed that there would be no acquisition of land unless the seller is willing. The broader economic and social impacts on the region from the proposed land acquisition were also raised. Defence indicated that there was no automatic process for compensation but it would be open to anyone to make a claim. 




Recommendations



The committee has made recommendations: 


to ensure the most efficient communication mechanisms are in place for the most effective flow of information which may generate potential business opportunities;


to ensure as much information about upcoming training exercises is being disseminated;


to provide a contact point regarding local exercises on an ongoing basis;


to make information available to local communities about Defence expenditure in the area;


to commission an independent economic impact assessment of the loss of rateable land which would result from the proposed expansion plans.


The committee has welcomed the recent announcement by the Minister for Defence of the Local Industry Capability Plan pilot which aims to provide local industry with more opportunity to participate in major Defence infrastructure projects. Two of the three pilot projects are in QLD: the Shoalwater Bay Training Area Redevelopment and the Townsville Field Training Area Mid-Term refresh. The committee looks forward to seeing the outcomes of this new approach. 


Once again I thank committee members for the bipartisan approach to this inquiry. In August the committee held hearings in Darwin and Katherine and there will be a separate interim report to cover those hearings. 


I commend the report to the Senate.




Senator GALLACHER:
  This report originated out of some representations from the Upper Spencer Gulf mayors who came to Canberra and said: 'We have a great disposition towards Defence. We love them in our community, and they do bring some economic activity, and we would like to see it improve.' Out of that sort of conversation, and given that Cultana was on the expansion footing, so to speak, we sought the Senate's leave to do a report. And how we've been conducting the report is quite straightforward and simple. We are producing an interim report at the end of each series of visits and/or hearings. So we produced a report in the Upper Spencer Gulf. This report is in relation to Townsville and Rockhampton. We followed a very similar framework and format.


Basically, there is good policy here. Right at the minister and the Prime Minister level, there are good, transparent statements about what should happen. There are clear, unequivocal, concise statements about the effect investment in regional economies and regional communities should have—a net positive outcome. We thought that we would find plenty of evidence that this is true. Disturbingly, the evidence isn't quite as clear. The evidence is that the money has been spent, but the evidence that we're seeing is that it's not sticking, for want of a better description, to the local economies and/or communities. We're making some abundant and clear recommendations in respect to this. I think it's really important to put on the public record that the Minister for Defence has got onto the front foot, particularly in the statement she made in the Northern Territory recently, with smaller packages of work and a better effort to get all of the opportunities from competitive tension from good local businesses into the equation. I think that is very good work.


The simple and clear recommendations we're making here is that the most efficient communication mechanism should be in place. There should be an effective flow of communication between the respective entities, which will generate potential business opportunities. We need to ensure as much information about training exercises is disseminated as possible. We need a contact point for local communities and local businesses, with either economic opportunities to pursue, environmental concerns to pursue or just some general information. They need to be abundant and clear, and easy to find and easy to contact. I think, importantly, in the Rockhampton area there's a need for an independent economic impact assessment of the loss of rateable land which may occur, if the huge expansion that is proposed there goes ahead in the format that it is in.


The evidence is really clear that the local communities are very, very supportive of Defence. They are keen to take opportunities economically and in all areas of value. But it's not quite happening. It isn't quite happening. The transparency that's required is not there. The tier 1 contractors rarely win the work. The job of engaging the local community actually goes to the tier 1 contractor. It is not coming to fruition. I wasn't going to be at all political about this particular inquiry because I think it's very useful work done by a bipartisan committee that is delivering good, effective review processes. But I read in Adelaide's The Advertiser today that the Department of Defence is deserting regional SA—it is from no less than the member for Grey, Mr Rowan Ramsey. He is quoted in the paper as saying:


REGIONAL Australian businesses, particularly those based in South Australia’s Upper Spencer Gulf, are being ""ripped off on a regular basis"" when it comes to securing Department of Defence work…


That's what he is reported as saying. I'm not used to seeing Mr Ramsey use such language myself, but he's reported as saying we've got a real problem.


Suffice to say the evidence we are collecting is widespread. The concerns are widely held and deeply felt. We need to do a better job here. The investment is critical to Australia's defence and Australia's economic future. To get regional businesses more in tune with the opportunities in Defence is good for regional employment, it's good for all of the tier 1 sectors that we're looking at and, I think, it's in tune with the Prime Minister and the defence minister's policies.


We look forward to pursuing this inquiry through to its fruition, so to speak. We look to having, along the way, actually achieved some regional impacts in the economy, environment and the social cohesion around the Defence networks. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted.

Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (21:47):  I rise this evening to congratulate the outstanding efforts of the Ballarat Basketball Association for their recent efforts in obtaining $10 million in federal funding for the expansion of the Ballarat Sports and Events Centre. While this was undoubtedly a team effort, there is one person in particular who I feel must be specifically congratulated. The substantial expansion project would not have received federal government funding if it hadn't been for the persistent, hard work of Mr Peter Eddy, and Peter Eddy's team at the Ballarat Basketball Association. This expansion project has been a long-held dream in the Ballarat community, and the countless hours of consultation, meetings and forums held by Mr Eddy and his team were instrumental in proving the case for the centre's proposed upgrade. Mr Eddy and his terrific leadership team have devoted themselves to this worthy cause of civic engagement and have been duly rewarded. Peter, you have my sincerest congratulations.


It is also incumbent upon me to offer my congratulations to the two major basketball teams in Ballarat, the Ballarat Miners and the Rush, who will undoubtedly be celebrating this wonderful announcement for federal funding. A special mention must go to the head coach of the Miners, Eric Hayes, and assistant coaches, Justin Fraser and Nathan Cooper-Brown, as well as team manager Brett Robinson; and head coach of the Rush, David Flint, and assistant coach Rob Baker, for their tremendous commitment in not only leading their teams but also supporting Peter and Basketball Ballarat in obtaining the funds. It has been a successful year for the club. Not only did they receive this very impressive grant; they were named the South East Australian Basketball League Club of the Year.


With the necessary funds now in the bank, the expansion project will see the construction of six new sports courts and a dramatic increase in audience capacity. This upgrade will lead to growth in participation in not only local, regional and state basketball but also netball, volleyball and badminton. The expanded facilities will support 222 weekly games, with a capacity to host more than 4,000 participants. The sports and events centre in Ballarat will allow Ballarat to retain large-scale tournaments and become the centrepiece of regional sporting competitions. 


What an excellent way to bring the community together to foster a healthy lifestyle and to instil the values of teamwork and sportsmanship for young Australians. Not only will the community in Ballarat thrive but so will the local and regional economy. The Building Better Regions Fund ensures that vital public funds are directed towards stimulating regional economies in a prudent and effective way. This expansion project is just one such project. The social and material benefits will add to Ballarat's character and to Ballarat's wealth, making it one of Victoria's premier regional cities. We all know that what is good for our regions is good for our state.


I would now like to extend my thanks to my parliamentary colleagues who assisted Ballarat Basketball during this journey. First of all, I would like to thank the Special Minister of State, the Hon. Scott Ryan, for the consultative work that he undertook for many, many years with the Ballarat Basketball Association. Before I was even elected to parliament, Minister Ryan was heavily involved in the Ballarat community and I know that he welcomes this very successful outcome. Alongside Minister Ryan, a very good friend of mine who not only represented Ballarat in the House of Representatives but also sat in this very chamber, the Hon. Michael Ronaldson, also deserves congratulations. 


Former Senator Ronaldson—Ronno—is one of Victoria's greatest advocates for regional communities and for a fit and healthy lifestyle. His support of the Ballarat Basketball Association and his unwavering promotion to provide the community of Ballarat with access to state-of-the-art sporting facilities has paid off. His vocal support to ensure that our regions get a fair share of the nation's wealth is to be commended. This is a terrific time for Ronno. Not only is his home town receiving a boost to its local economy; it is receiving this boost through one of his greatest passions, which is, of course, sport.


I look forward to watching Ballarat's sporting community grow into the future as it harnesses the opportunities that the upgraded sports and events centre provides. This is a great step forward for Australian sport, for Ballarat and for Victoria. I commend the project to you all and I thank the chamber for its time.
