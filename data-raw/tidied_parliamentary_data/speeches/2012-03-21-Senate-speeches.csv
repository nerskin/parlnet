Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:31):  I move:


That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent me from moving a motion, namely:


That the Senate calls on the Liberals and Nationals to condemn the defamatory comments regarding the Greens, Mr Drew Hutton, Greenpeace and others of their major supplicant, Mr Clive Palmer.



Senator Bernardi interjecting—




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Senator Bernardi says this is a joke. Well, it is—on them.




Senator Bernardi:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I did not say this is a joke; I said Bob Brown is a joke.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  He did say that this is a joke, then changed it. But I am not here to discuss what he has to say.




Senator Joyce:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. That is misleading. I am sitting right next to Senator Bernardi. He did not say, 'This is a joke'; he said, 'Bob Brown is a joke.'



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order. That is a debating point.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Well, aren't the Nationals on the back foot too? And so they should be. We had their major backer, Clive Palmer, this multibillionaire from Queensland, who is also a major backer of the Liberal National Party in Queensland, of Mr Campbell Newman—




Senator Abetz:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I was wondering whether Senator Brown could do us the courtesy of actually circulating the motion so we know what we are discussing.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It is a suspension of standing orders, and that is not required under the standing orders.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  However, I would be quite happy if the attendant would circulate the motion, which says:


That the Senate calls on the Liberals and Nationals to condemn—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Brown started when people were leaving the chamber. Perhaps I am premature, but I have not heard what he was talking about. I am terribly interested, because I have not had a good laugh for a while! Perhaps he could start again.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order. Senator Brown is in order.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  The Queensland senator was leaving the chamber when he should have been here attending to his business. The motion I propose to move says:


That the Senate calls on the Liberals—




Senator Cormann:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The Greens, together with the government, voted to gag debate on some important legislation, and the Greens are now preventing us from debating—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order; that is a debating point.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Mr Deputy President, thank you for sitting down another one of them. But they are in defence mode here this morning, and so they should be. They are on the back foot, because Clive Palmer, who I am told is just starting to withdraw parts of his statement—no doubt under pressure from them—yesterday went out and said:


We’ve just distributed, I’m sure you’ve seen it, ‘How to stop Queensland coal’ report—


That is a Greenpeace document—


which probably came out of Langley in the United States with the CIA.


He went on to say:


I think this is wrong. I think Drew Hutton should be ashamed that his document’s in there.


And so on. Let me tell you this, Mr Deputy President: here is the power behind the Campbell Newman Liberal National Party in Queensland—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Milne:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I ask that you call the Senate to order, because it is outrageous that we cannot even hear— 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Milne:
  Even on the point of order they cannot be quiet.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Milne. Before I call Senator Brown, could senators on my left, in particular, come to order. Senator Brown has the right to be heard.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Yes, they are braying like a lot of donkeys in retreat, and they have been made to look donkeys by their major supplicant, Mr Clive Palmer. But there is no repudiation from this lot. They stand by what Clive Palmer had to say, even as he withdraws at least part of it—and, of course, so he should. I have no doubt he has had overnight legal advice on some of the things he said. But let me say this in response to them and to Mr Clive Palmer, who is part of them. There will be no Greens candidates withdrawing from this election campaign. Why? Because Clive Palmer is right about one thing: the Greens are the real value option rising for the Queensland voters this Saturday.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I know a lot of latitude is allowed for a motion to suspend standing orders, but, when—as is plainly the case now—it is evident that Senator Brown is abusing the process as well as wasting the time of the Senate by making silly debating points, you really ought to call him to order on the question of relevance. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I thank you, Senator Brandis. There has been a lot of latitude allowed in suspension of standing order debates, and that will continue. Senator Brown, you have the call. 




Senator BOB BROWN:
  You are absolutely right yet again, Deputy President. At three days out from an election, this multibillionaire—no doubt after consulta­tions with the Liberal National Party—is injecting himself into an election campaign to try and stymie the Greens. Why is that? He at least recognises that the Greens are the best value for the voters of Queensland this Saturday. Yesterday I said: 'Well, Mr Palmer, speaking for the Liberal National Party and for Campbell Newman—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my left!




Senator BOB BROWN:
  The fact is that Mr Palmer has not taken on the star Greens candidate, Mr Adam Stone, who is standing in Mount Coot-tha. Why not? Because the Liberal National Party cannot match the policy suite of the Greens, let alone the influence that they are having put on them by Mr Clive Palmer, Gina Rinehart and this whole suite of foreign backers of the massive coal industry which is sucking jobs out of the Queensland economy. Mr Palmer's own consultants show that just one of his coalmines in the Galilee Basin—and I was up there with Senator Larissa Waters after talking with Mr Adam Stone, the candidate for Mount Coot-tha, just a fortnight ago—that single coalmine promoted by this Liberal National Party—because why wouldn't they: they're in bed with Mr Clive Palmer—will suck 2,000 jobs out of the Queensland—




Senator Joyce:
  Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: I really have to pull him up on that. It is interesting to hear him talk about Mr Palmer, but I am certainly not in bed with Clive Palmer.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Joyce, that is not a point of order. Senators, I want to indicate that, whilst points of order will be tolerated, continuous frivolous points of order will not be. A point of order is a serious matter to raise in the chamber, so I would ask senators to consider the nature of the point of order before they raise it. 




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Thank you for pointing out how frivolous Senator Barnaby Joyce, National Party, Queensland, is in this place—not just on this occasion but right down the line. The Greens will be offering the voters of Queensland this best alternative, and Clive Palmer knows it. His accusations are of course totally— (Time expired)



Opposition senators interjecting—





Senator Bob Brown:
  There is no point of order.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brown, I will determine what is a point of order and what is not a point of order. Senator Macdonald, did you want to raise a point of order?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  No. I was going to speak, but I concede to my leader.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:41):  Thank you. To save Senator Brown from further embarrassment, I move:


That the question be now put.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Abetz, that the motion be now put, be agreed to.




A division having been called and the bells being rung—





Senator Bob Brown:
  Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Senator Brandis just made comments about a corrupt political party—'You are leading a corrupt political party'—to me in the chamber. That is prosecuting a quarrel. It is not allowed. It is unparliamentary. I ask you to have him withdraw it or for the President to look at that matter. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brown, the matter is noted. The matter will be referred to the President. If there is need for the President to report back to the chamber he will do so if he wishes to.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. The issue that Senator Brown is talking about is funded in a certain degree by a Mr Graeme Wood, who is one of the co-authors of a document that Senator Brown is talking about.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order, Senator Macdonald. Could I just advise senators that points of order during a division should relate to the division or matters pertaining to the division. If there are points of order relating to the division or pertaining to the division they can be raised legitimately.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (09:52):  Courtesy of the Labor Party and the Greens, debate on this important piece of legislation will be gagged at 10 o'clock this morning. Courtesy of the Greens' suspension of standing orders this morning, we will have 7½ minutes to debate this whole bill about indirect taxation. I can well understand that neither the Labor Party nor the Greens want to spend too much time in the Senate talking about indirect taxation, because they are high-spending and high-taxing parties. I say to the people of Queensland, to whom Senator Brown was trying to send some vague message: if you want to vote against the carbon tax and if you want to vote against death duties, you should support Campbell Newman and the LNP in Queensland.


The Indirect Tax Laws Amendment (Assessment) Bill 2012 is about going down the path of self-assessment by extending the self-assessment arrangements to indirect taxation. It follows a Board of Taxation review into the administration of the GST, which made a series of recommendations for the harmonisation of the self-assessment system across a range of indirect taxes—including the GST, luxury car tax, wine equalisation tax and fuel tax credits. The bill also allows the commissioner to make a determination allowing taxpayers to correct errors in their assessments of GST and fuel tax assessments in the subsequent assessment year.


The coalition support this bill. However, what the coalition do not support is the high-spending and high-taxing agenda from this Labor-Greens administration. It is this Labor-Greens administration which has given us 20 new or increased taxes. Remember the increase in the alcopops tax? Remember the increase in the luxury car tax? Remember the new condensate tax, the $2½ billion tax grab at the expense of the North West Shelf gas project in my home state of Western Australia? Remember the flood tax? Wherever there is a tax to be increased, the Labor Party and the Greens will find it. Of course, since then we have had the carbon tax and the mining tax. If Labor are re-elected at the next election, no doubt there will be another 20 new tax grabs. And guess what? Having introduced 20 new or increased taxes, they still cannot balance the books. This Labor-Greens administration—which is desperate to limit debate on this bill to 7½ minutes—despite 20 new or increased taxes, many of them indirect taxes, still cannot balance the books.


Despite all of that, under this government we have had $167 billion of accumulated deficits. Despite 20 new or increased taxes from this Labor-Greens administration and despite inheriting a $22 billion surplus and a $70 billion net asset position for the Commonwealth, they have been able to turn that around to $167 billion of accumulated deficits, and are now heading for $133 billion of government net debt.


After the last election, the Labor Party and the Greens signed an agreement to form government. It was a highly publicised agreement; it is what gave us the carbon tax. The Greens want us to expand the mining tax. The Greens want to go down the path of death duties. The people of Queensland should be very aware of what will come their way if the Greens are successful in any way at the next election. There is really only one message to be sent to Queensland on Saturday—that is, a message against the high-spending, high-taxing and fiscally reckless agenda of Labor-Greens administrations around the country.


Ever since the Labor Party and the Greens signed an agreement to form government, our fiscal situation in Australia has gone from bad to worse. Before the election in the FIFO statement that had to be released by Treasury and Finance, we were told that the deficit this financial year would be about $10.4 billion. By the time the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook came along in December 2010, three months later, that had gone up to $12.3 billion. So in just three or four months, it had blown out by more nearly $2 billion. But guess what? By the time of the budget in May 2011, we were told that the deficit this financial year would be $22.6 billion. That means that from the time of the election to the time of the budget, which was less than a year, the budget deficit had blown out by more than $12 billion. What happened after that—because, as you know, the gov­ernment then releases a Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in December 2011? Do you know what the deficit now is for this financial year? It is $37.1 billion. The deficit has blown out by more than $26 billion since Treasury and Finance released the pre-election fiscal outlook.


That is why this government is such a high-taxing government. This is why this government has had to go for 20 new or increased taxes. Even though it comes up with one ad hoc tax grab after another, it still cannot balance the books. This is a government that does not know how to live within its means. This is a government that forever casts around for new ad hoc tax grabs. This is a government that tells us that it will give us root and branch tax reform to make our tax system simpler and fairer, and all it does is just whack on another tax. Rather than going through a proper process to make our tax system more efficient, to make our economy more competitive and to improve our productivity, this government just always chases more cash so it can use it for its reckless and wasteful spending here out of Canberra. This is a terrible government. This is a government that has seriously mismanaged our public finances. 


People across Australia instinctively know that whenever the Labor Party get hold of the treasury benches they stuff up our public finances. People across Australia instinctively know that whenever the Labor Party have been in government—and it is even worse when they are in government with the Greens—it takes the coalition to come back to restore good financial management, to put the budget back into balance and to not only pay off Labor's debt but deliver income tax cut after income tax cut.


It is quite disgraceful that the Labor Party and the Greens would conspire to gag debate on this very important piece of legislation and then, on the day when we were always just going to have half an hour to debate this bill, the Greens jump up to cut down that part of the debate that was available, to the point where this legislation will now only have 7½ minutes for debate. Clearly, the Labor Party and the Greens hate the scrutiny that comes when we talk about taxes. They do not want people to know what their secret tax agenda is.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2012-03-21,"



Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania) (12:44):  During this matter of public importance I wish to speak on the current debate concerning the investment strategy of our $1.3 trillion superannuation sector. This debate has been occurring vigorously, particularly since the global financial crisis, and has crystallised over the last week as a result of commentary by the former Treasury secretary, Dr Ken Henry, in a speech to an Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia event last Friday, with further commentary from a range of participants including supporting comments for Dr Henry from Mr Jeremy Cooper, former chair of the review into the operation of our superannuation system, and outgoing Future Fund chair, Mr David Murray.


It is a matter of great public importance not least because the underlying investment strategy substantially impacts on both the final retirement savings for millions of Australians—it is a major social policy—and, critically, on the Australian economy, with a savings investment pool of some $1.3 trillion and almost $1.4 trillion if the Future Fund assets are included. As I am sure many senators are aware, my interest in this issue has been longstanding. My 25 years involvement in superannuation, first as a founding trustee of two funds between 1986 and 1990 and then, on entering the Senate, as chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation overseeing development and passage of the superannuation guarantee, the SI(S) Act, and other inquiries, including on investment. I was shadow minister for superannuation for most of the period 1996 to 2007 and then Australia's first superannuation minister from 2007 to 2009.


It is important to note that earlier this week the parliament also passed two major superannuation measures: an increase in the superannuation guarantee, which will go from nine to 12 per cent by 2020, and a rebate of the 15 per cent contributions tax for low- and middle-income earners earning less than $37,000. Combined, this will see superannuation assets grow from the current approximate $1.3 trillion to approximately $3.3 trillion by 2026 and $6 trillion to $7 trillion by 2035. To put this into perspective, $1.3 trillion is approximately the size of the Australian economy.


Responsibility for the investment of these assets is placed with trustees. This was confirmed by statute in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993—the SI(S) Act—which codified the prudent person principle: invest the assets diversified for the long term as if they were your own to maximise the return to the member. In Australia government does not direct superannuation investment in any way. It is delegated at arms length to independent trustees. This is almost unique in the world for a system of such size. There has been reference to examples of other countries with pension fund assets with a significantly greater percentage in fixed income. I think it is important to note that in some of these cases this is a consequence of government direction. Indeed, some governments go even further, with direction for investment in housing and infrastructure and a range of restrictions, including on overseas investment.


According to the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority data, as at June 2011 the asset allocation of the default investment strategy—that is where the trustees make the decision for members who fail to make one—was approximately 43 per cent of total assets. This was composed of 29 per cent in Australian shares, 24 per cent in international shares, 10 per cent in listed and unlisted property, 16 per cent in Australian and international fixed interest, eight per cent in cash and 14 per cent in other assets. Despite the GFC, which has led to the proportion of investments in shares moving down and that in fixed interest and cash going up, the primary investment is still in shares. Dr Henry and others' argument is that, given recent losses and market volatility, trustees and their advisers—fund managers and asset managers—have tended to invest too heavily in shares and not enough in bonds and that shares are too risky and volatile.


According to media reports:


… Dr Henry said a strong ''average'' performance of shares over time had not prevented many fund members from losing out when markets tanked.


''Depending upon when they enter the system and when they retire, some fund members will benefit enormously from a portfolio weighted heavily toward equities while others will lose big time,'' … ''And nobody knows, in advance, who will win and who will lose.''


I have the greatest respect for Dr Henry, Jeremy Cooper and David Murray. I have had many positive interactions with them over many years and agree with them on many of their policy observations. However, on this issue I fundamentally disagree, and strongly so. Where they have identified some weaknesses—and I will refer to these—there are alternative solutions.


Fundamentally it would be a serious mistake for government and/or trustees and fund managers to shift the base investment away from diversified shares, because over the long term that strategy provides the highest rate of return. Over the 20-year period to 2010, returns per annum were 11 per cent for shares, 8.2 per cent for the bond market index and 4.3 per cent for cash. In a defined contribution system, which is what we have in Australia, contributions minus tax, fees and charges, plus returns from underlying investments determine the final outcome. Effectively, the member carries the risk of that outcome. Given that we know on the evidence of diversification—and the SI(S) Act requires diversification—that shares outperform bonds and cash over the long term, this should remain the fundamental asset class that the superannuation system should be based on. Yes, we know on the evidence that there is a risk of greater volatility in equities; however, the even greater risk for members is a lower return over the long term if those assets were invested in bonds and cash rather than equities. This would result in a lower level of final savings. So, yes, there is greater volatility from shares, but we know on the available evidence that the final outcome will be higher.


There is one important caveat to this outcome and where it is possible for bonds to outperform equities, and that is if fees and charges are excessive and/or if a fund has insufficient fund scale to purchase a mandate with the lowest possible fees. To the extent this is an issue, and it is for some—and I applaud and support Jeremy Cooper for the vast majority of his recommendations; indeed, I appointed him as chair of the review into superannuation—higher than reasonable fees and charges are resulting in a lower outcome for investments in equities than bonds or cash. 


The government has initiated important reforms, MySuper, SuperStream and related FoFA reforms—it is a subject for debate on another day in the Senate—and these will reduce the costs and fees and charges in the long term. That set of issues is being dealt with by government. Mr Murray, the outgoing Chair of the Future Fund, gave some supporting comments to Dr Henry. As Mr David Murray knows and has explained on many occasions that, if the underlying assets of the Future Fund were predominantly in bonds and cash, the Future Fund would be unlikely to achieve its targeted rate of returns and certainly less likely than with a predominance in equities and shares.


Australians will be in the superannuation system for an average of 40 years pre retirement and an average of 15 to 20 years post retirement. During that time there will be a number of market peaks and troughs—volatility. This is unavoidable in a capitalist market economy. The example Dr Henry gave—which he admitted was extreme—was of a 59-year-old in 2007 planning to retire at 60, seeing perhaps a 25 per cent plus decline in their account balance because of the GFC. Presumably this individual, given their age, would have been in the system since at least 1987, the date of the introduction of the initial three per cent compulsory superannuation, then added to by the SG. Their account would have experienced strong positive growth in all but one year up to 2007. So what we have to do, in looking at this debate, is to take into account the long-term positive growth from equities year on year as well as the negative down years. 


I illustrate this with my own experience. I have a defined contribution account. I have had it since 1990 when I entered the Senate. It is invested predominantly in equities. The account peaked on 30 June 2007. Every dollar was then worth $8. Then at 31 December 2008 the dollar value went from $8 down to $6 and, as of 31 December last year, it had gone back up to having a value of $7. If that had been invested in bonds, it would not be worth the $7 as of December last year; it would be worth $6 at that date.


I do accept that it is difficult, particularly for those who are older and value predictability and certainty, to explain the concept of long-term returns. I had to do this when I was Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law during the GFC to hundreds of people who engaged me in conversation about their super account going significantly backwards, often for the first time. It is possible to minimise volatility with a share base if funds adopt a reserving strategy, putting aside some of the positive returns in good years to offset the negative in bad years in order to smooth returns. Indeed, some funds did take that approach in the past. However, Choice of Fund ended this approach. Funds could no longer continue to adopt the smoothing strategy.


A major defect in our system is the lack of focus and highlighting consistently, in an understandable way, the long-term return and its value. Most funds in the lead-up to the GFC enjoyed double-digit rates of return each year they highlighted and, indeed, many boasted, with front-page headlines, increases of 10, 12, 15 and 18 per cent. This was a serious error. Funds should highlight the long-term rate of return. Further, it is possible with robust actuarial standards to provide a projection on contributions or a forecast to not just retirement age but also average life expectancy. However, as I have mentioned, many elderly Australians dislike volatility and prefer a predictable income stream. That is understandable. This highlights a major gap in our superannuation system, the lack of post-retirement annuity pension take-up. This is the last major policy reform gap in our system.


The superannuation sector is keen to find an effective solution. In a well-designed retirement income system, rather than a lump sum savings system, which is what Australia has—and that is in contrast to most other countries with a defined contribution system—a well-designed post-retirement annuity pension is a vital necessity. Any effective solution in this area almost certainly will lead to a higher investment in bond assets. The need to design a much more effective annuity pension post-retirement system has been recognised by both the Treasurer, Mr Swan, and the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, Mr Shorten. They have appointed a panel of experts to a superannuation roundtable charged with finding solutions in this area.



Notwithstanding my arguments about preferring an equity base for superannuation, it is very necessary to strengthen and deepen the public and private bond market. I agree with Mr Johnson, the chair of a committee who made recommendations to assist developing a local bond market, that it is an urgent issue. These reforms are necessary to remove operational and structural impediments that he identified. They need to be acted on and, indeed, the government has commenced work in this regard. Whatever the arguments and conclusions reached on the equities versus bonds debate, a more effective bond market will be an absolute necessity, not only given the necessity to support an effective post-retirement system but in order to help deal with the strong growth in savings that I highlighted earlier—$1.4 trillion at the present, including the Future Fund, forecast to reach $3.3 trillion by 2026 and $6.7 trillion by 2035. But, whatever the concerns are about the operation of our superannuation system, unlike most comparable advanced economies, Australia has a modest sustainable defined benefit base—the age pension—supplemented by a funded, income related, compulsory defined contribution system.(Time expired)

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (15:05):  I have some additional answers to a question without notice from Senator Waters. I seek to incorporate the answer in Hansard.


Leave granted. 




The answer read as follows—



On 19 March 2012, during question time, Senator Waters asked me a question as Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities concerning national heritage listing and wild rivers in Queensland.


RESPONSE


The National Heritage List recognises, celebrates and protects places of outstanding heritage value to the nation.


The usual process for the inclusion of places in the National Heritage List is set out in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.


Anyone can nominate a place for inclusion in the National Heritage List. Each year, the Australian Heritage Council reviews nominations and provides the Minister with advice on which places it considers should be assessed. The Minister approves a finalised priority assessment list.


The Australian Heritage Council undertakes an assessment of each place on the finalised priority assessment list and provides the Minister with a written assessment of whether the place meets any of the national heritage criteria. The Council also provides the Minister with comments received during the assessment process.


After receiving an assessment from the Australian Heritage Council, the Minister decides whether to include a place in the National Heritage List, having regard to Council's assessment and the comments received.


The Minister may include a place in the National Heritage List only if he is satisfied that the place has one or more national heritage values.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Senators Cormann, Joyce and Edwards today relating to the carbon tax.


It has been confirmed today that there is an acknowledgement that the state most affected by a carbon tax will be the state of Queensland—the state of Queensland, which this weekend goes to an election; the state of Queensland, where currently the Labor Party's approach is, 'Feel sorry for us, and that is why you must vote for us.' They have given up trying to win the election. They are basically saying, 'You must feel sorry for us.' You must feel sorry that they have been so totally and utterly incompetent. You would not marry someone you felt sorry for. You certainly would not go to a dentist and say: 'Can you stick that drill in my mouth and have a bit of a scrape around even though you are inherently clumsy and incompetent but you've got a nice smile? I feel sorry for you.' The people of Queensland this weekend will not be voting for somebody they feel sorry for; they will be voting for somebody they believe is competent. That means that the Labor Party are gone. We had this ridiculous position where we had Kate Jones and the member for Toowoomba North running around pretending they are not actually in the Labor Party anymore. But it is the same Labor Party up there that we see down here. We can go through all the manifestations of this, but one of the greatest assets that I have had to campaign against the Australian Labor Party, the Greens and the Independents is the carbon tax. When everything else might be letting you down and you are losing the crowd a bit, you just go back to the carbon tax—talk about the carbon tax because they absolutely hate it; they are pathological in their hatred of it. But you have said that it is your major accomplishment. Unfortunately, it is not going to be the major accomplishment for the people of Mackay, Rockhampton or Gladstone because these are the people who will lose their jobs—41,000 jobs are going. We have also found out that, even by 2050, the effect on the Queensland economy is equivalent to the size of the current Queensland economy.


This is what is happening with this mad tax. Apparently over here we are endowed with the capacity to change the temperature of the globe. They can do it; they can change it. It is not God; it is the Labor Party. They can make it rain, they can make it cold, they can change the temperature of the globe and all they have to do is just bang a new broad based consumption tax on you. It is all so simple. Why didn't we think of that? A new broad based consumption tax that affects the climate is just so logical. 


We have seen, up hill and down dale, the Labor Party's total and utter incompetence. One of the other areas of incompetence is their debt. It is always the same—you can always track them down. When they cannot do something, they get in a consultant and borrow the money from somewhere else. That is basically how it works: using consultants, public servants and debt. In Queensland they are currently at $62.3 billion in gross debt. They are heading towards $85.4 billion in gross debt. Down here we are currently at $233 billion in gross debt. We only have another $17 billion left on the overdraft before the cheques start bouncing. That is what is happening. This is what you have. 


In the midst of that, when we should be trying to get the economy moving along what are we doing? We are going to cool the planet. We are going to recalibrate our nation and my state's economy with a colourless, odourless gas. We are going to work out how we are going to fix it all. We are going to get something that was formerly free—that is the air you breathe--and we are going to charge people for it. Because we know they might try and get out of that, we will find a very sneaky way to hit them up with this tax. We will make it a consumption tax based primarily on electricity.


What drives Queensland's economy? It is coal. It drives our nation's economy as our biggest export. Coal is carbon, but under the Labor Party carbon is evil. It is evil rock, naughty rock. We cannot have any of that. But, apparently, when it passes over water it becomes righteous, and then it becomes righteous rock, but whilst it is here it is naughty rock and naughty rock must be taxed. We must have a massive tax to stop people using it, stop people staying warm. You cannot be warm anymore—turn off those heaters, turn off those air conditioners and stop cooking toast. This is the message from the Labor Party to you. It is evil to watch television. Stop it. Do not iron the clothes anymore, naughty housewife. Stop it immediately. We must all return to the caves. Let us return to being content hunters and gatherers on the forest floor. There goes the Labor Party.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-03-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (15:10):  These are dark days indeed. The air is thick with conspiracy. We heard earlier from the spiritual leader of the Liberal-National Party, Clive Palmer, that the Greens party has in fact become a CIA front. We learnt the extraordinary news that the Greens are a CIA front that have been engaged to attack the coal industry in this country for the betterment of the US economy. This extraordinary revelation was fresh in the political debate when we also learnt from Laurie Oakes this morning that the US faked the moon landing.


The immediate thought I had upon this extraordinary news was that, if the Greens are a CIA front and not the reservoir of Marxist-Leninist thinking that the Liberal Party tell us they are, where did all the Marxist-Leninists go? Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, the next conspiracy theory for me to reveal is that the Marxist-Leninists have all gone to Menzies House, where they are busy writing the Liberal Party's policy. When one looks at the policy proposition that those opposite are putting to the people of Australia, one sees that they have immediately eschewed any notion of using market forces and any notion of using modern economic thinking in their policies. What they are offering to the people of Australia is a command economy model of which North Korea would be proud. So perhaps there we find a hint of where all the Marxist-Leninists we thought were hiding in the Greens have actually migrated to.


Senator Joyce talked to us for the last few moments about the carbon tax. Upon listening to his words—empty of fact but occasionally witty—I thought to myself: 'Goodness gracious me! What a wonderful thing it would be if Senator Joyce were to read his own policy on carbon abatement.' As he mocks the Labor Party's policy, he also mocks his own. Is Senator Joyce aware of the fact that our plan to abate carbon has a target that is the same as that of the coalition policy? Has anybody told Senator Joyce that he himself has signed up to a policy whereby he says carbon should be abated? Has anybody revealed to Senator Joyce that his strategy for reaching the same target as ours is rather than having the cumbersome, dreadful notion of a market of supply and demand—of an emissions based scheme, a cap-and-trade scheme which engages the entrepreneurialism and the incentivation of the market—instead we have in the Liberal-National Party corner the plan of Chairman Abbott? It is a plan that Castro would be proud of, a plan which is to dispense with these old-fashioned and irritating notions of supply and demand, to get rid of this idea that the private sector can unlock the thinking and the investment that is required. Instead, the plan that Senator Joyce has signed up to, apparently without his own knowledge—the conspiracy deepens—is that the carbon tax will be repealed and $24 billion will be used to refund the big polluters for the carbon permits they have bought. But $3 billion of taxpayers' money will become a giant command economy scheme where Chairman Abbott and his inner circle will nominate those grand plans that they say will abate carbon, perhaps attract a command in the Urals or a five-year plan in the Gobi Desert. Who can imagine what Chairman Abbott and his inner circle will come up with? The point is this: the National Party cannot come into this place and rail about the carbon tax, and denounce and vilify and make nonsense of the fact that carbon pollution is a real danger to this country. They ignore the fact that they have a policy that says those very things. 


Somebody on the other side of the chamber desperately needs to introduce Senator Joyce to his own policies. This is not a new problem. This is something the coalition has confronted for many years. Getting poor old Senator Joyce up to the starting point where he has read the policies and is able to talk about them has always been difficult. We on this side of the chamber understand the enormity of your challenge, but you must take it on. You must introduce the National Party to your own policies or else you run the continuing risk of having them and their spiritual leader, Clive Palmer, speaking for you. Personally, I welcome it; I think Clive Palmer brings a refreshing sense of honesty to the nonsense that is the coalition. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-03-21,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:15):  Senator Feeney, on behalf of the Labor Party, again promotes what a wonderful idea the new carbon tax is for all Australians. I ask Senator Feeney, as I have asked every Labor senator: if the carbon tax is so good why did your leader promise before the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led? If it is that good why did she promise that?


What concerns me about the Labor Party—we all know that they cannot manage money—is that they cannot manage the truth. The Labor Party president at the time Ms Gillard made that wonderful promise of not introducing a carbon tax was none other than the Queensland Premier, Anna Bligh. Ms Bligh was also the president of the Labor Party nationally when Ms Gillard gave a rock-solid guarantee that she would not do away with the rebate on private health insurance. That is the trouble: whether it be Ms Gillard or Ms Bligh, you simply cannot believe anything leaders of the Labor Party say. 


Senators may be aware that we are involved in an election campaign in my state of Queensland at the moment. And I have heard Ms Bligh promising to spend more money on absolutely everything. She has got her lead from her federal leader, Ms Gillard: whatever you want, whatever will buy a vote, promise some money. But we all know that Queensland has lost its AAA credit rating. The Queensland government is broke. It is a state with the most wonderful natural resources for mining, agriculture and tourism, yet the state is broke.


Ms Bligh will, as Ms Gillard did, continue to promise to spend any money to buy a vote or two in a desperate attempt to retain the trappings of power. We know that, typical of any Labor leader,  anything Ms Bligh promises cannot be believed. Whatever she promises today you can be assured that, like Ms Gillard, in a couple of months time, should she win government again, she will ignore that promise completely.


I ask the people of my state of Queensland: can you believe anything the Labor Party tells you? Ms Bligh certainly cannot go on her record. She cannot go on the sagacity of her cabinet; that would just be a joke. What does her campaign involve? She has made up lies about the leader of the Liberal National Party Campbell Newman—'Can-do Campbell Newman'—who will be next premier of Queensland. Ms Bligh's only campaign is to make up lies about Mr Newman—lies which the Crime and Misconduct Commission have dismissed summarily. 


We talked today in question time about the carbon tax. I would like to ask a question of any Labor member—I would particularly like to ask the Labor candidates from the Central Queensland area in the state election of Queensland. I noticed that Senator Kim Carr was being very particular about Central Queensland, obviously because he has seen the polls. The miners who work in the mines in Central Queensland—the mines that the Greens and the Labor Party want to shut down—are big-money earners. They know that their jobs and their mortgages are on the line because of Labor's carbon tax and because of Labor's mining tax. It does not matter what the heavies and apparatchiks in the unions say, the workers in the mines know what it is about. That is why the Queensland Premier is running a mile away from anything to do with the carbon tax although as state premier she did nothing to oppose it and as president of the Labor Party she was privy to the breach of promise made by Ms Gillard when she said that she would not introduce that tax but did so immediately she was elected. You simply cannot trust Labor with money or the truth. (Time expired)

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:20):  After listening to Senator Joyce and Senator Macdonald you have to wonder how you could ever get the coalition to develop a proper policy on climate change. It is clear that the National Party and the North Queenslanders are actually promoting climate change denial within the coalition and ensuring that the coalition do not do anything appropriate about climate change. 


Senator Macdonald could not even last two minutes talking about climate change before he wandered all over the place. Senator Joyce is the clown prince of the Senate in terms of one-liners but does not deal with any of the scientific funds or any of the economic issues that are important for this country. 


I want to briefly go to a couple of areas. I want to briefly go to a couple of areas. I am not usually one who quotes the pontiff or the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in Rome, but the Pontifical Academy of Sciences said this:


We call on all people and nations to recognise the serious and potentially irreversible impacts of global warming caused by the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases …


This is not the Labor Party; it is not some socialist group that are saying you have to deal with climate change; it is not the Greens. This is a commission of scientists reporting to the Pope who say we must treat this seriously. So that is one area.


And then there are our own scientific advisers the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology. They have only just put out a booklet called State of the climate 2012. And what do they say in that? They say that temperatures are rising. They say that rainfall is becoming intermittent in some areas and very, very strong in other areas. They say the global average mean sea level is rising. They say that the ocean heat content is rising. They say that carbon dioxide is rising. And this has got serious economic and environmental implications for Australia.


You see, the coalition used to treat this seriously; they actually used to say we have to deal with this. And they set up a task group headed by Dr Peter Shergold, a key adviser to John Howard. What that group's report said was this:


Australia has a vital interest in the form of any emerging global response. Given our exposure to the impacts of climate change we want an approach that is effective.


They then went on to say:


However, waiting until a truly global response emerges before imposing an emissions cap will place costs on Australia by increasing business uncertainty and delaying or losing investment. Already there is evidence that investment in key emissions-intensive industries and energy infrastructure is being deferred.


They come in here and they argue that, under Labor, there is a problem with energy infrastructure. But in 2007, the year the public threw them out of office, they were getting reports saying energy infrastructure is a problem, that investment in energy infrastructure has not taken place. And what is the big cost in electricity increases? It is not a carbon price; it is energy infrastructure. Dr Peter Shergold recognised that. John Howard was told about this in 2007 but did nothing about it.



George Megalogenis has just written a book about politics in this country and he says John Howard introduced what he calls a 'chameleon approach' to climate change: one minute you are for it, the next minute you are against it. And Tony Abbott is the chief coalition chameleon on climate change. He is for it one minute and against it the next. He is an absolute disgrace. The coalition is a disgrace. Think of the future of this country. Do something about climate change. Stop denying. (Time expired)

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (15:26):  As my coalition colleagues have pointed out, there is an election taking place in Queensland on Saturday. One might normally expect in the course of the political toing and froing in this chamber that there would be Queensland Labor senators in this place supporting, defending and encouraging votes for the Bligh Labor government come Saturday. But there is not one here at the moment. There is not one of them to support—




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I do not understand how what the senator is now putting to this chamber has got any relevance to the issues that we are debating. It has absolutely no relevance whatsoever and she is out of order.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Cameron. I will draw your attention, Senator Boyce, to the motion before the chair, which is to take note of the answers of Senator Wong.




Senator BOYCE:
  Let me come to that, because time to take note of answers given in question time would generally be given to members of the government who have something relevant to say on the subject. Clearly, there is no-one here who can say a relevant thing, not one Queensland senator who can speak on the record of the Queensland Bligh government. That just follows on from—




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I have to indicate that this senator has got five minutes; she has spoken for more than one minute and she has not for one second dealt with the issues that are before the chamber. You must draw her attention to the issues before the chamber.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my left! Senator Cameron, thank you. There was some leniency shown to Senator Feeney, who commenced his contribution in exactly the same manner. Senator Boyce, I draw your attention to the question before the chair. You have three minutes and 42 seconds remaining.




Senator BOYCE:
  Could I point out, Mr Deputy President, that the clock only just stopped at the end of the point of order, not at the beginning; there was some time missed there. I certainly want to speak about the answers given on carbon tax. The evil twins of tax—carbon tax and mining tax—will hurt my state of Queensland worse than any other state or territory in the country. There is a Treasury analysis by the Bligh Labor government which found that Queensland's gross state product will be 0.4 per cent lower by 2019-20 than it would be without the carbon price. The net cost over the forward estimates period to the Queensland economy and, therefore, the Queensland people will be between $351 million and $360 million a year. That is what it will cost our economy to have a carbon tax. And heaven forbid that the Bligh Labor government or any shade of Labor government should still be in power in Queensland with the evil taxes in place by 2049-50, when gross state product in Queensland would be 3½ per cent lower than it currently is. And these are figures from the Queensland Labor managed Treasury. In Queensland it is going to cost everyone an absolute fortune. We have one business owner with a chain of stores across Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria who says that it will add $250,000 a year to his costs. That will include an extra $100,000 a year in rent. Lease agreements being drawn up right now for the badly struggling commercial sector and the industrial sector in Queensland all have a new clause in them that allows the landlords to pass on carbon and greenhouse gas emission related charges and to get those back from the lessee. These are people who are already struggling. Retailers know that the carbon tax in Queensland will add thousands of dollars to their annual rent, power and outgoings.


The reason that it will affect Queensland more than any other state—why these evil twins of tax, the carbon and mining taxes, will affect us more—is that we are the highest users of coal fired power. That is where the carbon tax will desperately affect us. In the mining area—nine per cent of the state revenues come from royalties from the mining industry—a growing, developing industry, we still have this government desperately trying to rip as much of that money out of the system as it can, to slow down investment in that area when you already have businesses being very seriously targeted in the other.


There is likely to be a court challenge around the mining tax. Certainly, we would hope that Queensland, with an LNP government in place after Saturday, will join that challenge and will try to stop at least one of those evil taxes. We have referred to these taxes as the 'evil twins of tax'. I would hope that come next Saturday we will get rid of the first of the 'evil twins' of Labor. Ms Bligh will be gone, and one hopes—certainly the mood of the Queensland voters is such—that Ms Gillard will soon follow her.

 (New South Wales) (15:57):  Pursuant to contingent notice and at the request of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Abetz, I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Abetz moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion relating to the Government’s failure to provide documents concerning the construction of a new Youth Skills and Employment Centre for the Central Coast.


This is an absolutely disgraceful move in this sad, sorry and sordid saga in relation to this job centre. The minister in his answer said that there had been 'usual communications'. If there are only 'usual communications', why are the Australian Labor Party and their alliance partners, the Greens, going to so much length to stifle debate on this and not produce these documents? That is the issue. What is this government hiding? I will tell you what they are hiding: they are protecting the member for Dobell. What hypocrisy! So much for the Greens. They will sit there day after day and prattle about transparency. You are all hypocrites, because today—

There are all the matters that I have referred to in this chamber about this issue since August last year, and there are lots of documents, but all I got produced from this government was 44 folios, most of which were just blank pages. We know that Minister Garrett received correspondence from the member for Dobell, because on one little line that was unredacted it refers to Mr Thomson raising concerns about interaction between '…' and DEEWR.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (16:02):  Minister, you would be aware that the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research has completed the Focusing Australia's Publicly Funded Research Review. I am sure you are aware of that. The review was undertaken from February to July 2011. It examined a number of issues in regard to the nature and utility of Australia's publicly funded research arrangements, with a particular focus on priority setting. So I ask this as my introductory question: how will the government's response to this bill affect the operation of the Australian Research Council in relation to the Focusing Australia's Publicly Funded Research Review?

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (16:06):  Humanities. Humanities, arts and social sciences are gaining greater priority than they once had—or that is my understanding from having looked at the Focusing Australia's Publicly Funded Research Review. There is a greater priority given to the humanities, arts and social sciences. I am not suggesting that that is necessarily a bad thing; I am simply asking the question.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (16:08):  Chair, I think I should indicate to Senator Mason that the government will be more than happy to provide him with further information about the priority goals of the review he mentioned, but I am unclear as to how that level of detail at this stage relates to this bill around establishing the Australian Research Council. Certainly they are very meritorious subjects, and matters that interest me also, and we are more than happy to cooperate. But I am sure Senator Mason appreciates that that information is not presently available with these officers with respect to this bill.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2012-03-21,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (16:09):  The reason I ask is that presently the government is considering, in the context of funding research in this country, looking at the role of and trying to divine how to measure the impact of research on our country, both social and economic. Let me just concede that it is a very difficult measure. My question really related to whether this review will assist and whether the impact is being taken into account in the context of this review. I think the government is right to start assessing impact because without it—how do I put this gently?—some taxpayers find it difficult to fund research when they believe that academics are simply writing for each other. They would prefer something with a social and economic impact.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-03-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (16:10):  Before I venture to answer that question, perhaps I can backtrack to the National Research Priorities. The first of those is An Environmentally Sustainable Australia; the second is Promoting and Maintaining Good Health; the third is Frontier Technologies for Building and Transforming Australian Industries; and the final one is Safeguarding Australia. In respect to the question that Senator Mason just raised, I need to be confident that a focus on the outcome or the output from research would be a significant element, but I will wait for further information from the officers. Yes, I can assure him the impact is included in all ARC proposals.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,17,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-03-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (16:12):  Senator Mason and I have both been around long enough to understand that that is far from a very simple question. How the impact will be measured relates to what it is you are seeking to measure and what the project is. As to where it might fit in terms of any of the National Research Priorities, obviously measuring something in relation to an Environmentally Sustainable Australia is going to be different from how you might measure Frontier Technologies for Building and Transforming Australian Industries. It would be different on a case-by-case basis for the four projects.


I think the important element is a bit like the debates we have in this place about government addressing particular priorities and family impact assessments. Simply making the output one of the significant factors in assessing the projects focuses those who are putting forward projects and those who are assessing them on that issue and how output might appropriately be measured on a case-by-case basis.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (16:13):  Officers are working on that point. I think it is a very good question because Safeguarding Australia could relate to quite a broad range of security issues. It could pertain to food security or border security. The answer, Senator Mason, is yes.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (16:14):  With respect to environmental sustainability, is that a theme that runs through all the criteria for the Research Council grants these days?

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (17:28):  I am not sure if we have just seen Bob the senator or Bob the historian or Bob the blogger but I do congratulate my new colleague on his first speech. I note with some interest the content of Senator Bob Carr's speech in relation to the environment and I have a question for him: as premier, would he have gone to the people of New South Wales two days before an election and told them a complete untruth on what he was going to do about such an important policy as a carbon tax?


Because I remind Senator Bob Carr that two days before the last election the person who prevailed upon him to come into this place was indeed the very person who told the great lie of Australian politics in the last century, and that was: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' I ask Senator Bob Carr: would he have gone to the New South Wales people and told a complete untruth? That is what I would like to hear from Senator Carr when he makes his next speech.


I would like to refer Senator Bob Carr to an article in the Australian in February of this year written by Graham Lloyd, the environment editor. I will just read it because, with the greatest respect to the new senator, I did not think his Chicken Little approach to what lies ahead was a constructive debate in relation to where we will be in the next 10, 20 or 50 years. Graham Lloyd, the environment editor, said:


Himalayan glaciers are back on the frontline of climate change controversy, with new research showing the world's greatest snowcapped peaks lost no ice at all over the past 10 years.


Claims the Himalayan ice peaks would disappear by 2035 instead of 2350 cast doubt over the credibility of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2009 report. Now even the 2350 estimate of disappearing ice is open to question.


Research published in the scientific journal Nature showed satellite measurements of the ice peaks from the Himalayas to Tian Shan on the border of China and Kyrgyzstan have come to an unexpected conclusion.


While lower-altitude glaciers were melting over the past eight years, enough snow was being added …


…   …   …


In 2010, the head of the IPCC was forced to apologise for including in a 2007 report the claim that there was a 'very high' chance of glaciers disappearing from the Himalayas by 2035.


Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the IPCC, conceded in January 2010 that 'the clear and well-established standards of evidence required by the IPCC procedures were not applied properly' when the claim was included.


I do want to talk about some other matters. One is that in 2012 we mark the 70th anniversary of a number of matters that were an indication of the darkest of days in 1942 and the challenges facing this nation. Without an exhaustive list, of course I note the fall of Singapore; the bombing of Darwin—and Natasha Griggs from the other place, the member for Solomon, is responsible for a motion, accepted by both chambers in the end, that we recognise the bombing of Darwin, and full marks to her; the battles of Sunda Strait and Bantam Bay and the sinking of HMAS Perth; the bombing of Broome and Wyndham; HMAS Yarra, sunk off Java; the battle of Java itself; the battle of the Coral Sea; attacks on Sydney Harbour by Japanese midget submarines; the Queen unveiling Bomber Command Memorial in London this year on 28 June; the sinking of the Montevideo Maru; the battle of the Kokoda Track in New Guinea; the battle of Milne Bay in New Guinea; the battle of El Alamein in Egypt; and of course there are others. This is a moment and a year of solemn reflection for this country.


I want to talk about another matter that relates to a function I attended with the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott, in Bendigo on 5 March. There the Leader of the Opposition in writing again pledged the coalition to address the DFRDB and the DFRB indexation matter. Again, the Leader of the Opposition has set in stone the commitment of the coalition to address the wrongs that should have been righted many years ago—and I acknowledge it should have been righted by the former government. But I am not here to debate what happened before; I am here to debate and talk about what we need to do now. This chamber should be ashamed that on 16 June last year when the opportunity was there to address this issue of the fair indexation of this superannuation, which we all know is a wrong that should be righted, the Australian Labor Party, the Greens and Senator Xenophon voted it down.




Senator Edwards:
  Shame!




Senator RONALDSON:
  A unique opportunity—and, as Senator Edwards said, a shame. It was indeed a disgrace. We will index the military superannuation pensions the way they should be. Can anyone in this chamber tell me—I know from our side that they can, they will have the answer; but can anyone from the Australian Labor Party or the Greens tell me how it is appropriate to index age pensions and service pensions differently for these men and women? It is outrageous, it is unfair and it is inequitable, and this chamber had the opportunity to address it in June last year and it did not do so. That is to the eternal shame of this chamber. It is to the eternal shame of the Australian Labor Party and the Greens, and they stand utterly condemned for not addressing fair indexation when presented with the opportunity to do so.


Don't forget, this was about fair go. This was the opportunity to give 57,000 Australian families a fair go, and a fair go was not given. I know there are many, many Labor members who quite rightly have been inundated with emails and other correspondence from veterans, not just from those on the DFRDB and the DFRB but from many veterans who are absolutely incensed about what has happened.




Senator Edwards:
  Completely let down.




Senator RONALDSON:
  Completely and utterly let down, as Senator Edwards said. But the coalition will not let these men and women down, and that pledge is absolutely now written in stone. Another matter of enormous concern is the decision of the government last year to slash $8 million from veterans advocacy funding and the Veteran and Community Grants program. Just to put this into perspective, the state where this will have the biggest impact is Victoria. When the government released its advocacy review there was money set aside, quite rightly, to enable work to be done to include in New South Wales and Queensland the sorts of veterans welfare centres that Victoria had. But, remarkably, it has now removed that money. A reduction in funding was not mentioned or addressed at all by the advocacy funding review. In fact, if you read the review properly there is probably a very good reason to increase funding. So the very welfare centre model that the government was putting money into to spread the centres has been utterly decimated by the government's decision to remove $8 million.


There is a very real chance that the Ballarat Veterans Support Centre will close. The Central Victorian Veterans  Support Centre in Bendigo is under enormous strain. The administrator has taken a pay cut so the centre can remain open. It is the same in Geelong. It is the same in the Blue Mountains. Everywhere I go I am confronted with veterans advocates and pensioner welfare officers telling me they wonder why they are doing this work when the government itself refuses to acknowledge the work that they are doing. These are volunteers volunteering their services for the veteran community—some are veterans, a number are not. They believe this role is so important that they volunteer their services. And the government, in that budget decision last year, absolutely ripped the heart and soul of these centres and ripped out of those volunteers to some extent the commitment that they previously had. They themselves are saying, 'If that is the way the government treats us, why should we continue doing this?' I am confident they will because I know the cause is bigger than the incompetence of this government.


Turning to the BEST funding, young veterans and their families are the ones who potentially will lose the most out of these centres not providing potentially the level of service that they were. Those young men and women are the ones who, if they have got nowhere to go, are more likely to walk away from accessing their entitlements—legitimate entitlements given by the people of this country in recognition of the uniqueness of the military service they have been engaged in. The uniqueness of military service must underpin every decision we as a nation make and underpin every decision that comes from both here and the other place. The uniqueness of military service has not been recognised with the slashing of the BEST funding.


The veterans, quite rightly, are utterly incensed that they must pay for the incompetence of this government. It is not just the DFRDB recipients. It is TPI pensioners and the widows who cannot access the gold card. I can go on and on. I will tell you why these veteran issues cannot be addressed. I will go through some of the reasons. The Home Insulation Program: $2.4 billion was wasted and mismanaged. The Building the Education Revolution: a $1.7 billion blow-out on school halls with a program costing $16.2 billion and estimates of up to $8 billion wasted. The Computers in Schools program: blown out by $1.2 billion, with one million computers promised but only 300,000 delivered. The Broadband Network: promised for $4.7 billion but replaced with a $43 billion plan. There was FuelWatch and GroceryWatch. There was the solar home program: a $150 million blow-out with the program cancelled. Green Loans program: $300 million wasted, with the program cancelled. And, to rub salt into the wounds of those people who served this country, there has been nearly $1 billion spent on consultants by this government since they came to office in 2007. Government advertising is another one: the stimulus advertising, $50 million wasted; climate change advertising, $14 million wasted. There was $81.9 million to implement the ETS that never was. For the 2020 Summit: $2 million wasted. The tax bonus payments: $46 million wasted, with money sent to people overseas, criminals and dead people. It is about time we got our priorities right.


I will raise another matter. The cost of servicing the 'loan' that this government has imposed on the people of this country—every man, woman and child—is an interest bill of $8 billion. Given the appropriate amount of time, I could go through, chapter and verse, every single dollar that could have been spent from that $8 billion on the veterans of this country. That $8 billion would pay for the bulk of the issues that the veteran community, quite rightly, is angry about. If there was some good to have come out of this waste and mismanagement, there might have been an excuse for it. But how can any government turn around a country with budget surpluses and no debt into something now approaching about $130 billion to $140 billion of net debt and borrowing $100 million a day? I thank Senator Edwards and Senator Cash for assisted me with this figure: we are borrowing $100 million a day. It is absolutely outrageous. In the four minutes left I want to raise several other matters. I pay tribute to the outgoing Chairman of the Council of the Australian War Memorial, General Peter Cosgrove. General Cosgrove steered the Australian War Memorial through difficult times. I do not want to politicise these comments, but I will say the government was dragged kicking and screaming into providing the War Memorial with desperately needed funds. On behalf of the coalition and, I am sure, on behalf of this chamber and the Australian people, I thank General Peter Cosgrove most sincerely for his contribution. I do, on behalf of all those aforementioned, welcome Rear Admiral Ken Doolan AO RAN (Ret'd) as Chairman of the Council of the Australian War Memorial. Admiral Doolan joins a distinguished list of Australians who have served as chairmen of the Australian War Memorial's council. I have every confidence that Admiral Doolan will forthrightly represent the Memorial's views to the government and ensure that projects like the gallery's redevelopment are properly funded and delivered on time.


I turn to some remarkable comments by Councillor Cameron Granger, the Deputy Mayor of Geelong, who, of course, is a member of the ALP right and is in the faction of Richard Marles, the member for Corio. The Geelong Advertiser reports today that Councillor Granger at a Geelong business network breakfast had the gall to attack the Premier of Victoria over Alcoa. He made the quite remarkable comment: 'Mr Premier, we can't wait. Devise a plan to assist and get on a plane to New York.' Well, I have got some advice for Councillor Granger: why doesn't Councillor Granger, the Labor Party lackey Deputy Mayor of the City of Geelong, get on a plane and fly to Canberra and tell the Prime Minister of this country and the right wing of the Labor Party that he does not want a carbon tax, because the carbon tax is the one imposition that will destroy manufacturing jobs in Geelong. So if Councillor Granger gets on the plane and comes here, then let us see what outcome he will get and whether he can address this outrageous attack on Geelong manufacturing and other jobs, and this outrageous attack on Geelong families. When Councillor Granger says we cannot wait, I say to Councillor Granger: I can't and we can't wait for you to start doing your job properly and stop playing cheap partisan politics when the City of Geelong and the region of Geelong is under such enormous threat.


I will finish on this. The coalition has given the government our absolute commitment to bipartisan support for the Centenary of Anzac. It will be an extraordinarily important period in this nation's history. We have the opportunity over the term of that commemoration to provide our children and leave them with a legacy that should be modelled upon the legacy left by a former Labor veterans' affairs minister, Con Sciacca, who in my view left a remarkable legacy to this country with the Australia Remembers program. What we must do is generate in the hearts and minds of our young people ownership of those things that we hold dear. It is our children, and not the current World War II and other older veterans, who oddly have the responsibility to ensure that this country never ever forgets.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (17:49):  I rise to contribute to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012. This is a government that, when it comes to spending taxpayers' money and when it comes to robbing the mums and dads of Australia blind, has absolutely no shame whatsoever. Time and time again when faced with a situation where there is no money left in the pot, what does it do? Does it do what an economic conservative would do, which is sit back and take stock of why there is no money in the pot? The answer to that when it comes to the Labor Party is no. The Labor Party has no shame at all. It merely comes into this place with another bill requesting a few more hundred million dollars from the Australian taxpayer and says to the parliament, 'We have run out of money, and we need a bit more.' 


Why do I say that? That we are currently debating appropriation bills in the Senate is proof of the fact that this government, consistent with so many Labor governments that have gone before it, when it comes to managing the Australian economy is absolutely reckless. It is not just the coalition saying that. Let's look at the figures. When the Rudd government came to power in November 2007 a great gift was bequeathed to it, and that was the legacy of the former Howard and Costello government to the tune of $22 billion with zero debt. Let's look at the situation four years on. We have had the execution of Mr Rudd, who now has so many 'formers' before his name it is embarrassing. Let's look at the situation now under the current Labor government. Under Labor, Australians are now bearing the brunt of the four biggest budget deficits in our history—not four budget deficits, but the four biggest budget deficits in Australia's history. Under those who are currently in government, Australia is borrowing $100 million each and every day of the year, and that is merely in interest alone. That's right, the Labor government is currently borrowing $100 million a day. The figure is so big you can hardly get your mind around it. If you equate that back to the average household budget, it would be like the mums and dads of Australia borrowing $1,000 every day to prop up their reckless spending. But the mums and dads of Australia cannot do that because they have to stick to very strict budgets. Unlike the Labor, they do not have the capacity to come back into this place and say, 'We are economically reckless. We have wasted taxpayers' money. We have no shame and we are going to ask for some more.' That is exactly what the Labor Party are doing under the bills we are currently debating.


Under Labor, not only have Australians had the economy destroyed but they have also been hit with no less than 20 increased taxes in just four year. The Labor Party must be the only party which, when they put through a tax in the Senate, open bottles of champagne and congratulate themselves and say, 'Well done. We've just re-robbed the Australian taxpayer blind. We think they're mugs to pay for our reckless spending.' And who pays the price for this government's continued fiscal incompetence? It is the Australian people. It is the mums and dads of Australia. Governments do not have any money of their own. The money the government has comes from the mums and dads of Australia who pay tax. They have a right to expect that the hard-earned taxes they hand over to the government will be expended appropriately. And what do we have under this government? This government have ensured that Australians are now consistently struggling under rising costs of living due solely and utterly to their reckless spending. 


I am going to turn to the portfolio that I refer to often in this place, and that is Immigration and Citizenship. What these appropriation bills are doing in relation to Immigration and Citizenship is seeking an additional $330 million. That is right, the government has come here today cap in hand seeking an additional $330 million in that portfolio alone. In typical Labor style, when these bills were debated in the other place they were described by Minister Shorten as:


These funds are sought in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the last budget ...


What a quaint and innocuous statement which, quite frankly, shows the contempt with which the Labor Party treat Australian taxpayers. Minister Shorten failed to tell Australian taxpayers the real reasons why, in February this year, the Labor government had to come cap in hand to the parliament and ask for an extra $330 million for the Immigration and Citizenship portfolio. Why did they need the money? The additional $330 million is to make up for a further blowout in last year's costs and a further increase for the 2011-12 budget, cost blowouts which, I note, Bill Shorten conveniently did not mention when he introduced the bills into the other place.


Mr Shorten refused to come clean with the Australian people. He refused to be honest with them and tell them why an additional $330 million, on top of what this parliament appropriated in the budget last year, was actually required. If he had any decency at all, if he had any respect for Australian taxpayers, he would at least have said in his speech to the parliament that Labor's decision to abolish the Pacific solution, to abolish temporary protection visas, to abolish the Howard government's proven border protection policies, is the sole reason for what is now a multibillion dollar cost blowout in this particular portfolio area.


Why do I say that is the case? Because the government has now admitted—on Monday, 13 February 2012 in Senate estimates—that Mr Rudd's decision to abolish the Pacific solution and temporary protection visas has increased costs for taxpayers with the budget for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship blowing out by more than $1 billion a year since Labor was elected. In this portfolio they are now looking at a cost blowout in excess of $4 billion. In the Senate estimates I drew attention to the fact that since Labor was elected the cost of running the department of immigration has increased from $1.6 billion in the last year of the Howard government to more than $2.7 billion following the release of the additional estimates figures. When I put this to the department, this is what they said:



Senator CASH: The cost since the 2008-09 budget have increased from less than $500 million over the forward estimates to more than $3 billion based on the current figures. And again I ask you: what was the impact on your department of the changes in policy of the Rudd and Gillard governments? Was it an increase in costs? 



Senator Lundy: Senator Cash, you are trying to extract from the official some comment on policy. That is inappropriate. 



Senator CASH: I’m asking what the impact on the department was. Was it an increase in costs? 



Senator Lundy: You know that. 


There is an admission, if ever I heard one, that the Labor government's decision to abolish the former Howard government's proven border protection policies has led directly to the multibillion dollar cost blowout that the Australian taxpayers are now footing as a result of the government's incompetence. It is not the Australian parliament that foots the bill for these budget blowouts; we merely appropriate more money for the Labor Party to spend. It is the mums and dads of Australia who, as I said before, have an expectation that, when they hand over their taxes to the government, those taxes will be spent appropriately. They do not get that in relation to this portfolio area.


In 2008-09 this government made no additional provisions for increased costs as a result of abolishing the Howard government's measures. In 2009-10 the government did it again. They did not provide for an increase in costs, despite the fact that they knew the minute they started rolling back the proven border protection policies of the Howard government that there would be an increase in boat arrivals and that increase in boat arrivals would give rise to further costs in this portfolio area. In the 2009-10 budget the government provided less than $500 million over the entire forward estimates to manage asylum seekers, and yet the direct blowout on the costs alone in this portfolio is now almost $4 billion. The government appropriated $500 million—that was their expectation of projected costs—probably because it sounded good when they read it out in the budget statement, knowing full well that that was never going to be the case. The Australian taxpayers are now faced with this government coming cap in hand to the parliament and asking for additional moneys to cover up the fact that Labor could not get it right.


In just five months since abolishing the Pacific solution and temporary protection visas the Labor government are now spending on boat arrivals what they said they would spend in four years. The result? The result is why we are here today. In relation to this particular portfolio area, the parliament is going to legislate for the government to go and waste a further $330 million to cover what is just another cost blowout. That is on top of when they came back to the parliament last year cap in hand and asked for an additional $295 million, because again they could not get their figures right. There will be $330 million extra this year, on top of $295 million extra last year and $120 million extra the year before. You would think that the government would start to try and properly estimate what this portfolio is going to cost them; $120 million extra, $295 million extra and today we are going to give them another $330 million. That is just for this portfolio area.


The question Australian taxpayers should be asking is: when is this government's insatiable appetite for wasting taxpayers' money going to end? But the sad reality for the Australian taxpayers is that when it comes to border protection the Labor Party only ever had a political strategy—that is, to appease the left of the Labor Party and the Australian Greens. When you enter into an unholy alliance, as the Labor Party have done with the Australian Greens, someone gets to pay for it. In this case the someone is the Australian people, the mums and dads of Australia. 


The additional estimates released by the government now show the extent of the current budget blowout in this portfolio area. The actual extent of the blowout is $866 million, or more than 25 per cent of what the government had estimated it was going to spend. I have to say that in May, when the government brings down this alleged surplus, one can only assume that if it has not been able to get its figures right in relation to this portfolio to date—and that is going to translate across a lot more portfolios—it will bring down a magic number, which I believe will be plucked out of the air because it is going to be fake, and the Australian taxpayers will be entitled to think that it is just one great big lie. To date, when it comes to economic credibility, this government has proven time and time again that it has absolutely none.


If we look across the entire immigration portfolio—and this does not include last year's budget blowout—the increase for the four years to 2014-15 is $759 million. This is $559 million, or almost three times, more than the $197 million the Treasurer and Minister Bowen told taxpayers the bill would be for immigration when they released MYEFO for this period last November. In just the two months, between November and February—and I have to say this is quite a good effort—the government has blown out its estimates by more than $560 million. It would be funny if it were not actually true. It would be funny if it were not for the fact that the mums and dads of Australia, who are already struggling under the 20-odd taxes that the Labor Party has so proudly imposed on them in the last four years, will have to foot the bill. It would be funny if it were not for the fact that new reports have been released that show that Australia's electricity prices are at a record high and are only going to get higher as of 1 July when the carbon tax is introduced. But it is not funny. It is not funny because the only people who are going to end up paying for this and, in fact, the only people who are already paying for this, are the Australian taxpayers. They are paying for it because the government is borrowing $100 million every day due to its inability to manage the economy properly. Under both Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard, the Labor government have presided over disaster after disaster, failure after failure, budget blow-out after budget blow-out, and boat arrival after boat arrival—all at the expense of the Australian people. The strong, robust economy that they inherited from the previous, coalition government has now been well and truly destroyed and is but a distant memory. In fact, a $22 billion surplus has been reduced to what is possibly going to be a $37.1 billion deficit. That is not the worst part. The worst part is this: that figure is actually up from what the government, at the last election, thought it would be. The government thought that their fiscal incompetence was so bad that they would be delivering a $10.4 billion deficit, and yet they have had to revise up that estimate and Australians are now looking at a $37.1 billion deficit.


In relation to this portfolio, on his watch the minister has dismantled the last remaining bricks in John Howard's wall of border protection. His budget has blown out to record levels, the detention network has been set on fire a number of times and the minister has admitted that almost 10,000 people will turn up this year and the government will not be turning any boats back before the next election. This is not an attractive legacy, to say the least.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:09):  For those listening to this debate—and I know a lot of people do via ABC News Radio—I just want to explain that the appropriations debate is about expenditure of government money. I am sad to see there are not many Labor Party senators listed to speak on this, and there should be because, boy, do they know how to spend other people's money. I make the point first of all that the government itself does not have any money. Anything the government spend is taxpayers' money. All too often the government act as if somehow, when they waste money, they are wasting government money. But, indeed, as I said, the government do not have money. What the government spend is taxpayers' money. It is the money of all those people who have done a hard day's work today and paid taxes on their earnings. It is their money that the government have a history of wasting.


As my colleague Senator Cash said, when we left government just a few short years ago, in 2007, there was about $60 billion in credit, thanks to the hard work of Peter Costello and John Howard and, indeed, the whole of the Howard government over a period of 11 years. We had turned the $96 billion deficit left by the last Labor government into something like $60 billion credit in the bank. In a few short years, this typical, high-spending Labor government has turned that credit into a deficit of something like $130 billion, and it is going up. In spite of promises by the Labor leader to not increase taxes, not bring in a carbon tax and leave the health insurance rebate as it was, we have found that, since the Gillard government has been in power, we have a new carbon tax, a new mining tax and several other new taxes. That just reinforces what I think all Australians now know: talk of Labor and you talk about taxes; talk of Labor and you talk about increased expenditure, usually on projects that are badly administered and money is wasted. This is not new; it is typically brand Labor, whether it be the Gillard government, the Rudd government, the Keating government, the Hawke government, the Bligh government in Queensland or the Beattie government in Queensland. Labor cannot handle money.


I have been in this place for a while and I was here when Labor delivered its last budget, for 1995-96, before the first Rudd budget. Australians were led to believe before the election that the budget was pretty good—that it was almost even. When we took office we found that the deficit in 1995-96 alone was $10.3 billion. An examination of the total debt of the Keating government at the time showed that Labor's total debt had increased to $96 billion. If you look back to the years of Keating and Hawke Labor you will see that a pattern has evolved. Before elections, Mr Hawke and then Mr Keating would promise tax cuts. They would promise that there would be no new taxes. Once they got into power, of course the exact opposite was done. People with a memory for political history might remember that, before the 1993 election, Mr Keating introduced legislation to say there would be a tax cut starting in 1996, following the 1993 election. When he was challenged at the Press Club on 9 February 1993, he said to the unbelieving journalists: 'That tax cut is law—l-a-w law.' It had been legislated, but as soon as Mr Keating won the 1993 election the first thing he did in the next parliament was junk the legislation that had provided for those tax cuts.


I simply make this point: you cannot believe anything any Labor leader says regarding tax cuts or new taxes. I know that in my own state of Queensland the Beattie government and then the Bligh government promised before an election that they would maintain the 8c-a-litre subsidy that Queenslanders—very nicely, thank you—had always had on their fuel. Before the election Ms Bligh promised that would stay, just as she promised, 'We won't be selling any government assets.' But in typical form, regardless of the promises before the election, as soon as Labor got in the first thing they did was remove that 8c-a-litre subsidy, making it much more expensive for all Queenslanders, and particularly those Queenslanders like me and the people I represent in the north—those who live distant from the capital cities and who rely on freight and therefore pay more in fuel costs and the added-on costs. This is just typical Labor: you simply cannot believe promises before an election.


In Queensland, my own state—and, as a senator, I feel justified in talking about my own state in the states house—we used to have a AAA credit rating. Why did we have that? Thanks to good Liberal and National Party governments in the past. You might remember that we were the first state to abolish those insidious death taxes and gift duties. We brought down the very substantial payroll taxes there were, and Queensland was a low-tax state. But it was also one of the wealthiest states, because its financial affairs were well managed by treasurers going back to the year dot—people like Gordon Chalk, going right back into the sixties and seventies. Queensland had a great economic story to tell. But, since Ms Bligh has been there, not only are we now in a position where we cannot pay our nurses in the hospitals because the government has run out of money but we have lost our AAA credit rating. How could that possibly happen with a state as wealthy as Queensland? It is just incredible that any government could mismanage the wealth of Queensland to such an extent that we in Queensland have lost our AAA credit rating.


I laugh to myself as I hear Ms Bligh wandering around Queensland: 'You've got a problem here? Right, we'll throw some money at it. We'll give huge grants. We'll build this road. We'll fix up that bridge. We'll get a new hospital here and a new airport there. Whatever you want, whatever it requires to keep us in power, you can have'—because who cares? It is not her money. It is not the money of Labor Party politicians that she is throwing around; it is taxpayers' money. But you can be assured that all of Ms Bligh's promises, like all of Ms Gillard's promises, are absolutely worthless. How can any Australian believe at any time any promise made by a Labor Party leader before an election? It distresses me that the affairs of our country and our states are in the hands of people who are just incompetent, dishonest when it comes to dealing with money and certainly dishonest in the promises they make to the Australian public. Again, we are not talking about governments' money; we are talking about taxpayers' money.


One of the taxes that will be borne by all Queenslanders is the tax that Ms Gillard specifically promised would not be introduced. I hear Minister Wong saying: 'Look, this carbon tax is needed to save the world. It's going to be great.' I say to her and to any Labor Party senator who might take part in this debate: if the carbon tax is so great, why did you promise before the last election that you would not be introducing a carbon tax? Why did you do it if you are now telling us it is so good for us all? I know the people of Queensland are asking that very same question.


I represent Queensland as a senator, but I try to look after the north of the state, and on behalf of the opposition I look after northern and remote Australia. It just so happens that with all of the big mining development—the development that has just in the last week again been taxed by a Labor government—northern and remote Australia is the area where jobs are being created. People working in the mines in Queensland earn fairly big money, and good luck to them. It is not an easy job, and they are skilled workers—well, many of them are; some of them are unskilled, but they are still earning big money because of the wealth of the mining industry that has been brought on by investment from overseas and from within Australia. Many of those workers fly in and fly out, and there is some controversy on whether that is good or bad; I have views on that, but not for tonight. They live in places like Yeppoon in the state electorate of Keppel, and they buy there because it is a very desirable place. They buy these new houses, but they pay big mortgages. Whilst they are earning big money in the mines and are able to afford these things, that is good, but if they lose their job because of the mining tax or the carbon tax then who is going to pay the mortgage? Who is going to pick up the pieces of that family's life when their life comes to ruin?


The Labor Party, as well as increasing taxes, are about to introduce the quite ridiculous rules on cabotage and coastal shipping. That means that the 800 people living in Gladstone who work in the cement factory there will find that they no longer have a job. Why? Because it will be cheaper to bring cement from South-East Asia into Townsville than to take Gladstone's cement up the coast into Townsville. The shipping will be cheaper. As time goes on the workers in Gladstone will be losing their jobs. I am sure they, as well as the electors of Keppel, will take that into account.


I mention the state electorate of Whitsunday, which takes in the northern beaches of Mackay. They are suburbs that are full of fly-in fly-out or drive-in drive-out workers in the Bowen Basin and the Galilee Basin. They are good citizens and have borrowed big to build very nice houses and build a nice life in those areas. But, if the Labor Party and their mates in the Greens shut down the coal industry, where are those people going to get their jobs? Where are they going to get the money to pay the mortgage? The Greens will tell us that they will get a job building windmills and putting in solar panels. Big deal!


This, I think, is crucial. I know people in Queensland are thinking about this at the moment. They understand that carbon taxes, mining tax and every other tax which you can be assured this federal Labor government and Ms Bligh and the Queensland state government will impose upon them are bad for their jobs. They know that. The Greens and Graeme Wood, their great benefactor, have destroyed the Tasmanian forest industry and destroyed the jobs of all those very honest workers, members of the CFMEU, who had jobs in Tasmania in the forestry industry. Now, having done that, the Greens want us to put another tick on the board. With the help of their big benefactor they are moving to shut down the coal industry in Queensland.


If I shout, Mr Acting Deputy President Furner, I do it because I want every worker in Queensland to understand and to hear this: if you vote Labor, if you vote Greens—and, effectively, it is the same—you are putting yourself out of a job and you are ensuring that your mortgage will be foreclosed upon by the bank.



Government senators interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I hear laughter from the Labor senators, and I hope that when they participate in the debate they will be able to tell me where I am wrong. Where are the jobs coming from—building windmills, building solar panels? Where else are we going to get them—digging hot rocks? Have a look at what is happening in Mackay and Townsville, which are two areas I know well. Mackay is an absolutely booming city. Townsville is doing not too bad either. Why? Because in Townsville we have three mining refineries—copper, zinc and nickel. But, if you keep taxing the mining industry, those factories will shut down. The jobs at Queensland Nickel and the copper refineries at Stuart or at Sun Metals will disappear. Where are those people going to get jobs?


You cannot trust Labor with money and you cannot trust any promise that any Labor politician might make. Ms Bligh in my home state of Queensland is, as I say, running around promising the world. She lied—and I can say this without fear of contradiction—about her only initiative in the Queensland election campaign, and that was to make up lies about Campbell Newman and to make up lies about referring to the CMC. She knew there was nothing in it. She actually admitted she had no evidence. She could not have anyone look at her record. Her total campaign has been about telling lies about a respected and honourable gentleman, Campbell Newman, the son of a former minister in this chamber, former senator Jocelyn Newman. He is a very upright and honest man. All Premier Bligh could do in her campaign was to tell lies about him.


The message I want to leave with senators in this chamber, and with any Queenslanders who might be listening to this broadcast as they drive home from a hard day's work, is that you simply cannot trust Labor with money. What is more important, you cannot trust anything a Labor leader will tell you before an election. I am delighted that Campbell Newman, in understanding the imposition on business of the payroll tax, has committed a new government, a Liberal National Party government, to reducing substantially the payroll tax burden on jobs.


My point is that before the last election Ms Gillard promised no carbon tax and she promised that there was a rock-solid guarantee to maintain the rebate on private health insurance, and what happened? Broken. Before an election a while back Ms Bligh promised that they would retain the 8c subsidy on fuel and they would not sell off Queensland Rail, and immediately they get into power what do they do? They break their word. You cannot simply believe anything that any Labor Party leader will ever tell you. I think it is important in this debate on the appropriations we all understand that mismanagement of money is Labor's hallmark.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (18:29):  I must congratulate Senator Ian Macdonald for that outstanding contribution. Whilst he was referencing the appropriation bills so eloquently, I was taken by his reference to Queensland Premier Mrs Bligh and her lack of integrity and the lack of trust that the Queensland people could have in her. It made me cast my mind back to the last South Australian election when, in a fog or a mist of sleaze and innuendo, there was this promise by the then Premier of South Australia, Mike Rann, that he would serve a full term as Premier. But, of course, we know that that was not true. It reinforces the point that Senator Macdonald has made so well: that you cannot trust Labor in any election environment. What Mrs Bligh has said about Campbell Newman, a very good man, is once again illustrative of that.


But I will take issue with one thing that Senator Macdonald said, because Mrs Bligh actually had the wherewithal to admit that she had no evidence for the smears she was making against Campbell Newman. We have a Prime Minister who did not tell the truth to the Australian people, who muttered these infamous words: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' She was then elected, then broke that promise, and then had the temerity to say that she was keeping her commitment to pricing carbon—notwithstanding the fact that she had ruled it out in its entirety. If you have to look for any sort of silver lining or you want to gild the lily with respect to Labor premiers, at least Premier Bligh admitted she had no basis for making her grubby smears, unlike our own Prime Minister who has repeatedly misled the Australian people and refuses to admit that even to herself, which is quite extraordinary.


The reason that I wanted to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.3) 2011-2012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012 is that before I came into this place I spent a number of years trying to help individuals with their finances. One of the things that I did was write a short book for children to demonstrate and illustrate to them that they could change their financial future by making a few key habits. One of the important principles I have tried to instil as I have distributed tens of thousands of these books complimentarily across Australia is that you should never spend more than you earn. Yet how can that message sink in with our young people today when we have a government that do not understand anything about spending restraint? They see a problem and they think that a tax will solve that problem.


The government have introduced two taxes most recently—the carbon tax and the mining tax—which, incredibly as it sounds, are going to cost more—due to implementation costs and the payments as a result of them—than they are actually going to raise. So the government are going to have a negative bottom line for the budget. So they introduce new taxes which punish everyday Australians—the mums and dads out there who are already battling with their family budgets—and our budget bottom line nationally is going to be worse off. This should concern all of us.


I have to remind this place and I have to remind the Australian people that you cannot borrow your way to prosperity. In the end, you have to pay back the money. In four years, we have $169 billion worth of debt—and the repayment obligation of that will fall not to me, as a 42-year-old in this place, but to my children and possibly their grandchildren. This government are clocking up debt at such a rate they are sending us down the path that European nations have found themselves—and still they refuse to confront the problem, which is their inappropriate and wasteful spending. I do not think I have to remind the Australian people that, if you spend a billion dollars putting pink batts into houses—burn a few down, kill a few people along the way—and a billion dollars to pull them out again, it is not a good policy; it is disgrace.


And this is a disgrace too, because they are asking for another $3 billion to mop up the damage from their carbon tax bill—the carbon tax bill that was promised would never be introduced under any government led by Ms Gillard. The only conclusion I can draw out of that is that Ms Gillard is not leading this government; that there are some other people on the grassy knoll getting involved with the conspiracy theory that Senator Bob Brown was on about this morning. This is a government that are desperately clinging to any hope or prospect of retaining their reign, their seat of power, in this country—even though they have no agenda.




Senator Ludlam:
  Which conspiracy theory?




Senator BERNARDI:
  Senator Ludlam, it is actually the conspiracy theory about you receiving $1.6 million for your party to push your own propaganda—and you are holding the Australian people to ransom with your idiotic Green policies that are spewing out of your tent over there.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Order! Senator Bernardi, would you address your comments through the chair and continue on the theme of your—




Senator BERNARDI:
  Indeed I will. The ridiculous and idiotic policies of the Greens are manifesting themselves in a lacklustre and directionless government led by Ms Gillard. These bills before us are about borrowing $3.1 billion on behalf of the Australian people to mop up the damage done by the government's carbon tax. This carbon tax is going to hurt the hip pocket of every Australian. It is going to damage our international competitiveness. It is going to export jobs. And it is going to make it much harder for the families of Australia to balance their budgets every single week—and they are already struggling. They are already struggling with the rise in utility prices, rising food prices and rising house prices—all this driven by a government that are spending more than they earn. That is the major problem we have.


So we are borrowing $3 billion to fix a problem created by too much wasteful spending on wasteful government policies—policies that have been driven by the Greens. This is not in the national interest; this in the interests of individuals just handing out the Australian taxpayers' money to organisations to further the aims and the ideological agenda of this government and their alliance partners, the Greens. It is not good enough. We are all going to pay the price for this—and not just today. We are going to be paying the price and repaying this debt for decades to come.


It took 10 very good years of coalition government to pay back $96 billion of debt left after the last time the Labor Party were in power. In four years they have ratcheted up $167 billion worth of debt—in four years; it beggars belief—and they do it in the name of saving us from some catastrophe. Well, why are they continuing to borrow money now? Why are they taxing successful and productive enterprises? They should be incentivising enterprises in this country—and not ridiculous ones like windmills and green energy solutions that will never, ever supply our baseload power requirements in this country. They will not, they cannot, and we all know that. Anyone with an ounce of common sense knows that.




Senator McEwen interjecting—





Senator BERNARDI:
  Unfortunately, Senator McEwen, who continues to rudely interject, does not know that. She lives in that fairyland or that nirvana where, like Senator Hanson-Young, they are going to shut down the steel industry in my home town of Whyalla and turn it into the world's biggest wind farm. What a disaster that would be! That will save plenty of jobs! How many jobs are there in a wind farm? There are not that many, and there is not that much carbon—




Senator Cash:
  Especially when the wind stops blowing.




Senator BERNARDI:
  When the wind stops blowing there are plenty of jobs for people to pull the blades around. Thank you, Senator Cash. There are not that many jobs there and it is not that carbon efficient, if that is what they are worried about when they put those big steel mills up and watch them catch fire and see the birds fly into them—and then there are the health problems that people complain about. It is a fancy. These are people who are living in an idealistic world that will never exist. We have to live in reality and that is in order to stick up for the Australian people. That is what concerns me about this.


How can we suggest to the young people of tomorrow that they need to prepare for their future? That means taking care of the environment, but it means taking practical care of it. It means not spending more than you are earning. It means getting a job—a decent job—and not living on government welfare or sitting back and hoping that the largesse of government will continue to feed, clothe and house you. This is what this government is driving into the community and society. People are now asking themselves: if everyone else is getting a handout, why am I not getting one? There used to be some pride in this country, where people who did not need welfare did not take it. This government is fostering the notion where people feel they are missing out if they are not getting some largesse. We need to stop that, because the country simply cannot afford it.


Whilst this government is borrowing $3 billion to support the notional clean energy future, it is going to try to tax the coalmines out of existence and then subsidise them along the way as well. They are going to be supporting the coalmining abatement technology, which I do not think will ever see the light of day, and they will be doing a whole range of other things. They are selling our nation short and they are selling the Australian people short.


I am short of time tonight, because I know there is at least one more speaker who wants his full allotment of time. But I have to put on the record my concerns for the Australian people about the direction this country is travelling in. It is going down the wrong path. It is a path without any principle. It is a path without boundaries or limits. In fact, I find that there is a complete lack of character in how this government conducts themselves. They will swear that black is white, and then the next day they will say that white is black again. And they call everyone who questions them a fool. They may say that I am a fool or my colleagues are fools. They can call me whatever names they might like to, but in the end someone has to say: the emperor—or the empress—has no clothes on. What they are doing to this country is a travesty and it is incumbent upon the Australian people to share that with their elected representatives so that when we do have an election they can remove this disgraceful government with their spendthrift ways and replace it with some fiscal prudence.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (18:41):  We have constant promises, streams of words and verbiage from this government and, indeed, from the Labor Party at state and federal level, as my colleagues Senator Bernardi and Senator Macdonald have outlined. But when it comes to balancing the nation's books, when it comes to delivering the long-promised surplus, Labor's promise that they will deliver a budget surplus is up there with 'I'll call in the morning'—and, I might say, it is also up there with 'I'll only be 10 minutes' in Senate estimates committees.


There is a moral issue to running up constant budget deficits. There is an equity issue to running up constant budget deficits. That equity issue is that every dollar borrowed today is merely a dollar of deferred taxation. As well as the interest cost, it is something to be paid back by future taxpayers. So for all the purposes of indulgence today and achieving whatever the government wants in the short term rather than investing for the long term, the truth is that that is merely deferring the cost to future taxpayers. That is something I take seriously and it is something that the coalition take seriously, because government debt is a bad thing. We have heard arguments from ministers of this government for months, even years, about how they apparently saved all these jobs during the global financial crisis—which we now know was mainly a North Atlantic and European banking crisis. There is no evidence that those jobs were saved, particularly with the second stimulus package. 


We saw the Auditor-General's report yesterday into the bike paths, that pointed out that there could not be a quantification of the number of jobs produced. Shovelling money out the door and sending cheques of $900—including to dead people and prisoners, I might add—does not protect an economy. What protects an economy is economic reform, productivity-driving reform and a government that is balancing its books in order to take pressure off interest rates and, in this case in particular, to take pressure off the dollar, because 80 per cent of the Commonwealth borrowings are coming from overseas. On top of the massive borrowings being racked up by state Labor governments over the last 10 years, that actually does put Australia in a precarious debt situation. 


In order for every company in Australia to be able to borrow money, either through their bank or through their financial markets or through bond holders, we need a situation where the government is not in that market constantly putting pressure on demands for money. Our banks are very dependent upon overseas funding, although that has taken a slight change lately with the increase in savings—which I might say is a good thing, yet the government seems to try to say that it is the reason why retail spending is weak. People saving is something that we spent the 1980s and 1990s trying to encourage. So that in itself is a positive: people investing for their own future. What is a negative about it is why people are doing it. People are doing it because they are scared. People are doing it because at the same time the government is borrowing tens of billions of dollars a year and trumpeting about how strong the economy is, people in the most populous areas of Australia are feeling the pinch. The small business community in particular is feeling the pinch. Retail spending is low. It is all because of a lack of confidence. What we hear from this government and have heard through the last several budgets delivered by the Deputy Prime Minister is a message that is being delivered with a forked tongue. When we first started back in 2008, the first budget was all about the inflation genie. It had escaped the bottle. The problem was the economy was running too fast—not fast enough for Labor to drive the budget into deficit, mind you—and we had to pull back spending. As the shadow Treasurer has said, we have heard Wayne Swan talk the talk a great deal on tough budgets and tough decisions, but we have never actually seen any action.


After that we had the great crisis that fulfilled the dreams of every member of the Labor Party and the Greens of implementing a statist economic policy that led to massive new taxes, a massive amount of regulation and the fatal conceit that somehow the government could save the economy. In a small, traded economy with a floating exchange rate, the old notion of Keynesian stimulus is not something that has a consensus that it works. The government can quote economists that say it does; there are many who say it does not. But sending out $900 cheques, which we know led to booms in poker machines—and Jerry Harvey said was fantastic for the sale of flatscreen TVs—the whole idea of sending out money like that, when we know a lot of it was saved as well, to somehow save the economy is based on a 30- or 40-year-old notion of an economy.


It surprises me that the present Labor Party is naught but a shadow of the Labor Party that existed in the eighties and which the coalition has previously given credit to. That Labor Party did support policies that opened the economy; it did support policies on competition and did drive difficult but necessary economic reform. Those very changes—the floating of the exchange rate, the removal of tariff barriers and the opening of our economy to much more international trade—actually made the whole notion of Keynesian stimulus, like it was the 1960s and a closed economy, completely superfluous. The government is wrong on that, and that little report yesterday about the bike path in Byron Bay illustrates it in a micro sense. The more we go on, the more we know that the notion of stimulating the economy through simply borrowing money and shovelling it out the door has no place in a modern, liberalised market economy.


But I am not actually sure that that is what the government wants. What we have seen and what these appropriation bills represent is yet another step in the statist approach that this government entails. We have had new taxes; the two big ones which have been debated in recent months are the carbon tax and the mining tax. We have had the attacks on private health insurance. Apparently the Medicare levy should be universal but the rebate should not. I state again that the very reason the rebate was structured as a rebate was to ensure that it was worth more to lower-income earners than high-income earners. If a person on the lowest tax bracket had a tax deduction for private health insurance, they did not get as much benefit as a person on the highest tax bracket. The Howard government intentionally structured the private health insurance rebate as a flat rebate to ensure it meant more to lower-income earners. The millions of Australians earning under $50,000 are going to face higher increases in their private health insurance than they otherwise would because of the policies of those opposite. There is no other way to put it. We know it is going to lead to people dropping out of private health insurance. We know that is going to lead to a reduction in the size of the pool. We know it is also going to impact upon the type of people who purchase private health insurance. But the government does not care, because it wants to continue its war against the private health sector even though more than half of all the surgical procedures in this country are performed in private hospitals and even though the Productivity Commission in its substantial report several years ago outlined that in many cases the private sector is cheaper. The dream of Labor and the Greens of a national health service for Australia is going to take precedence over the welfare of Australians.


We have seen it in education, where the Gonski review is nothing but a charade and a bail to continue Labor's war on nongovernment and independent schools. When you have in there terms like 'capacity to pay'—




Senator McLucas:
  You haven't read it, have you?




Senator RYAN:
  I will take that interjection, Senator McLucas. Labor has just got better at hiding its intention. You do not use the term 'hit list' anymore; you use a term like 'capacity to pay' hidden amongst pages and pages. The point is that the term 'capacity to pay' apparently only matters when we are talking about people at nongovernment schools. That means that those in nongovernment primary schools in particular could face massive increases in their fees. This is because nongovernment primary schools, particularly the Catholic sector, are often at a much lower fee level. So if we are going to start looking at the capacity of parents to pay regardless of what the fees are at the moment, that can only be a vehicle for Labor to force the parents of people sending their children to nongovernment schools—in this case, Catholic primary schools—to pay higher fees. Again it is continuing its statist approach because there is nothing better than a state-run monopoly.


They have done it with tax. The carbon tax is nothing but an internal tariff on our economy. I was interested in the first speech of the foreign minister, Senator Carr, earlier today. He talked about George Reid being a Free Trader. I think he slurred the great Alfred Deakin a bit much. I would like to point out that both of them were implacable opponents of the Labor Party. Both of them might have fought over the Federation of Australia, but it was the Labor Party that opposed the Federation of Australia. It was Liberals, Free Traders and Protectionists who fought for the Federation of Australia. Labor has always had a chip on its shoulder about that. But the foreign minister lauded Mr Reid for his opposition to customs duties and tariffs because they impact on the poorest. We know they are regressive in their effect. We know that tariffs on everything from textiles, clothing and footwear to everything else that Australia had built up by the mid-1980s were highly regressive in their impact. We know, as Senator Carr outlined, that they made the cost of living higher than it needed to be.


What is the carbon tax? The carbon tax is nothing but an internal tariff. If I purchase a television made overseas, there is no carbon tax on that regardless of the myths propagated by those opposite. This is the highest and broadest based carbon tax in the world. If I buy a television from overseas, there is no carbon tax component of that. If I bought one in Australia—if there were to be one made in Australia—then, quite frankly, there would be. You might say, 'There are no TVs made in Australia,' Senator McLucas. Let's go to cars, where the cost of building a car in Australia will be $500 more expensive because of the carbon tax. How on earth are we to take seriously the government's complaint about wanting to maintain a car industry in Australia when they increase the cost of production here that is not faced by all the Mazdas and Volkswagens rolling off the ships in the Port of Melbourne?


It is nothing short of ludicrous, but it does go to the core of the ideal Labor and Greens economy. We see that in this budget, because what they want is patronage and the ability to tax and to hand out favours. 


I will go through a few of the things that are off budget which have a substantial impact on the financial state of the Commonwealth, even though they are not technically in the budget papers. We have $50 billion for the NBN, which I have no doubt will in decades to come be still quoted in this place as one of the greatest misconceived ideas. I have little doubt that in the coming years it will be seen, a bit like the Victorian desalination plant, as a great boondoggle for Labor's favoured mates and particular trade unions.


We have the $10 billion clean energy fund. The price of the Greens to get the carbon tax was $10 billion. The clean energy fund precludes certain technology regardless of whether it is clean. It cannot do anything about coal because coal is inherently evil. It cannot be touched even if someone did make it clean in a way that would satisfy the Greens. Coal is the problem. This is a $10 billion fund that is basically picking losers, because this is for commercial proposals that cannot get private sector funding and that are not viable under the mandatory renewable energy target or many of the other programs that are in place. So we are going to hand over $10 billion for these projects, even though they fail those first two hurdles.


I come from Victoria. My generation is still scarred from Tricontinental and the Victorian Economic Development Corpora­tion of John Cain and Rob Jolly and, subsequently, the Kirner government. It is nothing more than picking losers, but the government has hidden it off the budget. The government has not committed to any of the funding requirements in the Gonski review, which parents should rightly be afraid about. The government are now talking about how apparently the mining tax—which this place debated late last week and early this week—is going to somehow deliver increased superannuation.


I turn to the area of small business because there is a great myth—and the government has tried to conflate the two topics intentionally—that somehow the mining tax will pay for superannuation. Every employer in this country, small and large, knows that the mining tax does not pay a cent of superannuation. That is going to come out of workers' pockets and in the short term it is going to come out of employers' pockets. Mind you, these are employers, particularly in small business, who are already facing the highest costs of doing business in a decade. Today we saw the report, based on more recent data than the government likes to admit, that Australia is one of the most expensive places in the world for electricity.


I note that my home state of Victoria is the fifth most expensive place in the world for electricity out of the 70-odd markets surveyed. This is a state where Sir John Monash built the State Electricity Commission, based on technology from Europe, with our massive deposits of brown coal. I heard my friend the Minister for Energy and Resources in Victoria say today on AM that Victoria has more energy stored in its brown coal reserves than the entire North West Shelf. That is how much brown coal we have—enough for hundreds of years. It used to be cheap to have electricity in Victoria. It was something we aspired to. I think it is something we still should aspire to. But the government seeks to use a carbon tax to force up the cost even higher. 


The Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong, in answering questions always tries to dodge this key point. The carbon tax is intended to force up the cost of electricity. I do not know about you, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I do not want my grandmother and other people's grandmothers who grew up in a different generation and who value a dollar because of their life experiences—we all know stories of people not turning the heat on in winter and not turning the air conditioner on in summer because they do not want to worry about the power bill—thinking that they should skimp on turning on the air conditioner on a 42-degree Melbourne February day or turning on the heater on a four-degree Melbourne July night. Whether it was Sir John Monash or Henry Bolte or people previously—and I dare say even the Labor Party previously—cheap energy was considered to be something this country should be proud of. It was a competitive advantage, but now we have this delusion that somehow by making energy more expensive we are going to transform our economy. Economics 101: if you make an input cost like energy more expensive, you are going to suffer an economic welfare loss. There is no other way about it. 


The delusional Greens in the corner somehow think that simply forcing up the price of electricity that you and I and our parents, friends and relatives pay in our houses to turn on a light will miraculously bring about a new technology. That is flawed logic. There is an old economist saying: the Stone Age did not end because they ran out of stones. I hasten to add that it did not end because they introduced a stone tax either. The Stone Age ended because someone invented bronze. There is no lack of incentive for anyone around the world at the moment to be exploring new technologies. It is the story of humanity. Only a Labor-Greens government suffers from the conceit that somehow a new tax will lead to a new technology—somewhere someone is coming up with a way to make the windmill and the solar panel work better because of a new tax. Does anyone here seriously think that those efforts will be stronger on 2 July this year than they are on 29 June?


That is absolutely untrue. The government says the economy is still going to grow. Of course, it is going to grow, but the truth that this government will not admit is that it will grow by a lot less if only we did not have a carbon tax. The true cost is in the difference between the growth curves, but this government and their Greens allies like to pretend that by forcing up the cost of energy we are miraculously going to transform ourselves into a new economy. We may transform ourselves into a new economy because no-one in the world is doing what we do. We may transform ourselves from what was once a shining beacon of the world with low government debt, high productivity growth and high economic growth to be something like Europe.


Labor and the Greens through budgets like this are doing nothing less than seeking to Europeanise Australia. I notice Senator Ludlam smiling. They are trying to create a highly regulated state, where the government determines how people go about their business by forcing up energy costs and increasing regulation everywhere from the workplace to occupational health and safety. I am reminded of the story about Napoleon dismissing the English before the Battle of Waterloo as nothing but a nation of shopkeepers. What he did not understand was that it was because they were shopkeepers that they won. It was the free market economy of post Scottish enlightenment Britain, the start of the Industrial Revolution. It was the high-street shops and businesses that drove innovation. It was that market that was so important. What we are seeing in budgets like this is nothing less than an attempt to reregulate our economy in a way that we have not seen since the 1960s. It is going to lead to an economic welfare loss for every Australian as their costs go up. We are seeing GDP growth per capita of less than one per cent. That is why people are feeling the pinch.


It makes no sense to force up the cost of doing business, to force up the cost of buying everyday household goods and—

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (17:28):  I am not sure if we have just seen Bob the senator or Bob the historian or Bob the blogger but I do congratulate my new colleague on his first speech. I note with some interest the content of Senator Bob Carr's speech in relation to the environment and I have a question for him: as premier, would he have gone to the people of New South Wales two days before an election and told them a complete untruth on what he was going to do about such an important policy as a carbon tax?


Because I remind Senator Bob Carr that two days before the last election the person who prevailed upon him to come into this place was indeed the very person who told the great lie of Australian politics in the last century, and that was: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' I ask Senator Bob Carr: would he have gone to the New South Wales people and told a complete untruth? That is what I would like to hear from Senator Carr when he makes his next speech.


I would like to refer Senator Bob Carr to an article in the Australian in February of this year written by Graham Lloyd, the environment editor. I will just read it because, with the greatest respect to the new senator, I did not think his Chicken Little approach to what lies ahead was a constructive debate in relation to where we will be in the next 10, 20 or 50 years. Graham Lloyd, the environment editor, said:


Himalayan glaciers are back on the frontline of climate change controversy, with new research showing the world's greatest snowcapped peaks lost no ice at all over the past 10 years.


Claims the Himalayan ice peaks would disappear by 2035 instead of 2350 cast doubt over the credibility of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2009 report. Now even the 2350 estimate of disappearing ice is open to question.


Research published in the scientific journal Nature showed satellite measurements of the ice peaks from the Himalayas to Tian Shan on the border of China and Kyrgyzstan have come to an unexpected conclusion.


While lower-altitude glaciers were melting over the past eight years, enough snow was being added …


…   …   …


In 2010, the head of the IPCC was forced to apologise for including in a 2007 report the claim that there was a 'very high' chance of glaciers disappearing from the Himalayas by 2035.


Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the IPCC, conceded in January 2010 that 'the clear and well-established standards of evidence required by the IPCC procedures were not applied properly' when the claim was included.


I do want to talk about some other matters. One is that in 2012 we mark the 70th anniversary of a number of matters that were an indication of the darkest of days in 1942 and the challenges facing this nation. Without an exhaustive list, of course I note the fall of Singapore; the bombing of Darwin—and Natasha Griggs from the other place, the member for Solomon, is responsible for a motion, accepted by both chambers in the end, that we recognise the bombing of Darwin, and full marks to her; the battles of Sunda Strait and Bantam Bay and the sinking of HMAS Perth; the bombing of Broome and Wyndham; HMAS Yarra, sunk off Java; the battle of Java itself; the battle of the Coral Sea; attacks on Sydney Harbour by Japanese midget submarines; the Queen unveiling Bomber Command Memorial in London this year on 28 June; the sinking of the Montevideo Maru; the battle of the Kokoda Track in New Guinea; the battle of Milne Bay in New Guinea; the battle of El Alamein in Egypt; and of course there are others. This is a moment and a year of solemn reflection for this country.


I want to talk about another matter that relates to a function I attended with the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott, in Bendigo on 5 March. There the Leader of the Opposition in writing again pledged the coalition to address the DFRDB and the DFRB indexation matter. Again, the Leader of the Opposition has set in stone the commitment of the coalition to address the wrongs that should have been righted many years ago—and I acknowledge it should have been righted by the former government. But I am not here to debate what happened before; I am here to debate and talk about what we need to do now. This chamber should be ashamed that on 16 June last year when the opportunity was there to address this issue of the fair indexation of this superannuation, which we all know is a wrong that should be righted, the Australian Labor Party, the Greens and Senator Xenophon voted it down.




Senator Edwards:
  Shame!




Senator RONALDSON:
  A unique opportunity—and, as Senator Edwards said, a shame. It was indeed a disgrace. We will index the military superannuation pensions the way they should be. Can anyone in this chamber tell me—I know from our side that they can, they will have the answer; but can anyone from the Australian Labor Party or the Greens tell me how it is appropriate to index age pensions and service pensions differently for these men and women? It is outrageous, it is unfair and it is inequitable, and this chamber had the opportunity to address it in June last year and it did not do so. That is to the eternal shame of this chamber. It is to the eternal shame of the Australian Labor Party and the Greens, and they stand utterly condemned for not addressing fair indexation when presented with the opportunity to do so.


Don't forget, this was about fair go. This was the opportunity to give 57,000 Australian families a fair go, and a fair go was not given. I know there are many, many Labor members who quite rightly have been inundated with emails and other correspondence from veterans, not just from those on the DFRDB and the DFRB but from many veterans who are absolutely incensed about what has happened.




Senator Edwards:
  Completely let down.




Senator RONALDSON:
  Completely and utterly let down, as Senator Edwards said. But the coalition will not let these men and women down, and that pledge is absolutely now written in stone. Another matter of enormous concern is the decision of the government last year to slash $8 million from veterans advocacy funding and the Veteran and Community Grants program. Just to put this into perspective, the state where this will have the biggest impact is Victoria. When the government released its advocacy review there was money set aside, quite rightly, to enable work to be done to include in New South Wales and Queensland the sorts of veterans welfare centres that Victoria had. But, remarkably, it has now removed that money. A reduction in funding was not mentioned or addressed at all by the advocacy funding review. In fact, if you read the review properly there is probably a very good reason to increase funding. So the very welfare centre model that the government was putting money into to spread the centres has been utterly decimated by the government's decision to remove $8 million.


There is a very real chance that the Ballarat Veterans Support Centre will close. The Central Victorian Veterans  Support Centre in Bendigo is under enormous strain. The administrator has taken a pay cut so the centre can remain open. It is the same in Geelong. It is the same in the Blue Mountains. Everywhere I go I am confronted with veterans advocates and pensioner welfare officers telling me they wonder why they are doing this work when the government itself refuses to acknowledge the work that they are doing. These are volunteers volunteering their services for the veteran community—some are veterans, a number are not. They believe this role is so important that they volunteer their services. And the government, in that budget decision last year, absolutely ripped the heart and soul of these centres and ripped out of those volunteers to some extent the commitment that they previously had. They themselves are saying, 'If that is the way the government treats us, why should we continue doing this?' I am confident they will because I know the cause is bigger than the incompetence of this government.


Turning to the BEST funding, young veterans and their families are the ones who potentially will lose the most out of these centres not providing potentially the level of service that they were. Those young men and women are the ones who, if they have got nowhere to go, are more likely to walk away from accessing their entitlements—legitimate entitlements given by the people of this country in recognition of the uniqueness of the military service they have been engaged in. The uniqueness of military service must underpin every decision we as a nation make and underpin every decision that comes from both here and the other place. The uniqueness of military service has not been recognised with the slashing of the BEST funding.


The veterans, quite rightly, are utterly incensed that they must pay for the incompetence of this government. It is not just the DFRDB recipients. It is TPI pensioners and the widows who cannot access the gold card. I can go on and on. I will tell you why these veteran issues cannot be addressed. I will go through some of the reasons. The Home Insulation Program: $2.4 billion was wasted and mismanaged. The Building the Education Revolution: a $1.7 billion blow-out on school halls with a program costing $16.2 billion and estimates of up to $8 billion wasted. The Computers in Schools program: blown out by $1.2 billion, with one million computers promised but only 300,000 delivered. The Broadband Network: promised for $4.7 billion but replaced with a $43 billion plan. There was FuelWatch and GroceryWatch. There was the solar home program: a $150 million blow-out with the program cancelled. Green Loans program: $300 million wasted, with the program cancelled. And, to rub salt into the wounds of those people who served this country, there has been nearly $1 billion spent on consultants by this government since they came to office in 2007. Government advertising is another one: the stimulus advertising, $50 million wasted; climate change advertising, $14 million wasted. There was $81.9 million to implement the ETS that never was. For the 2020 Summit: $2 million wasted. The tax bonus payments: $46 million wasted, with money sent to people overseas, criminals and dead people. It is about time we got our priorities right.


I will raise another matter. The cost of servicing the 'loan' that this government has imposed on the people of this country—every man, woman and child—is an interest bill of $8 billion. Given the appropriate amount of time, I could go through, chapter and verse, every single dollar that could have been spent from that $8 billion on the veterans of this country. That $8 billion would pay for the bulk of the issues that the veteran community, quite rightly, is angry about. If there was some good to have come out of this waste and mismanagement, there might have been an excuse for it. But how can any government turn around a country with budget surpluses and no debt into something now approaching about $130 billion to $140 billion of net debt and borrowing $100 million a day? I thank Senator Edwards and Senator Cash for assisted me with this figure: we are borrowing $100 million a day. It is absolutely outrageous. In the four minutes left I want to raise several other matters. I pay tribute to the outgoing Chairman of the Council of the Australian War Memorial, General Peter Cosgrove. General Cosgrove steered the Australian War Memorial through difficult times. I do not want to politicise these comments, but I will say the government was dragged kicking and screaming into providing the War Memorial with desperately needed funds. On behalf of the coalition and, I am sure, on behalf of this chamber and the Australian people, I thank General Peter Cosgrove most sincerely for his contribution. I do, on behalf of all those aforementioned, welcome Rear Admiral Ken Doolan AO RAN (Ret'd) as Chairman of the Council of the Australian War Memorial. Admiral Doolan joins a distinguished list of Australians who have served as chairmen of the Australian War Memorial's council. I have every confidence that Admiral Doolan will forthrightly represent the Memorial's views to the government and ensure that projects like the gallery's redevelopment are properly funded and delivered on time.


I turn to some remarkable comments by Councillor Cameron Granger, the Deputy Mayor of Geelong, who, of course, is a member of the ALP right and is in the faction of Richard Marles, the member for Corio. The Geelong Advertiser reports today that Councillor Granger at a Geelong business network breakfast had the gall to attack the Premier of Victoria over Alcoa. He made the quite remarkable comment: 'Mr Premier, we can't wait. Devise a plan to assist and get on a plane to New York.' Well, I have got some advice for Councillor Granger: why doesn't Councillor Granger, the Labor Party lackey Deputy Mayor of the City of Geelong, get on a plane and fly to Canberra and tell the Prime Minister of this country and the right wing of the Labor Party that he does not want a carbon tax, because the carbon tax is the one imposition that will destroy manufacturing jobs in Geelong. So if Councillor Granger gets on the plane and comes here, then let us see what outcome he will get and whether he can address this outrageous attack on Geelong manufacturing and other jobs, and this outrageous attack on Geelong families. When Councillor Granger says we cannot wait, I say to Councillor Granger: I can't and we can't wait for you to start doing your job properly and stop playing cheap partisan politics when the City of Geelong and the region of Geelong is under such enormous threat.


I will finish on this. The coalition has given the government our absolute commitment to bipartisan support for the Centenary of Anzac. It will be an extraordinarily important period in this nation's history. We have the opportunity over the term of that commemoration to provide our children and leave them with a legacy that should be modelled upon the legacy left by a former Labor veterans' affairs minister, Con Sciacca, who in my view left a remarkable legacy to this country with the Australia Remembers program. What we must do is generate in the hearts and minds of our young people ownership of those things that we hold dear. It is our children, and not the current World War II and other older veterans, who oddly have the responsibility to ensure that this country never ever forgets.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2012-03-21,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (17:49):  I rise to contribute to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012. This is a government that, when it comes to spending taxpayers' money and when it comes to robbing the mums and dads of Australia blind, has absolutely no shame whatsoever. Time and time again when faced with a situation where there is no money left in the pot, what does it do? Does it do what an economic conservative would do, which is sit back and take stock of why there is no money in the pot? The answer to that when it comes to the Labor Party is no. The Labor Party has no shame at all. It merely comes into this place with another bill requesting a few more hundred million dollars from the Australian taxpayer and says to the parliament, 'We have run out of money, and we need a bit more.' 


Why do I say that? That we are currently debating appropriation bills in the Senate is proof of the fact that this government, consistent with so many Labor governments that have gone before it, when it comes to managing the Australian economy is absolutely reckless. It is not just the coalition saying that. Let's look at the figures. When the Rudd government came to power in November 2007 a great gift was bequeathed to it, and that was the legacy of the former Howard and Costello government to the tune of $22 billion with zero debt. Let's look at the situation four years on. We have had the execution of Mr Rudd, who now has so many 'formers' before his name it is embarrassing. Let's look at the situation now under the current Labor government. Under Labor, Australians are now bearing the brunt of the four biggest budget deficits in our history—not four budget deficits, but the four biggest budget deficits in Australia's history. Under those who are currently in government, Australia is borrowing $100 million each and every day of the year, and that is merely in interest alone. That's right, the Labor government is currently borrowing $100 million a day. The figure is so big you can hardly get your mind around it. If you equate that back to the average household budget, it would be like the mums and dads of Australia borrowing $1,000 every day to prop up their reckless spending. But the mums and dads of Australia cannot do that because they have to stick to very strict budgets. Unlike the Labor, they do not have the capacity to come back into this place and say, 'We are economically reckless. We have wasted taxpayers' money. We have no shame and we are going to ask for some more.' That is exactly what the Labor Party are doing under the bills we are currently debating.


Under Labor, not only have Australians had the economy destroyed but they have also been hit with no less than 20 increased taxes in just four year. The Labor Party must be the only party which, when they put through a tax in the Senate, open bottles of champagne and congratulate themselves and say, 'Well done. We've just re-robbed the Australian taxpayer blind. We think they're mugs to pay for our reckless spending.' And who pays the price for this government's continued fiscal incompetence? It is the Australian people. It is the mums and dads of Australia. Governments do not have any money of their own. The money the government has comes from the mums and dads of Australia who pay tax. They have a right to expect that the hard-earned taxes they hand over to the government will be expended appropriately. And what do we have under this government? This government have ensured that Australians are now consistently struggling under rising costs of living due solely and utterly to their reckless spending. 


I am going to turn to the portfolio that I refer to often in this place, and that is Immigration and Citizenship. What these appropriation bills are doing in relation to Immigration and Citizenship is seeking an additional $330 million. That is right, the government has come here today cap in hand seeking an additional $330 million in that portfolio alone. In typical Labor style, when these bills were debated in the other place they were described by Minister Shorten as:


These funds are sought in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the last budget ...


What a quaint and innocuous statement which, quite frankly, shows the contempt with which the Labor Party treat Australian taxpayers. Minister Shorten failed to tell Australian taxpayers the real reasons why, in February this year, the Labor government had to come cap in hand to the parliament and ask for an extra $330 million for the Immigration and Citizenship portfolio. Why did they need the money? The additional $330 million is to make up for a further blowout in last year's costs and a further increase for the 2011-12 budget, cost blowouts which, I note, Bill Shorten conveniently did not mention when he introduced the bills into the other place.


Mr Shorten refused to come clean with the Australian people. He refused to be honest with them and tell them why an additional $330 million, on top of what this parliament appropriated in the budget last year, was actually required. If he had any decency at all, if he had any respect for Australian taxpayers, he would at least have said in his speech to the parliament that Labor's decision to abolish the Pacific solution, to abolish temporary protection visas, to abolish the Howard government's proven border protection policies, is the sole reason for what is now a multibillion dollar cost blowout in this particular portfolio area.


Why do I say that is the case? Because the government has now admitted—on Monday, 13 February 2012 in Senate estimates—that Mr Rudd's decision to abolish the Pacific solution and temporary protection visas has increased costs for taxpayers with the budget for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship blowing out by more than $1 billion a year since Labor was elected. In this portfolio they are now looking at a cost blowout in excess of $4 billion. In the Senate estimates I drew attention to the fact that since Labor was elected the cost of running the department of immigration has increased from $1.6 billion in the last year of the Howard government to more than $2.7 billion following the release of the additional estimates figures. When I put this to the department, this is what they said:



Senator CASH: The cost since the 2008-09 budget have increased from less than $500 million over the forward estimates to more than $3 billion based on the current figures. And again I ask you: what was the impact on your department of the changes in policy of the Rudd and Gillard governments? Was it an increase in costs? 



Senator Lundy: Senator Cash, you are trying to extract from the official some comment on policy. That is inappropriate. 



Senator CASH: I’m asking what the impact on the department was. Was it an increase in costs? 



Senator Lundy: You know that. 


There is an admission, if ever I heard one, that the Labor government's decision to abolish the former Howard government's proven border protection policies has led directly to the multibillion dollar cost blowout that the Australian taxpayers are now footing as a result of the government's incompetence. It is not the Australian parliament that foots the bill for these budget blowouts; we merely appropriate more money for the Labor Party to spend. It is the mums and dads of Australia who, as I said before, have an expectation that, when they hand over their taxes to the government, those taxes will be spent appropriately. They do not get that in relation to this portfolio area.


In 2008-09 this government made no additional provisions for increased costs as a result of abolishing the Howard government's measures. In 2009-10 the government did it again. They did not provide for an increase in costs, despite the fact that they knew the minute they started rolling back the proven border protection policies of the Howard government that there would be an increase in boat arrivals and that increase in boat arrivals would give rise to further costs in this portfolio area. In the 2009-10 budget the government provided less than $500 million over the entire forward estimates to manage asylum seekers, and yet the direct blowout on the costs alone in this portfolio is now almost $4 billion. The government appropriated $500 million—that was their expectation of projected costs—probably because it sounded good when they read it out in the budget statement, knowing full well that that was never going to be the case. The Australian taxpayers are now faced with this government coming cap in hand to the parliament and asking for additional moneys to cover up the fact that Labor could not get it right.


In just five months since abolishing the Pacific solution and temporary protection visas the Labor government are now spending on boat arrivals what they said they would spend in four years. The result? The result is why we are here today. In relation to this particular portfolio area, the parliament is going to legislate for the government to go and waste a further $330 million to cover what is just another cost blowout. That is on top of when they came back to the parliament last year cap in hand and asked for an additional $295 million, because again they could not get their figures right. There will be $330 million extra this year, on top of $295 million extra last year and $120 million extra the year before. You would think that the government would start to try and properly estimate what this portfolio is going to cost them; $120 million extra, $295 million extra and today we are going to give them another $330 million. That is just for this portfolio area.


The question Australian taxpayers should be asking is: when is this government's insatiable appetite for wasting taxpayers' money going to end? But the sad reality for the Australian taxpayers is that when it comes to border protection the Labor Party only ever had a political strategy—that is, to appease the left of the Labor Party and the Australian Greens. When you enter into an unholy alliance, as the Labor Party have done with the Australian Greens, someone gets to pay for it. In this case the someone is the Australian people, the mums and dads of Australia. 


The additional estimates released by the government now show the extent of the current budget blowout in this portfolio area. The actual extent of the blowout is $866 million, or more than 25 per cent of what the government had estimated it was going to spend. I have to say that in May, when the government brings down this alleged surplus, one can only assume that if it has not been able to get its figures right in relation to this portfolio to date—and that is going to translate across a lot more portfolios—it will bring down a magic number, which I believe will be plucked out of the air because it is going to be fake, and the Australian taxpayers will be entitled to think that it is just one great big lie. To date, when it comes to economic credibility, this government has proven time and time again that it has absolutely none.


If we look across the entire immigration portfolio—and this does not include last year's budget blowout—the increase for the four years to 2014-15 is $759 million. This is $559 million, or almost three times, more than the $197 million the Treasurer and Minister Bowen told taxpayers the bill would be for immigration when they released MYEFO for this period last November. In just the two months, between November and February—and I have to say this is quite a good effort—the government has blown out its estimates by more than $560 million. It would be funny if it were not actually true. It would be funny if it were not for the fact that the mums and dads of Australia, who are already struggling under the 20-odd taxes that the Labor Party has so proudly imposed on them in the last four years, will have to foot the bill. It would be funny if it were not for the fact that new reports have been released that show that Australia's electricity prices are at a record high and are only going to get higher as of 1 July when the carbon tax is introduced. But it is not funny. It is not funny because the only people who are going to end up paying for this and, in fact, the only people who are already paying for this, are the Australian taxpayers. They are paying for it because the government is borrowing $100 million every day due to its inability to manage the economy properly. Under both Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard, the Labor government have presided over disaster after disaster, failure after failure, budget blow-out after budget blow-out, and boat arrival after boat arrival—all at the expense of the Australian people. The strong, robust economy that they inherited from the previous, coalition government has now been well and truly destroyed and is but a distant memory. In fact, a $22 billion surplus has been reduced to what is possibly going to be a $37.1 billion deficit. That is not the worst part. The worst part is this: that figure is actually up from what the government, at the last election, thought it would be. The government thought that their fiscal incompetence was so bad that they would be delivering a $10.4 billion deficit, and yet they have had to revise up that estimate and Australians are now looking at a $37.1 billion deficit.


In relation to this portfolio, on his watch the minister has dismantled the last remaining bricks in John Howard's wall of border protection. His budget has blown out to record levels, the detention network has been set on fire a number of times and the minister has admitted that almost 10,000 people will turn up this year and the government will not be turning any boats back before the next election. This is not an attractive legacy, to say the least.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-03-21,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:09):  For those listening to this debate—and I know a lot of people do via ABC News Radio—I just want to explain that the appropriations debate is about expenditure of government money. I am sad to see there are not many Labor Party senators listed to speak on this, and there should be because, boy, do they know how to spend other people's money. I make the point first of all that the government itself does not have any money. Anything the government spend is taxpayers' money. All too often the government act as if somehow, when they waste money, they are wasting government money. But, indeed, as I said, the government do not have money. What the government spend is taxpayers' money. It is the money of all those people who have done a hard day's work today and paid taxes on their earnings. It is their money that the government have a history of wasting.


As my colleague Senator Cash said, when we left government just a few short years ago, in 2007, there was about $60 billion in credit, thanks to the hard work of Peter Costello and John Howard and, indeed, the whole of the Howard government over a period of 11 years. We had turned the $96 billion deficit left by the last Labor government into something like $60 billion credit in the bank. In a few short years, this typical, high-spending Labor government has turned that credit into a deficit of something like $130 billion, and it is going up. In spite of promises by the Labor leader to not increase taxes, not bring in a carbon tax and leave the health insurance rebate as it was, we have found that, since the Gillard government has been in power, we have a new carbon tax, a new mining tax and several other new taxes. That just reinforces what I think all Australians now know: talk of Labor and you talk about taxes; talk of Labor and you talk about increased expenditure, usually on projects that are badly administered and money is wasted. This is not new; it is typically brand Labor, whether it be the Gillard government, the Rudd government, the Keating government, the Hawke government, the Bligh government in Queensland or the Beattie government in Queensland. Labor cannot handle money.


I have been in this place for a while and I was here when Labor delivered its last budget, for 1995-96, before the first Rudd budget. Australians were led to believe before the election that the budget was pretty good—that it was almost even. When we took office we found that the deficit in 1995-96 alone was $10.3 billion. An examination of the total debt of the Keating government at the time showed that Labor's total debt had increased to $96 billion. If you look back to the years of Keating and Hawke Labor you will see that a pattern has evolved. Before elections, Mr Hawke and then Mr Keating would promise tax cuts. They would promise that there would be no new taxes. Once they got into power, of course the exact opposite was done. People with a memory for political history might remember that, before the 1993 election, Mr Keating introduced legislation to say there would be a tax cut starting in 1996, following the 1993 election. When he was challenged at the Press Club on 9 February 1993, he said to the unbelieving journalists: 'That tax cut is law—l-a-w law.' It had been legislated, but as soon as Mr Keating won the 1993 election the first thing he did in the next parliament was junk the legislation that had provided for those tax cuts.


I simply make this point: you cannot believe anything any Labor leader says regarding tax cuts or new taxes. I know that in my own state of Queensland the Beattie government and then the Bligh government promised before an election that they would maintain the 8c-a-litre subsidy that Queenslanders—very nicely, thank you—had always had on their fuel. Before the election Ms Bligh promised that would stay, just as she promised, 'We won't be selling any government assets.' But in typical form, regardless of the promises before the election, as soon as Labor got in the first thing they did was remove that 8c-a-litre subsidy, making it much more expensive for all Queenslanders, and particularly those Queenslanders like me and the people I represent in the north—those who live distant from the capital cities and who rely on freight and therefore pay more in fuel costs and the added-on costs. This is just typical Labor: you simply cannot believe promises before an election.


In Queensland, my own state—and, as a senator, I feel justified in talking about my own state in the states house—we used to have a AAA credit rating. Why did we have that? Thanks to good Liberal and National Party governments in the past. You might remember that we were the first state to abolish those insidious death taxes and gift duties. We brought down the very substantial payroll taxes there were, and Queensland was a low-tax state. But it was also one of the wealthiest states, because its financial affairs were well managed by treasurers going back to the year dot—people like Gordon Chalk, going right back into the sixties and seventies. Queensland had a great economic story to tell. But, since Ms Bligh has been there, not only are we now in a position where we cannot pay our nurses in the hospitals because the government has run out of money but we have lost our AAA credit rating. How could that possibly happen with a state as wealthy as Queensland? It is just incredible that any government could mismanage the wealth of Queensland to such an extent that we in Queensland have lost our AAA credit rating.


I laugh to myself as I hear Ms Bligh wandering around Queensland: 'You've got a problem here? Right, we'll throw some money at it. We'll give huge grants. We'll build this road. We'll fix up that bridge. We'll get a new hospital here and a new airport there. Whatever you want, whatever it requires to keep us in power, you can have'—because who cares? It is not her money. It is not the money of Labor Party politicians that she is throwing around; it is taxpayers' money. But you can be assured that all of Ms Bligh's promises, like all of Ms Gillard's promises, are absolutely worthless. How can any Australian believe at any time any promise made by a Labor Party leader before an election? It distresses me that the affairs of our country and our states are in the hands of people who are just incompetent, dishonest when it comes to dealing with money and certainly dishonest in the promises they make to the Australian public. Again, we are not talking about governments' money; we are talking about taxpayers' money.


One of the taxes that will be borne by all Queenslanders is the tax that Ms Gillard specifically promised would not be introduced. I hear Minister Wong saying: 'Look, this carbon tax is needed to save the world. It's going to be great.' I say to her and to any Labor Party senator who might take part in this debate: if the carbon tax is so great, why did you promise before the last election that you would not be introducing a carbon tax? Why did you do it if you are now telling us it is so good for us all? I know the people of Queensland are asking that very same question.


I represent Queensland as a senator, but I try to look after the north of the state, and on behalf of the opposition I look after northern and remote Australia. It just so happens that with all of the big mining development—the development that has just in the last week again been taxed by a Labor government—northern and remote Australia is the area where jobs are being created. People working in the mines in Queensland earn fairly big money, and good luck to them. It is not an easy job, and they are skilled workers—well, many of them are; some of them are unskilled, but they are still earning big money because of the wealth of the mining industry that has been brought on by investment from overseas and from within Australia. Many of those workers fly in and fly out, and there is some controversy on whether that is good or bad; I have views on that, but not for tonight. They live in places like Yeppoon in the state electorate of Keppel, and they buy there because it is a very desirable place. They buy these new houses, but they pay big mortgages. Whilst they are earning big money in the mines and are able to afford these things, that is good, but if they lose their job because of the mining tax or the carbon tax then who is going to pay the mortgage? Who is going to pick up the pieces of that family's life when their life comes to ruin?


The Labor Party, as well as increasing taxes, are about to introduce the quite ridiculous rules on cabotage and coastal shipping. That means that the 800 people living in Gladstone who work in the cement factory there will find that they no longer have a job. Why? Because it will be cheaper to bring cement from South-East Asia into Townsville than to take Gladstone's cement up the coast into Townsville. The shipping will be cheaper. As time goes on the workers in Gladstone will be losing their jobs. I am sure they, as well as the electors of Keppel, will take that into account.


I mention the state electorate of Whitsunday, which takes in the northern beaches of Mackay. They are suburbs that are full of fly-in fly-out or drive-in drive-out workers in the Bowen Basin and the Galilee Basin. They are good citizens and have borrowed big to build very nice houses and build a nice life in those areas. But, if the Labor Party and their mates in the Greens shut down the coal industry, where are those people going to get their jobs? Where are they going to get the money to pay the mortgage? The Greens will tell us that they will get a job building windmills and putting in solar panels. Big deal!


This, I think, is crucial. I know people in Queensland are thinking about this at the moment. They understand that carbon taxes, mining tax and every other tax which you can be assured this federal Labor government and Ms Bligh and the Queensland state government will impose upon them are bad for their jobs. They know that. The Greens and Graeme Wood, their great benefactor, have destroyed the Tasmanian forest industry and destroyed the jobs of all those very honest workers, members of the CFMEU, who had jobs in Tasmania in the forestry industry. Now, having done that, the Greens want us to put another tick on the board. With the help of their big benefactor they are moving to shut down the coal industry in Queensland.


If I shout, Mr Acting Deputy President Furner, I do it because I want every worker in Queensland to understand and to hear this: if you vote Labor, if you vote Greens—and, effectively, it is the same—you are putting yourself out of a job and you are ensuring that your mortgage will be foreclosed upon by the bank.



Government senators interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I hear laughter from the Labor senators, and I hope that when they participate in the debate they will be able to tell me where I am wrong. Where are the jobs coming from—building windmills, building solar panels? Where else are we going to get them—digging hot rocks? Have a look at what is happening in Mackay and Townsville, which are two areas I know well. Mackay is an absolutely booming city. Townsville is doing not too bad either. Why? Because in Townsville we have three mining refineries—copper, zinc and nickel. But, if you keep taxing the mining industry, those factories will shut down. The jobs at Queensland Nickel and the copper refineries at Stuart or at Sun Metals will disappear. Where are those people going to get jobs?


You cannot trust Labor with money and you cannot trust any promise that any Labor politician might make. Ms Bligh in my home state of Queensland is, as I say, running around promising the world. She lied—and I can say this without fear of contradiction—about her only initiative in the Queensland election campaign, and that was to make up lies about Campbell Newman and to make up lies about referring to the CMC. She knew there was nothing in it. She actually admitted she had no evidence. She could not have anyone look at her record. Her total campaign has been about telling lies about a respected and honourable gentleman, Campbell Newman, the son of a former minister in this chamber, former senator Jocelyn Newman. He is a very upright and honest man. All Premier Bligh could do in her campaign was to tell lies about him.


The message I want to leave with senators in this chamber, and with any Queenslanders who might be listening to this broadcast as they drive home from a hard day's work, is that you simply cannot trust Labor with money. What is more important, you cannot trust anything a Labor leader will tell you before an election. I am delighted that Campbell Newman, in understanding the imposition on business of the payroll tax, has committed a new government, a Liberal National Party government, to reducing substantially the payroll tax burden on jobs.


My point is that before the last election Ms Gillard promised no carbon tax and she promised that there was a rock-solid guarantee to maintain the rebate on private health insurance, and what happened? Broken. Before an election a while back Ms Bligh promised that they would retain the 8c subsidy on fuel and they would not sell off Queensland Rail, and immediately they get into power what do they do? They break their word. You cannot simply believe anything that any Labor Party leader will ever tell you. I think it is important in this debate on the appropriations we all understand that mismanagement of money is Labor's hallmark.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2012-03-21,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (18:29):  I must congratulate Senator Ian Macdonald for that outstanding contribution. Whilst he was referencing the appropriation bills so eloquently, I was taken by his reference to Queensland Premier Mrs Bligh and her lack of integrity and the lack of trust that the Queensland people could have in her. It made me cast my mind back to the last South Australian election when, in a fog or a mist of sleaze and innuendo, there was this promise by the then Premier of South Australia, Mike Rann, that he would serve a full term as Premier. But, of course, we know that that was not true. It reinforces the point that Senator Macdonald has made so well: that you cannot trust Labor in any election environment. What Mrs Bligh has said about Campbell Newman, a very good man, is once again illustrative of that.


But I will take issue with one thing that Senator Macdonald said, because Mrs Bligh actually had the wherewithal to admit that she had no evidence for the smears she was making against Campbell Newman. We have a Prime Minister who did not tell the truth to the Australian people, who muttered these infamous words: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' She was then elected, then broke that promise, and then had the temerity to say that she was keeping her commitment to pricing carbon—notwithstanding the fact that she had ruled it out in its entirety. If you have to look for any sort of silver lining or you want to gild the lily with respect to Labor premiers, at least Premier Bligh admitted she had no basis for making her grubby smears, unlike our own Prime Minister who has repeatedly misled the Australian people and refuses to admit that even to herself, which is quite extraordinary.


The reason that I wanted to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.3) 2011-2012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012 is that before I came into this place I spent a number of years trying to help individuals with their finances. One of the things that I did was write a short book for children to demonstrate and illustrate to them that they could change their financial future by making a few key habits. One of the important principles I have tried to instil as I have distributed tens of thousands of these books complimentarily across Australia is that you should never spend more than you earn. Yet how can that message sink in with our young people today when we have a government that do not understand anything about spending restraint? They see a problem and they think that a tax will solve that problem.


The government have introduced two taxes most recently—the carbon tax and the mining tax—which, incredibly as it sounds, are going to cost more—due to implementation costs and the payments as a result of them—than they are actually going to raise. So the government are going to have a negative bottom line for the budget. So they introduce new taxes which punish everyday Australians—the mums and dads out there who are already battling with their family budgets—and our budget bottom line nationally is going to be worse off. This should concern all of us.


I have to remind this place and I have to remind the Australian people that you cannot borrow your way to prosperity. In the end, you have to pay back the money. In four years, we have $169 billion worth of debt—and the repayment obligation of that will fall not to me, as a 42-year-old in this place, but to my children and possibly their grandchildren. This government are clocking up debt at such a rate they are sending us down the path that European nations have found themselves—and still they refuse to confront the problem, which is their inappropriate and wasteful spending. I do not think I have to remind the Australian people that, if you spend a billion dollars putting pink batts into houses—burn a few down, kill a few people along the way—and a billion dollars to pull them out again, it is not a good policy; it is disgrace.


And this is a disgrace too, because they are asking for another $3 billion to mop up the damage from their carbon tax bill—the carbon tax bill that was promised would never be introduced under any government led by Ms Gillard. The only conclusion I can draw out of that is that Ms Gillard is not leading this government; that there are some other people on the grassy knoll getting involved with the conspiracy theory that Senator Bob Brown was on about this morning. This is a government that are desperately clinging to any hope or prospect of retaining their reign, their seat of power, in this country—even though they have no agenda.




Senator Ludlam:
  Which conspiracy theory?




Senator BERNARDI:
  Senator Ludlam, it is actually the conspiracy theory about you receiving $1.6 million for your party to push your own propaganda—and you are holding the Australian people to ransom with your idiotic Green policies that are spewing out of your tent over there.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Order! Senator Bernardi, would you address your comments through the chair and continue on the theme of your—




Senator BERNARDI:
  Indeed I will. The ridiculous and idiotic policies of the Greens are manifesting themselves in a lacklustre and directionless government led by Ms Gillard. These bills before us are about borrowing $3.1 billion on behalf of the Australian people to mop up the damage done by the government's carbon tax. This carbon tax is going to hurt the hip pocket of every Australian. It is going to damage our international competitiveness. It is going to export jobs. And it is going to make it much harder for the families of Australia to balance their budgets every single week—and they are already struggling. They are already struggling with the rise in utility prices, rising food prices and rising house prices—all this driven by a government that are spending more than they earn. That is the major problem we have.


So we are borrowing $3 billion to fix a problem created by too much wasteful spending on wasteful government policies—policies that have been driven by the Greens. This is not in the national interest; this in the interests of individuals just handing out the Australian taxpayers' money to organisations to further the aims and the ideological agenda of this government and their alliance partners, the Greens. It is not good enough. We are all going to pay the price for this—and not just today. We are going to be paying the price and repaying this debt for decades to come.


It took 10 very good years of coalition government to pay back $96 billion of debt left after the last time the Labor Party were in power. In four years they have ratcheted up $167 billion worth of debt—in four years; it beggars belief—and they do it in the name of saving us from some catastrophe. Well, why are they continuing to borrow money now? Why are they taxing successful and productive enterprises? They should be incentivising enterprises in this country—and not ridiculous ones like windmills and green energy solutions that will never, ever supply our baseload power requirements in this country. They will not, they cannot, and we all know that. Anyone with an ounce of common sense knows that.




Senator McEwen interjecting—





Senator BERNARDI:
  Unfortunately, Senator McEwen, who continues to rudely interject, does not know that. She lives in that fairyland or that nirvana where, like Senator Hanson-Young, they are going to shut down the steel industry in my home town of Whyalla and turn it into the world's biggest wind farm. What a disaster that would be! That will save plenty of jobs! How many jobs are there in a wind farm? There are not that many, and there is not that much carbon—




Senator Cash:
  Especially when the wind stops blowing.




Senator BERNARDI:
  When the wind stops blowing there are plenty of jobs for people to pull the blades around. Thank you, Senator Cash. There are not that many jobs there and it is not that carbon efficient, if that is what they are worried about when they put those big steel mills up and watch them catch fire and see the birds fly into them—and then there are the health problems that people complain about. It is a fancy. These are people who are living in an idealistic world that will never exist. We have to live in reality and that is in order to stick up for the Australian people. That is what concerns me about this.


How can we suggest to the young people of tomorrow that they need to prepare for their future? That means taking care of the environment, but it means taking practical care of it. It means not spending more than you are earning. It means getting a job—a decent job—and not living on government welfare or sitting back and hoping that the largesse of government will continue to feed, clothe and house you. This is what this government is driving into the community and society. People are now asking themselves: if everyone else is getting a handout, why am I not getting one? There used to be some pride in this country, where people who did not need welfare did not take it. This government is fostering the notion where people feel they are missing out if they are not getting some largesse. We need to stop that, because the country simply cannot afford it.


Whilst this government is borrowing $3 billion to support the notional clean energy future, it is going to try to tax the coalmines out of existence and then subsidise them along the way as well. They are going to be supporting the coalmining abatement technology, which I do not think will ever see the light of day, and they will be doing a whole range of other things. They are selling our nation short and they are selling the Australian people short.


I am short of time tonight, because I know there is at least one more speaker who wants his full allotment of time. But I have to put on the record my concerns for the Australian people about the direction this country is travelling in. It is going down the wrong path. It is a path without any principle. It is a path without boundaries or limits. In fact, I find that there is a complete lack of character in how this government conducts themselves. They will swear that black is white, and then the next day they will say that white is black again. And they call everyone who questions them a fool. They may say that I am a fool or my colleagues are fools. They can call me whatever names they might like to, but in the end someone has to say: the emperor—or the empress—has no clothes on. What they are doing to this country is a travesty and it is incumbent upon the Australian people to share that with their elected representatives so that when we do have an election they can remove this disgraceful government with their spendthrift ways and replace it with some fiscal prudence.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,19,2
"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2012-03-21,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (18:41):  We have constant promises, streams of words and verbiage from this government and, indeed, from the Labor Party at state and federal level, as my colleagues Senator Bernardi and Senator Macdonald have outlined. But when it comes to balancing the nation's books, when it comes to delivering the long-promised surplus, Labor's promise that they will deliver a budget surplus is up there with 'I'll call in the morning'—and, I might say, it is also up there with 'I'll only be 10 minutes' in Senate estimates committees.


There is a moral issue to running up constant budget deficits. There is an equity issue to running up constant budget deficits. That equity issue is that every dollar borrowed today is merely a dollar of deferred taxation. As well as the interest cost, it is something to be paid back by future taxpayers. So for all the purposes of indulgence today and achieving whatever the government wants in the short term rather than investing for the long term, the truth is that that is merely deferring the cost to future taxpayers. That is something I take seriously and it is something that the coalition take seriously, because government debt is a bad thing. We have heard arguments from ministers of this government for months, even years, about how they apparently saved all these jobs during the global financial crisis—which we now know was mainly a North Atlantic and European banking crisis. There is no evidence that those jobs were saved, particularly with the second stimulus package. 


We saw the Auditor-General's report yesterday into the bike paths, that pointed out that there could not be a quantification of the number of jobs produced. Shovelling money out the door and sending cheques of $900—including to dead people and prisoners, I might add—does not protect an economy. What protects an economy is economic reform, productivity-driving reform and a government that is balancing its books in order to take pressure off interest rates and, in this case in particular, to take pressure off the dollar, because 80 per cent of the Commonwealth borrowings are coming from overseas. On top of the massive borrowings being racked up by state Labor governments over the last 10 years, that actually does put Australia in a precarious debt situation. 


In order for every company in Australia to be able to borrow money, either through their bank or through their financial markets or through bond holders, we need a situation where the government is not in that market constantly putting pressure on demands for money. Our banks are very dependent upon overseas funding, although that has taken a slight change lately with the increase in savings—which I might say is a good thing, yet the government seems to try to say that it is the reason why retail spending is weak. People saving is something that we spent the 1980s and 1990s trying to encourage. So that in itself is a positive: people investing for their own future. What is a negative about it is why people are doing it. People are doing it because they are scared. People are doing it because at the same time the government is borrowing tens of billions of dollars a year and trumpeting about how strong the economy is, people in the most populous areas of Australia are feeling the pinch. The small business community in particular is feeling the pinch. Retail spending is low. It is all because of a lack of confidence. What we hear from this government and have heard through the last several budgets delivered by the Deputy Prime Minister is a message that is being delivered with a forked tongue. When we first started back in 2008, the first budget was all about the inflation genie. It had escaped the bottle. The problem was the economy was running too fast—not fast enough for Labor to drive the budget into deficit, mind you—and we had to pull back spending. As the shadow Treasurer has said, we have heard Wayne Swan talk the talk a great deal on tough budgets and tough decisions, but we have never actually seen any action.


After that we had the great crisis that fulfilled the dreams of every member of the Labor Party and the Greens of implementing a statist economic policy that led to massive new taxes, a massive amount of regulation and the fatal conceit that somehow the government could save the economy. In a small, traded economy with a floating exchange rate, the old notion of Keynesian stimulus is not something that has a consensus that it works. The government can quote economists that say it does; there are many who say it does not. But sending out $900 cheques, which we know led to booms in poker machines—and Jerry Harvey said was fantastic for the sale of flatscreen TVs—the whole idea of sending out money like that, when we know a lot of it was saved as well, to somehow save the economy is based on a 30- or 40-year-old notion of an economy.


It surprises me that the present Labor Party is naught but a shadow of the Labor Party that existed in the eighties and which the coalition has previously given credit to. That Labor Party did support policies that opened the economy; it did support policies on competition and did drive difficult but necessary economic reform. Those very changes—the floating of the exchange rate, the removal of tariff barriers and the opening of our economy to much more international trade—actually made the whole notion of Keynesian stimulus, like it was the 1960s and a closed economy, completely superfluous. The government is wrong on that, and that little report yesterday about the bike path in Byron Bay illustrates it in a micro sense. The more we go on, the more we know that the notion of stimulating the economy through simply borrowing money and shovelling it out the door has no place in a modern, liberalised market economy.


But I am not actually sure that that is what the government wants. What we have seen and what these appropriation bills represent is yet another step in the statist approach that this government entails. We have had new taxes; the two big ones which have been debated in recent months are the carbon tax and the mining tax. We have had the attacks on private health insurance. Apparently the Medicare levy should be universal but the rebate should not. I state again that the very reason the rebate was structured as a rebate was to ensure that it was worth more to lower-income earners than high-income earners. If a person on the lowest tax bracket had a tax deduction for private health insurance, they did not get as much benefit as a person on the highest tax bracket. The Howard government intentionally structured the private health insurance rebate as a flat rebate to ensure it meant more to lower-income earners. The millions of Australians earning under $50,000 are going to face higher increases in their private health insurance than they otherwise would because of the policies of those opposite. There is no other way to put it. We know it is going to lead to people dropping out of private health insurance. We know that is going to lead to a reduction in the size of the pool. We know it is also going to impact upon the type of people who purchase private health insurance. But the government does not care, because it wants to continue its war against the private health sector even though more than half of all the surgical procedures in this country are performed in private hospitals and even though the Productivity Commission in its substantial report several years ago outlined that in many cases the private sector is cheaper. The dream of Labor and the Greens of a national health service for Australia is going to take precedence over the welfare of Australians.


We have seen it in education, where the Gonski review is nothing but a charade and a bail to continue Labor's war on nongovernment and independent schools. When you have in there terms like 'capacity to pay'—




Senator McLucas:
  You haven't read it, have you?




Senator RYAN:
  I will take that interjection, Senator McLucas. Labor has just got better at hiding its intention. You do not use the term 'hit list' anymore; you use a term like 'capacity to pay' hidden amongst pages and pages. The point is that the term 'capacity to pay' apparently only matters when we are talking about people at nongovernment schools. That means that those in nongovernment primary schools in particular could face massive increases in their fees. This is because nongovernment primary schools, particularly the Catholic sector, are often at a much lower fee level. So if we are going to start looking at the capacity of parents to pay regardless of what the fees are at the moment, that can only be a vehicle for Labor to force the parents of people sending their children to nongovernment schools—in this case, Catholic primary schools—to pay higher fees. Again it is continuing its statist approach because there is nothing better than a state-run monopoly.


They have done it with tax. The carbon tax is nothing but an internal tariff on our economy. I was interested in the first speech of the foreign minister, Senator Carr, earlier today. He talked about George Reid being a Free Trader. I think he slurred the great Alfred Deakin a bit much. I would like to point out that both of them were implacable opponents of the Labor Party. Both of them might have fought over the Federation of Australia, but it was the Labor Party that opposed the Federation of Australia. It was Liberals, Free Traders and Protectionists who fought for the Federation of Australia. Labor has always had a chip on its shoulder about that. But the foreign minister lauded Mr Reid for his opposition to customs duties and tariffs because they impact on the poorest. We know they are regressive in their effect. We know that tariffs on everything from textiles, clothing and footwear to everything else that Australia had built up by the mid-1980s were highly regressive in their impact. We know, as Senator Carr outlined, that they made the cost of living higher than it needed to be.


What is the carbon tax? The carbon tax is nothing but an internal tariff. If I purchase a television made overseas, there is no carbon tax on that regardless of the myths propagated by those opposite. This is the highest and broadest based carbon tax in the world. If I buy a television from overseas, there is no carbon tax component of that. If I bought one in Australia—if there were to be one made in Australia—then, quite frankly, there would be. You might say, 'There are no TVs made in Australia,' Senator McLucas. Let's go to cars, where the cost of building a car in Australia will be $500 more expensive because of the carbon tax. How on earth are we to take seriously the government's complaint about wanting to maintain a car industry in Australia when they increase the cost of production here that is not faced by all the Mazdas and Volkswagens rolling off the ships in the Port of Melbourne?


It is nothing short of ludicrous, but it does go to the core of the ideal Labor and Greens economy. We see that in this budget, because what they want is patronage and the ability to tax and to hand out favours. 


I will go through a few of the things that are off budget which have a substantial impact on the financial state of the Commonwealth, even though they are not technically in the budget papers. We have $50 billion for the NBN, which I have no doubt will in decades to come be still quoted in this place as one of the greatest misconceived ideas. I have little doubt that in the coming years it will be seen, a bit like the Victorian desalination plant, as a great boondoggle for Labor's favoured mates and particular trade unions.


We have the $10 billion clean energy fund. The price of the Greens to get the carbon tax was $10 billion. The clean energy fund precludes certain technology regardless of whether it is clean. It cannot do anything about coal because coal is inherently evil. It cannot be touched even if someone did make it clean in a way that would satisfy the Greens. Coal is the problem. This is a $10 billion fund that is basically picking losers, because this is for commercial proposals that cannot get private sector funding and that are not viable under the mandatory renewable energy target or many of the other programs that are in place. So we are going to hand over $10 billion for these projects, even though they fail those first two hurdles.


I come from Victoria. My generation is still scarred from Tricontinental and the Victorian Economic Development Corpora­tion of John Cain and Rob Jolly and, subsequently, the Kirner government. It is nothing more than picking losers, but the government has hidden it off the budget. The government has not committed to any of the funding requirements in the Gonski review, which parents should rightly be afraid about. The government are now talking about how apparently the mining tax—which this place debated late last week and early this week—is going to somehow deliver increased superannuation.


I turn to the area of small business because there is a great myth—and the government has tried to conflate the two topics intentionally—that somehow the mining tax will pay for superannuation. Every employer in this country, small and large, knows that the mining tax does not pay a cent of superannuation. That is going to come out of workers' pockets and in the short term it is going to come out of employers' pockets. Mind you, these are employers, particularly in small business, who are already facing the highest costs of doing business in a decade. Today we saw the report, based on more recent data than the government likes to admit, that Australia is one of the most expensive places in the world for electricity.


I note that my home state of Victoria is the fifth most expensive place in the world for electricity out of the 70-odd markets surveyed. This is a state where Sir John Monash built the State Electricity Commission, based on technology from Europe, with our massive deposits of brown coal. I heard my friend the Minister for Energy and Resources in Victoria say today on AM that Victoria has more energy stored in its brown coal reserves than the entire North West Shelf. That is how much brown coal we have—enough for hundreds of years. It used to be cheap to have electricity in Victoria. It was something we aspired to. I think it is something we still should aspire to. But the government seeks to use a carbon tax to force up the cost even higher. 


The Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong, in answering questions always tries to dodge this key point. The carbon tax is intended to force up the cost of electricity. I do not know about you, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I do not want my grandmother and other people's grandmothers who grew up in a different generation and who value a dollar because of their life experiences—we all know stories of people not turning the heat on in winter and not turning the air conditioner on in summer because they do not want to worry about the power bill—thinking that they should skimp on turning on the air conditioner on a 42-degree Melbourne February day or turning on the heater on a four-degree Melbourne July night. Whether it was Sir John Monash or Henry Bolte or people previously—and I dare say even the Labor Party previously—cheap energy was considered to be something this country should be proud of. It was a competitive advantage, but now we have this delusion that somehow by making energy more expensive we are going to transform our economy. Economics 101: if you make an input cost like energy more expensive, you are going to suffer an economic welfare loss. There is no other way about it. 


The delusional Greens in the corner somehow think that simply forcing up the price of electricity that you and I and our parents, friends and relatives pay in our houses to turn on a light will miraculously bring about a new technology. That is flawed logic. There is an old economist saying: the Stone Age did not end because they ran out of stones. I hasten to add that it did not end because they introduced a stone tax either. The Stone Age ended because someone invented bronze. There is no lack of incentive for anyone around the world at the moment to be exploring new technologies. It is the story of humanity. Only a Labor-Greens government suffers from the conceit that somehow a new tax will lead to a new technology—somewhere someone is coming up with a way to make the windmill and the solar panel work better because of a new tax. Does anyone here seriously think that those efforts will be stronger on 2 July this year than they are on 29 June?


That is absolutely untrue. The government says the economy is still going to grow. Of course, it is going to grow, but the truth that this government will not admit is that it will grow by a lot less if only we did not have a carbon tax. The true cost is in the difference between the growth curves, but this government and their Greens allies like to pretend that by forcing up the cost of energy we are miraculously going to transform ourselves into a new economy. We may transform ourselves into a new economy because no-one in the world is doing what we do. We may transform ourselves from what was once a shining beacon of the world with low government debt, high productivity growth and high economic growth to be something like Europe.


Labor and the Greens through budgets like this are doing nothing less than seeking to Europeanise Australia. I notice Senator Ludlam smiling. They are trying to create a highly regulated state, where the government determines how people go about their business by forcing up energy costs and increasing regulation everywhere from the workplace to occupational health and safety. I am reminded of the story about Napoleon dismissing the English before the Battle of Waterloo as nothing but a nation of shopkeepers. What he did not understand was that it was because they were shopkeepers that they won. It was the free market economy of post Scottish enlightenment Britain, the start of the Industrial Revolution. It was the high-street shops and businesses that drove innovation. It was that market that was so important. What we are seeing in budgets like this is nothing less than an attempt to reregulate our economy in a way that we have not seen since the 1960s. It is going to lead to an economic welfare loss for every Australian as their costs go up. We are seeing GDP growth per capita of less than one per cent. That is why people are feeling the pinch.


It makes no sense to force up the cost of doing business, to force up the cost of buying everyday household goods and—

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (19:02):  It is a very difficult process to talk about this range of bills in this place because we know that there is so much pain and concern out there in the community about what has happened around the Stronger Futures legislation. 


I am speaking tonight on behalf of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee that visited a number of communities in the Northern Territory during our look into this bill. We also received a range of evidence from community members, organisations and people who care about the future of Aboriginal communities and Aboriginal people, not just in the Northern Territory. Certainly, the Stronger Futures element of this batch of legislation does refer specifically to the Northern Territory, but we also heard evidence about Aboriginal people, their rights and their futures, across the whole of this county. 


One of the core issues that our Senate community affairs committee believes in is ensuring that every person who comes to our committee is treated with respect and their evidence is listened to. We read their submissions and we try our best to ensure that they feel safe and respected and that they know that the committee cares about their evidence. One of the more distressing parts of this process has been some allegations that because the committee did not respond directly and agree with some of the positions that were put before us we somehow did not have appropriate respect for Aboriginal communities and elders. I assure you that this is not true. In fact, as a government senator I can put on record that we all share a genuine concern that what comes next in the future of the Northern Territory legislation under this title of 'Stronger Futures' will be appropriately discussed and worked on and that together we will be able to come to a future direction.


I make this point because consistently in the evidence we received there was widespread concern about the consultation process used. You would see from our report that we looked at that closely and we answered those concerns. We listened and we cared about the responses that were made. I truly believe that there is no such thing as a perfect consultation process. I also truly believe that the processes that the department has used over the last many years in dealing with Aboriginal people have not been perfect. I believe that there have been genuine efforts made to ensure that, as far as possible, the issues with the Stronger Futures process and what has gone on in the past—it is known as the NT intervention process—have been on the agenda. People from the department as well as ministers and parliamentary secretaries and local parliamentarians have all made great effort to visit communities, to sit down with people on their lands to ensure that there is an exchange of information.


I do not believe that that has been perfect. I think our committee report put that forward. There must be, in the future, ongoing work to ensure that there are appropriate consultation mechanisms to ensure that culturally appropriate consultation is put in place in any discussion about legislation with Aboriginal and Islander people. I also believe that in terms of any government consultation with any community those principles should be in place. In particular, because of the pain, confusion and anger which we found when we visited some of the Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, the committee put forward a recommendation that we ensure, in the future, that the departments work effectively with the Human Rights Commission to consider strong and effective protocols and consultation processes.


On this basis, we take some of the comments that were made by people across this country about their concerns about the consultation extraordinarily seriously. We also know—we have it on record—that significant efforts were made by the department to visit communities and talk with people. One of the processes and the problems, of course, is that when you visit communities you often only have some people attend sessions—sometimes people who have a particular view they wish to share. Of course that is their right but, in terms of ensuring that everybody has a say, that is always a problem.


Another point that was brought out consistently in previous evaluations of consultation was the fact that Aboriginal communities, over many years but in particular since 2007, have suffered from consultation overload. One of the clear points that was brought out was that there are perhaps too many visits by too many people who have not effectively prepared the way for that process, and one of the things that is brought out in the Human Rights Commission information is that this needs to be done better. So in any discussion around Stronger Futures we need to ensure that people feel that, whilst every effort can be made about effective consultation, there must be an effective interchange and also a commitment from all involved that they will engage in the process.


In discussing stronger futures, you cannot move forward unless you effectively deal with the past. One of the most confronting elements of our visit was that there was, clearly, palpable pain, suffering and regret about what had gone on when the original intervention took place. That is probably no news to many people in this place because it has been raised in the past in various debates around Aboriginal policy. But, for the wider community, in talking about where we are going to go with the Stronger Futures legislation it should be understood that there seems to be continuing confusion about what was in place beforehand. Consistently, in evidence from people who are very well informed, there was confusion about what exactly was different in the Stronger Futures legislation from how things had occurred in the past. 


We heard quite confronting stories about how disempowered people felt by the way the original intervention took place. And that pain continues to be there, not just in individuals but within whole communities, and while it is not addressed and not acknowledged it is impossible—and I use that term quite deliberately—for us to look effectively at any change in the future. So we acknowledged that as a committee. We said that we must acknowledge the past, and not just what happened at the intervention but also the years of Aboriginal and Islander first peoples' disadvantage in this country. We know that within the Northern Territory a large percentage of their population have felt this disadvantage and isolation and have felt a lack of respect by the rest of their communities. In terms of the Stronger Futures legislation, we have to work through that process beforehand.


Importantly, the Stronger Futures process addresses that. It says, clearly, what has happened in the intervention, what has changed between 2007 and now, and looks at where we can go. It points out in the legislation exactly what has changed. In particular, we look at the aspects around alcohol management. We look at the aspects around community growth. And we say that there is a genuine responsibility for all parties to play a role and to make sure that they play that role cooperatively with others. So there will not be stronger futures unless there is a genuine engagement, from all parties, in terms of where they are moving and, most particularly, of the funding that is necessary to ensure that the projects that have been put in place will be able to be effectively funded into the future.


There was great debate about the time frame that has been put into the Stronger Futures legislation. The government's proposition is a 10-year project, and that did cause great discussion. Within the evidence, there were views from all sides saying that 10 years possibly would be an effective time frame on which to move the future legislation because that would give time for an effective settling in of the programs and a chance for people at the local level to engage in and take ownership of the programs. That would give everybody the best chance for an effective future, because that is in fact what the legislation is all about—stronger futures. So there has been debate, and I believe there will be amendments moved while this debate goes on about looking at changing that time frame, because some people—and this was put to us very effectively—felt that that was too long a time frame and that there needed to be a shorter time frame to allow more evolution of what was happening and allow for concerns. So, whilst there must be a clear, independent evaluation of any of the changes that are put forward, the discussion about how long that will take will be determined by the debate in this forum.


The reason for the 10 years is to ensure that people have the time, and the funding has the time, to really make a difference. We heard in evidence that people, over many years, have suffered from too much short-term emergency funding without the chance for long-term, effective development and effective responses to people's needs. If there is going to be a stronger future that must be within the communities themselves, and people need to feel that there will be effective responses to their needs—in particular in the areas of health, employment and education.


I want to spend a bit of time on the background to what we are putting forward in this legislation about education, and also on the clear distress and confusion that was put forward to our committee because people had not had accurate information about the programs that the government was putting forward. We have had debate in this place before about the SEAM program. That is a program that looks at working effectively with parents, schools and also the Centrelink network to consider how best to ensure that families work with their kids and their schools to ensure that there is a higher attendance at school. One of the major issues in the report that led to the intervention in 2007 was the concern that too many young people were not having the chance to attend school and therefore were entrenched in disadvantage from which they could not escape because, without effective education, there is no stronger future. In fact, there is no future. There is no disagreement—everybody understands that that is a reality. Yet, from the best information and evidence we received when we were in the Northern Territory, people were at the stage of celebrating 50 per cent attendance at school. That would not be tolerated in most communities. Whilst it is important that the attendance rates have risen from below 50 per cent, when you actually have a school with facilities that are available, with teachers that are available, and the fact that the young people are not actually engaging in that process, we have a problem and we have an ongoing problem.


The SEAM program is one that has been trialled now for a couple of years in, I think, six trial sites in the Northern Territory. Certainly that actually engages with families to ensure that they work with their school and with their children to ensure that kids get to school. Unfortunately, there seemed to be a degree of confusion—and I am saying that quite diplomatically—about exactly what SEAM is about. We heard from people that the intent of SEAM was just to rip their Centrelink payment away from parents as soon as kids were not at school. We did not hear that once; we heard that consistently, and that is an inaccurate and quite misleading view of the operations of the SEAM program.


We talked with teachers, we talked with people from the NT government and we talked with people from the department, who all reassured us that that was not the way SEAM was designed to happen. The idea was that there would be an engagement facilitated by having the process that Centrelink could be involved in. But the idea of people losing their Centrelink payment was a last resort, and that was after consistent nonattendance and a lack of engagement by parents in their kid's attendance at school.


Sometimes people seem to think that I tend to take a different view on some Centrelink and social security views, but on this one I will strongly advocate that I believe the SEAM program is one with which we can cooperate actively. It has a great outcome if parents—and family members, not just parents—see the value of their involvement with their children and their school. So the process that I think we need is to ensure that we get the communication right, that we do not run scare campaigns with families and do not distance people from the very programs that are there to help them.


One of my greatest disappointments in the evidence which we received was that the degree of confusion and fear was so great that it actually stopped people thinking about where the positive outcomes could be. That is something I think that as a government and as a parliament we need to work more effectively on with communities to ensure that does not happen.


I know that there are going to be many people wanting to take part in this discussion, because it is happening in the community as well, and I will not have time to look at all the different issues that were raised with us. I know that the issue around income quarantining, which has been expanded in the social security bill that is part of this package to trial sites in other parts of the country, has caused great discussion and debate. It is most important that we continue to work effectively with the communities taking part in these trials as well as the ongoing process in the Northern Territory, to see what the intent of the program is and what the cooperative arrangements with Centrelink and with job assistance will be to ensure that people are able to engage effectively with their own budgeting and to ensure that they will be able to move forward. I know that this is a sensitive issue in some areas, and I think that this debate will go on. But I am confident that the people who had the real interest in the issues and who came and gave us extensive evidence in our inquiry will continue to work with government and also with departments to make sure that respect for people will be maintained through any decision.


The worst thing that could happen would be further division. I am confident that if we work effectively that will be overcome. But one of the messages I want to make very clear is that the discussions must continue. There cannot be a view that these changes are being forced on people and that there is no sense they are being respected in the process. The intent of the legislation all the way through is to maintain that there will be stronger futures. That must be continually in front of all the people who are working in the field and also in government.


One of the aspects of the legislation that did cause considerable discussion was around alcohol management plans. And you would remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, that in the Little children are sacred report, the report by the Northern Territory which led to the original intervention response, the issues around alcohol and drug abuse in communities and their then impact on the safety of families and children were extremely serious. I think there has been positive movement in this area, and certainly the evidence we received indicated that people felt that the stronger futures processes around alcohol management were, indeed, a step forward and that the continued ownership of local communities of their own alcohol management plans is a key part of that. There is great willingness for the communities to work with government.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (19:02):  It is a very difficult process to talk about this range of bills in this place because we know that there is so much pain and concern out there in the community about what has happened around the Stronger Futures legislation. 


I am speaking tonight on behalf of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee that visited a number of communities in the Northern Territory during our look into this bill. We also received a range of evidence from community members, organisations and people who care about the future of Aboriginal communities and Aboriginal people, not just in the Northern Territory. Certainly, the Stronger Futures element of this batch of legislation does refer specifically to the Northern Territory, but we also heard evidence about Aboriginal people, their rights and their futures, across the whole of this county. 


One of the core issues that our Senate community affairs committee believes in is ensuring that every person who comes to our committee is treated with respect and their evidence is listened to. We read their submissions and we try our best to ensure that they feel safe and respected and that they know that the committee cares about their evidence. One of the more distressing parts of this process has been some allegations that because the committee did not respond directly and agree with some of the positions that were put before us we somehow did not have appropriate respect for Aboriginal communities and elders. I assure you that this is not true. In fact, as a government senator I can put on record that we all share a genuine concern that what comes next in the future of the Northern Territory legislation under this title of 'Stronger Futures' will be appropriately discussed and worked on and that together we will be able to come to a future direction.


I make this point because consistently in the evidence we received there was widespread concern about the consultation process used. You would see from our report that we looked at that closely and we answered those concerns. We listened and we cared about the responses that were made. I truly believe that there is no such thing as a perfect consultation process. I also truly believe that the processes that the department has used over the last many years in dealing with Aboriginal people have not been perfect. I believe that there have been genuine efforts made to ensure that, as far as possible, the issues with the Stronger Futures process and what has gone on in the past—it is known as the NT intervention process—have been on the agenda. People from the department as well as ministers and parliamentary secretaries and local parliamentarians have all made great effort to visit communities, to sit down with people on their lands to ensure that there is an exchange of information.


I do not believe that that has been perfect. I think our committee report put that forward. There must be, in the future, ongoing work to ensure that there are appropriate consultation mechanisms to ensure that culturally appropriate consultation is put in place in any discussion about legislation with Aboriginal and Islander people. I also believe that in terms of any government consultation with any community those principles should be in place. In particular, because of the pain, confusion and anger which we found when we visited some of the Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, the committee put forward a recommendation that we ensure, in the future, that the departments work effectively with the Human Rights Commission to consider strong and effective protocols and consultation processes.


On this basis, we take some of the comments that were made by people across this country about their concerns about the consultation extraordinarily seriously. We also know—we have it on record—that significant efforts were made by the department to visit communities and talk with people. One of the processes and the problems, of course, is that when you visit communities you often only have some people attend sessions—sometimes people who have a particular view they wish to share. Of course that is their right but, in terms of ensuring that everybody has a say, that is always a problem.


Another point that was brought out consistently in previous evaluations of consultation was the fact that Aboriginal communities, over many years but in particular since 2007, have suffered from consultation overload. One of the clear points that was brought out was that there are perhaps too many visits by too many people who have not effectively prepared the way for that process, and one of the things that is brought out in the Human Rights Commission information is that this needs to be done better. So in any discussion around Stronger Futures we need to ensure that people feel that, whilst every effort can be made about effective consultation, there must be an effective interchange and also a commitment from all involved that they will engage in the process.


In discussing stronger futures, you cannot move forward unless you effectively deal with the past. One of the most confronting elements of our visit was that there was, clearly, palpable pain, suffering and regret about what had gone on when the original intervention took place. That is probably no news to many people in this place because it has been raised in the past in various debates around Aboriginal policy. But, for the wider community, in talking about where we are going to go with the Stronger Futures legislation it should be understood that there seems to be continuing confusion about what was in place beforehand. Consistently, in evidence from people who are very well informed, there was confusion about what exactly was different in the Stronger Futures legislation from how things had occurred in the past. 


We heard quite confronting stories about how disempowered people felt by the way the original intervention took place. And that pain continues to be there, not just in individuals but within whole communities, and while it is not addressed and not acknowledged it is impossible—and I use that term quite deliberately—for us to look effectively at any change in the future. So we acknowledged that as a committee. We said that we must acknowledge the past, and not just what happened at the intervention but also the years of Aboriginal and Islander first peoples' disadvantage in this country. We know that within the Northern Territory a large percentage of their population have felt this disadvantage and isolation and have felt a lack of respect by the rest of their communities. In terms of the Stronger Futures legislation, we have to work through that process beforehand.


Importantly, the Stronger Futures process addresses that. It says, clearly, what has happened in the intervention, what has changed between 2007 and now, and looks at where we can go. It points out in the legislation exactly what has changed. In particular, we look at the aspects around alcohol management. We look at the aspects around community growth. And we say that there is a genuine responsibility for all parties to play a role and to make sure that they play that role cooperatively with others. So there will not be stronger futures unless there is a genuine engagement, from all parties, in terms of where they are moving and, most particularly, of the funding that is necessary to ensure that the projects that have been put in place will be able to be effectively funded into the future.


There was great debate about the time frame that has been put into the Stronger Futures legislation. The government's proposition is a 10-year project, and that did cause great discussion. Within the evidence, there were views from all sides saying that 10 years possibly would be an effective time frame on which to move the future legislation because that would give time for an effective settling in of the programs and a chance for people at the local level to engage in and take ownership of the programs. That would give everybody the best chance for an effective future, because that is in fact what the legislation is all about—stronger futures. So there has been debate, and I believe there will be amendments moved while this debate goes on about looking at changing that time frame, because some people—and this was put to us very effectively—felt that that was too long a time frame and that there needed to be a shorter time frame to allow more evolution of what was happening and allow for concerns. So, whilst there must be a clear, independent evaluation of any of the changes that are put forward, the discussion about how long that will take will be determined by the debate in this forum.


The reason for the 10 years is to ensure that people have the time, and the funding has the time, to really make a difference. We heard in evidence that people, over many years, have suffered from too much short-term emergency funding without the chance for long-term, effective development and effective responses to people's needs. If there is going to be a stronger future that must be within the communities themselves, and people need to feel that there will be effective responses to their needs—in particular in the areas of health, employment and education.


I want to spend a bit of time on the background to what we are putting forward in this legislation about education, and also on the clear distress and confusion that was put forward to our committee because people had not had accurate information about the programs that the government was putting forward. We have had debate in this place before about the SEAM program.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (19:20):  I rise in tonight's adjournment debate to talk about my experiences in the 'Walk a Day in the Shoes of an Aged Care Worker' campaign earlier this month. This is a very important initiative that highlights the work that our carers do across the country in looking after elderly Australians. I know that a number of my Tasmanian colleagues are also rolling up their sleeves and experiencing firsthand what aged-care workers do in their day-to-day jobs.


As part of the 'walk in the shoes' event I was able to spend a few hours with an aged-care worker as part of a buddy shift to give me a small taste of their daily routine. Spending time with these workers at a Hobart aged-care facility in my home state of Tasmania gave me an insight into the daily tasks they face. We were constantly on the go, providing care and support to high-care residents. My tasks included assisting in dressing residents, helping out with meal times and providing the general care to residents that they require.


I do think it is important for me to point out that these tasks that I performed are, of course, not the only duties undertaken by the workers. Due to privacy and OH&S issues it would not have been appropriate for me to do things such as bathing and toileting residents or dispensing medication. Also, my buddy's shift started at 7 am and my shift started at 8 am.


After my buddy shift I also had the opportunity to join members from my shift and other workers from the aged-care facility to discuss aged-care reform over a cup of tea. This was a rare time for them to catch their breath and to take a moment to have a chat and outline to me their experiences and thoughts on aged-care reform. They spoke to me about the challenges of working in the industry and the constraints of the current aged-care system. Conversations like these with people at the coalface of the sector are vital in broadening our understanding of the issues faced. I undertook to pass on their feedback to the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mr Mark Butler.


While I only participated in the event for a few hours, this gave me the opportunity to get an understanding of the dedication and professionalism of our aged-care carers. They work tirelessly to provide the best possible care to the residents they look after and I applaud their passion and commitment. Working conditions are often difficult, dealing with people with dementia and other illnesses. I have always supported aged-care carers and now more than ever can appreciate and value the work that they do. There are around 300,000 aged-care workers in Australia just like the ones I spent time with in Hobart. Quite simply, they are looking after our grandparents, mothers and fathers when they are most in need. I am not overstating the importance of aged-care carers when I say that society as we know it would not function without them. We owe it to our elderly to ensure that they receive the highest possible quality of care and we owe aged-care carers the utmost dignity and respect for providing this care.


I thank all of the aged-care workers who partnered with me during my buddy shift; their patience and guidance was probably tested but it was also greatly appreciated. I also thank the Tasmanian Health and Community Services Union, HACSU, particularly the State Secretary, Mr Chris Brown—no relation, even though we are in Tasmania—and organiser Meagan Lewis for facilitating the Walk A Day in My Shoes event. It was organised as part of the Age Well campaign, which I am sure all senators know quite well and which is focused on reforming the aged-care sector. The Age Well campaign is being driven by an alliance of organisations in the aged-care sector who recognise the need for reform. There are 28 member organisations under the umbrella of the National Aged Care Alliance, including Aged and Community Services Australia, Anglicare, United Voice, the Health Services Union, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Australian Nursing Federation, the Council on the Ageing, Catholic Health, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, the Returned and Services League and Uniting Care, just to name a few. These organisations represent all facets of the aged-care industry from consumers to providers and their unions.


In February the organisations involved in the Age Well campaign released their blueprint for aged-care reform, called 'Preparing for our future now'. The blueprint outlines major reforms to the aged-care sector, including: building community care and wellness services that maintain a person's independence for as long as possible and that minimise the need for more expensive services; increasing Australia's ability to pay for aged-care services through a combination of government funding and co-contributions from older people according to their financial capacity; and improving the affordability of aged care for the community through a reasonable balance between individual responsibilities, support for those most in need and taxpayer funding. It also suggests some initial steps to lay the foundation for real and sustainable change, including announcing a wage-bridging supplement and signing a heads of agreement establishing the payment mechanism and paying the first instalment.


Recently, over 130 older people and their carers and workers from the Age Well campaign converged on Canberra for a day of action. The campaign delegation attended the House of Representatives' question time and the group was acknowledged by our Prime Minister. The Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mark Butler, also met with the group. The day of action was an excellent opportunity for the group to meet directly with their elected representatives and to highlight the need for reform in the aged-care sector. As the government is aware, as our nation ages so too will our reliance on the aged-care sector and the need for care of our elderly. Over the next 40 years the number of Australians aged over 65 will increase from one in six to one in four. Further to this, the over-85 population will grow from one in 200 to about one in 20.


As I have previously mentioned, we currently have around 300,000 aged-care workers in Australia, but by 2050 we will need more than 500,000 additional workers. By 2056, 25 per cent of Australia's population will be 65 or older, including seven per cent who will be aged 85 years or over. Some 280,000 people have dementia now, with 16,000 of these people under the age of 65. By 2050 there will be close to one million Australians with dementia. I am sure members of the chamber will agree that these figures are startling, but there is no escape from it. We know that there is going be increased demand and pressure on our aged-care system over the next 20 to 30 years. We need to ensure that we put in place sustainable, long-term reforms which meet the future needs and challenges of our ageing population.


The government is determined to get these reforms right. That is why the minister has met with over 4,000 older Australians, their families and their carers, as well as with industry stakeholders through their peak organisations, the National Aged Care Alliance and the Ageing Consultative Committee, and their unions. I had the pleasure of hosting one of those forums in Hobart with Minister Butler. The forum—one of three that were held in Tasmania—was attended by over 100 people, including consumers, carers, providers and unions. It was an extremely productive event, with the participants focusing many of their questions and comments on a more flexible aged-care system that would allow people to stay in their homes for longer. The forum, as I said, was very productive and the feedback I received from a number of people was that we need to work together and get these reforms right. These reforms will not work unless we have everyone from the aged-care sector, including consumers, workers and providers, pulling in the same direction. Failing is simply not an option. We must succeed and we must get this right for the long term.


We need to make sure that these reforms do not just improve aged care over the next five years, but that they are sustainable for the next 20 to 30 years. Whilst our current investment in the aged-care sector is significant, this government recognises the importance of reform to the aged-care sector and to ensuring that we get it right.
