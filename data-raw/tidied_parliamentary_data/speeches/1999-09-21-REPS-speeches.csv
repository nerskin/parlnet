"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,1999-09-21,"—I rise to express my concern about the Australian Cricket Board's decision to discontinue the Australian Schools Cricket Cup finals due to the running costs no longer being met by sponsors or the Australian Cricket Board. At a time when interest in cricket is at an all-time high due to the Australian cricket team's success in the World Cup and the current tour of Sri Lanka, we should be encouraging young Australians to participate in this sport at all levels. While not every young cricketer will be successful in playing for Australia, competing at a national level is a dream many young cricketers aim to achieve. I particularly express my concern that a school cricket team in my electorate has been denied the opportunity to compete at a national level due to this decision.
St Patricks Blacktown First XI has won the A-grade Metropolitan Catholic School Premiership, the New South Wales Catholic Colleges Downie Trophy and the New South Wales All Schools Omnican Trophy. St Pat's was successful in the state championship, which consists of the best two teams from each of the major education groups in New South Wales. All secondary schools in New South Wales are invited to participate.
To win the state championship, St Pats defeated St Gregorys College, Campbelltown, and Oakhill College, Castle Hill. It then defeated Trinity Grammar in the Champion of Champions final in a very tight finish, with Trinity Grammar 10-95, and St Pats 8-96. The player of the series was a St Pats team member, Troy McFadden. He took four wickets in each of the three final games of the series. The captain of the side, Michael Wood, was also selected in the New South Wales under-17 state side. The St Patricks side was undefeated in all 16 games.
Many of the team members developed their skills through one of the progressive junior cricket clubs in Western Sydney—Kings Langley Cricket Club. St Pats competed in these competitions during the 1998-99 season on the understanding that the successful school in the New South Wales Schools Championship would be entitled to compete 
 at a national level in the Australian School Cricket Cup finals. In spite of St Pats' outstanding cricket success, this now appears unlikely due to the Australian Cricket Board's decision to discontinue this competition.
This decision is denying many young cricketers in Western Sydney the opportunity to develop their cricketing skills by competing at a national level. If the Australian Cricket Board's decision to withdraw support for the national finals was being considered due to the lack of sponsorship, this decision should have been made prior to the commencement of the season so as to give other sponsors the opportunity of filling the gap.
This decision sends a message that the ACB is not interested in supporting school cricket at this level, and it reaches far beyond the current position affecting one school. It affects all students throughout the country who continue to develop their cricketing skills and love of the game through school cricket.
The faces of young students, as all schools' first XI teams are paraded at assemblies around the country, hold the key to their dreams and aspirations of one day reaching the same level. Each of these schools continues to aid the development of cricket within Australia by helping to promote the game and coach the stars of tomorrow. What better experience for these young cricketers than to compete in their school cricket team at a national level? Although only one of many schools in each state or territory can reach this prestigious level each season, thousands of young cricketers no longer have this goal to reach each year.
The Australian Cricket Board needs to understand how a national competition keeps dreams alive for many young cricketers. While all members of this parliament enjoyed the privilege of the visit of the Australian cricket team to this parliament earlier this year, and many of our friends and relatives were able to rub shoulders with some of our cricketing heroes, there are many young battling cricketers in Western Sydney who do not get this unique opportunity. It is up to the Australian cricket hierarchy to ensure that these battlers reach the pinnacle of their skills. Surely a decision to keep the Australian 
 Schools Cricket Council Cup alive would be good for the game.
While they are disappointed at the ACB's decision to discontinue this competition, I am sure that St Pats will continue to maintain its deep commitment to the game of cricket and would want me, on their behalf, to wish Steve Waugh and his team all the best of success in their current tour of Sri Lanka.
Finally, I call on that cricketaholic of this parliament, the Prime Minister, to use his undoubted influence on the ACB to try to have this great school competition reinstated for the good of our young cricketers of all states.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Schools Cricket Cup Finals</title>,Adjournment,1,1,speech
